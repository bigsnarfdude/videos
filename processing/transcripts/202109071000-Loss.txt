Thank you very much, and thank you very much to the organizers for inviting me to this very nice meeting. I would like to report on some work which I did recently with Rupert Frank from Carlteck and now I think going back to Munich, and it's about zero modes. So let me just sort of So let me just sort of start out with a slide telling you what this is. So you have these three sigma matrices, sigma one, sigma two, sigma three, the Pauli matrices. And what you're looking at, you're looking at the PDE. It's a system of PDEs of that type. So it's sigma dot minus I grad minus A of X, and you apply it to a spinner, and you should get a zero mod. This is the key word. The key word zero mode, right? So the equation, I mean, when you write it out in terms of coordinates, you get this matrix-valued operator, and you apply it to spinners. And these are two component spinners. So each of these functions, psi one and psi two, are complex valued functions. And we require that they are normalized. So, in other words, psi one modulus squared plus psi two modulus squared should be equals to one. Now, you see. Now, you see, it's relatively easy to see that you have solutions. What is less obvious is that you can have solutions where the magnetic field doesn't blow up. And what we're going to require is a magnetic field for our purpose, which is in L three halves. The magnetic field is, of course, related to A through the curl, right? Curl of A is equals to magnetic field, and A is usually called the vector. And A is usually called the vacuum potential. So maybe I should tell you first a few words why these zero modes sort of have some interest. And the way we got to those is through some work which I did with JÃ¼rgen Frehlich, Elud Lieb on Zuyau about 35 years ago. And it's the following problem. Imagine you have a hydrogenic atom. Imagine you have a hydrogenic atom. So here, here it is, right? Hydrogenic, I mean, I'm saying this because the Z, which is the charge of the nucleus, is not necessarily one, okay? So here it is, right? So here's the Coulomb potential. This, if you like, is the kinetic energy. But when you have spin, the electron has spin. This is one of these things. So the electron is not described by a single wave function, but a wave function of two components. And what you then have is. And what you then have is an interaction with the magnetic field and the spin, and that changes things dramatically. So, one question which we have is, well, how does the ground state energy behave in terms of the magnetic field? And you can easily convince yourself that when the magnetic field gets extremely large, the ground state energy can dive, become as negative as you like. And so you ask yourself, well, I mean, of course. And so you ask yourself: well, I mean, of course, a large field means I have to pay some money to the power company. And what is the money you have to pay? That's the field energy, right? And in my units, this is a little bit crazy. You get one over eight pi alpha squared, and alpha is the fine structure constant, one over 137. So this is a relatively large number, but that's because we use atomic units, which turns a macroscopic constant, of course, into a huge number. Okay? Huge number. Okay. So, and then what you notice is there's this wonderful formula, namely that the square of this three-dimensional Dirac operator, sigma dot minus i grad minus a, turns out to be precisely this term here. So you look at the quadratic form here, it is, and you try to minimize it. And now you see what happens is when you have a zero mode, and let me just sort of explain this for a moment. Explain this for a moment. Let's see, let me insert the page. So, what you're going to do? Well, you're going to take your wave function and you scale it. That behaves, that preserves the L2 norm, and you scale the vector potential also in that fashion, right? And then, and don't forget, you have then, let's call this maybe psi lambda. Let's call this maybe psi lambda, and let's call this maybe a lambda. And so at the end of the day, when you do this little scaling, you learn that this equation still holds. That's obvious, right? But you see, what happens is now, if you plug this into the kinetic energy at this point, you just get zero. And what you have left is this term and that term. And when you work it out, you'll learn that they scale the same way. So you get for the energy that term. Energy that term by psi squared I mean the sum of the two squares and then this one over eight pi alpha squared integral b squared. And now if you if you make the chart the z large enough that this becomes negative you can let the lambda go off to infinity and you get you can make the energy including the magnetic field as negative as possible. Possible. And so at that time, when we worked on it, it was, of course, the whole question: well, do you have zero modes? And as it turns out, there are. And this was then figured out by Hong Soriao and myself. And the zero modes given here is an example of this type. So this is a spinner, right? Phi is a constant spinner. You have this matrix, if you like, which apply to this spinner. Which apply to this spinner. And then, when you take the vector potential of that form and you relate the spinner in that fashion, notice, by the way, these parentheses are just the standard inner product in C2. So this is a vector. And when you plot this vector in this equation, what you get is indeed a zero mode. In other words, sigma dot minus i grad minus a Minus a psi is equal to zero. And you see, the magnetic field, when you work it out, is beautiful. It decays very fast, it's beautiful in L2 and everything you like, even L3 halves. Okay. So in fact, by the way, an amusing thing is when you look at the field lines of A, they actually look like the pullback of the Hop vibration on S3 under stereographic projection. So these are circles which live on tori and Which live on tori and they interlink. So they're really quite curly, actually. Yeah? Good. So this is where the story stands. So, what's the problem? Well, of course, the problem is you would ask yourself, well, under what condition do I have zero modes, right? I mean, you could easily imagine that when the magnetic field is too small, you might not have any zero modes. And of course, how do you measure this? And now let me give you an absolutely primitive. An absolutely primitive notion how to measure that, and that's use Sobler's inequality. So we all know it and we cherish it, right? So this is the dimension of the space. Then you have this inequality here, and the sharp constant is given by that number. And you notice that that's easy to see actually that this gives equality, and what is less easy to see is that this is equal. Is that this is equality if and only if, right? And this, of course, the famous work by Rodemiche is sort of relatively unknown that he actually worked this out, Dalenti 76 and Obama, 1975. So what do you do with the Soblev inequality? Suppose you would like to understand, well, under what size of the potential do you have to have so that you have a negative energy bound state? And the way you usually do it is this: you look at the minimization problem, right? So you look at the quadratic form, use a little bit of Helder inequality in Sobolev, and what you get, you end up with this term here. And then you notice that when the V3 halves norm is strictly greater than S3, you can actually make this negative. So then you have a bound state. And when it's less or equals S3, you don't have a bound state. You don't have a bound statement. So, this gives you a sharp condition on the existence of a bound state. So, now, if you work in this kind of spirit, you could ask yourself then, well, what is the story with zero modes, right? So, what you do is, as before, you look at the square, and then you notice, of course, that you can just integrate this. This. I've done it here. Use a little bit of Hilder. Here's the Hilde inequality. And you notice that the length of this vector here is just the length, the magnitude of the spinner. And then you use what is called the diamagnetic inequality here, because that you can basically allow you to drop the A if you're prepared to replace the psi by its magnitude. And then you see right away, again by Sobolev, that. Away again by Sobolev, that the necessary condition for a zero mode is that the three-halves of the magnetic field is greater or equal the Sharp-Sorbolev constant. But I mean, you agree, this is an absolutely crude, very crude estimate. And you might ask yourself, well, can you sort of improve that? And indeed, we can. And what we can do is we can actually improve it to by a factor of two, which does. Of by a factor of two, which doesn't sound very much, but you know, it's better than nothing. So, so here is, by the way, um, so I think this slide we can forget. I just wanted to mention that you can also prove a regularity result, namely, if you have a zero mode in L P, okay, and P is between three halves infinity, strictly, then this zero mode is in fact in any LR where. Uh, um, LR where R is strictly bigger than three halves and less than infinity, and that has to do with the fact that you can always assume that the A is an L3, provided the B is in L3 halves. And that's an easy consequence of the Hardy-Littlewood-Zobert inequality. Okay, so you don't have to really worry too much about the regularity of the zero mode. So, here's our improvement again. I assume the piece. Again, I assume the B curl A is in L three halves. And then I don't know. So this is the existence, the necessary condition for a zero mode. I don't know why sometimes the tech updates nicely and sometimes it doesn't. I don't understand my program here. So what is the story? Here, the story, you can just summarize it by simply saying a necessary condition on the magnetic field to have a zero mode. Magnetic field to have a zero mode is that its three-halves is great to equals twice the Sobolev constant. And now, now this sounds quite, I don't know, semi-trivial maybe. I mean, this factor of two, it seems to be, I would like to explain that this is actually somewhat difficult to do. You need new ideas, let's put it this way. So, how do we do that? So, the key So, the key idea is what is called a new kind of diamagnetic inequality. So, let me first explain in one slide here the diamagnetic inequality. When you have minus i grad minus a psi, and you take the magnitude. Now, notice this has nothing to do really with spinners. And then, and then what you notice is if you write the psi. And then, what you notice is if you write the psi as e to the i s psi magnitude, then you learn that this here is just a minus grad s squared psi squared plus gradient psi magnitude squared. And what the whole point about this inequality is, is you just drop that term. Okay, now what turns out here is that you have actually Is that you have actually provided you have a zero mode, you have actually a much stronger magnetic diamagnetic inequality. In other words, what you get is you get that the gradient of the modulus of psi squared is less than this guy, but with a factor of two-thirds, which is somewhat mysterious. And I would like to explain this here in this talk. So, this actually has been worked, I mean, this is based on work by many, many people. By many, many people. Eli Stein was one of the first who had sort of some insights in this direction. Cartoon Yao, Yao, Xingtung Yao, this time, used it, I think, in his proof of the Calabi conjecture. Feehan worked on it. Caldebank, Godeshon, Mark Herzlich, they worked on these kinds of things. And the ideas are taken from these people. Okay? Good. So what is the thing here? Why do we gain? The thing here, why do we gain a factor of two-thirds? Well, the idea is actually not so terrible. I mean, it needs some ideas. You look at the following operator, pi. So what do you do? So V is a spinner. Beta is a vector in R3. And what you do is you look at pi, beta tends to V, and you look at the Jth component, and that's given by B to J V. And then you have the sigma dot. And then you have the sigma dot B, that's a single thing, and applied to V, and then also to Sigma J, right? So this is your projection. And this projection has the property that when you multiply it by sigma j and sum, remember the sigma j's are the Pauli matrices, then you get zero. So it's sort of in the kernel of that operation. Notice, by the way, you use here that the sigma j squares are equals to the identity. Now, you usually have the standard. Now you usually have the standard inner product, right? Beta tensor V, gamma tensor W. This is the inner product in C2, and this is just, if you like, the summation of pointwise multiplication of the components. Another thing is what you learn, it's very easy to see that with this inner product, this pi is actually turns out to be a symmetric operator, self-adjoint, I should say. And you can do a Say and you can do a simple calculation, namely you take pi beta tensor v, you square it, and sure enough, you get this two-thirds length of beta squared, length of the spinner squared. So this is precisely, of course, now where this two-thirds comes from. Good. So now let's jump into it. And in order to do this, and I think this is the advantage of our method here, we only use differentiation of Sobler functions. So you take the usual simplification, you add an epsilon squared because you have to worry about where this thing becomes zero, right? And you do some derivatives, right? This is a fairly obvious thing. We know how to do that. And now what we notice here is because the A is real, it's a vector potential. You have an I in front. Remember that I don't have the I in front of the partial derivative. I have it now in front of the A. So because we take The A. So because we take the real part, you can just put this A for free. Okay? And now, so here is a little computation, right? It's completely standard. That's what you get. And now you notice here that because of the zero mode equation, this gadget here, the jth component, you can actually write in this fashion, because the zero mode tells you that this piece is actually equals to zero. equals to zero. So in other words, what I'm saying is you can for free stick in here this projection pi. So and now we use the fact that pi is self-adjoint. We move it over onto this term here. And then you use Schwartz. Here you have. And then you notice finally that the V, the spinner, is given by this quantity, which is the length is roughly one. The length is roughly one if you let the epsilon go to zero. And the beta is just this gradient term. So you have this product here. And as when epsilon tends to zero, you get indeed this claimed inequality, namely, let me go back, we get this diamagnetic inequality here. This one here. This is important, right? So this is quite simple, but it's an idea, right, which is not. But it's an idea, right? Which is not, I don't think, so totally obvious. This has been worked out by many people. Now, I don't want to go into the details of the computation, but what Rupert and I, we suspect, is that these zero modes, which were found by myself and Yao, they are presumably the optimizers of this problem, except we can't prove it. So what you notice, however, is that when you take the modulus of psi, you get one over one plus x squared. Over one plus x squared. So, in other words, the modulus of psi to the one-half looks like the optimizer of the Sobov inequality in three dimensions. So, now you can do some more work, and what you can figure out is that indeed you get this kind of inequality for any zero mode if you replace the psi, I mean, where you involve the modules of psi to the power one-half. And sure enough, with that use. enough with that using again the standard Sobolev inequality and Hurdus inequality you learn that the the the the three halves norm as a necessary condition must be twice as three and that has to do with this factor one half okay by the way when you take this these zero modes with the hop vibration with which young and myself found you actually get a factor of four so there would be a lot Factor of four, so there would be a lot of work to do. And we are still offered by a factor of two. But we can ask the question: well, how good are these estimates, right? And here I would like to invoke a strange thing. Is this result optimal? Well, if you take this funny spinner, and this spinner is actually the spinner which together with this Spinner which is together with this vector potential, which by the way is nothing but the vector potential of a monopole. Now, if you choose this monopole strength, G, to be one half, you learn that you have indeed a zero modic again. But of course, the magnetic field now is not divergence-free. It's not really a magnetic field. It's a monopole and it has terrible decay properties and singularities and so on. But what is funny. So on, but what is funny is that when you plug it in, you get that this side pointwise and that pointwise is exactly, including the factor one half, exactly the same. So when you check it out, all these inequalities which we have been doing, when we don't integrate, they're equalities, right? So there is a certain optimal aspect to what we're doing, but of course, at some point, you integrate, and then of course. Of course, at some point you integrate, and then, of course, everything is out the window. So, maybe let me make a point here. If you look at the Euler-Lagrange equation for the Sobolev constant, right, this is this famous equation, then of course you have the regular solutions, but you can also have the singular solutions, up to translations. These are these. And these are, interestingly enough, optimizers for Hardis inequality. I mean, approximate optimizers, you should say. Optimizers, you should say. So you might think that a hardy-type inequality should play a little bit of a role in this problem about zero modes. So let's see. Let me sort of point out what the idea is. In the case of the Schrodinger operator, you take this functional, and then what you do is you replace the V and the F by the semantic decreasing rearrangements. This is sort of a standard. Then what you do: Standard. Then what you do next is you divide by x squared, multiply by x squared, and you pull out this thing, the supremum over it. Now, as you know, this supremum is actually nothing but what you call the weak three-halves norm of the function v. Of course, you have to multiply it by some geometric factor. And what turns by Hardy's inequality, this This here by itself is bounded above by one quarter, by four times this gradient. So, in other words, if you know that the supremum is bigger than one quarter, that's a necessary condition for the existence of a bound state. Okay, so indeed we have a theorem in this direction. If the supremum of B star, you take the magnitude of the magnetic field, you take this decrease in rearrangement, you multiply by. Increasing rearrangement. You multiply by x squared and you take the supremum. If this supremum is greater or equals one-half, that's a necessary condition for the existence of a zero mode. And oddly, the monopole field actually yields equality. So there are some interesting things going on, I think. Here is a little theorem, by the way, concerning scalar equation of this type. And what we can show there is that this A necessary condition on the function lambda is that this function, the three norm, is greater or equals one quarter times the surface area of the S3 to the power two-thirds. And this is sharp. And it turns out, when you look at this function here, which gives equality, you actually find such a psi. So I have still. I have still two minutes. So, let me just sort of say a little bit what is the background lurching somehow behind all of this. It's, of course, differential geometry, right? And this has to do with Hiyazi's inequality. And what is Hiyazi's inequality? You take the Dirac operator on ST. I mean, his work is, of course, much more general. And you have a metric, and then you. And you have a metric, and then you change the metric in a conformal fashion. And you can change the Dirac operator also in a conformal fashion. And here are the weights, right, which you put in. And then what Hiasi proved is that when you take the first eigenvalue, non-zero eigenvalue of this derivative operator, you square it. You see, it comes in pairs, plus and minus. So you square it. That's bounded below by this number times the ground state, the first eigenvalue of the conformal. The eigenvalue of the conformal Laplacian on s t. And if you work with this, you can actually figure out, prove that theorem, which I just mentioned here. What the problem, of course, when I say proof, it's exaggerated a little bit, because in differential geometry, all these functions have to be strictly positive, and in particular, they have to be smooth. And here, in our case, of course, we do not assume anything of that kind. Not assume anything of that kind. So Yas's work presumably is extremely good motivator, but it would be nice if one could sort of work this out in more detail so that one gets rid of the smoothness assumption. Okay, and I think my time is up and I thank you for it.
