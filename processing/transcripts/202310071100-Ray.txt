So, I'm going to talk about Vogue's conjecture for P-I-D-GLN, and this is joint work with my supervisor, Dr. Clifton Cunningham. So, okay, let's get started. So, I want to just start with a bit of a historical introduction where I place our work in context. So, in 1989, So in 1989, we got Arthur's conjectures describing constituents of square integrable automorphic representations, which gave us a global theory of Arthur brackets. And then in 1992, Adams, Farbash, and Wogan suggested a local construction using micro-local analysis on modular spaces of Langlands parameters, and this work was for real groups. So when Arthur came up with the global query, the local meaning was of much interest. Was of much interest. And they proposed a local construction. And in 1993, Professor Vogan predicted a similar description for piata groups. And then all the way in 2013, Artel clarified the theory of local a packet. So this kind of opened up the question of comparing the two approaches, the one through geometry and the other through harmonic analysis. Analysis. So in 2022, Cunningham Theory, Maasai, Marchek, and Zhu adapted this theory for piadic groups. And they make comparisons. They coined the term EVV packets using the functor EVS and they also coined Vogan's conjecture in the main Vogan's conjecture for the proposal that ABD packets. That ABD packets generalize local archae packets for paiatic groups. And our work is recent joint work to prove Bogan's conjecture for chaotic GLM. I apologize for not writing everything that's happening these days. So there's also, let me fix that. So there's also the previous talk that talked about Talked about the developments in the real groups case by Paul Mezzo, Nicola Garrenchivia with Jeff Adams and following ABB. And then for Piatic GLN, there has been interest in this and there has been work done by graduate students Shiheng Lo and Connor Riddleston regards to the combinatorics of regarding some combinatorial. Regarding some combinatorial aspects to this theory. So let me fix that. Sorry for the handwriting. Okay, so this is our work in context. So our goal for this talk is to summarize the work in these two papers that prove Bogan's conjecture for chaotic GLN. So I want to start with making the conjecture more precise. So let's The conjecture more precise. So let's establish some notation. So F is apiadic field and G is usually GLN for us. Wf is the way group and pi GF will denote the equivalence classes of smooth irreducible representations of GF or GLNF. And the capital Phi Gf will denote equivalence classes of Langlands parameters, which for GLN we can just think of as certain kinds of homomorphisms from the Certain kinds of homomorphisms from the way cross SL2C to GLNC. So let's talk about L packets. So for GLN, we have the local Langlands correspondence, which is the theorem for GLN. It's a bijection between the two aforementioned sets. So equivalence classes of smooth irreducible representations of GLN are in bijection with equivalence classes. Are in bijection with equivalence classes of language parameters, which are also called L parameters, which are these homomorphisms. So this is why we have a parametrization of these representations. So because we have a bijection, the fibers of this map are singletons and these fibers are L packets. In general, it's a many-to-one map. But anyhow, the L packets for GLN are singleton. So now we get to our curve packets, and this is local. So these are local archer packets, but we just drop the qualifier local. An archer parameter is a certain homomorphism, which can be thought of as a homomorphism from the Bay group cross SL2C, cross SL2C. So the first is the Deline copy of SL2C, and the second is the R code. Copy of SO2C and the second is the archer, SL2C to GLNC. And this parameter defines an archer packet or a packet. An arter packet is indeed a set of smooth irreducible representations of GF, GLNF for us. So given an outer parameter of psi, we can obtain We can obtain a corresponding language parameter by just replacing the third argument of psi with this matrix given right here. So for each artha parameter, we can obtain its corresponding Langlands parameter. So its Langlands parameter will define an L packet and the R parameter will define an Arthur packet. And for GLN, we know that those two are the same. Those two are the same. So all the packets for JLN coincide with the L packets for the corresponding Langman's parameter, which turns out to be a singleton. So other packets consist of unitary irreducible representations, but they particularly don't cover all representations of GLL. Just as a note. So the third kind of packet that we will be talking about are Packets that we will be talking about are ABB packets. So, ABV packets arise out of the geometry of varieties built on Lanyon's parameters and they are, again, sets of smooth irreducible representations of GLMF. In order to define an ABV packet, we need to assume the local Langman's correspondence. And given that the ABV packet depends on this data, which comes from Depends on this data which comes from a language parameter. You can, you can like naturally ask how this compares with an L packet, and we see that every ADB packet contains a distinguished L packet. So, in particular for GLN, every ADB packet should contain the singleton representation that corresponds to the particular L parameter. So, as because they are dependent on L parameters and because we have this containment, Containment, APV packets do cover all the representations of GLM, but they may not be disjoint. So that's why they don't necessarily partition it. Here, I've not written down the explicit definition. We're just still outlining the goals, so that will come later. Okay, so we can state. Oh, I see that there is a question. There is a question. Please go ahead. Okay, so I don't hear anything. I see a raised hand. So feel free to drop your question in the chat and I'll look at it, or we can also talk about it at the end. So I'll continue. I'll continue. So, the conjecture that we call Hogan's conjecture for g equals g ln is the following. So, we can we can start with an alpha parameter for glm and we write down its corresponding Langlands parameter. So, we can write down the APV packet for that Langlands parameter. And the conjecture states that this is the same as the local arthrit packet that we define for. That we define for the upper parameter. So, ABV packets, again, for a piadic case, they are defined using EBS functor, which is given by Gunni and et al. in their work that adapts this theory to piadic groups. Again, we attribute it to Wogan's work extending ABB's work on drill groups to piadic groups, and therefore Groups and therefore call it Hogan's conjecture. We can formulate this for more general quasi-speed groups, which is done in the original work that coins the conjecture. Okay, so in this talk, we will be looking at a proof of this theorem. And the way we have organized the proof is through a series of Have organized the proof is through a series of reductions. So we start with an arbitrary alter parameter, which can be written as a finite sum of irreducible alpha parameters. And we reduce it to the case of an irreducible alpha parameter, meaning that if we prove Gogen's conjecture for irreducible, then we can carry out this process that is endoscope weightlifting to prove the conjecture for a sum of irreducibles. And then from irreducible, And then from irreducibles, we can further reduce it to the simple arthr parameter, which is just this bit, the irreducible representation of the two copies with L So to C bit of the irreducible arthrit parameter. And once we get the simple arth parameter, we can apply orbit closure relations to work out a proof. So this is going to be the general breakdown of the proof. And this is what we will discuss. And this is what we will discuss in our talk. Okay, so let's start with establishing some theory for ABB packets for GLN. Okay. So I don't exactly see the chat here right now, but hopefully someone can notice. But hopefully, someone can notify me if I'm missing some questions or concerns. Okay, so let's talk about review our parameters real quick. So for an R parameter, which we can consider as a homomorphism from V group cross FO to C cross SO to C to G L M C, you can define a corresponding Langlands parameter by substituting the last argument. Substituting the last argument of the other parameter by this matrix. And the key thing we need to do for this theory is to set an infinitesimal parameter. So an infinitesimal parameter, again, for GLN is just a homomorphism from the way group to GLNC. You can think of it as a representation of the way group. And that is obtained by replacing the second argument of the Linus parameter by this matrix, alternatively replacing both. It's alternatively replacing both the S and to C arguments by this particular matrix. So, this is called the infinitesimal parameter. It is very analogous to the infinitesimal character that people talk about in particular groups. So, once we fix this, we can write down a variety and a group action, which will be the objects that build our geometry. So, the variety is So, the variety is given by the following relation. So, it's all of the elements from the Lie algebra of the complex to a group of G, which is G L and C, which satisfy this particular relation. So, the add action of lambda just scales our x by the absolute value. And if this variety has a group action, in fact, a conjugation action of the group In fact, a conjugation action of the group, which is the centralizer of the image of lambda in GLNC. So this variety is a finite dimensional vector space, and under this action, we have finitely many orbits. And they help us build the geometry. More precisely, we want to talk about the category of equivalent Berber shapes and And it's very lucky that Nicolaus' talk was before this. So we already had a bit of an introduction to this on the real group side. So we view the local Langlands correspondence through a geometric perspective, and the geometric perspective is through the category of equivariant wherever she is on this Vogan variety. So we mostly just care about simple. We mostly just care about simple perverse sheaves up to equivalence. And happily for GLN, the only simple perverse sheaves up to equivalence, well, simple perverse sheaves up to equivalence are of the form IC of L C, where L C is a local system on an orbit C on V lambda. And for GLN, the only irreducible local systems are the trivial local systems on each orbit. So we can write down the set that we care about. The set that we care about, it is just these particular simple Furbover sheaves parametrized by the orbits of H and V. So now we can write down the correspondence. So remember, we fixed an infinitesimal parameter. Corresponding to that fixed infinitesimal parameter, we have finitely many lines. We have finitely many Langlands parameters, so they share a common infinitesimal parameter. If we go through the local Laminance correspondence, we can write down the irreducible representations that correspond to those Laminance parameters with the shared infinitesimal parameter. So we have, of course, pi lambda, which consists of all the representations which share the infinitesimal parameter. And we have this bijection. This bijection. So through local Langman's correspondence, we anyway have a bijection between these two sets where an irreducible representation matches with a Langlands parameter. And the geometric perspective is that this Langlands parameter matches with, for GLN, it matches with an orbit. And on that orbit, we have a unique. A unique irreducible local system up to equivalence, which gives us the Furbish sheaf that pi corresponds to. So in this case, in this way, we can write down for every pi, we can write down a Furbox sheaf p pi. So this pi to p pi is our new formulation of the local Language correspondence. Okay, so among all of these Langman's parameters, there's one that came from an Arthur parameter. If we started with an Arthur parameter to define our infinitesimal parameter, so we just highlight that because we are interested in A packets. So when pi is coming from the alpha parameter, we denote the corresponding orbit by C Psi and the corresponding representation pi psi. So in particular, our So, in particular, our A packet is this particular single chunk. So, let's look at an example real quick before we move on. So, let's take a very simple example of an author parameter, SIM1x. This is just the standard two-dimensional representation of the second SL2C, of the first SL2C. Then its corresponding Langlands parameter is again simple. lens parameter is again sim1 x and the infinitesimal parameter is given by this matrix. So if we try to compute the Vogon variety for this we see that it's just these two by two nilboton upper triangular matrices and it is the affine line over C and H lambda is the product of two G L ones, essentially the diagonal torus in G L two. Taurus in GL2. And the action is again given by just scaling x by this number because we are all looking at one cross one matrices. So as you can see, if we want to write down the orbit, it depends on whether or not x is zero. So if x is zero, the orbit, which is obtained by scaling x by s1 divided by s2 is just zero. And if x is non-zero, And if x is non-zero, we get all non-zero complex numbers. So we have two orbits, c1 and c0, which correspond to the two languages parameters. So the c1 corresponds to the language parameter sym1x, which on the representation theoretic side corresponds to the sign for GL2, and C0 corresponds to this direct sum. To this direct sum, this reducible two-dimensional Langman's parameter, which corresponds to the trivial representation. So, this is essentially a small example of the geometric perspective on the local Lanyard correspondence. Okay, so keep moving on to go to the definition of a BV packet. Of a B V packet. So for every a parameter psi with infinitesimal parameter lambda, we have this functor EVS psi, and this functor can be written down from the category of H-equivariant perversions on V lambda to the category of representations of A Psi. Here A Psi is the component group attached to Psi, which for GLN just turns out to be trivial. And therefore, this is just this category of representations. This category of representations just consists of all C vector spaces. So, this is a functor that helps us define an ABB packet. So, again, we fix this infinitesimal parameter lambda and we obtain the Langman's parameter phi sub psi. So pi ABV of GF, sorry, forgot to add that, are all the representations in Pylan. All the representations in pi lambda such that when we apply the EBS functor on the corresponding purple sheaf, we get something non-zero. So that is the definition of our ABB packet that we have to work with. Great, so now we can start talking about the proof that is. Proof that is again about the comparison of the arthrit packet and the ABB packet for the Langman's parameter for the Arthur parameter. And remember, we talked about the reduction. So we start with an arbitrary direct sum, sorry, a finite direct sum of irreducible arthriters, which is an arbitrary artha parameter. Then we reduce the case to irreducible, irreducible arthrit parameter. Irreducible arc parameter, and then we finally come down to simple. So let's get started with a general archae parameter. So it's of the form psi i, sum from 1 to k, where each psi i is irreducible. And each psi i is an irreducible arthur parameter for GLN i. So as you can see, this parameter naturally carves out a Levy subgroup of GLN. A Levy subgroup of GLN, which is the product of all the GLNIs that appear. So we write that down. And we note that we can write from the initial data, we can write down psi m as an irreducible parameter for the levy itself, thought of as a product of groups. So we didn't start with an irreducible parameter, but it carved out a levy and we get But it carved out a levy, and we can think of ψm as an irreducible parameter for the product of GLNIs, which is just this product of factors, box product of factors. And it gives us an infinitesimal parameter and Vogon variety. So the nice thing here is that the Vogen variety for the Levy subgroup is a product of Vogan varieties. Product of vocal varieties, and the group that acts on the vocal variety is the product of the groups for each individual lambda i. And the action is also component-wise. So that is just something to note here and keep in mind. So now let's discuss the reduction here. So remember, we had this correspondence between the sets pi lambda. Between the sets i lambda, all representations with infinitesimal parameter lambda, and the set of simple parish she's on the lambda up to equivalence, up to isomorphism. So instead of working with these sets, we work with the growth ND groups, which we also saw in the previous talk. And think of the representation theoretic growth and D group as a Z module. You know, a Z module over irreducible representations that are inside Pi Lambda, or there is another basis that consists of standard representations at IP pi. So remember, pi is a unique quotient inside its standard module or standard representation. So both irreducibles and standards give us two different bases of this module. This module. Similarly, for the Purbish sheaf side, we have two different bases. One consists of simple Purbish sheaves after equivalence, which we saw, which is IC attached to the trivial local system on C. Or constructible standard sheaves attached to each orbit, which are denoted by, which for us, we only have the trivial local system. So this is one natural. One natural C. Okay. Oops. So instead of thinking about a bijection, we will think about a pairing between these two growth and D groups. So this pairing is defined as follows. So pi and e, or their images in the respective growth and d groups, are paired with each other through this pairing, which is at the Through this pairing, which is at the level of g, by the way, it gives us something non-zero if and only if pi was related to p through the bijection we mentioned before. So if and only if p was equal to p of pi. And this pairing we can also define on the growth entry groups for the representations of M, the Levy subgroup. M, the Levy subgroup, and the geometric side for V lambda m and h lambda m. So we'll work with this pairing. And then we are going to reformulate our goal, which is now, which is as yet an equality of sets. We're going to reformulate it in terms of virtual representations. So for psi, we write down a virtual representation eta psi. Presentation, eta psi ABB, which this is important, but for our purposes, like these are some Z coefficients. So this is a formal linear combination of all of the representations that occur in the ABV packet. And I should write here because ABV packets are defined for Langlands parameters. So we define a virtual representation like this. Like this for our ABV packet. It is again, once again, a formal linear combination of representations inside the ABV packet. Similarly, we define a virtual representation for the A packet. Now, an A packet is a singleton, and we know exactly that one representation that lies inside it. So, we just define eta r psi to be just the trivial linear combination of just this one. Linear combination of just this one representation. And now we want to show that these two virtual representations are equal to each other. Alternatively, we can use the non-degenerate pairing that we defined to say that these two virtual representations fail to give the same thing for every class of Ferbo sheet in the top index. Of further sheet in the broken deep group. So, from sets, we go to inequality of what we get, then we apply the pairing on each side. So, the reduction part of this is to reduce the result from an arbitrary arthriter to an irreducible arthriter. So, we start that by So, we start that by going down through the level subgroup. So, the things we have here is a restriction functor that we get from the category of Fursheaves on V lambda to the category of Ferbo sheaves on V lambda M, which gives us a linear map at the level of growth and D groups. And we have a lifting, which we also saw in the previous talk. Also, saw in the previous talk on the spectral side that goes from the representation theoretic side for M to the representation theoretic growth and D group for G. And the idea is to compare these three. So in our most recent work, we carry out endoscopic lifting to relate the result on G with the result on M. On G with the result on M. So this is just a series of equalities, arrangement squared. So here we have the pairing on G on the ABB side. And we ultimately want it to be equal to this particular pairing. So we go through these three equations. So first we reduce So, first we reduce. This looks ugly, so I'm gonna try to delete it. Okay, that's not working. That's fine. So we first go down to the Levy subgroup via the fixed point formula. So we relate the pairing on G to the pairing on M, where size replaces. On M, where psi is replaced by psi m, and the purview sheaf is the restriction map is applied to the purview sheaf, its image in the growth and D group. And then star M means the conjecture at the level of the Levy subgroup. So at the level of Levy subgroup, we want to show that the APV packet is equal to the Arthur packet, which means we will show that this guy right here is equal to the corresponding virtual representation attached. Virtual representation attached to ψ M. And then, to lift the result, we would employ endoscopic lifting to lift this identification to the identification of stairs, where epsilon star of f will be replaced by F and eta psi m will be replaced by eta psi. So, this is this schematic of the reduction and the challenge. The reduction and the challenge here is to characterize what endoscopic lifting does so as to prove achieved. So, that is what we will be doing. So, by definition, lift is the adjoint of pullback. So, this is how lift is defined. So, it tells So it tells us what to expect for lift. So epsilon star takes standard sheaves to standard sheaves. So standard sheaves on B lambda to standard sheaves on B lambda M. So since the standard sheaves are paired via the pairing to standard representations, we expect the transpose of this restriction to take standard representations on M to standard representations on G. Representations on G. So that gives us an expectation of what lift should be. So now we want to find something in spectral theory that does that. Well, indeed, parabolic induction will do that, which also coincides with Langdon-Schostar transfer in this case. So we go on to prove that the candidate that we suggested is the right one. So, this is the way to go. So, recall that M is product of G L and I's, and P will denote the standard parabolic subgroup, the Levikin point in M. So, for every pi M, if we take the standard representation attached to pi M and then induce it up, then first of all, it's a standard representation for G, and in fact, it is. G and in fact, it is the standard representation for pi, which lies above i. So, in this way, parabolic induction lifts the standard representation on the levy to the standard representation on the fake group at the level of working D groups. So, what we have So, what we have done here is we have used parabolic induction to show that the lift and this map given by the parabolic induction agree on a basis, the basis of standard representations. Since they agree on a basis, they agree everywhere. So, lift is indeed characterized by parabolic emotion. So, here we have the detail. we have the details filled in. So instead of eta psi m, we have pi psi m because that is a singleton arthot type representation. This is a singleton artha packet for the levy. And we have that endoscopic lifting is parabolic induction. And we have proven it on the basis of standards. So now we want to Standards. So now we want to conclude something about the other basis. So let me flag here that we assume the Karshdan loostic, we have the Karsdan Lucettic hypothesis for GLN, it's a folk roll theorem, most recently appearing in Solophil's papers. So anyhow, P-It-Causion-Loustic hypothesis is involved here because we are changing the basis from standards to irreducibles. So with that, So, with that clarified, we see that, and this is important, that the induction of this particular representation, pi psi m, is irreducible. We need that in order to lift to the correct A packet, because the A packet will consist of one single irreducible representation, as m is in fact pi pi. So, this gives us lift of pi psi n is pi psi. Of pi psi n is pi psi, and if we assume Bogam's conjecture for the levy, then we have this equality which we were where this was our eta art psi, this equality that we were after. So, what we have done in all these slides is that is shown that if we have the result for the Levi-Subgroup, we can lift the result to the big group by. To the big group by employing this sort of adjointness between endoscopic lifting and pulling back. Okay, so let's keep going. So now, remember, we are trying to reduce the case all the way down to a single irreducible factor. So we see that to prove star m, remember star. To prove star m, remember star m was Hogan's conjecture for the Levy subgroup. Everything is a product. The variety is a product, the group is a product, representations, orbits, everything is a product, or box product, to be more precise. So eta psi m consists of a singleton representation, which is eta psi i, pi psi i, because the box time box times pi psi i, the pi psi i is. times pi psi i the pi psi i is the singleton represent um makes up the singleton artifact psi i um and remember v lambda and h lambda were products so so the product of representations match up with a product of further sheaves and evsin which is the functor that helps us define adv patterns is non-zero if patterns is non-zero if and only if every single EDS psi i applied to p sigma i is non-zero. So this shows that it is enough to talk about an irreducible parameter. So if we have Rogan's conjecture for an irreducible parameter, then we have the Rogans conjecture for a levy and hence fluentoscopic lifting for a group. So let's now look at this irreducible parameter. So what does This irreducible parameter. So, what does it look like? So, an irreducible parameter is just an irreducible representation of wave group cross SL2C cross SL2C. So, let me just write that down here. So, this is just an irreducible representation of these product of these three groups. So, rho ja. Groups. So ρw is the irreducible representation of the weight group tensor with ψ, where ψ is an irreducible representation of the product of the two SL2 seeds. And a row, by the way, is bounded. That is included in the definition of an alpha parameter. So now we want to reduce from this irreducible case to the simple case. So we follow this process called. Follow this process called unramification. So, what is unramification all about? So, let lambda be the infinitesimal parameter for psi. So, we have that we can write down a new infinitesimal parameter from bay group to G L n divided by m of c defined as follows. Which gives us isomorphic woken varieties and groups. So, what is happening here? Like ψ corresponds to this infinitesimal parameter lambda non-ramified. And what this says here is that the geometry of the irreducible parameter can be completely captured by the geometry of its Geometry of its simple piece. And these equivalences are really nice isomorphisms, which at the level of matrices involve taking scalar matrices lambda i to just lambda. So they're really nice isomorphisms. So everything that we care about, arbitrosure ordering, the category of furs, duality, involution, everything is preserved and can be borne. And can be boiled down to the simple part. So, lambda non-ramified is the infant parameter for the simple piece. Variety and group actions are the same. And the category of reaches is equivalent. So, our result now through this process of unramification, which we go through again for GLN, in our first paper, it reduces. In our first paper, it reduces to the simple parameter ψ s. So now all we need to do is to prove the result for the simple parameter, which is of this type. And for this simple parameter, we use properties of EBS and parameter inequalities. And the time can be theories work on multi-segment combinatorics for these inequalities. Inequalities. So, this is a rundown of the proof. And now we will look at an example. So, the GL2 example that we saw was pretty easy. So, we will reap the rewards of having looked at it before by taking two copies, well, not two copies, but taking a GO4 example, which is not simple and not irreducible. So, it's a sum of two. Of two parameters, each of dimension two, and we can write down the infinitesimal parameter for this alpha parameter. And what happens is that the Wogan variety turns out to be isomorphic to these other triangular block matrices. Your X is a two by two matrix. So we get a four-dimensional affine space. Four-dimensional affine space over C. And the group action is GL2 cross GL2. The group is GL2 cross-gl2. And these matrices sitting on the diagonal act on this upper triangular X by conjugation, as you can see here. So you can probably note here that the rank of the matrix X. Here, that the rank of the matrix X will determine the orbits because we're conjugating by matrices inside GLN. So, there are three orbits depending on the rank of the 2 by 2 matrix, which is 0, 1, and 2. And I want to flag that the algorithm that we started with is this rank 1 matrix situation. So it's C1. And it corresponds to pi 1, which is pi psi. So this is our arthroparameter. This is our ARTHA parameter, and we want to show that the ABB packet is indeed just this pi side. So that's what will happen to this. So let's look at the Levy subgroup that it carves out. Well, the Levy subgroup is GL2 cross GL2 because it's a sum of two dimensions, two alpha parameters for GL2. So we can write V lambda 1 cross V lambda 2. It consists of these tuples, each containing the matrix that we saw in our first example, first unit. That we saw in our first example, first GL2 example. And now we have a torus in GL4 that acts component-wise on each of these factors. So this is hopefully reminding you of the first GO2 example, but happening twice. Okay, so then here it depends on whether each component is zero or non-zero. Each component is zero or non-zero. So we have four orbits, and they are all products of orbits. So C0 is a product of C0 cross C0, and C10 is C cross times zero, and so on. So this corresponds to four irreducible representations of the Levy subgroup, and the Arthur parameter for the Levy corresponds to this. The levy corresponds to this particular alter parameter on the levy subgroup. And now we want to figure out what restriction and left does here. So again, maybe you saw in the previous talk that we want to include the, through the inclusion of the dual groups, we have an inclusion of the varieties. So this is given by B lambda and sitting inside B lambda. So naturally, there is a pullback at the level of Is a pullback at the level of standard sheaves as well as purpose sheaves. So, this is just embedding this matrix inside the two by two upper triangular block. And the actions remain the same. And the orbit that we were particularly interested in, that was C1, it restricts to a disjoint union of C10 and C01. The orbits generated by 10 and 01. 0 and 0, 1. So now we can start computing these linear maps at the level of group and D groups. So epsilon star we can write down in terms of standard constructible sheets, which essentially boils down to looking at how the orbits restrict the GLN. And because we ultimately want things in terms of irreducibles, we write down the change of basis matrix. We use a version of shifted. We use the version of shifted perversion. We use the basis of shifted perverse sheets here, just so that the signs are nice and pretty, but nothing to worry about too much. If we write down a change of basis matrix from simples to standards, and then we can write down a corresponding inverse that we need at the level of the level subgroup. And so we compute the pullback at the level of our shifted simple. Of shifted simples. So this involves some latrix multiplication, which hopefully you can trust that I'm all right. So this is our restriction matrix. So its transpose will give us lift. And the transpose does indeed give us lift. And this is a nice case where everything lifts to where everything. Where everything lifts to a single rep, well, these two lifts to the same representation, but particularly what we were interested in is the lift of this representation, which was our special case for the arthotype parameter that we started with. So that's the end of the example. So just some final remarks that, of course, we want to look Of course, we want to look at other groups and we want to use what we have for GLN as a template for proving this conjecture for other groups. So here we said that parabolic induction or Langman-Shell-Strike transfer characterized this lift. So this is what this equation is saying: that Langman-Shell-Strike transfer, where if you look at the transfer. If you look at the transfer factors, there are delta 1, delta 2, delta 3, and delta 4, and delta 4 turns out to be this nice factor that matches our distributions, which essentially gives us the same characterization of lift that we got from parabolic induction. So for more general cases, we will have levy subgroups, which we have endoscopic groups, and we also encountered fooster endoscopy. So we will be looking at landman shell strike transfer. Shell-star transfer and the work of Shell-Star in general to help us understand lift from all gender groups, particularly classical groups. So, for example, odd special orthogonal groups. So, that's the end of my talk. Thank you very much for listening. And yeah.
