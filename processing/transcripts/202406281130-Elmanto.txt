Various people here. And but yeah, I want to start with the Norada. So I said the bar group appears, but I put a K1 there previously, but it's really K2 with Zmot L coefficients. Thanks to Noah for pointing this out. And that's like really this mu L, this is where this mu L comes from, and it's still the Bar group. So again, this was like to demonstrate that KTV does not have et al. percent. If it were, then the Barrow group would have appeared. If it were, then the bar group would have appeared, but of course, the bar group doesn't appear because this thing is simply just z modl. Okay, just uh just uh just to point that out. All right, so uh yeah, I wanted to finish off my series of talks on this muti conjecture, so but I just want to talk about how one would study k-theory in general, uh, k-theory via realizations. Realizations. We've seen several talks on the idea of motives, and somehow K-theory is a motivic object. So, the way you should study motiv objects is just via their realization, or like one practicable way to do it is to study them via realization. Okay. So, one example, let's just start very slowly. If I have a scheme, I can take it's k0 of x, right? And I want to study k0 of x via other invariants, which are probably more tractable. There's a map here for the rank map. And it lands inside H0 Zariski of X, which is the fancier saying a free billion group up to its number of connected components. So there's the first kind of invariant that you can ask. There's the first kind of invariant that you might want to access K-theory by. You can ask, like, what is the rank of a vector bundle? Or, you know, you can write down a perfect complex and as explicitly as a bunch of vector bundles and take its alternating sum and then look at its rank. Some and then look at its rank. That's the first thing you can do. So, something a bit more sophisticated is the determinant. There's something else you can do. This lands inside the Picard group of X. There's another way that I can study K-theory. I can try to extract a rank one vector bundle out of a vector bundle by determinant. Or you can, out of a perfect complex, you can appeal to various works of various people and produce the determinant. Of various people and produce the determinant of perfect compact, which is, you know, used to be like not easy, but nowadays, there's just slick ways to do it. I'm sure you've thought about it. So this is one way, this is a very elementary model, what I mean by studying K-theory by its realization. So we can kind of enhance this a little bit more. So this K0 is the homotopy groups of a K-theory spectrum, is pi zero of a spectrum, which I denoted like this. And I can look. Denoted like this, and I can look at its connected part. I can throw away its negative homotopy group. So, this enhances to a map to the chain complex r gamma zar, r gamma zar, computing is risky co-moment. But there's some enhancement of the rank map. Most host on five zero does that. And many people have talked about stacks in this conference, and the determinant enhances also map to the picard stack or maybe BGM. Evaluate the numbers. Yes, that's a maybe more fancy way to talk about realization from. And in many ways, the study of KTM motivic homology is just a very enhanced, a very fancy version of studying BGM assistance. All the properties that you can imagine about BGM and all the ways that you study BGM is often reflected on K3 of X. There's no like big governing principle, but this is just somehow an observation throughout the history of the subject. The history of the subject. You want to ask if it's true for the Picard group and for the units, and if it's true, then you can ask if it's true for K-theory. Okay. So, this is like something that might be familiar to many people of how you would attempt to study K-theory. You might have some impression that K-theory has to do with vector bundles, and these are the first two things that you would expect. So, here are something else that you can do. So, if I look at the whole K-theory spectrum now, and over C, there is a map to this topological K-theory of S. map to this topological k-theory of x of the underlying analytic space you can attempt to study k-theory and to study to what extent uh is uh k-theory determined by something in topology right this is something you can this is like some kind of battery realization and to study this object you might want to understand it via uh something that has appeared many times the co-chains of singular singular co-chains of x and let x z in the sense that there exists a spectral sequence with e to pay That there exists a spectral sequence whose e to page is a singular comology of x converging to topological k theory of x. One way that you might want to study kth of x over c. So, just as a small advertisement, you can attempt to study the difference between algebraic k the of x and ku topological k theory of x. This has the motivic filtration on the left. This has the Atiyah-Hitzerberg filtration on the right, so to speak, something that gives rise to the spectral sequence. And the Kohnitz unamified cohomology, which was something that Nick Eddington and I observed and used it to do some variables. And I observe and used it to do some rational geometry. So that's fun. So this is something that you can study oversea. Okay. All right. So let's see. We've seen this object appear a number of times in Lucy's talk, in Noah's talk. We can study it via Shockschill tomology of x over k. Let's say I'm over maybe some base discrete ring k. Yes. For any skill, any pick phi zero, then you get the other board. But it's just a map. I'm just saying that there's a map. Okay. So, yeah. So there's a map. There's a map like this called the trace map, which you've seen many times. It's a way to study K-theory via something simpler. And this can be accessed via powers of the quote. Be excessed via powers of the cotangent component. Okay. Yeah, so we've seen in Lucy's talk where this was enhanced to something over the reals. We've seen Louis' talk where this is enhanced via something called the even coefficient. So you can attempt to study KT by looking at this image on Hochschule's homology and then try to study Hochschlush homology via the potential. So I'm going to get a bit more fancy. There's something called periodic cyclic homology. Again, over a field. Again, over a field. So, this guy is studied by some cubulation of this cotangent complex guys. Periodic cyclic technology. Cubulation, right you assemble this together to get the derived Durham complex. L omega is a hat x over here. So, I talked about the process of animation, and this is like you take the Durham complex, which you know and love, and you just animate it. Yeah, so there's this. It yeah, so there's the these relationships are the same, okay. So then it gets uh it gets a bit crazier. So uh I'm gonna go here and say I can study this via something called topological cyclic homology of I, which I've defined for you in mod p world as just eta shapefricification of k theory. It's just eta shapeframe. And what makes this accessible is it's so And what makes this accessible is this so-called syntomic homology, so Z E J sin, which has to do with this logarithmic differential forms in characteristic P, and I just animate it again. So this is how you will study things via TC. So it did get better and better. And there's another way to do it. And we've seen talks on A1 homotropy theory by Gabi today, for example. So you can look at K-theory. So, you can look at k-theory, which is not a1-invariant, and then you can write down la1 of k of x. This also appeared in Arnob's talk and TASA's talk. The k-theory is not a1-invariant, which makes it harder to compute. For example, I don't know how to compute k theory of fi9 over something non-something singular. I force a1 invariance, just make it do it. And this guy can be studied via what I would call A1 motivic homology. Okay, and I want to say something. And I want to say something about this, just one word about this. Okay, so this A1 multivic homology gadget, make a remark. If I do it mod p for any prime p, I can write this as Paul, as Paul as okay, I take the truncation of our epsilon lower star Z mod P J sin. Okay, so this guy, whatever this is, if one over P is in Ox, this is just a topic homology, mu p gadget. If p is equal to zero, then again, Equals to zero, then again, let me remind you: it's some kind of like derived omega j log in general. This is a theory that comes out of in all characteristic, in mixed characteristic from Batmore-Schulze and Batlering. So, if I've just taken this in the singular setting, then this is the block hut or this is the Block Hatto. This is this formula for motivation. This is the formula for motivation hormonology. And I've just done that. I just gotten the usual formula for motivation hormonal, which is again a byproduct of the block hato isomorphism, like being used every in every talk, maybe, secretly. So there's this guy, this gadget, but what this turns out to be is you have to CDA shippify this. So you have to ensure that this respects blow up squares. So this is a formula obtained by von Bachmann and Matt. On Bachmann and Matthew in a different project. And it should be thought of as a singular analog of the Balencien-Lichten-Baume isomorphism or the Blockhart isomorphism. Okay, so this is kind of nice. All right, so that's one way to study K-theory by mapping into it. So let me also mention that you can mapping out of it, sorry, there's another way that you can study K-theory by mapping into it, which has been seen, which has been secretly mentioned a couple of times. Sequently mentioned a couple of times. Let's say O is a semi-local ring, or local, whatever. You can define this gadget called Milner-K-theory, which has been defined by, which has been talked about by Max extensively. So this is the free, this is the tensor algebra on the units of O. On the units of O okay, modulo a tensor one minus a equals to zero if a not equals to one. So this is some link which is generated in degree one. Okay, and uh relations in degree two so this is So, this is very nice. It's not quite a lot of K-theory, but there is a map. So, K-milner star of O has a map to the K groups of O just because in star equals to one, they're equal, and two, they are equal. Okay, so K-theory is kind of sandwiched between a very interesting gadget. Miller K-theory is extremely interesting, my opinion. And it's also between other things which are also interesting. The sandwich, there's a sandwiching phenomenon. This will be one of the things I'll tell you about. Yes. Okay. Yes. So hold that thought. Okay. So. But okay, so you can ask: like, out of this, all these invariants, how do I reconstruct K-theory? Okay, and even if I'm interested in K0, one of the things I'll tell you is that you still need to understand some of these other strange invariants, at least if you are in characteristic, at least if you are not smooth, which is the theorem due to many people. I guess Kurtzstrung Thammer. You find this result in Küttstrung Thammer. This result in Kristung Tama, maybe Suzinski, maybe Seri Karsik in some other setting. Yeah, well, Hessemeyer in his thesis. Oh, yeah, and Lan Thama. So it's like you have to collect a lot of people's results. So you arrive at the following square. Let X be a scheme, any scheme. Then the K-theory of X is obtained via three other invariants. Three other invariants. So, first, you take this topological cyclic homology of x. So, there's a map from K3 to its etau avatar, eta 55. It's not an equal equality, but you can measure the difference. But the way you measure the difference is to go down and force A1 localization and glue them together along this CDH shamification of TC, where you force this gadget to respect glob squared. Gadget to respect block squares. So K3 is made up of three components: it's a tau counterpart, is A1 local counterpart, and some fine funky term that you shouldn't think about unless you have to. Okay, so let me tell you some things about this square. So I'll not prove it, but something about it. Let's say it accesses. Let's say if x is smooth over some base field, or more generally, regular noetherian, or smooth over a valuation ring, things that Arna Bent has worth talking about. The K-theory of X is just equivalent to the homotopy K-theory or L A1 K-theory of X because it does have A1 invariance. So if you add a nice setting, this map becomes an equivalent. This map becomes an equivalent. If x is regular, no, strictly Hanzelian, P local, strictly Hanzelian P complete, yeah, P complete maybe, then well, this is the eta verification, and verification shouldn't change stock. And shiftation shouldn't change stock. So this part becomes an equivalence, at least periodically. K of O with periodic coefficients is T C of O. So to study things which are singular, you need to invoke these guys because when you're singular, this is not enough to describe all of behavior. And to be more explicit, let me just have this exact sequence on the board. Exact sequence on the board. So you have k0 of x that you wish to study. This has a map to this pc0 of x, which is something direct sum la1 of k in degree 0 of x, dot dot dot. And then there is a strange term called L C D H D C 1 of X dot dot dot. So this is really sandwiched between some other groups that you should access in some other way. All right. All right, so we were trying to understand some subgroup of K0, and the strategy was to give a homological interpretation of the subgroup. And so that's given by this theory of motivic homology, which has been mentioned a number of times, especially in SSTOL. Okay, here's the construction due to myself and Matthew is that if I wish to study a Is that if I wish to study a filtration on K3 and DAO with a filtration, I guess I have to filter this guy, filter this guy, and glue together the thing. The most silly thing ever. So in character six zero, the way you do it is you take this A1 guy, you construct a non-trivial map to the CDA shapeification of this derived Durham complex. And you apply it on x, and you take L omega hat. Oh, sorry, greater than or equal to j, some weight, x over q. And motivic homology is defined as this pullback. So the filtration on Tc in characteristic zero is given by this steps of this Hodge filtration in a derived way. Of this Hodge fluctuation in a derived way. So I just glue them together along some map, which you have to construct. And then you obtain this cohomology theory, which are the graded pieces of operation on K-theory. Okay. So characteristic P, you do the same thing for syntomic homology. The ZJ mode. Yes. It's obtained by the following. So you take ZP. J syntomic, you map it to its CDA shape. And you again construct a non-trivial map from this A1 theory. And then you take the pullback. So these are just definitions. Okay, any questions so far? Right. So again, like somehow if I Somehow, if I just want to understand a piece of this, this is what I was trying to understand: some piece of this. I want to understand a piece of this in terms of pieces of that, that, and that. And so, I just create it by design to have the property. And so what we get by design is a spectral sequence. If the spectral sequence whose e to pH looks like h i minus j mode of x z minus j, which is just comology but complex in some ways, in some degree, going to k minus i minus j. So let me remark that this has been And this has been extended, as we saw in the second or third talk, extended by as BUI to all schemes. QCQS, I guess. Yeah. As Max says, don't disturb me. Okay. But so tensor construction is a bit more delicate in characteristic, in the actual characteristic case. In the actual characteristic case, it's easier to compute and we can prove more theorems, but it's like it has more explicit description. Kind of simple-ish, maybe. There's some excess everywhere. Okay. All right. So the way you should think about it is that I'm modifying this A1 invariant gadget by something that has to do with differential forms. This has also to do with differential forms. You remember, this is expressed as like the fiber of maps between omegas. So I modify. Omegas. So I'm modifying this A1 thingy a bit by something that is like coherent in nature, in the sense of coherent hormonality. That's like the idea. And the reason why this is all correct is because of this Cartesian square that I erased. And it justifies like kind of this definition. So I want to write down a theorem that is necessary to give this homological proof of Murthy's conjecture. And then I'll tell you how to prove the theorem and also how to relate it back to Murthy's conjecture. Motives injection. Yeah. Any questions? Yes, so maybe I'll write that cat more carefully. So there's a filtration on the k-theory of x, the map to k-theory of x. But these are not injective or subjective or whatever in any way, it's just a collection of maps of spectra whose graded pieces, so the cone between fill J plus one to fill J is equivalent to ZJ mode. Equivalent to Zj mode as a complex in degree 2j. What do you do? All right, so let me write down a theorem. So let me grammarize by parts. So zero, after you tensor with q, the spectral sequence degenerates. And if you look at these numbers carefully, And if you look at these numbers carefully, you get that k0 is the graded pieces of h2j, j. And there's some kind of singular version of Riemann Roche, maybe. So one. So this is the answer to Max's question. It's normal KTV the comology of some spectrum. Now we can answer this. So any A, a local K algebra. Then there is an isomorphism of graded wings HI mode of A Z I isomorphic to the direct sum i equals to zero of normal k theory of i a so there's a little hat here so There's a little hack here. So, Gabber and Kurtz give an improvement of MLK theory whenever the residue fields of A is too small. Okay, just some fudge. No, Z equals to Z. Yeah, no, the K2 indexer is Z. Okay. Right, right. So there's this. So this is called singular Esteranko Susslen. That's the rank co-suit. So two, okay. So there's some vanishing range. So eight. Yeah. 100%. All over the place. Yes, yes. Yes. Absolutely. So yeah, so yeah. Yeah, so yeah, I'll actually prove this and then you'll see some subjectivity is like the same subjectivity games that Max went on. The only way you can do it. So h plus greater than the x. Let's say x is a nostalian. So of x z right so j comma j when a is local is some kind of a When A is local, it's some kind of a non-metal k-theory thing, and then you move up all the way to some quantity up to the dimension of x, then that's still non-trivial until you reach dim x plus one, then this becomes zero. That's the vanishing range motivic homology. So, this is called this is motivic refinement of Weibel conjecture. Conjecture. So, this implies a certain vanishing range of K-theory that was predicted by Weibel and proved by Christstrom and Palmer. Okay, so far, this is, I guess, there's a paper that does this in the archive. This is in the archive. So, this one is kind of new. So, when k is algebraically close, and a is finite type over k, finite type, no, actually x finite type k scheme. Then when n is greater than, so j is greater than or equal to n, which is the dimension of x. H star mod of x with coefficients in z mod p of j, okay, when j is greater than a dimension. This is isomorphic to a h star syntomic homology of x with z mod p to the j. So describing the bad characteristic at this log form. Bad characteristic at this log forms or the good characteristic in terms of et al. homology. So when j is greater than or equal to dimension of x, suddenly this becomes kind of simple again. So this is an analog of Susslin's theorem yeah for X smooth any P yeah but it takes different names if But it takes different names if you're so before blockato was proof. Uh, Susslin kind of says that if you believe in blockato, then you should be able to say something when j is greater than equals to the dimension of x. So in particular, if I put 2j and j here, I say something about zero cycles of coefficients because already occurred in Andrea's talk, actually. It's this block, I mean, whatever his name was his name, Ross's cycle module. So he says that, and that range, when you are looking at zero cycles. And that range, when you are looking at zero cycles, you can control it via a Talcomode. So he gave an independent proof of this over algebraic equals field of the good characteristic. And if you believe in Blockato, it should be true. So this is one of these evidence of Blockato at the very beginning of the subject. Even for a small it's just about the J. Yes. Yes. Yeah, yeah. It becomes the et al. thing again. So, the way you should think about this is: maybe you might have heard of this Kullen-Lichtenbaum conjecture that says over C, let's say, K-theory is the same thing as topological K-theory when the degree on the K-theory is high enough. So let me give a way to think about this. So, K-theory over C, so X is a, let's say, for simplicity finite type C scheme. And then you look at this mod L for any L or mod P for any P. For any L or mod P for any P, there is a map to the topological avatar, like Ku of X analytic mod L. And clonified map tells you that they're different, but when you reach homotopy degree I, where I is less than, is greater than D minus 2, something like this, then they become the same. This is the Kuden-Lichten-Baum conjecture in this case. Yeah? In this case, yeah, this is a consequence of blockato, yeah. Uh, every other theorem, yeah, yeah, so I mean, that's that's an immediate immediate for smooth over C, and then some argument of Clausen and Matthew bootstraps this to like all singular schemes, even. Uh, so the proof of that, the way you prove that is to look at the spectral sequence and realize that there's this range. Okay, that's uh kind of funny. So, yeah, so you. Kind of funny. So, yeah, so you just have a singular bootstrap, a non-smooth bootstrap of like that result. Yes, correct, correct, exactly, exactly. Okay, so this is three, this is four. Okay, so this is also kind of funny. So maybe this is more of like me being a salesman or salesman. I don't know. We'll see. So over any field, finite type scheme. So, over any field, finite type scheme, and you have z, which is c of x. So, this is co-dimension c. The co-dimension of this embedding is c. And all I ask is that it lies inside the smooth local. So, z can be as stupid as possible, but it must be hidden tucked away in the smooth local. Then, from this, we can construct cycle class maps of H, QC, Mote. C mode of X Z C functorial in a suitable set. Okay, so in particular, which is what's relevant for us, if x is the point in the smooth locus of x, then little x determines for me a class in H2 dim x. X, X, Z then X. So you can construct cycle class maps within this theory. Okay, so let me make remarks about this result, about this theorem, but any questions before I proceed? Yeah, so in fact, Yeah, so in fact, if you really want to learn K-theory, one of the things that I, you know, I would here's a reasonable advice, I think. There's this paper by Pedrini and Weibel, which says K-theory of smooth complex surfaces. And so they use this theorem, and then they just compute the hell out of smooth compact surfaces. And you really can. You need to learn, you only need to understand K0, which is some child groups. Okay, so you just kind of do it, stare at it. Maybe you kind of do it, but like here are some names. Maybe you kind of do it, but like it has some names. You do k1 by some algebra, and then very soon it'll become a isomorphism, and then you compute the topological k-theory, which you can very, very, very nice paper. All right. So let me make some remarks. Okay. So one, this is the most new thing. Theorem of a combination of Lavin, Krishna, Srishna, Srinivas, and Krishna. So the way you would reprove this result is to say you have H2N mode of A. So A is finite type K equals to K bar algebra Zn. And you can construct an edge map to ah, so I'm gonna write it like this, an edge map to k0, okay. And that's because of this vanishing, by the vanishing result, right? So if you stare at what a spectral sequence looks like, there's some little edge right there. And because of this edge, because of this vanishing, you can construct an edge map. Is vanishing, you can construct an edge map. Like, this is not obvious to construct just from definition. Okay, so that's nice. Uh, and so this is one. Here are the steps, you construct the HMAP. Number two is this is an isomorphism with Hn Nisnevich of A with the cohomology shifts of Zn. So this isomorphism is just from the hyperchoomology spectrum. Is just from the hyperchomology spectral sequence. So, Zn is a complex of shifts, if you like, and it's a hyperchomology spectral sequence. And because of the way that these numbers work out, because n is the dimension, they're just isomorphic to some one small group in the hyperchomology spectral sequence. So that's not nothing. But we can now name this group because this is just some kind of shippy fide version of Milner K-theory by this singular nestoring system. Let me put. Let me just put two here. All right, so that's one. And so there is a map here which factors, okay, it's going to go to f n k0 of a. So there's some kind of cyclone class map from this object to this object, which lands at f n k0 of a, and it's rejective. And this is an old theorem due to Kato and Saito. Due to Kato and Saito within the realm of possible theory of arithmetic schemes. So, this object has been considered long ago by Kato and Saito. This Nisnevich-Komalji sheaf and like some KT, even for things which are singular. The hypothesis was quite excellent. They're very characteristic. You have these guys. And so they prove that this is rejective. And then there's a map here. So, you know, because it's isomorphism, this map here factors through there. This map here factors through there. And by one, this is rationally an isomorphism. So you can examine what happens on the graded pieces when you design a spectral sequence, and this becomes a rational ISO. So we can check, suffices to prove that this H2N mode of AZN is torsion free, and this becomes isomorphic. And this becomes isomorphic, becomes an ethnonic statement that says this FnK0 of A is actually isomorphic with H2N mode A Zn. You can just play around with this diagram for variant groups and to show that this torsion free is equivalent to saying that they're actually ISO. But the claim itself is that this is torsion free, which is what you want. Yes, it's torsion free, but because of all this, Free, but because of all this yada yada, uh, this is torsion free, if only if this is an isomorphism, but that's the same thing as saying that this is torsion free because of this if only yeah yes there's also some subjectivity here um yeah you have to think about it a little bit yes yes it's it's subjective by hydrocytal yes yes It's integrally surjective by work of Kato and Seito. Yeah, and in fact, if in the old literature of Muruti, like the subjectivity in older language, or like some kind of, yeah, so let me make a quick remark. So there was a, for a surface, there's a good candidate for this, namely Levin Weibo Child Group. And then they proved some subjectivity there. That was like not so hard. But yeah, it was global. I think it was really done. It was it was I think it was really done in Murthy's original paper. Thing is torsion free. Yes. Exactly. The motivation, that's a nice. I'm going to borrow that motivic location. So let me recall that in the last lecture, I told you that some eta approximation of this already works out. Already works out. And then I'm going to use the thing I just erased, the singular suslin, to say that I'm exactly in that range because n is the dimension of a. And so the effort of this eta version of the result just carries you through the day once I've proved all this result. I can really substitute this for something eta or syntomic, depending on the characters, like you already done. Yeah, so maybe you make a query mark 1.5. So there's this blip. So there's a split for surfaces in characteristic P with more peak coefficients because of this banana result was not good enough to deal with this show that in this range, in this relevant range, motiv homology Motivic homology respects normalizations. So you can build a surface, it's normalization, is conductor ideal, and the pullback. You have to show that you respect that. So you reduce the normal surfaces. And a normal surface case was Trishna Srinivas. And we don't really see anything new about this at the moment, although we are trying. But we do still use a little bit of that, some previous case in the early 2000s. Okay, so two. I guess I already said this. All right, right. So when x is quasi-projective over k equals to k bar, what Susan proved exactly was the following. Was the following, child D, so possibly singular. So this is block high chow groups defined via algebraic cycles. Still very relevant. This is isomorphic to HI compactly supported a talc homology X Z mod L dual one over L is okay. So Susslin proved what he proved exactly was for any quasi-projective variety, yeah, then this high chocolate. Yeah, then this high child groups defined by algebraic cycles is some dual to et al commodity. In other words, this is some kind of homology theory. And that's what cycles are. They're more like homology. You can push forward. And so what we have is basically a homological analog of this. So the exact relationship between our motivated homology and higher charg groups, that has not been fully explored. That's something that, yeah, well, somebody should work on that. Yeah. But there's a precedent to this, which is. A precedent to this, which is homological in nature, yes, dr and d the dimension of x, right? And i is sitting there in the middle. Or greater than or equal to the dimension. Yeah, this is the homological dimension. So there's equally a t-twist here, which I've removed because I'm always each and I can never remember. But it's like whatever, yeah, well, the thing that works out. Yeah, sorry. So remember that the theorem says that you can. Sorry, remember that the theorem says that you can always describe these motiv things whenever d is greater than a dimension, zero. Yes, yes, yes, exactly. But this, yeah, exactly. So the way that people in this community kind of thinks about it is that these are kind of higher zero cycles, like these bigger than dimension of X. Okay. Yeah, so three is that Yeah, so three is that so cycle, so there's a function from x to this h2 star x z star mode that we can now contemplate. So this is now a ring, even when x is non-smooth. So when x is smooth, then this is just the usual Vervotsky-style motiv homology. So it's just child groups. And so this can be this, you know. So, this can be this, you know, this if you're optimistic, you can think of this as some kind of an extension of child groups to singular schemes. And Srinivas, in its ICM address, kind of conjectured that such an extension should exist, and he listed a bunch of properties that this extension should satisfy, and we do fulfill all of them. But we don't make any uniqueness claim, we don't make any like universal property claim, we just check whatever he wanted, and it's not even clear if he knew what. It's not even clear if he knew what he wanted, but yeah, yeah, at least we have that. Okay, any questions about this remarks? Okay. All right. So let me kind of get to the proof of this. Yeah, so maybe the moral of the proof, the moral of the whole story, and maybe the moral of the whole project is that this process of Is that this process of animation and symbols, symbolic arguments are good friends. Like, it tells you something about the community. So, we're gonna do all this animation business, blah, blah, blah. But then, the only way you can control any of these is to have handles on the symbol. Just kind of insane. Just like kind of insane. So let me let me tell you their kind of format. Yeah, oh, no, this theorem, zero, one, two, three. Yeah. I kind of want to focus on the singular Nestorian cosystem. Okay. So let me observe. So, you have some functor f from polynomial algebras over k simplicity or simplicity or smooth k algebras. And then I have some functor like that to some category C. And then I want to extend right to all cumulative algebras over k. Okay. And remember to compute the value of a, lf, at. The value of a, lf at a, I'm going to take the geometricalization of some polynomial or smooth resolution of f of a. So here are some observations observation zero, say A is local. A is local. Then I can use instead essentially smooth local algebras to compute LF. So instead of this, instead of like having some Having some diagram which are polynomial or smooth, you can just replace it with ones which are local ranks of smooth algebra. There's some kind of continuity argument, some limit argument. And also, if it's Hanzelian, then I can also replace this with Henzelian. I can use this nice guys to compute. Some whatever, yeah. Because when you think about con extension, you of course. You think of con extension, uh, you're forcing uh limit like co-limits to commute, you're just just forcing it automatically to commute. So, you can use like you can preserve the locality, which is nice. This is going to be relevant because neural k-theory of a global ring, for a non-local ring, should not be thought about. Thomason taught us that you cannot do this. So, okay, so two, one, yes, yep. Yes. So the cotangent complex of F, okay, only, oh no, cotangent complex, the left-hand extent of f only can only decrease cohomology. In the sense that if Hi F A is zero for any A, then the cohomology of this L F of A Of a well, then okay, if h greater than or equals to i is zero, then this still remains zero. So the only thing you can add is things in a negative cohomological direction. You can only add on things which are negative. So remember the cotangent complex, right, when you look at it, when you animate the differential forms, you can only add negative cohomological groups. It's like the same phenomenon. Yeah, but I guess we're able to call in us. To compute a good tangent complex? Or I mean axis can be anything here though. I make no claims about I make no claims about the flat reports. That's a good question, but I don't know. Yeah, that's a reasonable question. Ah, so when you think when you animate the cotangent, when you animate omega one, you get a cotangent complex. And omega one has no on the ring, right? It doesn't have negative, it doesn't have homology. The cotangent complex on the ring also doesn't have homology, but it can have negative homology. There's a general phenomenon, yeah. Yeah. I'm homologically graded. Oh no, okay. I missed the fall of A. Yeah, fall A. Follow A, yes. All right. So, okay. So, two, this is something that Max secretly used, by the way. So, if I look at the top, the top cohomology of L F, or if you have homotopy theory is the bottom. It's an explicit formula for this. This is the co-equalizer of H top. of H top of E1 of H top E0. So this, the top homology, so this is the resolution, of course, P1 E0A. This is some kind of resolution. So there's this phenomenon that says if you're subjective, no, if you're a co-moder, which is, what do you say? If you're torsion free, or if. If you're a torsion free, or if so, for example, if you have a ship which is torsion free, H0 is also torsion-free, that's like one thing. And then what happens to the top if you are, okay, whatever. I forgot what it is, but it's like has a similar flavor, flavor. Okay. So the top homology of LF of A, this is some crazy thingy, but at the very edge, at the very top, it can be computed as a co-equalizer between just applying this function between these two. This one between these two? No. I mean, this L it depends on the F. The very last part of the cohomology of F beyond that is just all zero. Okay, so it's some kind of F homological dimension of A, but yes, exactly. Okay, so these are kind of some technical observations, but they're really powerful and they're going to carry us through the day. And somehow, the whole process of animation, in some sense, Animation, in some sense, it's like you really want to like this top thing, right? The reason why you want to animate, right? Who cares about the cotangent complex? I care about differential forms, but then I'm forced to animate. But when I animate, I still have some control over some parts of differential forms. You can still get some concrete consequences back. And these are some of the concrete consequences that you have from this whole process. All right. So All right, so let's see if I can say something meaningful in 10 minutes. So here's the claim. Okay, if I take this DJ mode, which I defined, this is the thing that Matthew and I constructed. And if I truncate this up to degree J, this is exactly the animation of itself. This is the first claim. Okay, so let me say what I'm saying. So, once I want to prove, so zero is like rational degeneration. I'm getting ahead of myself. I'm sorry. So, rational degeneration is via like Adam's operations. I'm going to not say anything more than that. If you know Adam's operations, it should be, you know, you can run this argument. So, one is like this. So, one is like this Nestorian singular Nestorian consistent, so relationship with non-L K-theory. Okay, so the key point with Relativeship Mineral K-theory is this thing. I'll tell you how to get Lewis shaped minimal K-theory using this. All right, so here's what you do. So, you have HJ of A. So, A is again semi-local. ZJ mode. So I'm in this range. So that's the top homology. This thing stops after J. So if you believe that is L of itself, then the following diagram is exact. P zero Z J H J mode HJ mode T1ZJ. So is the clay equalizer of this resolution? This is just using the fact using observation two and this clay. Again, this is like the top homologist in degree J, and because it animates itself by that formula, I get this co-equal as a diagram. All right, so. All right, so there's this Milner K-theory guy. So using observation zero, I can have an isomorphism here. So if this was some global ring, then Thomason tells you this is like illegal. The math police will catch you. But because these are like local, then it is legal. That's okay. So this result is due to Moritz Kurtz that says when you are smooth, you're in smooth. Your motivic homology with degree J and J is known like K theory. Homology with degree j and j is null narrow. Then you have k null narr j of p1 nice morphism like this. Yes, so total thesis is for fields. For regular local rings over a field, this is due to Morris-print. But these are regular semi-local same thing. And then and so you have it, you still have it. Have it, yeah, you still have it. So then you can complete the co-equalizer A memory J of A, so there is a map. The fact that this is a co-equalizer is due to Luder's moral. Yeah, so this is where some symbolic arguments are really needed. So let me say this in one minute, in one second. Okay, so the key observation here is that. Is that if you want to animate kmolar1 on like a local thing, this is just the animation of nothing but gm. Knowledge one is gm on locally. And gm is its own animation because gm is smooth. So when you animate the functor of points of a smooth algebra or a smooth scheme, even it's its own. So this, so then So this, so then because non-locative is symbolically generated, you bootstrap all of this to the higher guys. You get this. Right? So therefore, this isomorphism. This co-equalized, I mean, you know, yeah, by six, five lambda or something. Yeah, any questions? There's a question. You're okay? All right. So I want to talk about this claim because this. So I want to talk about this claim because this requires the full machinery somehow. Yeah. Okay, so to proclaim, we need to show how less than or equal to j z mode j modulo. Modulo P for all P and rationally tensor. We saw in Gabby's talk, for example, that to understand homotopy theory or anything, you need to model by P or model by Q or tensor with Q. And so you prove this one prime at a time and you tensor with Q. And prove that it's its own animation. I'm not saying anything about this. This is just coming from K-theory nonsense and rational generation. Rational generation. But I'll say something about this: the MOT P part. Okay. So these are some techniques that you can check, that you can maybe apply in your daily life. You want to detect if a functor is animated, maybe? I don't know. Okay. So yeah. The grocery store. Okay. So tau does n equals to j z j mod mod uh Mod uh mod L so claim is equivalent to tall, so if one over L is in K is tall less than or equal to J of R epsilon lower star mu L tensor J. Okay, so this is coming from a talk homology. All right, so if you see All right, so if you if it's in the smooth setting, uh if it's a smooth setting, then this is exactly what Blockato says. Yeah, but in the singular setting, this is what Tom, Matthew, and I showed is still valid up to this degree. The sigility you can ignore. All right, so okay, so but now this has a map to R epsilon. This has a map to R epsilon lower star mu L tensor J, mapping to tau greater than J R epsilon lower star mu L tensor J. And yesterday we saw that this is its own animation because of rigidity. But rigidity is something that holds for every cohomology group and therefore for every truncation. And therefore, for every truncation of this complex. So, this thing is also, these bootings are also animated. So, you steal the animation from Gabber. Stolen. So, in characteristic P, it's slightly different. And we'll see something that appeared in Danny's talk. It's all kind of like crazy. They come together. So, tau less than or equals to j z j mod p mod. mod p, mode mod p it's equivalent to tau less than equals to j of this syntomic gadget. So this again has a map to z mod p j sin mapping to tau greater than j of z mod p j sin. Yeah. So again, I should have said if you have a fiber sequence like this, if two of the three are animated, the other the third thing is also Are animated, the other, the third thing is also animated. So, by definition, this is animated. But this one is exactly this sheaf, Hj plus one lower p that Danny introduced, animation of it. But this is rigid. Like it doesn't, it's invariant under Hanzelian pairs. In pairs. And so it's its own animation again. And this rigid argument is purely symbolic arguments. You just have to write down the symbols between A and A mod I when I is a Hans Element pair. Yeah, so then this is also animated. So let me caution that no other truncations of this is actually animated. You can show that. It's exact J. So there's some work of God or something. I don't know. Work of God, or something. I don't know. Okay, it's pretty insane. So, let me finish off by saying one last thing. So, we are not quite there yet. The mod pj, tau less than or equals to j of zj mode. Mod p is not quite the same thing as tau as an equal to j z mode. Z mode J mod P functions don't necessarily move against pushing up a P, but it's an equivalence. So we need to show, we need to show something like HJ plus one Zj mode is of A is P torsion free. And this feels a lot like Max's talk. Right? Like, you want to say, so blockato tells you that some group is actually torsion-free, and it's like it's a very similar argument to that. That's a crazy. So I ran out of time, but yeah, thanks for listening. No, that's a that's a good way to summarize that. Yes, yes. Yes. But you can. Yes. So let me say the simple version of this. So this observation is purely due to October Matthew. So October Matthew tells you that you want to compute something in its own animation. You're allowed to deal with Henzelian thing. You're allowed to Henzelize all the simple short diagrams. So if it's animated, then you better say that A cross match. Mapping to A mod I, where I is Hanzalian, that this is surjective. But this is true. Yeah. And so if it's an isomorphism, then the argument yesterday I told you tells you that the thing is on animation, this is very easy. But what Akio showed is actually surjectivity results are enough. You only need to be surjective at different various steps. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Any other questions? Ivan, let's thank the speaker one more time.
