There in many recent occasions with you, but on this time I had recovering from a little operation and so I couldn't fly there. But nevertheless, I wanted to thank you for inviting me again. So as you see from my screen, I think the topic which I would like to discuss is how we think that phase transitions in particular are important to shape the way in which chromosomes are faulted. Chromosomes are folded in the nucleus of our cells. And what I will, I thought to discuss with you is, say, a general presentation on the matter, covering both the recent development from, say, the theory point of view, and discussing with you some new experimental data available, whereby we can try to make some conclusions about what is shaping chromosome structure. Ramism structure. So to try to start from scratch, you know that we have our genome fully sequenced. And nowadays we can sequence even the genome of a single person or of a single cell in that person. And to cut a short story long, more or less we know all the genes, that is to say, the coding part of our genome. What you know is What you know is less understood is how the system works in the sense that you know all our cells have the same genome, the same genes, but why in a given gene is one in a given cell, sorry, is one gene active, and in another that gene is struck off? Or why a noncogene which has been silent for years suddenly becomes activated and leads to cancer. And it leads to cancer. And so, trying to answer those questions, and this is the direction I will try to go into, trying to answer those questions is, of course, interesting and exciting from a point of view of basic science, literally to understand the ultimate mechanism whereby our genome works the way it works. And of course, also for practical reason, because you can imagine the type of old. Type of all, not all, but say the number of genetic diseases that we can try to tackle with developments in that direction. So, as you know, again, most of our genome is non-coding. The genes are just a tiny fraction of our chromosomes in length, I mean, less than 2%. The remaining part, up to say, 15 years ago or so, Or so, was considered to be a useless relic of evolution. Millions of years ago, we had a gene for, say, the tail. We have no longer a tail, but the remaining bases of that gene are somewhere in the mess, which is the known coding part of our genome. Nevertheless, that view has radically changed in the last 20 years or so. 20 years or so, because what has been understood is that along the non-coding part of our genome, there are DNA regions in green in my cartoon, which are regulatory regions for the genes. And what is striking is that those DNA sequences can be very far from the gene itself. Say, in human, a typical gene is a few kb long. K long, but the regulators can be as far as one million base pairs away. And what has been discovered is that those regulatory elements control the activity of their target gene by folding onto the gene. And in this way, they control if the gene has to be active or repressed. Well, that type of discovery, as you know, have changed the way in which we look at. The way in which we look at DNA because it is no longer a 1D sequence that has to be decrypted, but it is the 1D sequence to be decrypted and the way it falls, which, by the way, is precisely the topic of our meeting. And so this is what I'm going to discuss with you in the remaining part of my talk. And I think also. And I think also the basic information I've already given can make you feel the complexity of the organization of the system, because we have roughly 20,000 genes, order of magnitude. Each gene has three, four, sometimes more regulators. And so there is a very complex organization of contacts within the nucleus of cells. Nucleus of cells. And I want to briefly try to make this understandable to everybody, briefly touch upon the recent technologies which have given us experimental insight on who's conducting whom, and then we'll try to delve in some of the mechanisms which we have understood control the way in which such a complex organization is self-established. So, again, to go step by step, the fact that our chromosomes are not randomly organized into the nucleus cells is, in fact, a discovery of more than 20 or even 30 years ago, because it was the Kramer brothers, a physicist and a medical doctor, say in the early 90s, first proposed that scenario, which is summarized by the picture you see. This is the nucleus of. The nucleus of one human cell, and you understand that the different colors, the different colored regions are different chromosomes stained by standard fish, today standard fish technology. And you see, what appears immediately is that chromosomes are organized in a sort of geographical lump, which is totally unexpected because if you have Totally unexpected because if you have a spaghetti and you pour your spaghetti in a dish, well, they tend to randomly intermingle one with the other for prevalentropic reasons. And instead, it is as if in this spaghetti dish, each spaghetti knows its identity, falls on itself, and the other accordingly in geographical map. I told you. At the time, though, it was. though it was practically impossible to measure within a chromosome how is the organization, that is to say, are there contacts or it's just random and which type of contacts between whom? And only say 10, 15 years ago, major progress has been made in that direction, which I've allowed by using sequencing technologies. By using sequencing technologies to measure in a quantitative way who's contacting them. This is the high-C technology, which is based on a very simple and smart idea. So I want to give you the flavor of what that is, at least for those of you who are not already familiar with that. Suppose that you have indeed two regions of a chromosome, the blue and the reddish. The reddish in my slide, which are in contact for some reason. Then, the idea of the technology is that you can cut with restriction enzyme DNA in pieces in fragments and then ligate those fragments. And so you're left with, say, a circle of fragments, which we can linearize, but with fragments which contain in the same fragment a portion of DNA which comes from a given region. Come from a given region of a chromosome and another portion from another distal region on that chromosome. And so by sequencing and so by exploiting the technological development in that direction, you can literally measure how frequently you find pairs right together, and that provides you a proxy for how frequently destal pairs are found in contact. Are found in contact. And what you see here in the right in my slide is an example of a real IC matrix. This is named a contact matrix. And you see on the X and Y axis, you have the coordinates of the chromosome. This is chromosome 14 in a human cell. And the intensity of the color is, of course, the proxy for how frequently they come in contact. This is a brilliant idea. This is a fantastic technology, very easy to use. And nowadays, you can buy the kit and they do that for you. However, there are subtleties and of course little complications. I want to mention one, which is important in regards to the topic I touched before, that is to say, the regulators conducting. Regulators conducting genes. And the bias is this: suppose you have a triplet of DNA size which is in proximity. The key ligation step of that technology, of course, is selecting one out of the three pairs in that triplet. And so when you sequence the selected, the ligated pair, if you think about it, you are losing information on the two remaining pairs. Two remaining pairs in the treatment. And so you lose a substantial fraction of signal. That is to say that, well, high C is formidable, fantastic, but need maybe to be more accurate. And what we did was to develop another technology, which I only briefly want to mention, to try to solve that. And this is Solve that. And this is a different method, which is not based on the ligation step, which I mentioned before. And it is simple. So I hopefully manage to explain that with a few sentences. Suppose that you can cut slices, random slices through the nucleus of your cells. And suppose that you want to That you want to know whether, say, the three or two, the red and the green genetic region, DNA regions, are proximal or decidal in space. When you cut a random slice, of course, in general, neither the red nor the green DNA segment are captured in the slice. In the slice. Sometimes you have one of the two, but it's very unlike that you have both the green and the red, because you really have to cut the right slice to the nucleus, as say in the first example in my slide. However, suppose that the green and the red are proximal. If this is the case, then usually you don't find neither the red nor the green in your random slice. Nor the green in your random slice. But in the few slides where you find one of them, you are very likely to find also the second. And so by cutting many slices and by sequencing the content of the slices, of the different slices, and by some simple statistical analysis, you can come up with a measure. And this is a direct measure of the probability that in single cells you have two. In single cells, you have two sides together. And if you think about, you can also measure triplets and other, say, more complex combination of coexistent contacts. Nevertheless, overall, the general patterns of contacts that I showed you, you find with technology such as IC are also found with GAM. And this is what I want And this is what I want to briefly discuss with you. So, what the data are telling us: this is the same data I showed you at the beginning, that is to say, a content map for an entire human chromosome, chromosome 14. And you see by eye that there are factors. And a few years after the introduction of the technology, when the polyof data improved, it was possible also to investigate what happens, say, Also, to investigate what happens, say, around the diagonal of this matrix. And here you see a zoom, and it was discovered that even at such small scales, you have smaller scales, you have patterns. And the type of pattern that you see is what you is represented in this picture. That is to say, you see that along the diagonal, there are blocks of interactions, squares of interactions, which means that that genomic That genomic segment is strongly interacting with itself and more weakly with the rest of the genome. They've been named TANS. I don't know if the terminology is appropriated for us having a more mathematical physics. Say the ground is for topologically associated domains, but I mean, the name topology may be not exactly what we mean with that. Exactly, what we mean with that. But, nevertheless, you see, there are patterns, even at the scale of a fraction of a megabase. And further advancements have revealed that you have also patterns within those stats. But what I want to highlight is, and this apparatus, I think, from the picture here on the left, is that if you stare at the data, you see that there are contacts and patterns of contacts, so non-random. So, non-random contacts, which extend across, say, dozens of megabases up to the scale of entire chromosomes. So, in human, one chromosome is roughly 100 megabases. And so the picture that is emerged is the chromosome are really folded in a very complicated way. They form the territories I showed you before, and within a territory, And within a territory, they are organized in a complex pattern of contacts, which has a hierarchical structure, as you may perceive by eye, without even entering in further details. And of course, the other key information that this type of data, quantitative data, is providing is the contact probabilities between genes and regulators. So who's contacting whom within a chromosome? And currently, those technologies. And currently, those technology can really go down to very high resolution up to, say, a few hundred base pairs in terms of resolution. So this is the data we have. And of course, the next question is, what's the origin of those contact patterns? How can the system self-organize in the very complicated way you have seen? And here is where physics. Here is where physics and Polymer physics, in particular, enters in the sense that we can try to combine experimental results and polymer models to try to make sense of the mechanism which produce those patterns. And this is where I want to now try to go. So if you want the key If you want the key question is to understand how, say, a gene and a regulator meet each other, recognize each other in a distance, and come together. And I want to give you an example to give you a sense of scale of this, because I told you that the gene in humans is roughly a few Kb, but regulators can be millions of days away. So it is as you have a one-kilometer long rope. Kilometer long rope, and the first and last meter of that rope, one kilometer apart, recognize and come together. So, what's the mechanism? And one of the mechanisms, which we think is particularly important, as I'll show you in a second, that we proposed some years ago, is the one that is summarizing in this line. So we thought that, well, if they come together, maybe there is a particle, we would say, in physics, which mediates the interaction. Of course, this is not a fundamental particle as in nuclear physics or subnuclear physics, but those are molecules which can interact both with, say, the regulator and the gene, or whichever pairs of sequences interacting that you have. That you have, and then in some way come together, bring together the two by holding the two in contact. Of course, that picture needs to be solidified and made quantitative. And so we came up with a sort of toy model to describe that scenario. The scenario is that along a DNA filament, you have, say, two binding sites for some molecules which can Some molecules which can abridge the two. So you form something like that. But this is works. And so to see how you can obtain that in physical terms, we introduced an oversimplified model for chromosome, which named the strings and binders to highlight the only simple components that you have in this model. And the model is what you see in my cartoon here. My cartoon here. You have a chain of beads, a self-avoiding walk, so the beads are not overlapping one with the other, cannot overlap one with the other, because you know this is the zeroth order polymer model. And the difference, though, with the self-abinding vote is that along the chain, you have binding sites in red for the binders of the string and binders mode. So the binders are literally Are literally lattice gas or particles diffusing, which, though, when they are proximal to the binding signs, can bind them and can bridge pairs of binding signs, so forming loops and structures. And what you see sketched here is the Hamiltonian of the system. You, of course, have the term which would correspond to a self-abiding walk. You have a term which corresponds to the gas of the binder. To the gas of the binders of particles, and you have an interaction term. And as usual, it's the interaction term which is providing the interesting aspects of this type of system. But nevertheless, I guess that with you, I don't need to delve into many details because this is a very well-known problem in polymer physics. In practice, this is a self-interacting polymer. And so, the phase diagram that you see on the right is. See on the right is what you know from basic textbooks of physics. That is to say, the system has two main phases. One corresponds to the so-called coil state. That is to say, when the polymer doesn't manage to be folded by its interaction with the binders, and it's a randomly in a random self-avoiding state. And the other is when you form instead a globule, that is to say, the binders sexy. Say the binders succit thermodynamically to bring the different binding signs together in a globular structure. In this toy model, there are two main control parameters, which are the axis of the phase diagram. You see on the x-axis, there is the concentration of binders, because of course, if you have no binders, you have no interactions, and so you cannot fold. And the other is the scale, the amplitude of the interaction energy, so the amplitude. Energy, so the amplitude of that term in the Hamiltonian. And when we propose that scenario, a couple of things which are intriguing is that the scales that such a toy model provides for where the transition line is located, that is to say, concentration of, say, dozens of nanomoles and energy a few units in kBT, which what you would expect in the Expect in the weak biochemical energy range. Well, those skills came out naturally. Additionally, what was intriguing intellectually was the following consideration, because, of course, one question is how can the gene and the regulator come together purposedly at a given time point? And how can you be sure that that occurs? Well, if a phase transition. Well, if a phase transition is controlling the structure, well, that makes sense because the phase transition is on/off. And so you have a natural thermodynamic switch, robust switch to produce contacts when you want them to happen. And so that was a conceptual element in the story that was intriguing for us at the time. So, how do you four factors with this type of models? Consider a variant. Consider a variant of the model I mentioned before. So, a polymer where you have two types of binding sites and two types of binders: the red binders for the red binding sites and the green binders for the green binding sites. Of course, you need to understand what is happening here. You form two globules. By the way, technically, this is polymer microphase separation. So, again, well known in polymer physics. Nevertheless, if in those Nevertheless, if in those toy models you calculate the content matrix, you see that it immediately formed two squares because what happens is that the red tend to coalesce with the red in their globule and the green with the green and they're almost independent if not for the intervening portion of polymer between the two segments. And that visually, visually recalls the patterns, the tants. The patterns, the tants I showed you before. And by the way, this is really well-known physics: space transitions and the two wells, free energy potential, and all that. But I don't want to leave you with the impression that this is end-waving or just quartet, because what we did was to implement this type of models for real genomic regions. And I want to give you a flavor of what we get in those cases. The region I'm showing you. The region I'm showing you is a roughly six megabase wide region. Again, this is a human fiberblast chromosome tube. And what is on top of my slide is the content map from the experiments I told you before. By the way, maybe you noticed that this is higher level, higher quality experiments. This is a variant of IC, which is named CIC. IC, which is named CIC. And the region that I'm showing you is the region around FA4, which is a gene very important in the development of limbs. I'll get back to that. And what you see in that region are, say, the tads and meta-tads around that gene. There is that little red dot here, which is an enhancer for that gene. So it's a That gene. So it's a regulator, a positive regulator of the gene. And you see that the two have context, four contexts. On the bottom of the slide, instead, you have the polymer physics calculations of what is the content matrix of that region based on physics, based on a model similar to the one I mentioned before. The important difference. The important difference, though, is that the model is more complicated than just a two-color model, red and green, as I showed before. You see, you have here a cartoon of the polymer model, and you see that more colors are needed to reproduce the experimental pattern. If I have time, I will tell you in a few minutes how you can guess what are the molecules in different colors required. Color say required. But by now, I only want to stress that with very basic ingredients from polymer physics, overall you can explain the pattern of contacts with a decent degree of accuracy. By the way, things have improved with time. And so this is a sort of comparatively old paper on the matter. And you also may derive how the system falls, the treaty structure, and how. Falls the tree structure and how that breathes in time. Because one important difference, say, with respect to simple proteins, is that the structure is breathing. It's not just one naive confirmation. This is an important point in terms of regulation of genes. If I have time, I'll get back to that. However, what I showed you is only that with this type of mechanism, phase transition of polymer physics, you can Of polymer physics, you can make sense of experimental data. But we wanted to test those theories. And so, in a project with Stefan Mundos in Berlin, we came up with an idea which is easy to explain. And so, I want to try to at least briefly discuss that. The idea was the following. Suppose that you trust the polymer model of your genomic region. Polymer model of your genomic region. Then you can implement a mutation in the polymer model and check how the mutated model refalls upon only the laws of physics. And then you run experiments in cells bearing exactly the same mutation. And you make experiments to measure their content maps. And then you compare the And then you compare the pure prediction from polymer physics and the experiments, and you have no fitting parameters. And so, this is a heavy, a strong test of the theory. And this is what we did. We did that for a number of, say, genomic regions, for different cell types, different organisms, mouse and humans. And I only want to briefly summarize our finding with this type of investigations. Of investigations. So, on the bottom left part of my slide, you see the same region I showed before. This is the six megabase around the FFO gene. And I only swapped experiments and modal results. So, on the bottom now, you have the experiments, the same data I showed you before. And this is the modal prediction. Then, in the modal, we implemented that mutation. That mutation. We deleted that region, the gray bar. And the model made very specific predictions. It predicted that the regulator of FA4 now start interacting downstream of FA4. And note, not equally upstream and downstream at the same genomic distance, but mostly downstream with another. With another gene, PAX3, the one in yellow in my slide. I don't know if you can see that, but nevertheless, with that gene here. So you see, there is a cloud of interaction which is not present in the original cells. And we were surprised to see that when the experiments were done by Stefan, they confirmed the patterns of overall, the patterns of contacts. All the patterns of contacts predicted by Ethereum. And we run a number of other experiments in the sense that we considered inversions or in the case you see here, duplications. This is a case where you see that region is duplicated. And you see, there is a new cloud of interactions in this case here emerging, which is not present in the original system. Original system. And again, this is shown context between the enhancer of FA4, which is now ejected by another gene upstream when six. And so this was, of course, exciting from a fundamental physics point of view because it looks like that there is some reason to believe that the mechanism I described, Polymer phase transition, could be indeed. Could be indeed important in the way in which chromosomes are formed. But of course, it is another reason of interest here because you see that the mutation I'm discussing with you are not any mutations. They are mutations associated to a real patient. This is a patient with brochydactyly. I told you that FA4 is important for development of limbs. And in fact, you see that person has a malformation in his. Malformation in his fingers. And this is another type of malformation, syndacty. This is another patient. And if you think about it, of course, the tomoto is also making a very specific prediction, it's highlighting that if the theory is correct, the enhancer of FA4 is interacting with a different gene. And so it's very likely that this is a positive regulator. This is a positive regulator and an answer. So it's very likely that it is activating that gene, PAX3 in that case, and WIN6 in the other patient. And so Stefan ran experiments to measure the activity of those genes in the mutated systems, and he discovered that indeed they are activated. And so those results are interesting because we are in a position now where by using the Position now, whereby using the methods which are say familiar to this community, physicists, mathematicians, and so on, we can predict by principled approach what's the impact of the mutation. And those were diseases that up to now, those are examples of so-called congenital diseases. So, diseases linked to the fact that you have a congenital mutation in the genome. And those diseases were not understood. were not understood just a few years ago because well why should the person have that malformation and instead you see the understanding we have today is that some of those mutations which are linked to disease they have an impact on a phenotype that you say they produce disease because they change they rearrange rewire the Rearrange, rewire the regulatory contacts between gene and enhancers. And so, in the case I'm showing you, the enhancer is ejac by the wrong gene, which is wrongly activated and that leads to the malformation. I think I'm already too long, so want to skip on additional discoveries in that direction, but today we have a broader Today, we have a broader picture of the examples I'm giving you, whereby we think that there is a systematic connection between architectural change in the structure and functional changes in the activities of genes during differentiation development. And so, it's appeared to be a very important and widespread mechanism of controlling how genes are activated. So, Bill, I would So, I want to mention at least very briefly how we come up with what we think is the polymer model, which best describe a given genomic region. And the idea is simple. It combines polymer physics and say machine learning, but this is trivial machine learning, it's nothing special here. The idea is the following: suppose that for a given genomic region, you know. That for a given genomic region, you know what's the content matrix, then you can think of what is the content matrix for an inert polymer which describes that region. And so the machine starts with a polymer where you see in my notation, have no colors, so there are no potential interactions. And so, of course, you know how it folds. It folds in a random self-aboding conformation. And you know it. Confirmation. And you know, it's count and matters. This is the one you see here: no patterns. And so the machine starts adding colors randomly. And when it finds that the colors are producing a pattern which is closer to the input, then it conserves, it accepts that move and accepts those colors are potentially important colors and so on. And you iterate the procedure with the machine up to when you have an idea of what is the minimal set of colours. Minimal set of columns. And so, different types of factors that you need for out of only physics, explain the input contact pattern. So, that's the tool we use. Nothing especially difficult. But of course, there is an element here which is interesting because we are predicting what are the factors, the molecular factors required to fall. To fold. And so, if I have time, I'll show you later. Then, then you can combine this type of predictions with real experiments to make sense of what is the biological nature of the different colors that are required to explain the data. And so, in this way, you can discover what are the factors which produce the context. However, before delving into that, I want to mention To mention also some more recent development because microscopy has progressed, and now with the so-called multiplexed microscopy, I'm not delving into that, at least for a given resolution or specific genomic regions, you can measure how a chromosomes or a portion of a chromosome is folded in a single cell. So, this is exactly. So, this is exciting to us because not only you have access to the average contact pattern, but you can access to the single different conformations of chromosome in different single cells. And that was exciting because, again, that was surprisingly consistent with the predictions of the theory. I want to be quick because I don't want to. Quick because I don't want to take too much of your time. But you see, this is at the bottom in my slide. You see what are the predictions in terms of single molecule confirmations from the models I told you about. And what was exciting to discover is that, say, the squares, the tides can be different in different single cells. And it was exciting to see that when micro. When microscopy was developed at the level I told you, they found the same patterns in single cells. And so, to cut short, a much longer story, we have the impression that not only average contact patterns are well explained by the mechanism from physics I told you, but the ensemble of conformation. And you may now appreciate, maybe you can appreciate what I told you before, that is to say that. Before, that is to say that what this type of models and microscopies are revealing is that the chromosomes tend to fall not in one conformation, say in a given cell type, but in a given cell type across cells, you have differences. That is to say, the structure is breathing and is changing from cell to cell and in time. And so there is a degeneracy. And so, there is a degeneracy of folding states corresponding to the same free energy. Maybe one element of the story which could also be of interest is, well, I told you that mutations can induce disease because they require the interactions between regulators and genes. Interactions between regulators and genes. And so we wanted to explore how told you that is to say, suppose you have a patient with a given mutation, you can predict out of only physics what are the wrong contacts which occur in that patient and try to dissect what are the genetic elements which produce the phenotype. And so the idea was to apply. Type. And so the idea was to apply this type of method in entire genomic, sorry, patient databases. In particular, we explored Decipher. Decipher is a medical database where you have listed patients, the mutations they have, the phenotype they have, so the disease they have, and so on. And so the idea is that you can try to find what are the genes and the answers in that person. In that person, which are associated to its phenotype, you develop a controlled database of neutral mutations that you use as a background to test whether statistically the predictions you make are correct. And then you can predict whether in that patients there are ectopic contacts. Ectopic is a biological, say, charged from biology to say not normal context. Normal context within those phenotype-specific associated genes and enhancers. And then you test if those ectopic contexts are significant. And at that point, you can make sense of the blueprints of the phenotype, the genetic blueprints of the phenotype. And we could explore in this way thousands of patients and check whether this type of effects are, say, common or they're exception. Common or their exception, which type of diseases are associated with those, which are the genetic blueprints in different diseases and different patients. And I want to briefly summarize that for you. So again, the first thing was to validate modal predictions. So if we have a patient and we predict that there is a contact between, say, an enhancer and the gene, which is not expected in normal tissues, we want In normal tissues, but we wanted to make experiments testing those predictions. And of course, you cannot do that for thousands of patients, but we did that for a number of different cases. Or we considered cell types, cell lines, which had the same mutations of the patient. And then, of course, then you can go and make predictions across the database. And those are just a few examples. Few examples of a patient. This is the identity code of that patient and its phenotype. And what you see here is the identification of the genetic elements that we think are associated to the disease of that patient. So I want to briefly summarize that for you. The cohort of patients, for simplicity, I'm discussing only patients with deletion. Only patients with deletions. The cohort of patients is roughly a few thousands. And in the cipher, in that database, only roughly 12% of patients have an explanation of their phenotype. Well, when you apply the methods I told you, what we found is that of those patients, well, 57% overall involved. Overall, involve ectopic contacts between regulators and genes. So, at least in this database, which of course is a self-selected database, people with diseases, but in those patients, a majority of persons have potentially a disease which is linked to the mechanism I'm telling you. So, phase transition-controlled wrong contacts within genes and enhancers. And I don't want Answers. And I don't want to dwell in too many details, but you also see that they are important differently in different types of disease, diseases affecting brain, heart, intestine, and so on. From a structured point of view, what we also investigated is, well, whether the genes and the enhancers, which are wrongly contacting each other after the deletions, whether they are closed. Deletions, whether they are closed or they are far apart. And importantly, we discovered that also genes and an answer which are very far apart, say 10 megabases, can enter in contact wrongly and lead to a disease. And we also discovered that typically there are multiple contacts which are formed between different enanders. Different enhancers with the given gene, and the other way around. And this is one of the explanations of why those types of diseases were so difficult to understand for standard geneticists, because it's very complicated from a genetic point of view. And not only that, the same mutation or mutations very similar can produce very different phenotypes in different tissues, for example, because the same gene becomes an The same gene becomes enters in contact with different types of enancers in different tissues after the mutation. So in the last few minutes, I want to touch the last topic I left open, that is to say, what are the factors which are producing those contexts? And I want to give you a simple example that we investigated with Anna Pomo. Dana Pomo some years ago. So, as I told you, once the model indicates that there are colors interacting, those colors must be biologically associated to potentially, at least if the model is correct, with different biochemical factors. And so we considered first at the time, two years ago, a region A region which has very few colors, two colors, red and green, as in the toy model I discussed at the beginning. And so it was easy to try to figure out what the different colors in that genomic region correspond to. By the way, I'm talking about, to be specific, the region in mouse of the Hawksby genes. Those are the Hawksby genes. And you see, this is a region which is overall roughly one megabase wide. One megabase white, and for interestingly, in that region, there are two main colors: green and red. And so, you know, what is the prediction of the theory? The red have to come in counter with the red, the green with the green. And Anna, with her experiment, showed that this is the case indeed. But then we could associate what the green are and what the red are. And it turns out that the green are active genes, so genes which are transferred. So, genes which are transcribed in that types of cell. This is nanosymbryonic stem cells. The red is not fully silenced genes. The red is technically poised genes. So, genes where you have the POL2 bound, but there are other factors which prevent POL2 from transcribing the gene. And so, in this way, we could run three-colors microscopy experiments searching for those. Experiments searching for those factors, additional factors. And to cut short, a longer story, what we found is that when we find two active genes collocalized, we also find them collocalized with POL2, so with the machinery which is transcribing them. The red genes, when they collocalize, they are also collocalizing with another factor, a polycomrepressive comp. A polycom repressive complex protein and its enzyme SH2. And so the impression is that the red are brought together that combination of factors, including that one, and the green, I mean, active genes by POL2 itself, which has the double effect to form contacts and to transcribe. Now, those early investigations have been, of course, broadly expanded. Course, broadly expanded. And I want to just summarize for you the picture that we have in mind nowadays, which is the idea of the following: the single colors I've been describing in the polymer models that I discussed with you usually are not associated with a single factor. But the evidence is that different colors correspond to different combinations of factors. Of factors. And by the way, additionally, the different colors along the genomic regions are also combinatorially overlapping. And the impression we have is that such a combinatorial orchestration of the system permits comparatively few factors to finally control very complex structures, as those I showed you at the beginning, in a simple way through the Simple way through the phase transition mechanism I illustrated. So I want to come to my conclusion. I guess I've been too long already. And you see here more or less what I discussed. This is say that chromosome is a very complicated structure, which appears to be fully described, well described by the mechanism of polymer phase transitions. And so those phase transitions. Transitions. And so those phase transitions are controlling the function of chromosomes, as I showed you. And intriguingly, excitingly, through physics, we can not only predict how normal chromosomes fold, but also how mutations impact the folding and regulatory contacts. And so how mutations are associated to diseases. And by combining machine learning and physics, we are also. We are also unveiling at least some of the factors which are involved in forming those complex factors. And you see, I have a citation from Feynman at the bottom of my slide because you may know that book. This is a famous handbook for basic university physics. University physics course dated back to mid-60s, so more than 50 years ago. And if you read the introduction of that book, there is another formidable vision that Richard Feynman clearly stated, which is summarized by this quotation. That is to say, Say, already at the time he had it clearly saw that biology was one of the directions in science with more progresses and more promising. And he came up with the idea, which you see, that is to say, that the, well, that's complicated, but the most powerful assumption that you can make about life is that everything that composes life is. Everything that composes life is made of atoms, and so can be understood in terms of atoms. And maybe, as also other talks in this meeting are clearly showing, maybe we are progressing as a community along the visions that was pioneered by Richard Feynman more than 50 years ago. And so I stop here. I'm very happy to answer questions, if any.
