That was already evoked in Udi's talk. So it's a case of P-malor functions. So in all my talks, the base field will be denoted by k and it's a field of rational function in some ramification of x. And here p1 is an integer non-zero. So p1 mar function, it's P1 Marley function, it's a Laurent series in some ramification of X, which is a solution of the following equation, where the i's are in the Bayes street, so they are rational functions. So these functions were studied by Mahler, and for instance, he studied this well-known example, this f of x, which satisfies these two Mahler. Which satisfies this two-manor equation. So, one of the interests for such a kind of spatial function is that they have good transfer properties, which means that they transfer the transcendence of the function to the transcendence of the values of the function at some algebraic points outside a certain precise set. Sets. So this was one motivation to study the malar function. Another one comes out the theory of automatic sequences. And because when you're looking at the generating series whose coefficients are an automatic sequence, it satisfies a T-Malar equation. So one could wonder what One could wonder what is the significance of the parameter P1, and especially if one can recover P1 from the knowledge of the function, the Malar function itself. So to be more precise, if one takes another integer P2 that is multiplicatively independent from P1, then there is a famous conjecture by Loxton and von der Porten with in fact two steps. fact two steps. The first part of the conjectures ask if a non-rational P1 Mala function can be linearly dependent from a P2 Malo function. So which means in fact that do we have non-rational P1 Malof functions that are also P2 Malof functions? And the answer is negative. The one proof was given by Boris and Boris and Jason, and another one by Schefke and Sinker. The second step of the conjecture was to go beyond this linear independence and to ask if a non-rational P1 malar function is algebraically independent from a P2 malar function. And one of the main purposes of my talk today is to prove the second part of this conjecture. Lecture. And there are several preliminary results towards the second part. The first one was by van der Porten, who showed that these two precise Malo functions are algebraically independent. So first one is attached to p1 equals 2 and the second one to p2 equals 3. So later, Kumiko Nishioga showed that the conjecture holds for inhomogeneous. conjecture holds for inhomogeneous equation of order one so which means when you have phi of f equals a f plus b and a b ration okay and well another step towards this conjecture was also proved by borris and cola paperchon and they show that the conjecture is true when you have this condition which Which means, in fact, that the linear differential equation satisfied by the function f is singular regular. So it was also a peculiar case. So as already told, we will prove this conjecture completely without any assumption. So I will first try to put this in a more field theoretic framework. This is the goal of This is the goal of my next slide. So I'm considering a field F with two independent endomorphisms sigma and phi. So for Mahler this field F is the field of Lorentz A. And by independent, I mean that my automorphism commutes. And that if an element of F is not a phi sigma constant, which means that F is not fixed by is not fixed by sigma and by phi, then the equality sigma to the nf equi to the nf implies n equals m equals 0. So this is what I mean by independent. And then one can restate the conjecture of Loxton van der Porten in that setting. So I'm considering k a subfield of f that is table by phi in sigma. So k is this field of So k is this field of rational function, and a non-rational solution of a linear phi equation with coefficient in k. So I can wonder the first thing that in fact I have some kind of dichotomy that either f is transcendental in k or it's rational. So since I assume that f is non-rational, it must be transcendental for k. So the second point of the conjecture is that it is k linearly. Conjecture that it is k linearly independent from any solution g of linear sigma equation over k, which can be restated as it cannot be a solution of a linear sigma equation. And the last point is that my solution f is k algebraically independent from any solution of a linear sigma equation. So we will prove this field theoretic conjecture. Conjecture, in fact, for dynamics of a P1. So I will just show in the what I mean. So we will have three cases. So the first case is the case 2s for 2 shifts. So the base field is C of X and the field F, my field of solution, is a field of Laurence-Héri in the variable 1 over X. I'm considering two finite difference operators, means shift by the h1 and by h2. And the independence here of my operator is just to require that the quotient of h1 by h2 is not a rational number. The case 2q, so my base field here is the field of rational function in some ramification. Field of rational function in some ramification of x, and my field f of solution is the field of Lorentz in some ramification of x. And here I'm acting via the multiplicative group by multiplication by q1 on the first operator and q2 on the second. And the independence of the two is connected to the fact that Q one and Q two are two multiplicatively independent non zero complex numbers. Non-zero complex number. So here we have a mild assumption on the norm of q1 and q2, which is that at least one Galois conjugate of q1, if q1 is algebraic, is of norm not equal to 1. But I think that this might, this is not really important. Okay, and finally the manner situation that I have already explained. Already explained. Okay, this is the three case for which I will prove this conjecture about algebraic independence. And I want just to remark the following thing. So in all the cases, in fact, we start with C of X, the field of rational function, and one consider as base field the maximal extension that is unramified outside the set of places of C over. places of C of X fixed by phi. This is here you see in the case 2s the places that is fixed by the automorphism is infinity. In the case 2Q we have zero and infinity and it's the same for the case 2m. So the second point is that the operators I am considering they fix the same places and one could perhaps play a different game. Play a different game and consider pairs of operators that do not fix the same places. Okay, and finally, the field F is more or less the completion of my base field with respect to this valuation, and it will be very important for our results. And in fact, one can, if we change F, we have many counter-examples. have many counter-examples to the conjecture and for instance if f contains the log of a log of x you see that log of x satisfies a q difference equation for all non-zero complex number q so it is a q one and a q two uh function uh for every q one and q two so uh the the the choice of the field of solution is crucial, in fact. Is crucial, in fact. Any question? No? Okay. So I will just state the results. So we are starting in all these cases with a non-rational solution of a linear phi equation of a k. And the following also, the first thing is that we have this dichotomy. So our solution is transcendental of a k. Solution is transcendental over k, and this is connected to the choice of the base field that is unramified outside the set of fixed places. And which is really important that our base field has no proper finite phi-field extension, so that is, there are no proper extensions of k that are finite and stable under some extension of phi. Of phi. And for difference algebra, this property allows to get rid of many difficulties. We won't have to deal with algebraic elements. The second part of the conjecture is the fact that the solution of a linear free equation cannot beat the solution of linear sigma equation unless it's rational. It's rational and it has been proved by several people. For the case 2Q, it's a result of Bézijan and Butaba. For the Mahler case, it's a Boris and Jason result. And Chef Kenziger proposes a proof for all the three cases. So it just remains to prove the last point. And it's our result. So any solution of a linear alpha equation. Any solution of a linear alpha equation is algebraically independent from a solution of a sigma equation unless f is in the base field. Okay, so in the rest of my talk, I will try to show you how the proof works and what ingredients it uses, and how, in fact, it relies on. In fact, it relies on the previous part of the conjecture: the first socialist dichotomy for the solution of being transcendental or rational, and the fact that you cannot be a solution of enough equation in the two operator unless you are a very simple function. Kay, no question? I think I'm going too fast. I'm going too fast. Okay, so what is the general strategy of the proof? So the proof starts with the following very simple remark, which is as follow. So if your function f is algebraic with g, a solution of a sigma equation of k, then f, sigma of f, sigma two n of f must be algebraically dependent over k. dependent of a k. So you have a relation between F and its transform with respect to sigma and which we call F is sigma algebraic arcay. So we use in fact the sigma Galois theory for linear equation which is a kind of exotic Galois theory for discrete equation. Discrete equation that was constructed by Alexey Yevshnikov and Michael Vipma, and whose goal is to determine, given a solution of a linear field equation, what kind of algebraic relation this solution satisfies with its transform with respect to sigma, this other operator. So, in fact, using this Galois theory, we were able to show that. Theory: We were able to show that if our function solution is in f and is not in the base field, not rational, then it is sigma transcendental over k. So, which means, thanks to the first point, that it cannot be algebraic with a solution of a sigma equation. So, here I just want to remark that in the first point, in fact, I haven't really assumed that G is a solution of a linear signal. G is a solution of a linear sigma equation, g can be a solution of a polynomial sigma equation. And so, in fact, our results will work and will show that the solution f is algebraically independent from any solution of an algebraic sigma equation if it's not a rational function. So, I will just come back later on this point. Okay, so. Okay, so let me tell you a little bit about this sigma Galois theory. So what is it? So first of all, if one starts with a base field K endowed with two commuting operators sigma and phi and we consider a linear phi equation as follow, we can rewrite it as We can rewrite it as a different system in a matrix form. So here the matrix A L is just the companion matrix of the linear difference equation. So it's the same trick than with linear differential system. And so till now I won't speak about equation, but I will deal with different system instead. system instead. So here the matrix will be invertible in our base fit. So if one starts with a different system with coefficients in the base fit K, we call a phi sigma picarvasu extension for the system over k. phi sigma field extension of k. So what does it Of k. So, what does it mean? It means that, in fact, I can extend the action of phi and sigma to the field extension LA so that they are compatible with the action of the base. And we are required the following. So, first of all, you can find an invertible matrix with coefficient in your extension that solves the system and solves completely the systems. And solve completely the system. So you have a complete set of solutions in your field extension. Hence you are also requiring some kind of minimality assumption on your extension. You want that your field extension is generated over the base field by the entries of your solution matrix U and its transform with respect to sigma. This is the first point. This is the first point. And the second point is that you don't want to add new constants. You want to solve your equation without adding extra solution that you don't want. And so that, in fact, you are requiring that the elements of your extension data, constant with respect to phi, are the same here than those of your base fields. Than those of your base fields. So this is very similar to the case of polynomial equation, where you ask, you request that the Galois extension contains all the roots of your polynomial and is generated by these roots. And here we are interested by the solution of our equation. And since we want to take into account this action of sigma on solution, we also take all its transform. Transform with respect to sigma. Okay, so the fourth point is that up to iterate our difference operator and to consider an iterated system here, we have the existence of a Picard B2 extension of OK. The second point is that for the cases that we consider, the field, the base field, is relatively algebraically closed in our PTRV3 extension. And once again, it will be crucial because it will imply that all the geometric objects that I will introduce later will be connected and it will allow us to use many classification. Use many classification results that won't hold if this condition will not be satisfied. Finally, in fact, the construction of a Picard-Visuer extension is quite abstract. And we have abstract solutions, but I am interested in a very concrete solution, which is my Laurent-Série, and I want to. And I want to know what is the connection between my abstract construction and my concrete solution. And it happens that I can, in fact, construct a Picardus extension that contains my solution, F. Okay. So now I will define my Galois groups and in fact I will have two Galois groups. Two Gaiwa groups. So I will cheat a little bit because this construction is quite delicate, so I will lie a little bit. So suppose that I have a physigma PKI V-SO extension of a K, so I will define its parametrized Kaiwa group, which is defined as the set of The set of automorphism of my field extension, and since I have two operators, I want to take this operator into account and I will ask that the action of my operator is compatible with the two difference operators. So, my Galois automorphism should commute with phi and sigma. So, in fact, if I'm defining my parameterized Galois group by this object. By this object, I will not have a lot of things to consider. And to be really precise, in fact, I should define the parameterized Galileo group as a functor between the category of C sigma algebra, means the C algebra that have an action of sigma to the category of groups. So, but I won't enter in I won't enter into this detail. So one can do and pretend that the parameterized Galois group is just the field automorphism that commutes with the two operator. And I have a second geometric object, which is the Galois group of the extension, and which is defined by the set of field operator of field automorphism of Field automorphism of the field extension Ku, which is included in LA, that just comes with the difference operator phi. You see, because this guy is not stable by the action of the other operator. Okay, so I have two abstract groups and I want to give them some structure. And in fact, I have the following property. The following property. So the Galois group is a linear algebraic subgroup of G and of C. When we look at this automorphism and its action of a solution matrix, well, it's send a solution matrix and another one. And you can view this Galois group as a linear algebraic subgroup of G and N of C. The second point is that the parametrized Galois group That the parametrized Galois group is a sigma algebraic subgroup of GNN of C, and which is a more exotic object. So this object was the subgroup scheme introduced by Michael Fippmer and one can see this group as zeros of polynomial equation in sigma. equation in sigma. So I will try to show you what kind of objects one can have via an example. So for n equals one, the coordinate ring of g n1 of c is just this polynomial ring. Then a sigma algebraic subgroup of Gn1 of C is in fact given by polynomial equation in In this polynomial C algebra, where y, sigma of y, and all its transform are algebraically independent variables of C, polynomial variables of C. And since you want to have a group, you will require that this polynomial equation must be compatible with a group structure. So, in fact, one can see a sigma algebraic One can see a sigma algebraic subgroup of TL1 of C as given by an ideal of this polynomial algebra that is stable under sigma and that's also in fact a hop-fide because one can undo this algebra with a Hop structure. So let me give you an example. One can consider the sigma algebraic group that is different. Algebraic group that is defined by this equation sigma equals one. So, what kind of points do we have? So, if we look at the zeros of this equation in C, since sigma is trivial in C, we find just one. But if we look at the zeros of this equation in the set of sequences with coefficients in C, that we have an That we have endowed with an action of sigma that's just given as follows: sigma of u n is equal to u n plus 1. Then the point of my equation here are precisely this guy. So we have much more elements than just one. So here for people in difference algebra, this sigma algebraic group is given by an ideal. By an ideal I, that is not reflexive. Okay, so in fact, it will not be perfect and even not what Michel called sigma-reduced. So it's a very tricky example, but it shows you that first of all, you cannot just look at zeros in fields of this bonus. Of this polynomial equation because you won't have a lot of things, and you need to look either at zeros in any difference algebra or just consider the polynomial equation themselves. Okay, no question? Okay, so bye. Here we go. So we have some properties. So the first property is that the parametrized Galois group is Zariski dense in the usual Galois group, which means that when you have the defining equation of your parametrized Galois group, there are a polynomial equation in y and sigma of y, just keep the polynomial ones and you get the Galois group, the equation of the Galois group. Okay, the second point is that in all precise case the sigma gauge group is sigma integral, which means here that the defining ideal is in fact prime and reflexive, which means sigma of p is in the ideal implies p is in the ideal. implies P is in the ideal. So it's when the ideal is like this, it's a perfect idea. So this comes from the fact that all base field is relatively algebraically closed in Opi Cabesu extension. And the third point is that you have some kind of group action and the different spectrum of The different spectrum of this algebra generated by the solution U and its transform is a torso under the action of the parameterized Galwork group. So you can think about it as follows. In fact, the defining equation of the parameterized Galworth group, they reflect the algebraic relation between the entries of U and their transform via sigma. Via sigma. So if you want to know the algebraic relation between your solution and the transform with respect to the operator sigma, you just have to compute the defining equation of your parameterized Gala group. Another corollary we have that the dimension of our parameterized Gala group, the sigma dimension, is equal to the sigma dimension. Is equal to the sigma transcendence degree of field extension. And I don't want to give here some precise definition, it will be a little bit too long. But by the difference transcendence degree, the sigma transcendence degree, we mean the cardinality of a basis of your field extension made of a sigma transfer. Of sigma transcendental elements. Okay, and there is a parameterized Galois correspondence in that setting also between sub-field extensions that are fixed by sigma and phi and subgroups. I won't detail this now for sake of simplicity. Okay, and now for the usual carbon route. And no, for the usual Garrett group, in all situations it's connected, and the same holds now for just the usual spectrum of this algebra. And it's a torso under the action of the classical Galois group, which means here that the defining equation of the classical Galois group reflects the algebraic relations between the entries of U. And moreover. And moreover, in that situation, in fact, you can show that there exists what we call a gauge transform of the matrix of the system so that this guy lies in the Gala group. So, this is due to the fact that we are working over a C1 field and there is some triviality. And there is some triviality of some cohomology group that allows to put the matrix of our system inside the Galois group. So this is an important property when you want to compute your group, you can try to search for such kind of gauge transform. Okay, so Okay, so let me go now more deeper in the strategy of proof. And we start with the solution, which is in this field of Laurence-Herry, of a linear field equation, L, and we consider the associated system, where A is a companion matrix of the linear equation. So we can construct a Picard-V SU extension. A Picard-Visu extension up to iterate the automorphism, LA, and a fundamental solution matrix whose first column is precisely F, sigma of F, sigma, n minus 1 of F. So I remind you that I want to show that either F is sigma transcendental over K or F lies in the base field. So I will suppose that F is sigma algebraic over K and I will show that break over K, and I will show that F is in K. So my proof will have three steps. So the first steps we will show that this is true for linear phi equation of the form phi of y is equal to ay plus b. So in the case of Malar equation, this had been done in fact by Komiko Nishioka. And we will show this for the other operation. For the other operator. Then we will prove this fact when the Galois group, the usual Galois group, is irreducible, connected and of order greater than two. And the idea will be to reduce to the case of simple algebraic group when the Galois group is simple, a simple algebraic group. And the last step of the proof will be an induction on the order of the system. So I will try to. So I will try to give you some ideas of all these three steps. Okay, so for linear order one difference equation, so I will set K prime, which is the set of an element of F that are sigma algebraic over K. And in fact, for one can restate this. One can restate the conjecture for order one equation as follows. If B is in K and B is phi of F over F for some F in K prime, then there exists a G in K such that B can be written as the coefficient of G over G, and which gives you, in fact, the statement. This is the statement for homogeneous equation of this form, VI. And to get the inhomogeneous statement, we need to show, in fact, that if an extension of K5 models of rank one splits over K prime, then it splits over K. So, in fact, for a rank one difference equation, the conjecture is very close from a conjecture that's Conjectures that could be rephrased in terms of homology call statements. So, in both cases, in fact, we use some classification of different algebraic subgroup of GM and GA. That was due to Lucia, Michelle, and myself. And to show that when a solution is sigma algebraic, then it must satisfy a very peculiar relation because we know. peculiar relation because we know exactly what kind of subgroup of defining equation we can find for the Galois group and so that we have this correspondence between defining equation of the Galois group and algebraic relation between the solution and the transform so the result is quite technical but and I won't give a lot of details but it relies heavily on the action It relies heavily on the action of the operator on the divisor of the coefficients of the equation. Okay, so now for the second step, now we assume that the Galois group is irreducible and that the solution is sigma algebraic. Then, in fact, letting act Then in fact, letting act or parametrize Garois group on the sorry so if f is sigma algebraic then the first colon of u is sigma algebraic and then we can let the galois group act on this first column to show that every column of u is sigma algebraic because we have a transitive action in the case of an irreducible group. And now we have a And now we are in a very peculiar situation. We have shown that every element of U is sigma algebraic, which means that the difference transcendence degree of Opica PCU extension is zero. And this is a very strong condition. And I will try to show you why it's not possible to have such a strong constraint. Constraints and we will see this by a reduction to the case of a simple algebraic group. Okay, so since the gamma group is irreducible and connected, it has a non-trivial quotient that we denote it by G, that is a simple algebraic group. And then you can use the Galois correspondence to show that you can realize this simple algebraic quotient as a Galois group of a P C R base field extension for a different system was coefficient in your base fields. And since Lb is included in L A, you have also the different transcendence degree of L B over K that's zero. B of a k that's zero. So the construction is as follows. Here, you just take the usual Galois correspondence. And here you have the simple cushions. And in fact, the Galois correspondence tells you that since this guy is normal, this is a Galois extension. It's the same argument than usual. Okay, so we have reduced to a situation where the Galois group is a... Situation where the Galois group is a simple algebraic group and the difference transcendence degree of the field is zero. So now one will use previous results to show that the situation is not possible. So the first one is a result by Lucia, Michel, and myself that says the following. If you start with a usual Galois group, that is a simple With a usual Galois group that is a simple algebraic group, and since the parameterized Galois group is sigma integral, and you have some relation, even you have many relation between the solution and their transport, then the system is very peculiar. You can't find a matrix B, the D, sorry, in the base field, such that this system and this one are compatible. Compatible, which you can read as the following equation. And in fact, this compatibility is given by definition by this equation, but what does it mean? It means, in fact, that you can't solve simultaneously these two different systems. You can't find somewhere a common solution to these two systems. This is really what says the compatibility. The compatibility. And in fact, this result relies on a classification theorem on different subgroups that was done by Zoe, Shotzidakis, Elodor Kushovsky, and Cobi Peter Zil. That tells you that the Zariski dance different subgroup of a simple algebraic group is either algebraic group is either equal to the O group, and in this case you cannot have this difference transcendence degree equal to zero, or in fact your Galois group is given by the equation sigma of s of y is equal to y. So it's a kind of constant equation. And so thanks to the parameterized Gerois correspondence, you rewrite this equation on the parameterized Galois group. Equation on the parameterized Galois group as a compatibility condition between these two systems. And now, as I said, being compatible, it means to have a common solution. And we say that for this kind of operator, it's somehow impossible. And it's an intermediate result by Heina Chef and my... By Heinarchevka and Michael Singer to show that if you have such a compatibility condition, then up to Gauge transform, you can assume that in fact your matrix D and your matrix B, they are constant. They lie in G and N of C. And this condition can also be seen in a certain sense as a kind of normal form and triviality of Form and triviality of certain comological groups. Because here, in fact, I remind you that your Gerwa group here is given by an equation of the form sigma s y equals y. And here you are more or less saying that, sorry, b is a k point of your Gala group. It sounds a little bit strange, but perhaps this thing could be rewrite also as some kind of homological statement. So now to conclude, one just has to use a result by Carlos Arich and Michael Singer that tells you that if here the matrix B is constant, then the Galway group. Then the Galois group is generated by the matrix B. So it's generated by a constant matrix, and it's in fact an abelian subgroup. And this is a complete contradiction with the fact that your Gauwa group is a simple algebraic group. It cannot be abelian. So in this part of the proof, we are really using all the part before we are using the fact Before we are using the fact that, in fact, you have a dichotomy for the solution to be transcendental or rational. And here it's used in the fact that the group is sigma integral. And also we are using this linear independence between solution of phi and sigma equation, which is the result by Shefke and Sinker. So each of these pieces come together to show you. To Shell tells you that when the Galois group is irreducible and connected, then any solution that is non-rational is necessarily sigma-transcendental of a chi. Okay, so now I have five minutes to conclude. So the third step of the proof is the general case in induction. So my induction hypothesis is as follow. So if f is a solution in my field of Lawrence theory of a linear alpha equation of order A linear alpha equation of order less than or equal to n, then either f is in the base field or it's sigma transcendental over k. For the case n equals 1, it's a step for Rank 1 equation, it's already done. So we will assume that it's true for order n minus 1 and proof for order n. Okay, so does it work? So I'm starting with a solution of a linear With a solution of a linear phi equation of order n, and I assume that it is sigma algebraic over k. And I want to show that f is in k. So, first of all, the Galois group must be irreducible, because if it's irreducible, then we have already proved that f is sigma transcendental. So, since the Galois group is irreducible, then you can find a gauge transform that will put the matrix of your system in some kind of upper diagonal form. Upper diagonal form. And now, with a little bit of work, you can show that this guy, A1, is in fact an order one matrix. And now it's quite easy. So you set G1, G2, Gn the vector obtained by applying the gauge transform to the vector satisfied by F and it's iterates. By F and its iterate, this transform with respect to sigma. So this Gi there are formal because T is in GNN of K. And you can note that thanks to the form of this system, phi of G2GN is equal to A2Y. And all these guys are sigma algebraic, because all these guys are sigma algebraic, and the element of T, they are in K. R in k. So you apply the hypothesis Hn minus 1 to G2GN, which tells you that G2GN is in K. Here, there is a typo. Every element here is in the base field. Okay, and finally, you obtain that phi of G1 is equal to 1. That phi of G1 is equal to A1G1 plus A12 and G2GN. And this is just a non-homogeneous rank one equation. And you know the result for non-homogeneous order one linear phi equation. And this tells you that if the solution is sigma algebraic over k, then it must lie in k. So you have t1 in k. one in k. And now since all the gi are in k it's easy to see that since t is invertible f is also in k okay this is all the induction works. And so my proof is complete. So now as a conclusion I want just to make a few comments. So I've been quite fast and technical and I apologize. So first So first, this Galusion machinery should work for parameters that are on nice base fields. And by nice, I mean that your base field has no finite extensions that are stable by your difference operator. And it also relies on the first part of the conjecture, which means that a linear solution of a linear phi equation. A solution of a linear phi equation cannot be a solution of a linear sigma equation unless it's a rational function. So essentially, all our proof relies only on these two hypotheses. Okay, the second thing is that we prove in fact that a non-rational solution of a linear phi equation is algebraically independent from a solution of an algebraic sigma equation. And it would be And it will be interesting to say something about the solution of algebraic phi equation. So I go from linear to algebraic. To get symmetric statements. So I was also wondering if there could be some more general statements about solutions of different equations in different value fields. So I try. So I tried to explain how many of our results they rely on the fact that we are considering the action of our operator on sets of valuation. They are the same set of places that are fixed by both operators, but we have, in a certain sense, independent action on the valuation. So I was wondering if we could rephrase this kind of independence of operator in independence of operator in in in more general term i was thinking in model theoretic terms okay and and finally uh behind this behind this proof there is uh some some hints about the inverse problem for different algebraic groups that are sigma galois group of linear phi equation and in fact we see that for instance when you have a non-biant galois group A non-ambient Galois group, which is simple. In fact, you cannot have a lot of different algebraic subgroups. They are all equal to the algebraic group, so you don't have new stuff. But it would be interesting to study this inverse problem. In fact, to have more precision on the solution, on their relation between not only one solution, but many solutions of the same equation. Solution of the same equation. So, okay, my time is passed from one minute. So, thank you for your attention. Okay, feel free to apply. And there's some little clap icons there, too. Are there any questions? Feel free to unmute yourself if you want to ask a question. Or put it in the chat. So I missed one thing. What were the hypotheses for you to get this rational transcendental dichotomy for solutions to linear difference equations? What did you need on the endomorphism? So I need something on the base field, the transcendental versus rational. So I need that the base field is the maximal extension that is unramified outside the set of fixed faces. So then I can use Riemannovitz to show that, in fact, if you have a field extension that has an extension of your difference operator, then it cannot. Then it can ramify only at the place that are fixed by the determinant operator. This is the argument. And then since you took the maximal extension, ramified on the set of fixed place, then you're done. It must be equal to the fifth K. And I think, you know, basically. Think Bezavan did a lot of stuff where instead of algebraic, he would approach it using D finite or something. That view does it extend to the D finite case? D finite, if it's D finite, then it's rational, a solution or for this operator it works. And we proved, in fact, for In fact, if you're considering dynamics of a P1 given by a shift, Q difference in Malor operator, then in fact there are results of linear independence with solution of linear differential equation, which tells you that in fact you cannot be definite and satisfy a linear equation unless you're rational. And we proved in another paper that in fact you are any Any solution of a linear phi equation that is not rational is hypertranscendental, meaning that it does not satisfy an algebraic differential equation. One of the motivation was the result of Holder on the gamma function. Are there other questions? Yeah, I have a question. It's Michael. In the last slide, you said you'd like to extend this. I'd like to extend this to other fields. Do you have particular ones in mind? Well, I mean... Other nice fields. Well, for instance, the result of O D is quite tempting in that direction. If you are considering isogeny on field of elliptic function, you can of elliptic function you you can also wonder if this this works with uh this uh galvorchian strategy so uh so we are we worked with genus zero it is but is it possible to go to genus one this is the question to look at isogenies or translation uh on elliptic curve with bonds that are independent in the in the lattice of the curve Can I ask a question? Hi. Hi. I was just wondering, historically, what was the method used by van der Puten when he proved that these two examples, summation x to the 2 to the n and x to the 3 to the n were algebraically independent? Well, do you know what he was using? I sorry, I don't I don't really know. I say something stupidly perhaps it was Malaw's method, but it's boris. It never really proved that. They claim something similar, but I think Nishoka. But I think Nishoka was the first to prove this and she used Manner's method. Thank you. Are there other questions? Sometimes it takes people a second to unmute, so let's just see. If not, let's feel free to unmute and thank Charlotte again for a very great talk. Very good talk. So, Serge Pantas speaks at, I always get the translation wrong, 1230 Banff time, whichever time that is for you. So we'll resume. We do have a coffee break. We might just stay around in this room, but I'll put in the breakout room information and let me just stop recording. So I will leave. Otherwise, I stay here for
