Can we get started or we have a way to put it together right? Um why should you um put on air out here? The colour and something more fun. Um  So, where is the microphone? All right, so good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to welcome you back to our second day of the workshop. So, we'll start with two talks in climate. And the first one is Gabi Hegero. So, Gabby, it's Hey, girl. So, Gabi, it's a pleasure to have you here virtually. So, the floor is yours. Please go ahead. Thank you. I'm going to try to share my screen, which hopefully works. Can you see that? It's coming twice. Oh man. Oh man. Yes, we can see that. You can click on full screen. It should work. Okay, that working? Yes. Okay. So this is a talk on some things we are doing on extreme events in climate. It's a bit of a conglomerate of a whole lot of things that I thought might be interesting. And I'm a bit worried that I squeezed too many different things in, but I'll just give it a shot. And lots of that has been done. A short and lots of that has been done in collaboration with people in my group and also students. And so I'm talking about extreme temperature events largely. And those have been in everybody's mind, I think, with some of the extreme events we've seen, including the Pacific Northwest heat wave, which I'm sure extended also into somewhat into this region, and also the And also the extreme, the record temperatures in Pakistan last year. And I'm starting with the problem that we have talked about yesterday and that came up in Anthony's talk, which was on the Pacific Northwest heat wave. I'm now realizing that I'm calling it a US Northwest heat wave, and I suspect that there was quite a bit of an imprint in parts of Canada as well. So this is a paper, a collaborator of mine, Vicki Thompson. Collaborator of mine, Vicky Thompson, is doing in a project that we share across the UK project on looking at extreme events and how they change in a changing climate. And she has been motivated by the failure of the GEV fit to this heat wave to look at what makes the GEV fail. And we haven't actually figured out why it fails, but this is basically these plots: the maximum temperature. This plots the maximum temperature here from the reanalysis data. So, this is ERA reanalysis. It shows the annual maximum, daily maximum temperatures in the last 70 years against global mean surface temperatures. So these are anomalies of global mean surface temperatures so that you can see how there is an increase in the annual daily maximum temperature with increasing temperature, but it's also quite noisy. And then here's 2021, which I think. And then here's 2021, which I think we don't actually need a lot of statistics to see that this is somewhere wild outlier. And if you fit a general extreme value distribution to the data up to 2021, you would not have expected this event to occur. Whereas if you look at the second most extreme event, which was, oof, I forgot now when it was, which was quite a bit earlier, you have no problem at all with the Have no problem at all with the GV fit to that point. So I've been raising this problem with my collaborator Yanis Papastatopoulos in Edinburgh, who raised the point that I think also Anthony made very well yesterday, that in looking at a heat wave where you have just observed a record and then figuring out if you would have anticipated this, you are already biasing your statistics. Your statistics, but I'm also wondering if when we have such very rare events, if we are actually able to sample the physical processes that drive very extreme heat. So for example, if you dry out your soil quite completely, then you get all the energy gets converted into sensible heat. And so you get temperature heating rather than evaporation. And if this is not something the data previously have actually Data previously have actually seen that much, then I wonder if we could also look at, we could also encompass or face the problem where we don't actually, we are not in a position to see exactly how the tail changes as we change into a different kind of climate. So that is still, yeah, I'm curious about in the discussion for what if there are any more views on that. This has also been nicely illustrated by the World Weather Attribution work on this event and for. Work on this event and flagged by Geet Jan from Oldenburg, who sadly died a few months ago as that the GV did not actually go there. So, Wiki has now gone ahead and looked for some other extremes that wouldn't have been anticipated, which makes it statistically even more dicey, basically looking at the most extreme day ever recorded and then fitting the GV to all other day, to all other years. And then you can find quite a few regions where you have wild. Find quite a few regions where you have wild outliers, but then, as we discussed, this way of sampling is already biasing towards extreme outliers. What is generally done in my community is looking at extreme value distributions on a point level. So we look at a spatial point and then we fit. And a nice way around this, I remember this from a very long time ago, a paper by Richard Smith. Paper by Richard Smith, and we have Yanis and his student Graham have been working on this for the European temperatures and have found a way to fit the GV where we put where there's a penalty function for large differences to neighboring grid points. And he has then fitted it to the last, I think, 70 years again of data for Europe, daily annual maximum, daily maximum temperature. Maximum daily, maximum temperature, and found how the risk ratios have changed in time. I just wanted to flag this as another area where I think the climate community could be statistically a bit more sophisticated, but it is quite tricky to do this. And then I hope I haven't bored too many of you already with the 1930s heat waves, which exercised me for quite a while because they were so, so extreme. And they still exercise. Extreme. And they still exercise me because I think they illustrate what can happen when you encounter a very extreme event that also that causes a whole chain of events that then can exacerbate what happened. So I thought I start with the backstory. So in the it's that these heat waves happen in the dust bowl, where there's famous photos. So this is the year 1936 where the most extreme heat waves. Where the most extreme heat occurred, and you can see that there is basically no vegetation and lots of dust. So, what had happened is that in the 19, so that's given in here, that in the 1920s, the wheat price dropped. The wheat price was really high first in the 1920s, and people started to move into the Great Plains after the native population had been displaced and started farming and wheat. And wheat got great prices, and lots more people moved in and started plowing up the prairies. And as the climate, decadal variability changed from a quite rainy period to a much more dry period in the 1930s, there was a combination of oversupply of wheat and then the drought that got the farmers into trouble financially, which they tried to address by plowing up even more. Tried to address by plowing up even more prairie and try to make enough money to break even. So, you had an even faster change in the land surface. And so, you had a massively changed land surface, which changed into wheat, which then died in the drought and leading basically to bare soil. And then a massive displacement of people occurred, which people have read, The Graves of Roth have all read about it. So, it was, it had this period. This period had a huge impact, largely triggered by the drought. The heat is probably, as you will see, more of a symptom of what happened that then had enormous socio-economic impacts. So when we look at the heat, this is the annual maximum daily maximum on the right hand and annual maximum daily minimum temperature on the left and on the right. You can see from station data that they follow each other quite closely. This is average. Quite closely. This is averaged over the Great Plains region in the US. So you find a different maximum, possibly on a different day of the year for every data point, and then you average them across the Great Plains to see what is the average hottest day. And you can see that 1936 sticks out like a sore thumb. 1934-31 were also quite extreme. And the trends up to, I think this paper was done, this analysis was done in around 20 years. This analysis was done in about 2015. And to my knowledge, these extremes have still not been broken and they are looking highly unusual. And so I've been interested for a long time. There has been lots of papers that the droughts were influenced by sea surface temperatures, so that both the Atlantic and Pacific were in a climate situation which favors drought in that regions, which is quite influenced by large-scale circulation variability. Population variability: that the dust that was caused by the drought and also by the devegetation enhanced both the drought some more and deepened it. And that land surface feedback such as dry soil can be important here. And what we have, what Tim Tim Cowan, a co-worker of myself, and may have done over this period was looking at the maximum, at a different metrics of heat waves. Different metrics of heat waves, so looking at duration, frequency, and amplitude of heat waves, which is basically looking first what are heat waves which for which we require the maximum temperature exceeding the 90th percentile for this particular part of the year for at least three consecutive days and the minimum temperature exceeding the 90th percentile for about two and three for the second and third days. So, basically, having hot nights, hot days. Having hot nights, hot days for more than two days in a row, and then you can, when you have defined heat waves, you can then find their duration, frequency, and amplitude. And this is a terribly busy diagram, and I ask you to just look at the bits of it that I'm explaining because I think there's too much on it. But this is looking at what the years following the 10 driest and 10 wettest springs in that region based on the standardized crystal. Based on the standardized precipitation index, that's just looking at the rainfall in that region basically. So, you find the years with the 10 driest and 10 wettest springs on the record, and then you look at what the heat wave metrics were in the summer following it. And so the orange ones are following a dry spring. So, these little orange dots indicate individual years following dry springs. And you can see that they're very widely spread, some with a lot of heat wave events, and some with not so many. They are not exact numbers because you Exact numbers because you identify the number of events per grid point again and then average, and then you look at the ones following wet springs, and you can see that those cluster much closer to small heat wave numbers. So, this is basically, and on average, you wind up in, with a random trial, you wind up just picking any summers, you wind up in this range. And so, the heat wave, the number of events is significantly higher in following dry springs. So, in other words, basically, So, in other words, basically, if you had a dry spring, any of the conditions for a heat wave, you will have hotter temperatures and more often heat waves. This all makes a lot of sense and is very important in that region. So, the drought really does play a huge role. And then we played a little bit with what the sea surface temperatures do. So, this is again the observations, and this is now the heat wave frequency, how often are we in heat wave conditions? And looking at the Atlantic and And looking at the Atlantic and Pacific sea surface temperatures, you see that both of them individually, if the other basin was set to climatology, to average sea surface temperature conditions, you get a bit more heat wave frequency compared to the average. So both of them contributed, making it hot. But what really contributes hugely, if you have in a climate model simulation, which we did three bare soil experiments, if you kill off the vegetation, you get hugely more heat. Get hugely more heat wave frequency. So, the biggest factor, the biggest contributor to making these periods so hot was probably the day vegetation. And the mechanism is that the soil dries out. And so you have basically no evaporation and a lot more heat. So it's all quite straightforward, but it was a very satisfying explanation that basically you had such a dramatic change in landscape. Such a dramatic change in land surface and vegetation that you really change the possibility of heat waves to a very different regime. And that's why we had these very extreme hot conditions in this time period. The bottom diagram basically illustrates that in these individual devegetation runs that are captured by the colors over the annual cycle, you have a lot less. Less, you have a little bit less precipitation, but not by a lot, and they are similar to the other runs which were just driven with sea surface temperatures. But the evaporative demand is not met. Basically, you have a lot less evaporation compared to what is possible when you have in the other run. So, this is these low pink dots. So, it was a big factor. And then we played a little bit with what greenhouse gases did by ramping them up and down using these return period diagrams that they were better. Three term period diagrams that the World Veter Attribution likes to use. This was in collaboration with 3D Otto. And we tried how rare this event was in the 1930s compared to present-day CO2 and present-day sea surface temperatures and CO2 and see that it was. And I think the one in a hundred year estimate is a bit out there because it was targeting heat wave. Because it was targeting heat wave frequency to avoid quite a bit of a climatological bias of that model. But overall, you can see that today you would get a lot, you would get conditions like this a lot more frequently than you did at the time. And that chimes with basically having a little bit warmer temperatures, even in the 1930s, due to greenhouse gases, and a lot more warming caused by greenhouse gases since then, which is the pinkish things. So in other words, in other words, when we look at these extreme heat waves again, from the observations now again, compared to the climate model simulations of CMI-5, it was in that time. You can see that the heat waves leave the envelope of the CMI-5 simulations, and that is because the climate models that are run in the modeling centers have land use change, but not. Does have land use change, but nothing as fast as it happened in that time period because they update the land chain surface decadely. So, base, so that I think explains why it's basically impossible to capture these heat waves in the models. Interesting also is that in the present time, this is a region that doesn't really seem to see a lot of increase in heat wave. For example, this is here again the annual maximum daily maximum temperature, so it's quite flat. The models want to increase it a little bit, and it's a region with eerie. A little bit, and it's a region with irrigation, so it could be that we have again an aspect of the land surface changing things. So, that was the 1930s. A slightly, I don't know, a slightly different attack is, which I thought would be interesting because it's another data, interesting data issue, is marine heat waves, which also are increasing and have devastating consequences for corals, for example. And so this one, this is just from looking at long sea surface temperature data, monthly data. Sea surface temperature data, monthly data, finding the marine heat value here is the month exceeding the 90th percentile of sea surface temperature and counting what part of the marine area that is observed is covered in heat wave conditions or is under heat wave conditions. You can see that in the recent time there's a really nice increase, which is not so nice, but well expected. But well expected and understood increase. You can also see the little green lines showing El Niño events. But then you see some weird things, which is, for example, the World Wars in pink also show up as years with strong marine heat waves. During the World Wars, there was a lot less observation of the sea surface temperatures because there was, of course, problems with shipping, as well documented problems with shipping and changing the shipping. And changing the shipping fleet. And then, as we go further back in time, the heat waves seem to all of a sudden increase, both based on the sea surface temperature data in blue and also on night marine air temperatures, which are in orange. And so the student working on this thought he'd look up how many data points went into monthly averages and calculated a simple estimate of how much Estimate of how much this would change variability by plotting one over the number of these C-surface temperatures observations into the monthly data against the variance, the standard deviation of the C-surface temperatures, and found that there's a nice correlation which dies in the recent period, but in the badly observed periods, you have actually a lot of, you have an increase in variability that is quite consistent with what. Variability that is quite consistent with what you would expect from the number of observations that go into the data. So, we are looking here at a problem that the sea surface temperatures and the monthly means are poorer sampled early on, and so they are more temperamental as there's just a few ships going through them. And that basically means that it's much easier to have to detect heat wave conditions because you increase your variance. So, you have now 10 minutes left. Okay, so I'm going, I'm chasing for the future extremely quickly then. So, we've also looked at what happens in the future under heat wave conditions, again, with the general extreme value distribution, which is also something we have discussed yesterday a little bit already. So, what the student has done is taken C-surface temperatures from large model ensembles at one and a half, two and three degrees. At one and a half, two and three degrees above pre-industrial, and has looked at what the location parameter does. And of course, it warms unsurprisingly. And the scale and shape parameter, which he has fitted individually, again to a grid point, changes a little bit, but not nearly as much. So, and that's the Arctic part is well understood. And I think I've run out of time explaining it. There's also somewhat interestingly an increase in the scale parameter over some continental. The scale parameter over some continental regions where we might seem to have a broadening. But then, when we look at what this actually looks like in data in the models, so we've looked at, for example, here the Amazon region in the reanalysis data. So, this is the hottest day in a year histogram for the reanalysis data compared to different climate models. You can see that some of the climate models have a quite strange idea of what present day. Present-day hottest days in a year look like. Some of them are quite realistic. So, the ones the curves are different climate models, launch ensemble. So, this is, for example, MPI ESM has seems to have a reasonably good idea. Can ESM seems to have a quite strange idea of what the hottest day in the Amazon looks like. And then, as you go into the future from present day to one and a half, two and three degrees, blue, green, yellow, and orange, you can see that these different models have very different ideas of how these. Different models have very different ideas of how these extreme events change in the future. You can see where you would, for example, where you get in the MPI high-resolution model, you get a widening of the distribution. The low resolution modeling doesn't seem to want to change the distribution. And basically, I think this flags that we really have relatively poor simulations of present-day heat waves, and with that, also quite a huge uncertainty in what happens in the future. I was going to talk about how, if you consider what is uncomfortable for humans using heat indices, for example, such as the US Weather Service uses, you get much, much more dangerous hot conditions in the future. But I'm not going to do that. And so the challenges I think we face on looking at extremes is still compound hazards. And I think the Still, compound hazards, and I think the dustball heapers were a very dramatic example of compound hazards, but there could also be, there's a lot of others as summarized in the Scheischler paper. We are also, I'm not quite clear at the moment how we determine if we have a climate model, if it is fit for purpose for projecting future extremes. And also, we would like to learn from historical extremes. Would like to learn from historical extremes, but they are poorly sampled. So we have to, when we evaluate models, we have to be really conscious of what we are sampling in both cases. So it's another nice statistical challenge. And projection of extremes that are dangerous to human is something that I think we still need to do more of. And I think with that, I stop sharing.
