So I will introduce the notion of categorical homotopic distance between functors, which extends the notion of homotopic distance between continuous maps, which we define it for topological spaces. And as a particular cases, I will introduce the notions of categorical complexity and higher categorical complexity of a small category. I will prove the main properties. I will prove the main properties of these invariants, in particular Parado Rajan's theorem for rotent vibrations, which generalizes the work on categorical Luste Nikes in the main category of small categories by Tanaka. So let me speak about homotopic distance between futures. First, I will recall the notion of homotopy for futures between categories and that of geometric covering for a small. And that of geometric covering for a small category. All categories will be assumed to be small. And for a small category C, I will denote by C the set of objects and but C X Y the set of arrows between X and Y. So the interval category I M is the category with M plus one objects, zero, one, two, et cetera, and zigzag arrows. And zigzag arrows. And in particular, we need the category I1, which is the category with only two objects and one non-identity morphism S. We will need also the product of two categories, which is the category which has by objects the pairs of objects and by arrows the pairs of arrows. And so if we have two functions, we will say that they are homotopy. We will say that they are homotopic if there is an future H from C times IM to D such that its zero is F and its M is G. In this case, we will denote this by F homotopic G. This definition is equivalent to another one, which is two field sources are homotopic if there is a fence between them. is a fence between them, which means there is a finite sequence of functors F0Fm such that F0 is F and F M is G. And between Fi and Fi plus 1, or between Fi plus 1 and Fi, there is a natural transformation. The idea is that if you have a natural transformation, for each object C, you have a morphism, and these morphemes And these morphemes give you the homotopy in the category I1. So, a particular example are posets, partially ordered sets, which is the same as T0 topological spaces. That can be seen as a small category. If you put an arrow, each time you have two elements which are ordered by C1 less than or equal to C2. So, functions are just. So, funtos are just order-preserving maps, which means continuous maps if you consider topological spaces. And this notion of homotopy is exactly the notion of homotopy in the context of posets and topological spaces. Now, we need a notion of covering, which is due to Tanaka. A geometric cover of the small category C is any collection of subcategories, Ulanda, such that. Lambda such that each time you have a sequence of composable arrows F1, Fn, then there exists some U lambda containing all these morphisms. This idea of covering comes from the classifying space of a small category, where this kind of sequences correspond to simplexes in the classifying space. So you want a covering which covers the whole simplex. So, for instance, this is a small example. If you have this poset, which is a small category, the covering in the bottom is not a geometric cover because you see that it covers all the objects, it covers all the arrows, but it does not cover the composition of two arrows, the arrow coming from A to Z. So, this is not a good covering for us. Okay, so the definition of distance between functors is the least integer n such that there exists a geometric cover U0UN such that on each subcategory the filters are homotopic. So, for instance, an example is An example is a group G that can be seen as a category with just one object, the group, and the arrows are the elements of the group coming from G to G. And the filters are just the morphisms of groups. And homotopy is conjugation, because if you have a natural transformation, you can imagine the diagram of a natural transformation. This gives you a conjugation between the two morphisms. And then, for instance, if you have a non-trivial. Instead, if you have a non-trivial Arbidian group, then you cannot find a geometric cover because each time the maps are conjugate, they are equal. So unless the morphisms are equal, the distance is infinite. That means there is no geometric cover. Another example is this poset P in the diagram that means X1 is less or equal than. X1 is less or equal than X3, X1 is less or equal than X4, etc. And we consider the futures. One is the identity and the other is the future permuting X1 with X2 and X3 with X4. So these two filters are not homotopic, but it is easy to find a geometric cover by two subcategories. So that means that the distance is one. Is one so the basic properties are this one if you change one filter by a homotopic future the distance does not change. The distance, of course, is zero if and only if the filters are homotopic. So in fact, we are defining a distance in the homotopy classes of futures and it is symmetric, of course. But unfortunately, it does not verify the triangular. It does not verify the triangular inequality. We have a counterexample. And this is unlike in the setting of topological spaces, where we define it in another paper, the homotopic distance between maps. There, for normal spaces, you have the triangular inequality. But in this context, we have not this kind of normal property. So the triangular inequality is not true. So, a very basic property, but which is very useful for many proofs, is that if you compose the filters with another filter on the left or on the right, then you have this inequality. The distance between the compositions is less than or equal to the original distance. We will use that later in a couple of proofs. And the most important property is that this distance is homotopy invariant, which means if you have two couples of futures which are connected by natural equivalences, then the distance does not change. And this is important because later we will see several particular cases of distance and all these invariants will be homotopy invariant. Be homotopy invariant. Okay, so we have this kind of results. For example, for the product, if you have two filters Fg and two filters F prime, G prime, and you take the products, then the distance between the products is less than or equal to the product of the distances. There are some plus one which appear, but this is due to the definition which is normalized, okay? To homotopic distance. To homotopic distance, two homotopic filters have distance zero. It is one circuit category, distance zero. And you see that the proof is very easy because we have two different geometric coverings and we just take the product. So let me say a couple of words about connectness. From now on, all categories will be assumed to be path-connected. Path-connected means that if you have two objects, there is a To objects, there is a sequence of six arrows connecting them. And we will need this property: a small category is path-connected if and only if any pair of constant filters is homotopic. And it is very easy to prove because if you have two objects connected by an arrow, this arrow F defines a natural transformation between the two constant functions. Now we have the concept of Leusternik-Sniedermann category for a small category, which is due to Tanaka. So it mimics the classical definition of LS category. So we say that at subcategory U is categorical if the inclusion future is homotopic to a constant future. Constant future. And the categorical LS category of C is the least integer n such that there exists a geometric cover of C formed by n plus 1 categorical subcategories. What we observe is that this is a particular case of distance because, by definition, the category is just the distance between the identity and a constant future. And we have also another result. In fact, the category is the distance between the two inclusions I1, I2, which are defined by taking a base object C0 and including the category in the axis of the product. So now I need to speak. So, now I need to speak two words about contractibility. We say that small category C is contractible if the identity future is homotopic to a constant future, which means that the category is zero. And I have two interesting examples. The first one is you have a category which has an initial object or a final object, it is contractible because you define a natural transformation between the identity. Natural transformation between the identity and a constant future, say T, just by putting alpha X the only morphemes which exists between X and T if T is a final object. And this is a natural transformation because this diagram must be commutative because between X and T there is only one morphism. So the two compositions must be equal. And the same happens for the initial objects. The initial objects. Another interesting example is if you have a category which admits finite products. Because if you take an object C0 and you define the future C0 times something, then the first projection gives a natural transformation between this future and the constant future. And the second projection gives a transformation between this future and the identity. And so you have a fence between the And so you have a fence between the identity and the constant future, which means that they are homotopic, so the category is contractible. So for instance, this category with integer numbers and arrows in the same direction is contractible because it has an initial object. But this is a category, a infinite, which has the arrows. infinite which has the arrows zigzag has category infinite that means we cannot find a geometric cover however i put here the the the category topological category of the classifying space is zero because it is contractible so i will not speak about the classifying space but in in our first paper we have some results comparing the two categories so for instance So, for instance, here you have a small category with two morphisms, which is not contractible, but it is very easy to find a geometric covering by two elements. So the category is one. And the classifying space is the circle, which has category one, two. In general, there is an inequality between the category of the classifying space and the categorical category of C. Now we have a new invariant, which is like a version of the topological complexity by Farber. The idea is that when you define the categorical complexity, you take the disparaginous of the path vibration. Of the path vibration. But the path vibration is equivalent to the diagonal map. And so we will define the topological complexity. In this case, we call it categorical complexity as this varginus of the diagonal, which means we say that a subcategory U of the product is a fibre subcategory if there is a homotopic section of the diagonal and the categorical complexity of And the categorical complexity of the category is the least integer n such that there exists a geometric cover of C formed by n plus one farver's categories. What we prove is that in some sense complexity is dual to category, which means that the categorical complexity is just the distance. Complexity is just the distance between the projections. The LS category was the distance between the inclusions, and the complexity is the distance between the projections. And it is very easy to prove too that the complexity is the distance between the identity of the product and the flip arrow, which changes the coordinates. So this gives So, this gives a nice description of complexity. Of course, I forgot to say that all these invariants are homotopic invariants because they are particular cases of distance. So, now there are several results which compare these invariants. For instance, the distance between two filters is bounded by the category of the domain and by the complexity of the codomain. Domain. And there are several results which are similar to the classical ones and which are very easy to prove in this context. For instance, the category is bounded by the complexity. You see, you only take the distance between the projections. You compose with inclusions. We have the inequality for the compositions, but the compositions are just the constant and the identity. So this. And the identity. So, this gives you the inequality. Another result is the complexity is bounded by the category of the product. In this case, it is just a particular case that you have the distance between the projections, which is bounded by the category of the domain. And the domain of the projections is the product. Okay. So, in general, this distance gives very easy proofs of known results and gives, we hope, new results. And gives, we hope, new results. Now we can define the Heiger distance. If you have n futures F1, Fn between small categories, the Heiger homotopic distance is the least integer M such that there is a geometric cover such that on each subcategory any pair of futures are homotopic. Pair of filters are homotopic. And in particular, we will see that which we call the Heiger complexity, which means now you consider the Heiger diagonal and you take homotopic distance of the diagonal, then you define the Heiger categorical complexity as the least integer M such that there is a geometric cover where you have, say, Heiger farmers categories. That means. Subcategories that means subcategories where you have homotopic sections of the diagonal, then we can define this higher categorical complexity and we prove that this is just the distance between the projections. But this time you have the product CN and you have n projections. Okay, so this is the first part of my talk. And now I will speak about bifibration. And now I will speak about bifibrations because we will give a result relating the in a bifibration of small categories, a result similar to the Vara Jadarjan's result comparing the category of the total space, the base, and the fiber. So I will remember the notions of Cartesian morphism and fibration. And we have a future P from E to B and a morphism in the category E. And we say that the morphism phi is Cartesian if the following happen. It's time to have a morphine beta and you have a morphines bar. And you have a morphism bar alpha completing the diagram, then there exists a unique morphism alpha completing the diagram and projecting onto bar alpha. Okay, this is the definition of a Cartesian morphism. It seems that the name comes from the following property. If you take the compositions, they define this commutative diagram in the category of sets, the composition with. sets the composition with phi the composition with p phi the image phi the future and then you can verify that the morphism is cartesian if and only if this diagram is a pullback that means a cartesian square these definitions come back from rotendig in the 50s and so we say that the future p is a vibration if for any arrow If for any arrow bar phi in the base, if you fix a possible codomain, then there is a lift which is Cartesian. So you have what is called a Cartesian lift for a given codomain. And Cartesian lifting in vibrations are not unique, are unique up to a vertical isomorphism. Vertical means going to the living in the The living in the fiber. The fiber of a fibration over an object B is the category whose objects are the objects such that project into B and the arrows are the arrows such that the image is the identity of B. So a typical example is the category of arrows of the category C. The objects are the arrows of C, and the arrows are the square. And the arrows are the scores of arrows in C, the commutative scores. So you can take the codomain future, which sends each arrow into its codomain. Oh, sorry. Each arrow onto its codomain and each square onto the bottom arrow. So this future is a vibration if and only if you have enough pullbacks. You have enough pullbacks in C because you see if you have an arrow in the base and you are given a possible codomain, then you construct a Cartesian arrow. In the example before of a group with just one object and the elements as arrows, futures are just Are just morphisms of groups. Every arrow in H is Cartesian, so the morphism is a vibration if and only if it is surjective. You can lift arrows. Another example, which these are not small categories, are only locally small, but it is interesting. You have the forgetful function between topological spaces and sets. Between topological spaces and sets, then this is a vibration. Because partition maps here means continuous maps such that in the space E1 you have the initial topology. And so you say if you have a map of sets and you are given a possible codomain, which means a topological space projecting to the codomain, then you can construct initial topology and you have an Initial topology, and you have a partition arrow projecting onto your arrow. Okay, now we have the dual notion of co-Cartesian morphism, which means you have an arrow phi and you say that it is opposite Cartesian for the future P if the opposite arrow in the opposite category, which means you reverse the arrows. You reverse the arrows if the opposite arrow is Cartesian for the opposite function. This is very complicated, so let me translate to something more concrete. So we say that the morphism phi is opposite Cartesian. If each time you have a beta now in the domain, you see, and a bar alpha completing the diagram, then there is a unique alpha completing this diagram and projecting into bar alpha. Bar alpha. It is completely dual to the notion of Cartesian. And we say that the future is an opposite vibration. If any map in the base, each time you are given a possible domain, you can lift to an opposite Cartesian arrow. This opposite Cartesian lifting is not unique, it is unique up to a vertical isomorphism. So, for instance, the codomain future that I explained before is always an opposite vibration. Dually, if you take the domain future, then it is an opposite vibration if and only if you have enough push-outs. It is just the same idea as before. And we are interested in bifibrations, which means Vibrations, which means futures which are both a vibration and an opposite vibration. I will explain now why. In some references, this is called vibration and co-vibration, but co-vibration for topologies has a different meaning, so we prefer to call it opposite vibration. So, the typical example is the product. If you have the product of two categories, Have the product of two categories, then you see that if you have an arrow in the base and you are given a possible codomain, which means a couple B to C, then you just complete the arrow with the identity of C and you have a Cartesian rig. And duality, the forgetful future is also an opposite vibration this time. Opposite vibration this time, you must have a continuous map where the final topology of the document is the final topology. Okay, it's just dual to the other version. Okay, now we have to study the lifting properties of these bifibrations. This was studied by Gray in the 60s, and Gray proved that the field tropy is a vibration. Is a vibration if and only if homotopies can have Cartesian if things. But now we are speaking about homotopies with the product C times I1 instead of natural transformations. So I will translate Grave's result to our language. So we have the following proposition. The future P is a vibration if and only if it has the lifting property for the category I1. The category I1. You have a homotopy in the base, in the bottom line. You are given the final line of the homotopy, which is called G. Then there exists a lift till the h with the property that the image of F times S, S is the only arrow in the category I1. The image of this arrow is Cartesian. So this condition is equivalent to having a vibration. Having a vibration. And dually, if you have an opposite vibration, you have also a lifting property, but you have on the left the future I0, the initial condition. Before it was I1, you see the final condition. And here you have I0. So vibrations and opposite vibrations. Vibrations and opposite vibrations are dual in this sense. What we need for our theorem is the lifting property of a bifibration for an arbitrary length of the homotopy. You see, you have the lifting property for homotopies of any length. And now, just a technical point: when you have a narrow bar in the base, you can choose one particular lifting for each possible colomain. This was called by Grotendic Activas. So when you choose one particular lift, you have the domain of this lift, which is called phi star E2. Star E2 and that defines a filter between the fiber of B2 and the fiber of B1. The image of an arrow by this filter is just the universal property of Cartesian arrows. And the functorial property for the composition comes from the unicity in this definition of Cartesian arrow. So that means that for vibrations, you have a pullback function between. You have a pullback function between the fibers. Okay? And dually, for opposite vibrations, you have a push-forward future because among the possible liftings for a given domain, you choose one particular, and this one particular gives you the codomain phi star E1. And that defines a future between the fiber. Future between the fiber of B1 and the fiber of B2. And now we have the important result by Tanaka. If you have a bifibration and you have two objects in the base, which are connected by an arrow, then the two fibers have the same categorical type, homotopy type, which is completely analogous to the topological case. Topological case. The idea is: if you have a vibration, you have the push forward future and the pullback future, and this will give you a natural equivalence. The proof is just using the universal properties of Cartesian and called Cartesian arrows. So, I have here an example. On the left, there is a category. On the left, there is a category with three objects and three arrows, and the compositions F, G, and G F are the identity. And we project that onto the category I1. And you can verify that this is a bifibration. And remark that the fiber over the zero is just one point, the zero, but the fiber over the one is the category which is red. Which is red, so the fibers are not isomorphic, but they are homotopy equivalent because the category on the right, the red category is contractible. Okay, so this is just what the theorem says. And now we will extend the Barradara-Jan's formula for vibrations in the setting of topological spaces. In the setting of topological spaces, whereas Darajan proved it in the 50s that if you have a heur of each vibration, then there is a formula relating the category of the total space, the fiber and the base. And here we have a bifibration between small categories. We know that if the base is path connected, any two fibers are homotopy equivalent. So we can speak about the homotopy type of the fiber, and our result is. And our result is that if you have a morphism of vibrations, that means you have two morphemes between the total spaces, which induce morphemes in the base, and you have an object B in the base such that the image by the two filters is the same. Then you have an induced filter between the fibers. The theorem says that the distance between the filters in the total spaces. The filters in the total spaces is bounded by the product of the distance in the fibers and the category of the base. And the proof is rather long, but it uses essentially the lifting property. So as particular cases, we have the result by Tanaka for the LS categories. The category of the total space is less than or equal to the category of the base times the category of the fiber. The category of the fiber, which is a particular case of our result, just by taking F the identity and G the constant future, of course. And another interesting result is for complexities, because if you take the bifibration induced in the product by your bifibration and you take the projections, then you obtain that the complexity of the total space is bounded by the Is bounded by the category of the base times the category of the fiber, which is the categorical version of a result by Farber and Grant for topological fibrations. Okay, now I have several references. The paper by Gray about the lifting properties of vibrations, the original paper by Lee where he defined the homotopy for future. He defined the homotopy for futures, our paper about the distance between futures, and the original paper, which in fact is previous to the other one, about the homotopic distance between maps in topological spaces. And the reference Richard is a recent book which speaks about vibrations and Cartesian morphemes and all that in categories. Structure is a classical reference for. A structure is a classical reference for fiber categories. The paper by Tanaka, where he defined the category of a small category, and our very recent archive paper, which was posted today with the content of this talk. And that's all. Thank you very much. Let's see. Let me go back to what we call category and topological proposition. In the original approaches to discretize these things for spaces or for some discretization of spaces. The lower bound, the discretized thing is always larger than or equal to the topological thing. And one of the things that, at least in some of the models, is that you have this subdivision process to make it agree. So I was wondering if there is some kind of subdivision process for category that you could implement here. Yes, in Tanaka's paper, there is this kind of results. This kind of results. I don't remember exactly the results, but he considers subdivisions of small categories for this categorical. So it would be in principle the level for east that's the second. Yes, yes. We have not tried that, but probably, yes. Because the formal ideas are the same. So you must translate. It is the same thing when we define this kind of things for simplicial complexes. You must find a good notion of covering and a good notion of homotopy. But after you have more or less the same proofs and results, which is more difficult is to find examples and concrete computations, of course. But I think it's possible to do that. Can I answer your question? Sorry. Oh, please. Oh, sorry. Yeah, I can't hear the people in the room that well. That's from Zoom. Sorry about that. My question is on, so for J categories, which are a type of model category, there's this notion of abstract nutrition and Schenman category and abstract topological complexity. How do How do the notions of flustering economic category that and TC that you gave in the first half of the talk, do those agree with the ones that would be given by this abstract notion? Sorry, I didn't understand. It coincides with what? So there's a notion of if you have basically a model category with the cube axiom. With the cube axiom, there is a definition using the Ganea-Schwartz approach or the Whitehead approach to defining sectional category that lets you define Lesternich-Schnaulmann category and topological complexity. I was wondering if the definitions you gave for small categories for Leschernich-Schnommann category and TC, do those agree with the ones for that would be the one for the category of small categories? Because I know that's a model category. Because I know that's a model category, but I'm not sure if it's a J category. Oh, no, we have results comparing the, for instance, for posets. You can define there the usual category and the usual topological complexity as a topological space. And sometimes they are the same and sometimes not, due to the definition of geometric covering. You see, you have a topological space, you have more coverage. Space, you have more coverings because you can cover in finite spaces. For instance, the open sets are the sets of elements which are less or equal, a given element. This is a basis for the topology. So you have much more coverings than the geometric coverings. So in general, they are not equal. Okay, thank you. I have a question. I was wondering if you had. I was wondering if you have a general notion of sectional category, and so what is the relevant kind of diversion? Yes, we have, but we have not published yet. Yes, you can define this variable, the sectional category for future, of course. And the problem we were thinking about possible examples because the classical thing is to define the path vibration. And in this kind of abstract setting, And in this kind of abstract settings, it's rather difficult to define these kinds of things. For instance, we have a paper about simplicial complexes, and we were able to define a path complex, which is not finite, but it is due to rhaptics. So you can more or less have results. But the problem, for instance, in simplicity complexes is that this. Complex is that this path vibration is not really a vibration. It is a finite vibration. So you have this kind of problems with things are finite or not. It is the same that in small categories, you only have categories which are small. So you have not the general definition for categories. But yes, we have this kind of definition. Is there any uh importion of uh chronology of a category that gives uh uh some bounds to the category? That is a good question. In posets, there is a notion of homology which only uses the poset and which gives you the same homology that the topological space. It is a kind of simplicial homology. But in small categories, I don't know. I don't know. Because when you pass, the problem is that in a small category, you can associate the nerve of the category, which is a simplicial set, and there you could compute the homology. And when you pass through the classifying space, you are taking the geometric realization of this implicit set. And I think the problem is with the degenerate. Problem is with the degenerate simplexes, you know. So at the end, you obtain a CW complex which has one cell for each non-degenerate simplex. But I don't know if it is possible to define directly in the small category the cohomology. If this would be possible, then you you probably will have the the the lower bound for the for the category and for the distance. But I don't know if that exists. I don't know if that exists. I understood uh correctly. You said that the categorical category face to real distance. Sorry, the categorical distance face to real distance, right? Yes. Yes, because when you define the distance, you are aiming to have a true distance. You are aiming to have a true distance. And in the setting of topological spaces, you have a true distance if the spaces are normal. But in this posets, for instance, they are completely not normal. They are not households. And we have a counterexample. So, in general, you will not have the triangular inequality. I have not it here, not it's not very complicated. It is just, I think, a poset with four elements, something like that. And you can see that for a couple of futures, that doesn't work. But in the topological setting, it is a true distance. This is amazing because you are defining. You are defining a distance between homotopy classes of maps. And for arriving to this result, you must use a nice lemma by Opre and Strom, which says that if you have a normal space and you have a covering satisfying some property, say A, and the covering has size M and you have another. And you have another covering satisfying another property B of size N, and you are sure that the properties pass to the subspaces and to the disjoint unions, then the result says in a normal space there is a covering by n plus m elements satisfying both properties. This is really, really nice and difficult. And so And so you apply this to the triangular inequality, and it's almost evident that it is true. But unfortunately, in finite spaces or small categories, you have not this result. As a follow-up question to that, are there regularity conditions on the categories or on the functors that you guarantee the training looks? From the topological point of view. So, sorry, I was wondering if in the categorical setup there are assumptions you can place on the categories of the functors that you guarantee the time looking forward. Ah, no. We have only a small result saying that if things have category less than two, then that works because you to study all the possible cases. But we have not a general property now. Not a general property, no. Further questions?
