Now I have unmuted. Yes? Do you agree? Yes. See? Okay. I won't talk for too long so that we can go and enjoy Monte Alban and the pleasures of Mezcal and the other place whose name I forgot. There's one thing I'd like to start by clarifying from my previous lecture. From my previous lecture, I made a statement about mu4, mu4 tensor two. And I don't think that's that. Bjorn pointed out to me that what I said was incorrect. Now, let me tell you what I think I meant. And I think this is right, but this could also be incorrect. Okay. So just like a side note, I think the following, I think what I may have meant to say is if you try to compute sort of limiting cohomology, like with two added coefficients of spec of R. Coefficients of spec of R, you get Z mod two. But if you do the same thing with one with a twist, you get zero. And this will sort of come up again tomorrow in some in some form. But it's just, you can write down many examples where twisting a structure changes the cohomology dramatically. And I mean, you made reference to this in your very beautiful lecture. And another thing that I guess I want to say. Another thing that I guess I want to say is: I noticed we hear these children when we're in this room, like playing at school, and it's such a beautiful sound. And I was thinking about that during Eldon's lecture. And it's kind of like the kids are out there playing in their playground and they're screaming and running around having fun. I'm like, we're doing the same thing in here, but in like a very different way. It's kind of in the same spirit. I think that's what's so lovely about math conferences. We're like on this playground and we're kind of just running around chasing each other and trying to understand what's going on. Okay. So yesterday I told you about the. Okay. So yesterday I told you about the what the brow. Did I flip these? Oh, maybe I well, you know what? We'll never know what I meant. Okay. So last time, last time I told you about the what of the period index problem. And today I want to tell you a little bit about. Today, I want to tell you a little bit about the how in certain cases. And then part of this how has a lot to do with the inadequacy of this particular how. So next time I'll talk a little bit about some potential why or maybe why not. Okay. Now, where did we end up last time? We ended up with this discussion of twisted sheaves on gerbs, capturing the information about the index of Capturing the information about the index of a class, right? We had this S and we had a gerb. This was like a mu n gerb or a gm gerb. I don't remember how we set this up. Mu and gerb representing alpha in the in the Brouwer group of S, bracket N. And we said that the index of alpha, yeah, sure, but not for long. But yeah, I mean, for us, this was really specific, you know, this is specum. This was really specific, you know, this is spec of k for some big field, but I'm going to relax that in just a second. And the index of alpha was equal to the minimum rank of minimum positive minimum positive rank of a twisted sheaf on curly on curly s, right? You remember this? And so this gave us a And so, this gave us a coherent model for studying the index of a Brouwer class, a geometric realization of a geometric construction that reifies it and allows you then to work with it with your hands. Like I imagine if I made furniture, this is what it would feel like, but I'm never going to make furniture. Okay. So I guess we could say that now if we look at Kohlan's conjecture, we can sort of transparently Because they're transparently, you know. I mean, this is just saying the same thing again, but sort of the geometric formulation of Collegium's conjecture just says if K is a CN field, let me be consistent with my own CT field, excuse me. The T field and purely S spec of K is a mu n gerb, then there exists a twisted sheaf on curly S of rank n to the t minus one. That's filliotal inspiration. Yeah, that's only a tool in all right now. I want to stop just thinking about fields. There's a whole theory of Brouwer groups, of schemes, of ramification of Brouwer groups. If you take the Brouwer group of the function field of a variety, you can study where a class ramifies and blah, blah, blah. I'm not going to dwell on it. I'm just going to use the global theory that exists. And I'm happy to talk to anybody about that more if you're curious what that works. That works, but I really want to focus on this sort of special case, the function field of a variety, and really just the whole variety itself. So, here we're going to say capital K is K of S. S is a smooth proper keyfold over an algebraically closed field. Okay. And alpha. And alpha is in the Brouwer group of all of X. This is called an unramified Brouwer class. So now what happens, see, the thing is, if we're studying sheaves, we're thinking about sheaves on this gerb, now when you're on something proper, sheaves form a really nice space. It's like sheaves on a proper smooth variety, something like that. Proper smooth variety, something like that. So now, you know, S, S itself is a proper tame algebraic stack. And it's not too hard to see that the moduli stacks of twisted vector bundles, of twisted sheaves, are well behaved, or at least are algebraic. Let's say, I don't know, curly M of M. I don't know, curly M, sub curly S of R, this is like twisted coherent sheaves of rank R. And yes, of course, the objects in the moduli problem are not, in fact, coherent sheaves, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. These are algebraic. Really, you should be talking about quasi-coherent sheaves of finite presentations, etc. Algebraic, compatible with base change, and so on. And so on. So at least we have some kind of a space. And then, I mean, in some sense, Palio's Lund's conjecture becomes a conjecture about rational points on such a thing or whatever. But here's the craziest thing. Like, really, I mean, in this case, over an algebraically closed field, Coleplan's conjecture is just. So, Kaleitlan's conjecture is just saying that something is not empty. It's really, really hard to decide to show something is not empty. What do you do? How do you make something out of nothing? If you're trying to show there's no nothing, you need to have something, but how do you make something if all you have is nothing? You see what I'm saying? Okay, and so let me show you a way to do that in certain cases. So, an even more special case. Dimension of S. Dimension of S equals one. Please, Sid, please. I mean, like, there's a sense in which there is something after a basic. No, no. I mean, we're starting with an algebraically closed field. We have a variety of an algebraically closed field. We have this stack that's a modulized stack of sheaves on this gerb. And if I set r equal to. And if I set r equal to n to the t minus one, the conjecture literally just says this is not empty. So we have, you know, I told you last time that the benefit of having a geometric model is that you have it for all time and you can hold it. Okay, here we have a geometric model, but we don't know if we can hold it because there may be nothing to hold. Okay, so to get around this problem, if we want to try to use geometry, we need a way to leverage something that we know exists. Something that we know exists. That's kind of what I'm trying to say. And so let me tell you about a case where we know that something indeed exists. Dimension of s equals one. Now, Sen's theorem, this came up last time. It says that the Brouwer group of this function field is actually zero, or this is a C1 field, and so it has trivial Brouwer group. And what that means What that means is that the stack of sheaves on S is non-canonically isomorphic to the stack of sheaves on S, where I've taken the curly away. How do you realize such a thing? Do you remember that we had, so this says that S is approximately BE mu n. That's not really true, but it's approximately. That's not really true, but it's approximately true, okay, up to a thing. I mean, you can look at the class of H2 of S mu n is E mod n. And so we can imagine that this is sort of just, this is like the topological Brouwer class. This is the topological, this is like not the, the Broward class is a topological incarnation of this coinology class. Let's just assume it's zero. The mu and gerbiness is extra structure over the Gerbiness is extra structure over just the Brouwer class. I don't want to really worry about that. But so there's, so on here, remember there's this L universal that was corresponding to the canonical character mu n. And so if I take a twisted vector bundle here, I can just send it to V tensor L univ dual. And now this has no twist. And so then I can, I don't know, if you want to be careful about this, you take pi lower star where pi is a map from the gerb to the curve. That turns out to give you a nice support. That turns out to give you a nice separate. In other words, you can untwist a twisted vector bundle using this line bundle. You make the character act trivial, you make the group act trivially, and that means it comes from the space beneath. All right. We don't have an invertible, so, so a fact, which I should have stated last time. Alpha, maybe this is a good to see. Alpha equals zero if and only if there exists an invertible twisted sheet on S. I mean, maybe that's a better alpha zero on the Brouwer group, if and only if there's an invertible twisted sheaf on the mu n germ. All right, so for example, in this case, when it's b mu n, we have the universal sheaf. But in general, the existence of an invertible thing, it's like saying, you know, It's like saying, you know, the index would then be one because of this thing that we said yesterday. And so the class would have to be true. So what I'm trying to tell you is now the stack of these twisted sheaves on this curve is equivalent, is isomorphic to the stack of ordinary sheaves on a curve. And that we know all sorts of stuff. That's our friend. That's our good friend. So, let me tell you some things about it. Things about now, I mean, our curve is S. Maybe we should call it C. I'm going to now change S into a C. So let's fix, we're going to fix a curve, fix a curve C. Fix the curve C over an algebraically closed field. All right. Now, there's like two ways to say what I'm going to say. So I'm going to say it in the more classical way, which is also the stupider way. I mean, the important thing here is the stack of all vector bundles has certain properties. But in the history of moduli, people didn't understand that that would have meant nothing to them. Much like when I hear much, many of the things said here. Many of the things said here, I'm like, I don't understand what they're saying. It's like aliens from the future have come and said these things about sphere spectra. Like, what's going on? Like, I think if you went to an Italian at the end of the 19th century and said, well, just take the stack of all vector bundles. He'd be like, what? So many of these things are phrased in classical terms. But as I will show you in an example, there's also a reason to do that to eliminate certain things. All right. Um, all right. So, so first of all, um, have you ever experienced semi-stable vector bundles before? I'm like, yeah. Do you mean over the sphere spec? Sorry, I will stop making jokes about that on Friday after I stop talking. And I want to say, I love what I'm hearing here. It's amazing. I feel like a kid outside. Here. It's amazing. I feel like a kid outside running around. I'm not trying to insult you. I actually think it's wonderful. I just don't feel like I fully understand yet. Okay, so let's see here. So a locally free sheet, this is like the first version of all this. It gets much more sophisticated when you work on higher dimensional varieties and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, or singular curves. But locally free sheave V on C is I'm going to. On C is, I'm going to define two terms at once, semi-stable and stable. If for every proper sub-bundle, W inside of V, but I wanted to have like, you know, rank of W is less than rank of V. I think if I'm going to say this, actually, maybe that doesn't matter. Okay, either what I'm saying is true. I okay, either what I'm saying is true or false, and if it's false, it's almost true. Okay. We have this bizarre-looking thing. The degree of W over the rank of W is less than the degree of V over the rank of V. Strict inequality is what corresponds to stability. Potential equality is what corresponds to semi-stability. This is like a, this would turn out. This is like a this would turn out now if you if you think about things of uh uh degree zero this corresponds to having a certain kind of connection i mean being a representation of the of pi one and so on there's a very beautiful history of the subject i encourage you to read about it it got kind of turned into this and then this has connections to git uh this lead you know if you look at like mumford's thesis uh i'm not going to say his name again if i if i can avoid it All right. So, like, for example, just to connect this with the most basic thing in the world, if you take like P1, you know, Broton D tells us that any vector bundles vectors line bundles. And here, Bundles and here semi-stability is the same thing as saying all the AI are equal and stability only happens if the rank is one. E1 is maybe not the best example, but it's a place where you can fully understand what's going on. Yeah, I think I'll skip Genus 1. Genus 1 is a fascinating story, but I think it'll get too confusing if we. But I think it'll get too confusing if we go too far. Right. I heard an inhalation. Okay. Let me go to example. This is example A. Let me go to example C. But here the, this is a good one. All right. Let's say C has genus two. Oh, so what's the upshot of this? Sorry. So let me just say, what is the upshot of this? So if you look at the sort of moduli space of semi-stable. Moduli space of semi-stable sheaves on P1 of rank N and trivial determinant. So that means that I have fixed an isomorphism between the determinants of V and O. This is just a one point. This is actually like a B G L N. It only has one point. The vector bundle is just a direct sum of copies of O, and then it has some automorphisms, which are the automorphisms of a free vector bundle. Okay, so this is a little scary. This is not the regime where. Is this not the regime where geometric invariant theory works? But there's baby's first moduli space. Okay. Now let's go to C, genus 2. C has genus 2. And we're going to look at rank 2 and determinant O. Okay, so now this one is quite a fascinating example. Oh, maybe. Oh, maybe I should say that this is an open condition in the stack. So, really, just really, from the modern point of view, this is just some way of finding some kind of nice open substack that has, I don't know, what Elper would call a good moduli space, but used to be called the geometric invariant theory quotient and so on. Invariant theory, quotient, so on. But what's really important for things like the index of a variety is birational properties. That's why you can really just think about the stack of all sheaves. But you'll see in this example why it's nice to think about this particular open substack. So now, if we take the semi-stable sheaves of rank two and trivial determinant on this genus two curve, it turns out the GIT quotient is isomorphic to P3. That's so cool. That's so cool. And inside of here, there's a special surface, which corresponds, which is really, this is isomorphic to the Jacobian of C modula plus or minus one. So it's sort of the singular Kumar surface. I don't know, is that the word? What the hell would you call that thing? So that the complement, this is the stable locus. This is the stable locus. So, this is equal to M S C 2 O, okay? So, it's a couple of this embedded sort of Kumar surface thing. And then it gets better. Now, what happens is that if you think about the stack mapping to the GIT quotient. So we've got this going on. We've got this. We've got this thing. And that baby, this is a mu2 gerb. And it generates its class generates the browser group of U, which is Z mod2. So over the stable locus, we have a canonical browser. So, over the stable locus, we have a canonical Brouwer class, which is the stack of all sheaves. And then the semi-stable part is a little funky, but when you close everything up, you get this P3. And you have this nice surface, fully understandable. This corresponds, by the way, to sheaves of the form L plus L dual, where L is in the Jacobian of C. Those correspond to the properly semi-stable points of the modulate. Okay? That's why it's Jacobian modulo plus or minus one, because L plus L dual is L dual plus L. L plus L doo or is L do plus L. Okay, so what is the cycle bits over the surface? God-awful thing. It's horrendous. Okay. But I don't know. I mean, I know it's not pleasant. Okay. But you're absolutely right that we should think, I think it's actually important to understand that better than I think we should. Important to understand that better than I think we do right now. Maybe somebody does. Okay. Now you see one thing that just reminds me of something. I'm just wondering if it's related. So there's, do you know the mesh conic that if you start with a point on the moduli space of genus? Oh, maybe this, sorry, this is probably different. But anyway, I'll say it anyway, but I think it's not, it's not related. I'll say it anyway, but I think it's not related. If you take the moduli space of genus2 curves, you take a point on it, then there's a difference between the field of moduli and the field of definition. And so to actually find a curve over that field over that field of moduli, the obstruction is some Brauer class. And it's some two-torsion in the Brauer class. Some two torsion in the bar. Right. So I'm just wondering if that, but I guess this is this one maybe is not related, or I don't know. Well, let me tell you the relationship. You're pointing out there that the hyper elliptic locus in the stack of curves is a Z mod 2 gerb over the course space over the locus in the course space. And that's a very concrete realization of how you show that point, that that gerb is not split. You can make a conic where you take a bi-anti-canonical section and you show that you can't make. Canonical section, and you show that you can't make a double cover unless O of one exists, whereas on a conic, you only have O of two, right? That's what you're getting at. Because six is not six is only visible by two when two is bigger than one. Is this related to this? Yeah, now that's an absolutely essential. So on its face, no. On its face, no. But the way that that phenomenon is extremely important right here, and I'm glad you brought this up. If I take a rational point of this, If I take a rational point of this thing, of this u, it does not have to come from an actual sheaf because there's a Brouwer class obstructing the lift, which is the stack itself. So that's completely analogous to what Bjorn is pointing out. It's not, I don't think, directly related to that, because this is a universal property for any moduli space of sheaves on a curve. What you're talking about is a universal property for all hyperliptic loci. Okay, so it's just a different term. Okay, so it's just a different gerb then. It's not. Okay. Okay, never mind. Now, if you want to learn more, there's a paper I wrote with Dan Bragg where we show that every possible finite gerb occurs in the moduli space of curves. Okay, so just it's on the archive. We're revising it now because the writing could be improved. So that thing you're talking about is sort of a universal phenomenon for curves. And here we have this Brouwer group. And here we have this Brouwer group phenomenon for vector bundles. Like, this is an extremely important thing, that they're not the same. Great. Right. Comments, questions, other thoughts, feelings, anything that's freaking you out or making you confused or happy, you can share happy thoughts. Not hearing any happy thoughts either. Now, let me. Now, let me tell you the kind of like a key thing that is just related to what I said before. What was that? Was that number one? Number two. So there's this locus of semi-stable sheaves. You can understand the geometry in certain cases. It gets more mysterious as the genus goes up. For example, the fact that the properly semi-stable locus is a divisor and that the GIT quotient is smooth, this is the only case where that happens. There's no other cases like that. No other cases like that. What you expect for high genus, in general, what happens is that this is the locally factorial variety whose singular locus is exactly the properly semi-stable points and the codimension is high. So this is like a red herring, but it's like an important red herring. Okay, here's another thing to point out. Right. Oh, maybe this is D. Okay. So that was property C. Example C, what is these numbering? Example C, what is these numbering? What's going on? Yeah, okay. But D of what? C was an example in genus two. Okay, great. D. Let's say that C has genus greater than one. Not two. I mean, it could be anything bigger than one. It could be two. Okay. So the first thing to point out is that, in fact, this moduli space is not empty. So there is a stable sheaf with any Rankine determinant. Franken determinants. And this is true actually for any infinite, any infinite k. It doesn't have to algebraically close. So there's always stable vector bundles. And roughly the idea is, you know, the idea is make random extensions of line bundles, whatever. Of line bundles, whatever. If you take a random extension of line bundles that are where one is positive enough and one is negative enough, you put the negative one here and the positive one here. You take a random extension, then that'll be stable. And if you just, then you keep doing that, it'll stay stable. I mean, it's not trivial, but it's not deeply mysterious or anything like that. So there always is one of these babies. Okay. And now here's an even more, this is like just an amazing. Amazing property that's super easy to prove and extremely useful. Okay, so you see here, this was P3, and you could ask yourself: is that P3 for a reason? Maybe you'd expect, like in many moduli problems, as some numbers get big, like maybe as the genus of the curve goes up, the moduli space should get more and more general type or something like this, right? There's a lot of phenomena like that. Well, in fact, no. This is a theorem due to, I think, due to Serre. I think due to Sarah, this thing is unirational. Okay, and the proof of this is, Sid, your eyebrows are saying something. How many of you have seen this before? Have you not seen this before? Oh, this is a very special moment for all. Okay. Okay, so to fix O of one on C, right? C is projective, so it has an O of one. And now consider the general map from O of minus N to the R minus one of V. Okay, if you like, take R minus one general sections of a high twist of V. What? R is the rank. R is the rank. It's R. Yeah, I mean, maybe we should say it's positive. Yeah, it could be two, it could be three, could be a trillion. I mean, you can make it one. Make it one. Let's do the exercise. What happens if R is one? Well, it has fixed determinant, so then it's L, so it's a point, so it's giving your rational. Okay. But it's very important that it be fixed determinant. That's your point. This is a very important thing to point out. Yes. Thank you. So take a general map like this. So, take a general map like this. Now, if you have a general map and this is negative enough, then the sections will always be linearly independent at every point. These are elements of the vector space at each point. This is a Bertini argument that tells you that these are linearly independent at all points. And so we get an exact sequence: 0 goes to O of minus N to the R minus 1 goes to V, goes to L. goes to v goes to l twisted by r minus one times n zero okay now n just kind of depends on v how much twisting you have to do to get linear independence depends on on v on the cohomology or whatever so so the fact that the semi-stable locus is quasi-compact tells you you can choose one n that works for all of them but if not if you choose an n that's big you'll get a bunch of v's this way and then you can make n even bigger you'll get a bunch more v's you'll get some kind of ascending argument that You'll get some kind of ascending argument that fills in your thing if you want. But now look at this. Look at this. This is this. And this is this. Okay, this is the variable part. But these are not variable. These are fixed. And so now, if I just, there's also, you see, a vector space of extensions. There's an actual affine space parametrizing those extensions. There's x1. There's x one, you know, underline, whatever you want to call it, l of r minus one n to o of minus n to the r minus one. This is like some affine space underlying this k vector space. And if you take a generic extension, kind of like what we were talking about before, you'll get a semi-stable sheaf. And so, what you get is a rational map, a dominant rational map to this space, in fact, to the stack. It's even better. It's even better. Dominant. I mean, it could be surjective if you pay enough attention to your N. So it's unirational. How do you see that a generic element of this X1, it gives you a semi-stable? So this is an irreducible variety, and one of them does, and it's an open property. And one of them does, and it's an open property, so most of them do. Okay. So this is the proper Italian algebraic geometry. Okay. Good question. Yes. Okay. This is this argument is impossible not to love. But now there's something that I also want you to see about this. It's also a very frustrating argument. For example, you have to. For example, you have to use R minus one sections. That's awkward. Because if we're trying to show, think about colourful. Suppose we were like, we put on our fuzzy glasses and like we're zooming out in some situations where there's a gerb. We're trying to show something. We want to understand the moduli space. Well, we're trying to go to the place where the rank is minimal. So you can't do, I mean, you just can't do stuff like this in the category of twisted sheaves. It doesn't make any sense. So this is a very brittle argument in the sense that it is not at all. Argument in the sense that it is not at all compatible with the kinds of things that will come up in a little bit. Well, okay, multiple things are bad. R minus one is bad because it's less than R. Okay, O is bad because it's O and L is bad because it's L. So like this is not a twisted sheaf and this is not a twisted sheaf. So you can't directly make any argument on twisted sheaves because they lie in different slices of the category of sheaves. Everything is. Sheaves. Everything is messed up about it. The rank doesn't make any sense, the weight doesn't make any sense, and all that. Now, as I'll explain to you in a few minutes, you can sort of realize the moduli space of twisted sheaves by doing like a Galois, you make a Galois form of the moduli space of sheaves, where the way that the Galois group is acting is via tensoring with torsion line bundles. So if you start tensoring sequences like this, you end up with different space, different things here. It's just a giant mess. Like this kind of uni-rationality argument is too brittle to give us rational geometry. Riddle to give us rational geometry of anything over an interesting field. Yeah. Nothing. Nothing. But in genus one, the moduli space of semi-stable vector bundles is just a finite set of points. Okay, in fact, the moduli space of semi-stable vector bundles is sort of, there's this classification due to a TF. Is sort of there's this classification due to Atia, which is best understood in terms of the Fourier-Makay transform. And I encourage you, like Heinla wrote a nice paper where he explains Atia's theorem in terms of the Fourier-Makay transform. But what you see is that the moduli space of, in fact, I had this in my notes, I decided to skip it. But it's just a finite set. It's sort of in bijection with, if you think of the indecomposable ones, it's in bijection with the torsion points of the Jacobian, the n-torsion, if you're looking at rank here. And trivial determinant. And actually, it's a very important example for understanding certain. And actually, there's a very important example for understanding certain kinds of failures that I may or may not get good. Yeah, so this just always works. Sometimes the space isn't very interesting. Good, great. Okay. Now, one thing that you see, a consequence of this, is that this variety is separably rationally connected. You don't see this directly from this argument because you have to be careful about the separable part, but it's true. If you don't like that, just forget about this and just think about characteristic zero. Among other things, since it's unirational, it is a rationally connected variety. I'll explain why that's relevant in a sec. Now, there's another interesting uniformization using the affine Grassmannian, but I think I may save that one for this. Save that one for next. Okay. And then there's one other interesting fact I think that's worth saying about these moduli spaces at the moment. And that is we understand their automorphism groups, which is also really, really cool. Like what is the auto, you know, what is the automorphism group of the moduli space of vector bundles? Let's see. Sorry, Mike. So you want to produce points on the moduli spec, obviously. Yeah. Yeah. So far, all these results are the best of the Thoughts on a specific undergraduate. Yeah, I haven't said anything yet that's useful for the. I'm trying to explain the under. So the point is that once we have the geometric framework established and we know that things are compatible with base change, we can then divide the problem into two parts, a geometric problem, which is to understand what the underlying geometry of the moduli space is in whatever context it will appear. And then an arithmetic problem of trying to figure out whether the geometry influences the existence of rational points. The geometry influences the existence of rational points or low-degree zeros. Okay, so I want to say the last thing, which is not sort of strictly speaking essential, but is cool to know. Okay, so if you imagine you have a V, you have a V and you have an isomorphism of debt V with some L. And the rank of V is R. What? Yeah, yeah. E was the affine corresponding uniformization. Say what? Yes. You know, you, you, the Bovio-Laszlo construct. But you can do it in a slightly smarter way. I mean, you can choose a big enough divisor that, well, I think I'll try to do this tomorrow, but I may not. I mean, on Friday. Okay. How can I make another vector bundle? I want to talk about, think about automorphism. Vector bundle. I want to talk about think about automorphisms of the moduli space. That means I start with a vector bundle, I have to make a new vector bundle. Okay, what could I do? I mean, there's various things you could imagine. The easiest one to imagine is tensoring with a line bundle. It makes another vector bundle of the same range. But then you have to worry about the determinant. You don't want the determinant to change. So what you can do is you can tensor by L, where L is in, you know, I'm just the Jacobian, the R torsion of the Jacobian. If I change by an R torsion line, If I change my r tors and line bundle when I take the determinant, I raise it to the rth power and it doesn't change. It's trivial, so it doesn't change the determinant. And it turns out that this is actually an isomorphism. It's a theorem due to Pontev, Vedakis and Pontev. I think they're the first people to prove this, but I could be confused. This twisting map. This twisting map gives an isomorphism between the R tortured and the Jacobian and the automorphisms of this moduli space that we're talking about. And I think it's still true if you just look at the automorphisms of the. Is still true if you just look at the automorphisms of the stable locus as well. All right. So far, so good. Now I'm going to just mention, so mention. One can define, so semi-stability, et cetera, is the, well, I'll forget the, et cetera. Semi-stability is defined. Is defined for twisted sheaves also. So we have this curly M semi-stable curly C R L or a gerb over C also. Geometrically, it becomes isomorphic to the, so you know, so that if I then extend scalars, the k bar. The k-bar, it becomes isomorphic non-canonically to the usual thing when the Brouwer class dies. Is it defined in the same way? You could define it in the same way. But then you have to define what the degree is of a twisted sheaf. It's not too hard to do, but you just have to do it. Or you could do it in terms of the Hom sheaf from V to W and some numerical stuff. Then you have something untwisted. And some numerical stuff. Then you have something untwisted. There's various ways to try to say it, but yes, it's different. You could, I think the right way to do it is just to say it in the same way. Can I ask this? It's probably a stupid question, but if you start with a V, going back to this automorphism question, if you start with a V and you, that's semi-stable, the dual, is that doesn't have to be semi-stable? Is that I'm just wondering why you don't get no? Oh, yeah. Don't get oh, yeah, oh, yeah, duality. I think the dual is semi-stable. So, but then wouldn't you get another automorphism by sending v to v dual and then twisting by whatever line bundle you like to you need to make the determinant right again? Which thing by whatever line bundle you need to make the determinant right again. I guess that's the dual thing determinant L inverse. If yeah, so so but you can you can as long as l is congruent to l in versus modulo n, that seems to give you another another as long as it's yeah, as long as yeah, as long as l squared is divisible by r. Yeah, yeah. So let me put an asterisk. Something like what you're saying is definitely true. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And I started out with K being algebraically closed, and now it's just a field. Now I want to take a specific example, specifically. So here's an application of all this. The proof of Deong's theorem. Remember, that says that if S is a surface, That if s is a surface over k bar, and alpha is in the brewer group of the function field, then the period of alpha is equal to the index of alpha. And I'm just for the sake of simplicity here, I'm only going to consider alpha in the actual broad group of S, but there's multiple ways around that, one of which is to just use curves that have a stacky structure instead of curves that don't have a stacky, instead of just regular curves, and rewrite the whole theory. It all works the same way. Whole theory. It all works the same way. Another way is to note that if you know this for all unramified classes, or if you get it for all ramified classes, do. But I don't want to deal with the details of any of that. All right. So now here's a silly thing you can do. Choose a general ample pencil. Okay, and you get a thing like this. This is a blow-up in the base. This is a blow-up in the base locus of the pencil. And this is fibrid over P1. And this is sort of, and here you've got, you've got spec of K of T. And if you take the generic fiber, you could say this is going to be smooth. It's going to have some genus, which you can certainly assume is greater than one if you take a sufficiently general, sufficiently ample. Sufficiently ample pencil situation. And a base point will give you a section if you want. P comes from a base point. In other words, you can put yourself in the nicest possible conditions with a curve where you have a curve with a rational point. And now, what happens here if you take the function field of c over the Field of C over the function field of P1. This is just the function field of S. So this Brouwer class we're studying over S, we can think of as a Brouwer class on this curve over this now non-algebraically closed. Yeah? So now we've got a curve, and so now we have the Art Deco couch that we can sit on of the moduli space being non-empty. This is the point. So now we can consider Can consider this moduli space, sure I called it what I called it so let's say C. C, the C is this gerb representing alpha. Okay, so it's a mu n gerb representing alpha. So now let's consider this stack of stable sheaves on curly C, stable twisted sheaves, N L, I don't know, N O of P, if you like. Now, when the degree of the determinant is relatively prime to n, it turns out this whole thing is just a mu integer. So, what is this? This is the stack of stable twisted sheaves, vector bundles on C of rank N and determinant O of P. All right. And here's a All right, and here's its course space, its cheapification. This thing is a mu n gerb. Now, this thing, let's just call this m and call this curly m so I don't have to write all this stuff. Did. What's the order? N is the period. Oh. And our goal by Colliotel N is find a vector bundle. Is find a vector bundle of rank n, twisted vector bundle, right? Thank you, yes. So we might as well take the space of all such things and see if it has a point, right? But here's the space of all such things. Well, they're stable, and there's some condition on the determinant. But more or less, this is all of them. Okay? Now, what do we know? We just saw that M tensor A of T bar is unirational, is rationally connected. With the geometry, this variety is very strong. Now, there's a theorem of Graeber Harris's star. Have you ever seen this theorem before? What does it say? It says that any rationally connected variety over such a field has a rational point. So any rationally connected X. X over say K of T, where K is K bar, has a rational point. It's not an easy theorem. It's an amazing, beautiful thing. The proof of it is intuitive, so to speak, but it's not easy. And so, what does that tell us? That tells us that M has a rational point, doesn't it? I mean, am I going insane? Is that what it tells us? Am I going insane what it tells us? Here we have a rationally connected variety. We've got this map from spec of K of T to M. And now we've got this mu n gerb. And what we want is a thing like this, right? What's the obstruction? The obstruction, so let's call this F, let's call this. The obstruction, so let's call this f, let's call this g, the obstruction of to making g is in h2 of this field spec of k of t with coefficients of mu n, which is the Brouwer group of k of t and torsion, which is zero by Zen's theorem. And so this implies that currently m of k of t is not equal to the empty set. And this implies that the index of alpha divides m. That's the proof of De Young's theorem. That's not De Young's proof of De Young's theorem. That's a different proof. His proof was different. This was one of the things that I did when I was young. Okay. I mean, my thesis was really focused on surfaces of... Was really focused on surfaces over finite fields. And the geometry of the modulic space of twisted sheaves on a surface is much more complicated. It has to sort of use its asymptotic properties and then understand varieties over finite fields and blah blah blah. But this was just one of the things that came out of those methods. So this is, I just want to tell you, this is a how, right? This is a how this kind of thing might be, might, might happen and might be true. Okay. Now I have like four more pages of notes. Which has like the main meat of what I wanted to explain. But I think I shouldn't. I think maybe I should just stop. I think at the beginning of next time, I'll state. So the point is that these spaces are twisted forms of the classical moduli spaces. And their rational point properties are essential for understanding from this point of view the period index problem. So there's a lot of natural questions that. So, there's a lot of natural questions that arise about the arithmetic properties of these spaces over other fields. Okay, and maybe I'll just start by stating a couple of those next time before I move on to the why portion of my so with that I will conclude. Uh any questions? Like a very important It seems like a very important week was fibring the rational thing. You fibered it. Yeah. Yeah. Turn the frown upside down. Sorry. It makes a smile. Yes. I guess that script does not tell you for right. Right, so you could ask, what about like higher rational connectivity for those spaces? I don't think we know that. I think Anna Maria Kostrovet thought about this in some other context. Yeah, it's rather obstrue. You might ask yourself, do these always have zero cycles of degree one? For example, the answer to that is no. I can show you an example if you want. They don't have zero cycles of degree one. So the real question is, what is the index of this variety? And this variety is a Galois twist by the Loyal spectral sequence or by something like that. spectral sequence or by something like that. This variety is a Galois twist of the classical one by a co-cycle valued in H1 of the Jacobina C bracket N. So you can make stupid bounds on the index of such a variety, but it depends on the genus of C, which is very bad, not just the dimension of the underlying variety you're talking about. So the question is, what is the index of such a thing? And this, I think, is related to, one way you could try to study is by studying like the chowering of this or the Galois action on the chowering of the classical space and trying to understand the full intersection theory. The full intersection theory. And one of the most interesting things that occurred to me over the last week is: how would you make a P1 in here? Or in the classical, the untwisted one. Like, concretely make some curves in the moduli space. I don't think anyone does this, but there have to be lots of them. Like, how would you make it? Well, you could try to make it as some vector bundle on C cross P1. But actually, if you only want to make a curve in the core space, you can't make it as a vector bundle because I'd be making a curve here, which you don't think you have. Which you don't think you have. So there's something very interesting. You know, there's examples of ORC, of like curves in the space of stable curves that don't lift to the stack. I think there could be some interesting thing here where there's like a similar question, like how do you make proper sub-varieties of the moduli space of stable vector? And more generally, how do you understand the intersection theory? If you take like the canonical class of this thing and you take its top-top intersection, that's calculation called the Verlinda formula. And I think what you see, although I don't really understand this, is that it's highly divisible by n. But it's highly divisible by n. It involves a genus. It's like a horrendous number. But there's a lot of other cohomologic classes on the moduli space. Like, I haven't tried to fully understand the intersection theory, but it'd be very interesting if the index maybe depended on n, but not on the genus. That seems very unlikely, though. Another question. So it seems like you're the onwards of this moduli space of kind of like what how it's do we use it? I mean, no, no, no, I was getting because of the part that I haven't described. If you take the Lyré spectral sequence, you take a Brouwer class, basically. Spectral sequence: You take a Brouwer class, basically, it boils down to like a Brouwer class in the base field, and then a class in H1 of back bracket N. And sort of what you see is it almost like modulo this thing that Bjorn pointed out, almost any twisted form of this thing is going to be one of those moduli spaces of twisted vector modules. It's almost the same thing. Yes. So in characteristic zero, that just happens. In characteristic P, you'd have to be more careful. But you can reduce the question to characteristic zero anyway, so you could just do the loosey-goosey version. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, in characteristic zero, yeah. Or depending on your definitions, in characteristic zero. Good, thank you. So at some point, So at some point you developed this theory of moduli. Yeah. Was there like no my motivation was actually to study the moduli-derived Azumaya algebras originally. And then like I went and I talked to Dan Abramovich. He's like this guy, I don't know, one of the guys in Japan, I can't remember who it was, Yoshi Yoko, maybe studied this thing. And then I was like, oh, there's just this general theory. And that's where that paper came from. But I just had the experiences with the drive draws in my algebra. Experiences with the drive drives in my algebra is just, yeah, it was not related to this. But you can like develop modular perfect. Sure, you can do the same thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, you can totally do it. But see, as we talked about yesterday, there's like always a perfect like, okay, you're absolutely right. And then you try to understand the rank problem there. And I haven't thought, that's a very good question, what you, what to do. I'm not sure. Yeah. So one last thing is this. Isn't there some results about the whole bunch now? Yeah, that sounds familiar. Yeah, that sounds right. Because like tensoring by, yeah, now if I try to remember it, I won't remember it out loud. Yeah. Yes, there is such a thing. The proof of this thing is by completely different methods. Different methods. So it would be interesting to understand what's really going on. Yeah, yeah. Because, of course, as I'm sure you know, like the you know, the deformation theory of C and the deformation theory of this space are the same. And there's like, you know, the Fourier-Makai transform computes the colonology back and forth. So it wouldn't be surprising if there's some way of conjugating those results. Yeah, good idea. Yeah? Yeah. So you, I mean, because you're working over an algebraically closed field, you could do something insane, like the following. Take your curve. You can just lift your curve to characteristic zero. Now take the generic point of the special fiber. Point of the special fiber. Think the hensalization. You can, even though, don't be afraid about P, you can lift the class to a class over that strictly insaling and local ring. Then that's a co-limit of a bunch of smooth whatever's. And you kind of just start pushing things down until you get some kind of weird curve and where you can make a specialization back to the generic point of the special fiber. It's like an, I wrote it out in a paper. I can send it. it out in in a paper i i i can send it to you but it's like not it's not a refined argument it's like it's brutal it's just it's like you know it's dirty but it just works it just works not it's dirty so so yeah so let me say two things first i can't remember now if i required the thing to be prime to the characteristic now i have to go back and look certainly if it's prime to the characteristic what i said definitely works when i said don't worry about Definitely works. When I said don't worry about P, I started worrying about P. So let's just think about prime. See, the thing is, at P, it's actually much easier because Vrobenius is a locally free map of a certain rank, and you can use that to kill P torgent classes. So you get something that's slightly wrong, but you still get some bound. I'd have to think about, I have to look at this paper I'm going to send you too. And yeah, it doesn't work in higher dimension, if I remember this right, because you can't lift. Of course, you can birationally lift anything. Well, let's look at the paper. Birationally lift anything. Well, let's look at the paper together. It's been 20 years. Yeah. Thank you for asking that. We'll sit down and look at it. Okay, if we have more questions for Max, I think.
