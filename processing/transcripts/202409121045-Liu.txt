Hello, this is Orbiter Free DFT conference. You're going to see my work actually. Okay, it's totally auto-something, right? That's just topic just too big. But you're going to see in my work, it's really related to orbital DFT. But before that happens, we need to step a little bit back. Need to step a little bit back so see the general picture, the big picture that we've been trying to do in the last 10 or so years. So this talk is basically based on this paper I was invited to write by ACS Physic Chemistry. So this is a special issue. So people in that place try to have a big picture of what it will look like in 2050. 50 in physical chemistry. So I provide a proposal: how do you improve the chemical understanding? Use all kinds of theoretical or computational methodologies, including wave function theory, density function theory, machine learning, and quantum computer. I hope my intention will be too sensitive, right? Because even though I use Because even though I use the machine learning and the quantum computer, especially quantum computers, because what I'm interested is really in the specific topic of how do we gain the insight about chemical reactivity. So even though this topic just looks too long and not good, but you're going to see it is relevant. So what is chemical understanding? So, what is the chemical understanding? So, since we are from the chemistry side, a lot of you from the physics side. So, I hope that the language barrier is not that high. But I don't have a very generally accepted definition. So, I talked to a few machines, different, yeah, different. Different AI has a little bit different answer. But I think they got the keyword right. Okay. So chemical understand is we try to understand, to comprehend the chemistry, including the behaviors of metal. Matter could be anything, right? Molecules, condensed phase, surfaces, process, etc. And also this behavior could be related to structure, property, right? Property, right? Reactivity, because chemistry is all related to the reaction, right? And also the, yeah, so just so basically the keywords look similar, but their answers apparently is different. Also, when we try to understand chemistry, one key component, I think, is the concept. There's this concept in chemistry like In chemistry, like acid or acidity or basicity, right? Aromaticity, anti-aromaticity. If I want to go on, I can next one be electrophilicity, nucleophilicity, etc. It becomes more and more complicated, but the idea is the same. We have the concept. So, this is what we're trying to understand using the computational. Using the computational or theoretical approach because those concepts are normally from the experiment, okay, or experience when they do experiments. So purely empirical. What do we formulate, if we can use the formulation formulas, to relate these concepts to Concepts to some kind of theory like a wave function theory or DFT or orbital free DFT, et cetera. Because that's something we can do as a computational chemist or as a serial chemist. That's what we've been trying to do. So using these chemical sets as the intermediate or just the platform, try to understand the chemistry. That's what we've been trying to do. So it looks like it's a building block or. Looks like it's a building block of understanding. There's so many kinds of concepts. So I'm sure you don't want to listen anymore. But theory, because I've been trained as a DFT guy. So since especially Bob Pa was the founding father of conceptual density function theory. Conceptual DFT, the main purpose of conceptual df. Main purpose of conceptual diabetes is to apply DFT understand chemistry, right? So, in that theory, you have, I don't know if you heard this before, you have hardness, softness, electrophilicity, chemical potential, ukule function, etc., etc. The list goes on and on. So, theory provides a unique opportunity for us to understand this concept. Concept well, if I was asked to give an example, the best example probably I, well, it's all from myself. It's from actually I Google. I found this is a very good example, atom, right? So atom is a is a concept, it's a chemistry concept proposed many, many years ago. So it just is, it's a, it's a composed of individual particles where In individual particles where determines everything we see in your daily life. That's all the fundamental particle from a chemistry point of view. Physics is a lot of different fundamental particles. That's 400 BC. And then in 1803, Dordan then proposed this modern atomic theory. So it has a fundamental weight, right? Fundamental weight, right? And then Thompson then did the experiment. So discover this the atom has an electron, right? And then the slide keeps on. Then you have this more experiment. Again, this is from experiment. Atom itself is not from theory at first. And then you have this stuff with this content theory, and then you have. Theory, and then you have this atom that has a shells, right? One s orbital, two s2p, right? This atomic shell. And then when we have the orbital, when we have the wave function theory, then we can really see all from a theoretical perspective, we can have this so-called atom symbolic theory, right? Theory, right? From the Milliken chart, based on this, they have Milliken charge, Herschel partition, and the beta theory, and even in 2000-Power theory. What do you understand atoms in the molecule? Okay. So those early days are all from experiments. So I try to understand what is the atom in Molecule look like. And then recently, see. Lastly, theory and the computation really provides a tool, a very concrete, accurate tool to quantify, to describe what the atoms look like, even in molecules. So quantum chemistry or theory provides really a good platform for us to fundamentally opportunity insight. Fundamentally, obtain the insight about the atomic behavior in molecules. Okay, that's our starting point. Otherwise, I don't stand here. And also could be used to predict the reactions. So this is in a modern computation chemistry, just a very routine, right? For a middle-sized molecule, we can compute anything, including the mechanisms, the rates, reaction rates. The rates, reaction rates, products, intermediates, et cetera, et cetera. Okay. So the theoretical frameworks so far we have. So we have a Wednesday-bond theory, that's in 1980 and 1920s, multi-orbital theory, that's 1950s. DFT, then it's about 1980. Well, the series starts from 1965, 1964, then becomes the mainstream. Uh, the mainstream 1980s, late 90s. So, we have different frameworks to understand or to compute anything related to the traditional chemical concepts. Okay, so this theory will provide a bridge with the insight for those chemical concepts. That's what we've been trained to do that. But that's also my interest. But that's also my interest in research. So, in the last maybe a few years, we'll be working on this, try to summarize the effort we've been putting together in last 20 or 10, 15 years. The first one is the concept of DFT. So, many of the audience, a few of them contribute to this book. So, it was published two years ago. Basically, since Bob Power passed. Basically, since Bob Power passed away in 2017, he had a strong wish because he was the founding father of this theory, but I regret that we never had such a book. So since his passing, we have a group of people beside Probably at the time. So we put out the book. Put out the book. So, this is a book has 32 chapters. So, basically, we invite all the people in the world. So, it's from 14 countries. So, this is true. It's a pretty sick book. And then, two years later, we found that DFT might not be enough. Well, DFT has its own issues when we deal some special chemical concepts. So, that's the reason why. Concepts. So that's the reason why I contacted the publisher and also a lot of authors. See if it's possible we expand our territory a little bit. So this one is only for DFT, but here this is for everything, including molecular orbital theory, whether it's bound theory, of course, DFT, conceptual DFT. Also, yeah, machine learning. We do have some chapters, two chapters for machine learning using all the techniques we have from theory or computer. We have from a theory or computation perspective to understand the concept. There's a new effort to try to use the computational ideas or theoretical formulations to understand the traditional chemical concepts. So that's a brief review what the wave function theory can provide with us with the on the chemical concept. On the chemical concepts. Because this slide summarizes just some very simply summarized the methodologies we have in ebonitial theory. So sometimes wave function theories are called eb initial theory, right? So you have two extreme cases, Haji-Fock. In this case, you only have one slider determinant. And then you have the Haji-Fock theory. And then the fourth CI, you have all the. You have all the possible slate determinants to approximate your wave function. So you have 4CR. So in between, you may have this variational, this perturbation approach to go from here to here or another way around. And then another special case is the semi-pirical method. In this case, you still use one static determinant to approximate the total wave function. And then in that case, you introduce many and periodic. Case you introduce many empirical parameters to simplify calculation. That's a special case of the hodgebox theory. And then the concept from the wave function theory, this is pretty well established, like Fukui function, right? This Huku is frontier molecular theory. And also the Odawan Hufma rules. So these two theory was You know, was recognized in 1982 by a Chemistry Nobel Prize. Also, related to the wave function theory is the bound, right, charge, exile states, etc., etc. So in wave function theory, we do have a lot of understanding about chemical concepts. It also introduces a lot of new other ideas from this wave function theory. And then in DFT, of course, in this. In DFT, of course, in this community, in this audience, I don't need to talk about this DFT or Orbit-free DFT, but I do in about 2007, I propose a little bit different implementation of orbital. This idea is about new. What I did is this, you just introduce a physical chemistry effects, try to represent this total energy. try to represent this total energy in this case you the total energy is uh coming from uh coming from three physical effects what it calls steric electrostatic and the quantum okay so that's the key idea of this work so and then uh with a simple plus minus then you can you can come up uh with this um uh this uh steric effect is the just with that kinetic energy That kinetic energy. That's the main idea of this work. And then you have this orbit-free DFT neural equation. The concepts, framework in DFT, as always we summarized in the book, also in this review article, two years ago. And then we found at least four ways we can do that in terms of orbit-free. Orbit-free or density-based. Looks to me, these two words are just have the same meaning. Orbit-free or density-based. When it's called orbit-free DFT, that's what we're talking about. Yeah. And then you have conceptual DFT. And then you have, you borrow the ideas from information theory, because information theory, you have shin entropy, feature information, all those quantities has no orbital, right? They have no orbital. They have no orbitals. They're all density-based. Or just direct the use of density-related stuff, like what beta did, which the gradient of density to partition the atoms in molecules or some other properties or quantities. Okay? So, in that book, and in that paper. And in the paper, so we propose that at least to understand the reactivity using density-based idea, we have four pathways. So this is orbital-free DFT. This is what we are concerned in this conference. And then this is a conceptual DFT information theory, and then that is direct use of density-related stuff. So I told you before I get started, my work is related. My work is related to Orbit-free DFT because I do use the quantities from Obit-free DFT to appreciate chemistry, to appreciate chemical concepts. Just that my way is a little bit different from what you guys have been doing. Okay. So, concepts from the concept of the anonymity dig up a little bit. Up a little bit, yeah. This book I taught you already. So, in the concept of DFT, as uh, as proposed, was proposed by Baba many years ago, is the following. So, the total energy of the system is excess two variable function L, because this is the excess potential from the atomic nuclear or g of the molecule, and then the total number of electrons, okay. the total number of electrons okay so that's the that's the that's the uh quantity uh we're concerned in conceptual dft but in dft we know there's a one-to-one correspondence between the density and one state density and action potential that's a little bit different so this is a little bit more general case but we do introduce the approximation because anything related to chemical process if there is a chemical reaction or conformation change Or conformation change or whatever, like the acidic or the acid, etc. I have an example later. Then, anything related to change of this number of electrons or extra potential, then you have a title expansion. So, this is just perturbation, not a totally something different. It's a perturbation, okay? So, of course, to have this target expansion, I have to assume that the derivative is also all. Without all the existence on the web behavior of these derivatives, because the title series is really like this, it looks so messy, right? You have first order, first order derivatives, second order quantities. And also in this first order, you have this function, this derivative, this function of derivatives. Okay, it looks very messy. What's the major contribution of the concept of divided from Boppa and From Bob Paul and his co-workers, is giving those derivatives a physical chemistry meaning. It means, for example, in this case, the first law derivative of total energy with respect to the number of electrons is just the electric negativity or chemical potential. Okay. And the second order derivatives is the hardness, isophaness. Hardeness is one of the more important. Is one of the more very important concepts, especially in organic chemistry, they have a hardened soft acid-base principle. So we're just trying to formulate this hardness using a using using this formula. Okay. And then this term, this is the cross term of this second order array for derivatives, is the we call Huku function. call Fuku function. Fuku function. Fuku, you remember the Fuku theory from molecular orbital theory? So in this case, you have a homonumo. All these chemistry, important chemical processes are determined by the homonumo. That's the orbital orbital-based theory. But here, it's the density-based or orbital-free version. We're still able to recover the hookup theory because Hookie theory because this function, if you do this, because this is a derivative, right? But if you do this with the orbital, because this density is a very summation of all the orbital and orbital densities, right? So if you change your number of electrons, if you donate electrons, this is just a HOMO. If you accept the electrons, it's just a NUMO. So basically, This is a noumo. So basically, this is the approximate version of this formula is just a homo normal. Okay, so this is exactly reason why Weitao and Pa published a paper in 1986, I think, right? They call this Hook function. So basically, this is the DFT version of the frontier orbital theory. And then using the Using the all the orbital-based, I think my cooperator, Professor Yong, talked about this on Tuesday. So using all the density-based idea or orbital-free version, we're able to identify all kinds of interactions. So for the strong interactions, we're talking about the chemical bonding, double bond, triple bond, quadruple bond, five bond, six bond. Okay, that's the strongest bonus you can get. That's the strongest tones you can get, and then the weak interactions, like a one-wise interaction, like um I don't know, ionic, no, ionic, it's not weak, but uh weak interactions, okay. Here, you don't have orbital, it's orbital-free, but still we're able to to identify at least to describe so far. We don't have this, uh, we cannot quantify. Don't have this, we cannot quantify yet. It's only for the identification. Like this is what Weitao and Julia, right? He did many years ago, not many years ago, 15 years ago, right? It's about NCI, this guy is a density gradient divided by density to the fourth. And then about two years ago, we provide another extreme case. This is for spread. Case this is for strongly covalent system, like a three or four bones, or a double bone, or triple bone, or quadruple bones, using a very similar, but little bit different. This is the plushie. Here it's then the green. Here you divide this, you use a different numbers, but we just make this dimensionless. Okay, the reason why I put in a different number here is for the dimensionless because Laplacian and they have a different. And they have a different dimension. Also, this one, for example, this is the new one we proposed. So it could identify both weak interaction and the strong one. Of course, not the strongest one. So this is this guy. So basically, this is the you have the kinetic energy density and this is with that kinetic energy density divided by the withdrawal kinetic energy density. So normally when you So normally, when in the multi-orbital theory, you can use the orbital overlap to divide different bones or use noise electron share idea. But use the orbital overlap. You cannot describe weak theory like on weak interaction, like one wise interaction, right? You have to, because one wise. You have to, because one-wise interaction normally is related to the random force or some other interactions. You don't have orbital in this case. But here, we use this orbital-based orbital free-based orbital free or density-based idea. We can do both simultaneously. Okay. I think that's the benefit of using density-based quantities to this. Based quantities to describe different kinds of interactions. So, this is about the interactions. Then, about the reactivity. So, when we talk about the reactivity, then I have this regional selectivity. So, this property determines which atom in your molecule, you have many atoms, right, in your molecule, which atom is more active. So, what do we use? We use this called information. Call information gain, so it's all density-based, or it's a first-order approximation, which is a Husserl charge. So, Herschwald charge itself could be used to quantify stereoselectivity. When related to this curl, so when the chemical reaction takes Um, text space. I have an example somewhere, it's hard to tell in terms of uh words, but I do have examples. Okay, then you have a different way, use the steric effect, okay? This is what we proposed many years ago, uh, 17 years ago. So, use this formula, very simple one. It's again, it's orbit-free, there is orbit-free DLPT. Okay, so these are the quantities we've been used, and then. And then I think also these tables have been this results have been shown before. So, using this information or this all density based and orbital-free idea or this simple host per charge. So, for this guys, there is an experimental scale I will call electrophilicity. Electrophilicity is a property to measure, to quantify. To measure, to quantify the capability of atoms to accept electrons. So electron-like, so electron felicity. So you have a strong, this experiment, this is our theory. So we got a very strong correlation. On the other hand, for those other molecules, so this is called nuclear felicity. So this is the electron donor. So that was the former former. Though the former former slide is electron acceptor, this one is electron donation. So, again, there is electron, there is an experimental scale for these guys, and then this is a theory. So, we use the same formula. We can measure both, both electron donation or electron acceptance. So, again, you can see for this systems, there's a strong correlation between experiment and the theory. Okay, so again. Okay, again, this is Opito-free DFT, because this is an Opito Free conference. So I have to really emphasize my work is related to orbital free. But personally, I like density-based better than orbital free. Anyhow, this is the new work we just published, PCTP. So in this case, for the steric, for the steric effect, so there is Steric effect. So there is also experimental scale. Okay, so this is an experimental scale. And this experimental scale was determined by this hydrolysis reaction. So you have a given R, then you measure the reaction rate of this reaction, and then you get this experimental scale. So this is our theory, this experiment. We got a very nice correlation. Plus, we have not only for. Plus, we have not only for the steric effects, steric energy, we can also do steric charge, steric potential, steric force, etc. They're all related very strongly. And then sterosynectivity is another property. In this case, the chemical reaction could be happening on this side or this side. So it all depends on the nature of this. On the nature of this ligand, on the CR for carbon. L means much group, medium group, small group, then you have different trends. So this trend could be predicted by the steric related quantity we introduced. So I mentioned this already. So this is the current status of what we think this density-based reactivity series is about. Activity series about so it has four platforms and then being used uh applied to uh a few um a few applications i don't i don't have time to talk some of them only but uh the the other applications also okay yeah how many more minutes i have zero so this means i can i don't talk i can skip these slides Yes, Jan, you are doing this. You are very bad if you think it's helpful to be fine. Just a logical product. But to me, that's good news because I don't have time left so that I can talk very quickly about this sensitive topics. I'm not supposed to talk. Then, machine learning, right? We know this in machine learning have majorly three different kinds of methodology. Supervised learning, that's what we many of you, most of you, talking about. So when we're talking about machine learning, this is supervised learning, but there's another super unsupervised and reinforced learning. And reinforced learning. I do have some examples here. Okay, I can quickly go through these slides. And then in machine learning, it's been in that if you read the recent literature, a lot of papers on machine learning in chemistry and also very different kinds of topics. But I think there's a major change of the data set. Change of these data set quality interpret interpretability. That's what I mean because you get all kinds, hundreds, thousands of descriptors. Yeah, it don't have any meaning. Okay. And also the transferability. So you have a particular, particular model, machine model, machine learning model, but this particular problem, and then it's not transferable to other systems. Anyhow, so these are the current status of machine learning. are the current status of machine learning chemistry then there is a high technology hype so i i think many of you know this so this is what not from me uh it's from the uh uh website so the machine learning right now is here okay it's in in the peak on the peak so looks uh looks like it's very very promising but uh in next few years probably we're gonna see a a different direction and A different direction and then gradually picks up. Okay. And then this is the quantum computer. I'll talk a little bit later. So it's still climbing. Okay. Those are the status of this new technologies, new approaches, I would say. And then this is one slide about the quantum computer. So in the last few years, last three years, I've been offering seminars and training courses. Seminars and training courses at the UNC about this quantum computer. So, I'm not, my research is not involved in any way about the quantum computer, but my background is content. So, it's pretty straightforward for me to pick up. Plus, at the research triangle, we have a very big group of this technology. So, this is the reason why I've been involved. I'm representing the UNC on auto-reaching. On outreach to educating our users, educating our people with this new technology. And this is the status of chemistry using quantum computer. So these are the big systems we can do right now with the quantum computer. So each time you have some new technology, you can publish a natural science paper. But we're still far away from what we can do with real chemistry. But the real chemistry problems. By the way, the methodology we use for the molecules, we call WQE. It's a mixture. It's a half-breed of quantum commuter and cardiac commute. So my recent work on this two guys. So this is the paper Dongbo talked about yesterday. So we have a trying to use AI. We have trying to use AI and the information theory as a descriptor, and then combine with the fragment-based idea to do machine learning for these two properties. And then we had a chapter in the book, in the second book that I mentioned. This is using the interpretive machine learning models to predict different properties like spectroscopy, catalysis. Like spectroscopy, catalysis, and reaction. And also, this is paper just mentioned. So, I was invited to write this article. And then, how do you make this explainable AI? I have some points here, but I don't think I don't want to spend too much time here. So, the key idea from this paper is the following. So, traditionally, we have multi-scale modeling. Okay, you have time. Scale modeling. Okay, you have time x-axis is a space, right? You have different space scale, and then you have time scale. So for the quantum systems, for the microscopic systems, you use the quantum, right? For the microscope, you use the classical mechanics. And then in between, you have this QMMM. So that's the multi-scale modeling. And then in this paper, we've proposed that. In this paper, we've proposed that besides computation, it's all related to computation, right? Then there is understanding, also, because even though you can't compute all the energy or the properties, you don't get understanding. Understand like acidity, aromaticity, electrophilicity. This understanding cannot be directly obtained from this computation axis. So I propose, well, we need to understand it. And then. And then a different theory, like a wave function theory, you have mapping, you have a chemical space to the property space through this orbitals, right? In DFT, you do this mapping. That'd be a good idea. Yeah. Part two or part one. Let me see. I have only how many slides? I have only five maths. Sorry, I intend to be 25 minutes. Now it became 40 minutes. Okay. So this means that we Okay, that's a good idea. I should do next, but anyway, so I'll finish. I have only five slides left. Okay. So the mapping, right? This is your multi-orbital theory. You have this mapping, you have orbitals. And what is the mapping is the density. And then for the machine learning, the mapping is through the descriptors. So the key idea of understanding is. Of to understanding is to you know, in the Morgan operator theory use of the homonymal, right? Here, we what the DFT, as we talked about, uses the density-related stuff. So, I think I propose we use the descriptors to do that in the machine learning model. So, this is the this is the way I propose how to use the different descriptor to improve the understanding. Improve the understanding. Basically, use different. So in the wave function theory, use orbital, density, DFT, use the density, and then, yeah, these qubits use the descriptors. You do this mapping, you understand different problems. And then the key take-home message from this paper is called, I will propose today called I will propose today called hierarchical modeling compared to the scale multi-scale modeling. So instead of the scale modeling, you can combine this all together. It combines it all together using this machine learning and the quantum computer. So that's the key idea from this work. And then how do we alternate the camera understanding? So in DFT, we use the orbital. So, in DFT, we use the orbital-based density-based quantities, right? It's orbital-based. And then in machine learning, use the immune learning use descriptors. And then for the quantum computers, use the qubits. So this idea, how do you gain the chemical understanding? So, yeah, I'm done. Thank you.
