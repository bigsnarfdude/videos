Thanks to the organisers for inviting me to this meeting. It's been really interesting and very broad and very relevant for me. So my name's Edward File. I'm at the University of Bath over in the west of England. This is a picture of the beautiful city of Georgian city of Bath in the middle. And here is our lovely new Middle, and here is our lovely new center of evolution, which opened just a couple of years ago. So, I'm going to be talking mostly today about a big consortium project that I've been coordinating called SPARC, which was funded on the JPIAMR initiative, which is just coming to the end now. So, the project ends at Christmas. So, we're at the business end of the project. We've got all the data and the main paper is almost. And the main paper is almost ready to roll, and I'll really be describing the main results that will be in that primary paper from that project. So this funding call was really motivated by this question of One Health and in particular the transmission of AMR antimicrobial resistance within environmental settings. So One Health has been alluded to a couple of times in this work. Couple of times in this workshop. So it really refers to the intersection of the three different main spheres where antimicrobial resistance is found and possibly spreading. So the human sphere, the environment, the broader environment, the plants, the rivers, the soil, and the animals. That includes both livestock and wild animals as well. So it's a concept that has evolved. It's a concept that has evolved from the one medicine concept, and it's really sort of come into its own with respect to antimicrobial resistance. So, whenever you see a one health paper, particularly there's lots of very good reviews out there, it's almost certain that you'll find a figure like this, which depicts all the different compartments where we might find antimicrobial resistance genes or strains. Resistance genes or strains, and all the potential routes between them. So there's lots of arrows connecting the livestock, to the wildlife, to the wastewater, to the clinic, to the people. And it's very difficult to understand exactly which of these routes are important when it comes to public health. And it's not even very clear what it is that we're supposed to be tracking. We've already heard earlier today from Santiago, his nice work on Asenin. Santiago, his nice work on acanita bacteria that it's actually he finds that it's the spread of the resistance genes through mobile elements that's that's more pertinent than the actual spread of the clones themselves. So this is a basic problem. So it's a very multi-layered, multi-dimensional problem, which is often oversimplified actually as a one health problem. It deals with lots of different problems and questions on lots of different levels. Of different levels. So, my pet bug genus that I've been working on during this SPARC project is Klebsiella. This is a member of the Enterobacteriaceae, so it's related to E. coli, Shigella, Yosinia. It hitherto contains about 15 species. It's grown a little bit during the course of this project, as we will see. The most notorious, well-known species in this genus is. Well-known species in this genus is Klebsiella pneumoniae, shortened to Kp, which has become within the last 10-15 years one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired resistant infections and neonatal sepsis. There's a wide range of symptoms, pneumonia, soft tissue, and urinary tracts infections. There's also a lot of very nasty community-acquired infections, which lead to pyogenic liver abscesses. Pyogenic liver abscesses and other nasty diseases. So it's also very important as a commercial pathogen in livestock. It's a major agent of bovine mastitis. And this reflects the fact that actually Klebsiella pneumoniae and other species, other Klebsiella species, are very diverse in terms of their ecology. So they're entric, so they live in the guts of a fairly high proportion of. A fairly high proportion of the population completely blamelessly without causing any symptoms. They also live in the guts of other animals, but they live in the rivers and the soil and on the plants. So they're very, very diverse. So it's like a quintessential one health pathogen, if you like. And this ecological diversity, of course, reflects a great biological, genetic, genomic diversity. They have an open path. They had an open pangenome, as we shall see, of many tens of thousands of genes. So, in terms of resistance, this is really why there's such a problem in terms of the healthcare settings. They've picked up resistance to beta-lactamases, these extended spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitors, CTXM, SHV, and TEM, but they're also becoming very rapidly. Becoming very rapidly resistant to the carbapenems, which are broadly among the last resort drugs used to treat enterobacteriosa infection. So whereas previously a urinary tract infection may be cleared up within a couple of weeks or so, now we're seeing a massive increase in chronic UTIs worldwide due to these carbapenem non-susceptible infections. So there's a number of different genes which gene Different genes, which gene families, which encode carbapenemases, which munch up these carbapenin antibiotics. And in terms for Klepsiella pneumoniae, which remember is the most important species in this regard, these carbapenamase coding genes tend to be associated with particular clonal lineages which circulate within and between hospitals. Within and between hospitals. So the so-called ST258, ST101, ST307, etc. And there are other ways by which carbapenam resistance can be conferred, but these carbapenamase genes are the main way. So we know quite a lot about the virulence of this bug as well, Klebsiella pneumonia. There's been lots of very nice GWAS work done by, in particular, by Pat Holt and her group, but also. Holt and her group, but also other research groups as well, have identified these siderophores, these complicated, expensive molecules which are excreted outside of the cell, into the environment, which bind to iron and then are picked up by other cells. So the iron sequesters and irons are critical for pathogenicity. So these are very important virulence factors. There's other virulence factors. There's other virulence factors as well, which cause upregulate capsule production. And there's well-known hypervirulent lineages, particularly that circulate in the community rather than in hospitals, which contain all of these siderophores and these hypermucoid genes as well. And essentially, it's an additive effect. So the more of these virulence genes you have, the more virulent the bug is. So, this was a very nice review that came out at the end of last year. It was almost a year old now. So, it's looking at these carbapenamase genes, which aren't restricted to Klebsiella. They're in lots of Enterobacteriacy. And they've been found in lots of different settings in wildlife, in agriculture, in food animals, in wastewater. So, they're definitely out there in the environment. However, this report also states that. Also states that this has probably changed now in the last year, but they could only report two unequivocal cases whereby there's actually been infections by these carbabenamase-resistant enterobacteriaceae from environmental sources. So we know that these genes are out there in the environment, but what isn't so clear is actually how to gauge the risk to public health. So this is just So, this is just a very quick heads-up of a paper which is currently in the final stages, hopefully, the final stages of revision for microbial genomics. So, this was a study that we carried out locally in Bath looking at different Klebsiella isolates from the drains of the local hospital. This is the blue square here, and also from influent to the wastewater treatment plant which serves that hospital, which is. Treatment plant which serves that hospital, which is about 10 kilometers or about six miles downstream. And within the hospital wastewater, we found an awful lot of the OXA48 genes, which is one of these carbapenamate genes, even though we didn't select for carbapenam non-susceptibility. But by the time that the waste had gone through these 10 kilometres of pipe to the influence, it was still untreated. There was only one. There was only one instance left of the strain which carried this plasmid. So it's definitely there, at least in healthcare settings, but how far it penetrates into the environment, at least locally, is still unclear. There's another study that I was lucky enough to be involved in. This is Sophia David, who did this work. And the point of this study was really to show, or the take-home message of this study was to show that actually these clones, plebsiella pneumoniae, which harbor these. Pneumoniae, which harbor these carbapenamase genes, they really are primarily spread within and between hospitals. And we know that because if you, this is a big study, over 1,500 Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence from all over Europe. And if you look at the data, you take a particular isolate and you identify the nearest neighbor genomically to that isolate. If it's a resistant isolate, then it's far more likely that its nearest neighbour. Far more likely that its nearest neighbour will be from the same hospital than if it was a susceptible isolate. And this effect carries on as you increase the geographic scale up to the point where you're looking at hospitals more than 300 kilometers apart. So this was taken as evidence that really the resistant clones have quite a different epidemiology than the susceptible clones in that they really do seem to be spread within and between. Spread within and between healthcare settings. So, now the SPARC project. So, there's lots of different aims here. We're looking at the overall genus, not just Klebsiella pneumoniae. We're looking at horizontal gene transfer. We're generating long-read data to look at plasmids. But one of the things that gets me out of bed in the morning is to try and figure out what the adaptive relevance of this very diverse accessory genome is. This very diverse accessory genome is. It seems intuitively likely that having all this massive amount of diversity in the accessory genome has some relevance with respect to the ecological diversity. So in other words, that these genes are adaptive in some way. And of course, we're also looking at the more public health-oriented aspect of how these different strains might be transmitted. Might be transmitting, migrating between the different settings in the environment, and whether we can gauge individual, make individual risk assessments for different environmental settings in terms of how important they are in terms of public health, in terms of acting as a reservoir for resistance, and in terms of the likelihood that AMR, important AMR strains, will spread from those settings into the clinical or into the To into the clinical or into the community. So these two perspectives are actually linked. And the way I'm thinking about this is to say, okay, so if the accessory genome really does reflect a very broad ecology of the bacteria, that suggests that there's a very, very rugged selective landscape, that species on subspecies lineages are adapted to different niches. Adapted to different niches, and that may, in turn, of course, mitigate how well different strains can spread between different settings. If you there may be ample opportunity to move from a cow into a human, but if that strain is adapted to a cow and it finds itself in a human, then you can imagine that it's easily going to be out-competed by the resident flora. So, key to this study was the sampling. So, in order to maximize the chances that In order to maximise the chances of finding transmission, we restricted the sample as far as possible, both in terms of geography and in terms of temporal spread. So the whole sampling was focused around a single town in northern Italy called Pavia, where we took over 6,500 samples from all sorts of different settings, which I'll explain in a moment, all within a 15-month window between July 2017 and October 2018. October 2018. The other important point is that the sampling was completely agnostic with respect to the particular species that we were interested in. We selected for Klebsiella using selective media and took advantage of the fact that all Klebsiella are intrinsically resistant to ampicillin. So we had ampicillin in the media as a selective marker. But we weren't interested in any other, in selecting for any other types of resistance, and we weren't interested in selecting for a weren't interested in selecting for a particular Klebsiella species. The other point of this picking this particular spot in northern Italy is that northern Italy is a hot spot for carbapenamase producing Klebsiella pneumonia, in particular the gene KPC, one of the important carbapenamase genes. This is really prevalent in the hospitals of the area. So he wanted to know if this, to what extent these clones had sort of filtered These clones had sort of filtered out into the environment. So, this just gives you an idea of the sampling. So, everything's geotagged. We've got antibiotic phenotypic resistance data for all of the isolates. They come from all different sources, the river, the hospital, turtles living in the river, companion animals, wild animals, flies, plants, lots of environmental surfaces. We even took a sample from the holy water in the cathedral, which turned out to be negative. out to be negative um but we really sort of uh went to town as it were on on sampling as many different environmental uh uh uh uh surfaces and sites as we put as we could so we uh ended up sequencing almost 3500 isolates um relatively evenly split between humans animals and the environment slightly more humans because we piggybacked on ongoing surveillance studies in humans that uh from the hospital settings um the hospital settings um so we had slightly more from from those clinical of those clinical isolates um and this is figure one um which has a phenomenal amount of information on it but basically this is the the tree this is the tree drawn a different way so we have these four main species groups um the grey uh bars here represent uh these are all the ones from humans the pink these pinky colours are all the ones from other mammals which is mostly cows these are all the clevsiella These are all the Klebsiella pneumoniae. So you can see that actually there's blocks of purple and blocks of grey. So there are distinct clones which are in animals and distinct clones which are in humans. We can see in the other species here, there's lots of other colours which reflect the other settings. So just looking at the actual numbers, these are the species down the side here, which are given these abbreviations and these are all the different sources. Are all the different sources? So that Klebsiella pneumonia, as expected, is enriched. So red is enriched, blue is significantly underrepresented in those settings. So we have Klebsiella pneumonia, not surprisingly, enriched in humans and in cows. This species group, which was called the Rautella, but we're assimilating it back into the Klebsiella because there's no phylogenetic reason for it to be a different genus, are associated with the plants and the soil. Associated with the plants and the soil. What wasn't known is that this other species, group of related species here, are enriched, looks as though they're enriched in invertebrates. So there's plenty of evidence for non-random distribution of the different species. Interestingly, this is Klebsiella mitchia bonensis, which turned out to be enriched in hospital carriage and also in hospital disease as well, which hasn't been described before. We can look at the overall sort of diversity and Sort of diversity and population structure of the different species. So, this is these violin plots show that about 1% divergence. Most trees are these sort of bushy-like structures of an average of about 1% divergence. So, if anyone can tell me what's special about 1% divergence, please do email me. We have another little pink at the bottom here, which is the individual clonal lineages. And some of the species, of course, we see. And some of the species, of course, we see much more structure. So it looks as though they're on their way to speciating into separate clays, separate species. We used pop punk to quickly define subspecies lineages, which were roughly equivalent to STs, because not all the species have MNST schemes. So then we could broadly describe the population structure of each of the different species. Devsiella ornitholitica is very bushy. Very bushy, the least clonal species. And then, of course, we could do the same thing on a sub-species level. And indeed, we find this Clebsiella pneumoniae. Some clones are enriched in humans, some clones are enriched in cows. So they're a non-overlapping set of lineages associated with different niches. This is the Clevesiella grimontii, a particular clone which is associated with invertebrates, and this isn't just down to one clone all spread within one. To one clonal spread within one fly, this is lots of different flies from lots of different regions. So, this SC1 in particular seems to be associated with invertebrates. When we look at Klebsiella Mitchiganensis, there's no one clone which is associated with hospital carriage or hospital disease. That seems to be the whole species, which is kind of interesting. If we look at resistance genes, this is the distribution of resistance genes, different species, different settings, then most of them are. Then, most of them are very low-level resistance. There are no carbapenamase genes at all outside of healthcare settings, even in clevsiella pneumoniae, which was a surprise to us. The ASVLs outside of healthcare settings were mostly restricted to clevsiella pneumoniae. If we look at virulence genes, Ornitholitica contains, has acquired this Yosiniobactin virulence. This Yersinia bactin virulence lockers as almost like a core gene, which was a surprise to us. We don't really know what it's doing there. And there are other virulence genes in clevsiella pneumonia associated with pigs. I'll come very quickly onto the transmission. So we automated the, rather than going through the tree individually identifying all the individual transmission events, we built a pipeline whereby we took clusters defined by a threshold of 20 sniffs. Defined by a threshold of 20 SNPs, and then took all cases where within that cluster there was more than one isolates from more than one setting. And that allowed us to build up a matrix of all the different number of transmission events from one setting to another, which we analyzed with various permutation tests. So we can see there's actually the network is split up into there's a farm-like network here, and there's a hospital-like network here. There's some evidence. Here, there's some evidence that companion animals are linked with hospitals, and indeed that they do appear to be a bit of a risk. So, we then took, I'm not numerous, so I'm not going to try and explain this model. I haven't got time anyway, but there was an intervention model based on that transmission matrix, whereby you basically take one of the nodes out of the network and then see what happens to the number of cases of transmission with respect to hospital human disease. Human disease. And the take-home message there is that almost all cases of human hospital disease are acquired from other humans. So the combined effects of all the sources from the environment and all the sources from all the animals doesn't come anywhere near reaching the input you get from other humans. So this is really confirming that almost all of the transmission into humans is from other humans, and there's not very much transmission from any of these other sources. I'll skip that. I'll skip that bit of gratuitous pangenome. And this is just a final slide showing that we looked at the accessory genome and found that if you took, say, for a given level of core distance, very, very short level of core distance, like within an ST, then isolates a pair of isolates from the same source are going to have a much more similar accessory gene content than isolates from different sources. Content than isolates from different sources. So we're controlling for overall genetic distance and just saying that isolates within the same source have a much more similar accessory genome than isolates from different sources. And this supports the basic hypothesis that accessory genes are indeed important for adaptation. And I've gone slightly over, apologies for that. So summary, loads of diversity in Klebsiella. We've actually I skipped over, we found four new species. Four new species. So it's a case of sequences shell finds there's lots more species out there. We have looked from the distribution patterns, it certainly fits the fantastic bar speckling hypothesis that everything is everywhere, but that but in that adage is very important, the environment selects. And the example there was the very clear difference between the bovine and the human lineages. We don't see much AMI. We don't see much AMR, high levels of AMR outside of the hospital settings. We find that most transmission into humans is from other humans, companion animals, and water possibly pose relatively high risk. And we also find that accessory genome is having a bearing on local adaptation. So, all this, when you put all this together and you consider the One Health concept, I suggest that we. I suggest that we are maybe shooting myself in the foot with regard to funding here, but we need to weigh One Health strategies fairly carefully against more targeted AMR management priorities within communities and within healthcare settings. And that just leads me to show you the acknowledgements, all the lovely people on the SPARC project and some other people I've worked with in Bath and Hayo, who's a long-standing collaborator as well. Thank you very much. Yeah, thank you very much. That was interesting. And a lot of information. So, whenever I had a question, you answered it in the next slide, actually. So, are there any questions? So, when you collaborate with the hospitals, how cooperative are they to basically give away their Basically, give away their resistance strains, right? Because this is a problem for each hospital. Whenever you talk to a hospital, of course, they don't want to have these kinds of strains in their hospital, right? So was it easy to share the data? Yeah, it was actually. So as I said, we piggybacked off ongoing sort of surveillance projects that were going on in that region at the time. So there's five different hospitals in. The time. So there's five different hospitals in this city, and they were collecting these anyway. So we said, Look, can we sequence them and we can collaborate with the data? And they were more than happy actually to collaborate. This was all done on a local level. So our main guy in Pavia, David Cesara, knows the people in the hospital very well. So obviously, those personal relationships are very important. I don't know them that well. So That well. So, but as far as I'm aware, that worked fine. Also, worked a long time with Hayer Grumman, who's a clinician, but he has fantastic contacts, built these brilliant collaborative networks all over Europe, persuaded hundreds of reference laboratories linked to different hospitals throughout Europe to contribute strains to these big continent-wide surveys. Surveys, which are really amazing. I'm a real logistical triumph, actually. So I've been very lucky. I'm sort of one step back, if you like, from that immediate collaboration with the clinicians, but I know some clinicians who are very, very willing to help. So I know it can be a problem. Okay. So here's another question. Do you think wastewater sampling or patient, including veterinary patient sampling, is more reliable method? Sampling is a more reliable method for surveillance, specifically for IMR. If you could, if you could only do one more, yeah, okay. Please go ahead. Well, there's a I don't know what we'll compare it, more reliable than what. I don't know. So it's certainly very powerful. And we haven't actually included any wastewater in the SPART project, which is which is a bit of a gap. And it can tell you a lot of information. So what we didn't, we were very surprised that the study. We were very surprised. The study I mentioned right at the start, which was carried out in Bath with the hospital wastewater in Bath, we found all this OXA48. And it's interesting because the hospital hadn't reported a problem with carbapenamase, carbapenam non-susceptible isolates at all. So we don't actually know for certain that those isolates were circulating in the hospital. So there's antibiotics, there's antibiotics in the water. Antibiotics in the water. So it could be that actually that's enough to sustain that population of carbapen and non-susceptible isolates in the water. It's nothing to do with the hospital. It's just that they're hanging out in the drains there because there's antibiotics there. Because OXIF48 actually encodes quite a sort of stealthy carbapenamase gene. It encodes quite low-level resistance. I mean, that's a formal possibility. We don't know. But certainly, in general terms, wastewater. Certainly, in general terms, wastewater is a really, really fantastic, very powerful place. I mean, I'm doing a lot of work on wastewater with COVID, like a lot of other people. So, yeah, it's a very powerful sample. And you mentioned the long read sequencing and the plasmid sequencing. So, did you look at the plasmids? Yeah, so that was a casualty of COVID. So, that was all ready to go. We had Was all ready to go. Um, we had all the strains ready to send to the Sanger Institute where all the sequencing's been done, and then they stopped taking strains because they were they put all the machines over to sequencing COVID. So, and it's just getting going again. We're getting them sequenced somewhere else. We've got about a hundred, we're planning to do about six hundred. Um, and we've got a third lot of data actually, which we've got complete, which I didn't talk about, which was which we've got about a thousand plate sweeps. We've got about a thousand plate sweeps. So rather than pick individual colonies and sequence the genome, we also took all the colonies on the plate from each of these samples and sequence them on mass. So that would be great for the sort of thing that Leonard was talking about, where you can actually, the idea is there to pick out individual genes which are enriched in particular settings and also tells us something about the interactions within a community within particular settings as well. So that's the third lot of data that we've got from this project. Okay, and then last question: Do you think the one health paradigm is more relevant in low or middle income countries, e.g., yeah, yeah. So, so this, I should have said that. So, this absolutely where I'm slightly sort of pouring not cold water, but slightly tepid water on One Health. This is very much for this kind of setting. And this is the classic One Health paradox, actually, that in those. One Health paradox, actually, that in those settings which have the least resources to build the kind of One Health surveillance that you need, are those settings that you have the most contact with animals, and those are also the settings with the lowest resources. So, that's the sort of catch-22 of One Health, where it's most needed is where it's most difficult to apply. So, absolutely, I'll take that point. So, absolutely, I take that point that in different settings, it's going to be probably quite a different picture. Okay, thank you very much. So, thanks again, all speakers of this session. And we have a discussion now, round of discussions in the breakout rooms. And as usual, the speakers will be available in the order as they appeared. So, just go to the corresponding breakout room. Corresponding breakout room. Okay, thank you very much.
