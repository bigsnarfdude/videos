Very nice and interesting uh uh work so far. Uh so I will speak about the friction at the base of glacier at various and uh in fact it will be not so various because it will be too scales. Uh so I will so there will be two parts to the two different parts in my talk. The first part I will try to to show how we can infer the form of the friction law by The form of the friction law by doing some modeling at a very small scale. I will tell it the micro mesoscale, which is the scale of the bulbs on the bed. So let's say tens of meter. And the second application is how the form of that law will influence the Golden Light dynamics. So it's at the scale of the glacier, the semi-application. So, and these two applications will be done with only one tool, which is the Helmer ICE solver tools that we have heard already this morning by Thomas. And I will go very fast on this one because Jan already introduced the concept of what should be a friction law. But briefly, if you have a glacier, there is some topography at the long scale and you don't expect to resolve Uh you don't expect to resolve the the small uh roughness or the or the small bumps uh uh that are at the at the mesoscale. And uh instead you will say okay I don't know really what is the rootness of the of the bed but I will replace it by a mathematical function which will link the shear stress, the sliding velocity and maybe the effect. Maybe the effective pressure, which is the difference between the overburden pressure and the water pressure at the bed, and also maybe other variables. That's why I put some dots here. And that's if we look on that, it has been a lot of work seen, I would say, the fifties on that subject. And the all this work Uh the all this work um r remain on on on on a lot on a lot of assumptions. I will I I will d I will list this assumption later. But one of these assumptions is that there is a fill of water at the bed and that the ice is perfectly sliding and so you replace this bumpy bed by a flat bed but assuming a friction loop. And where it comes more difficult if you think that you can have If you think that you can have water at the interface between the ice and the bedrock, and if, for example, because on the lee side of the bump you have a lower normal stress than on this side of the bump, if the water pressure increases or if the sliding speed increase, then you can imagine that you will open a water-filled cavity that will change the rootness of the. Change the rootness of the bed, and that will change the friction you expect from the bed. So, before moving, so and then how this the form of the friction law is transformed by the presence of water. So, before moving to these two parts of my talk, I would like to make a bit of history. So, it's really from my point of view, from the point of view of the French point of view. There is a very nice paper. Front of you. There is a very nice paper also you can read by Andrew Fuller about Wertmann Dibutri and other people on the development of sliding theory. If you want to read more about this history, I wrote a small text on this so you can read it later. But let's start in 1957 when Wertmann published this famous paper. I think it's really the beginning of our understanding of what was happening. Of what was happening at the base of glacier. And he was invoking two mechanisms to explain why there is friction at the base of glacier. So, pressure melting and refreezing, and also the creep rate and Hansman. And one year later, Diboutry published also a famous paper in French, because at that time French people were still thinking that, okay, the language of science should be French. French. And so maybe not that much of you have read this paper because it's in French. Anyway, Liboutri, because he was not only doing mathematics, he was only on the field doing field work, and he knew that glacier was accelerating during summer. And also, we already know that there was some daily acceleration of glacier. And so he said that to explain... So he he said that to explain this, you need to invoke another mechanism. And he was already speaking about this cavity opening on the least side of the bulb on this 1958 paper. Ghiboutri will publish more than 20 papers on that subject during his career, among them this paper in 1968 about the general theory about friction and Webman. And Wertmann also did publish his general theory four years after. These guys were quite fighting at that time, as you can see. Maybe something more specific is that in 2005, so two years before Libutri died, he was already more than 80 at that time. He was still doing some science. And I had the chance to see, maybe I think his last. I think his last conference, his last presentation, it was in a small conference in Grenoble. Again, he gave us a piece, eight-page paper in French. I have it. If some of you want to have it, I can make a copy. And he said, I will translate because it's in French. He said that, in short, all what we have done so far is bullshit. Not only what the other have done, also what he has done and myself, okay, and all the other. And he presented in 10 minutes, you can imagine, a new theory about what is friction and its link with hydrology. And yeah, nobody understood really what was the meaning of the talk. What was the meaning of the talk at that time? I did not get it. And badly, this idea he was saying that, okay, this new theory, I will publish it in three paper that I will submit in Journal of Glassiology. He will never, he died two years after this, and he was a bit ill at that time already. And this paper will never be submitted. And I have tried to find the manuscript, asking the family if they can have a look. Family, if they can have a look on the computer, but you can imagine it's not so easy. And this manuscript is lost. We have only these few pages in French. Again, if you are interested, I can send it to you. Okay, so where are we now? There have been kind of some progress. At least I cannot include the work by Liboutri here, but there have been some progress. Been some progress, so we have come to some hindsight on what should be the form of this friction law in case you have this cavity opening at the interface. So there is the paper from Schof in 2005. We get kind of an expression and I did extend this work in two thousand seven using uh uh Elmer uh already at that time. And uh already at that time and uh then I get a a bit a mo more complicated blow uh that can present uh uh uh a weakening uh uh stress weakening uh phase uh depending on the value of this exponent uh Q. Uh as far as I know nobody has uh ne ever used this law with a value of Q different than one, which uh is uh Which is a monotonic increasing. So if you try to do a search flow with a non-monotone sliding law, all the solvability stuff kind of goes out the window. Yeah, yeah, for sure. That's why nobody has used it so far. I think it points to something that we tend to overlook, which is that we say the sliding law depends on, it gives friction as a function of velocity. Friction is a function of velocity and effect of pressure, but actually, there are other degrees of freedom that we assume to be slave to those two. So, we're saying that locally the shape of the cavities is in a steady state. I think Ian made this. I will question this right after. So, I think there are work in progress. So, all this work, the previous work by Libertary and where we are so far, I don't think there are that much since that time. All this formulation. Time. All these formulations, all these laws are based on the quite strong assumption. They are based on two-dimensional bed geometry. They assume pure sliding, that's this famous film of water at the interface between the ice and the bedrock. They assume steady water pressure, that's the point Christian just mentioned. So we assume that everything is steady, the shape of the cavity, the water pressure is steady. None of this flow has been None of this law has been ever validated against a real data set, and the link between the friction and the hydrology is still very inky for authors. So, in this talk, I will question this steady water pressure assumption, but if you want, there is a paper just recently published about how it changed the law if you. About how it changed the law if you move to three-dimensional geometry. In fact, it does not change that much the form of the law. Of course, the parameter will be changed. If you look at the assumption of pure sliding, maybe you should wait a paper from a student of me working on adding some Coulomb-type friction at the interface instead of assuming a pure slightly Instead of assuming a pure slightening. About this, also maybe we can wait a paper from Jean-Bert al who is showing that we can use the Argentia Glacier in the Alps near Germany to kind of validate this or at least try to validate the the form of this flow using this data set. And again using the same data set, Gilbert and Hol are Gilbert et al. are trying to link basal hydrology and friction in a different form than what is used classically. What I mean by this is use an hydrology model to get the effective pressure and use a friction law that use this effective pressure. So I haven't really yet started my talk, but okay. Okay. So uh the the the first part was how how this uh law are modified if uh I assume unsteady uh water pressure. And for sure you all know that uh water pressure at the base of a glacier is unsteady. It's not steady at different scale, at the daily scale during summer, but also at the seasonal scale at the yearly scale. So to do that I'm using exactly the same setup as I Exactly the same setup as I used in my 2007 paper. So it's a finite element model, assuming periodic boundary condition. The top is overburdened ice pressure and I impose a far field velocity at the top of the domain. So it has to be large enough so that the results are not influenced. The results are not influenced by this boundary condition. I take care of this. So I solve for the stokes as you interpret ice. And the most important is this boundary condition, where I will solve the contact between the ice and the rock, which is a perfectly rigid bedrock. So there is two different boundary conditions. Here we have the context, so there is no penetration, and I assume no curse like this. Pure sliding, no friction, no resistance. And when the cavities start to open, then this directly boundary condition is replaced by this Neumann and I apply a homogeneous and uniform water pressure. Olivia, can you say what you mean by assuming temperate ice? The gland flow law parameter is constant over the domain and it's given by the Patterson. It's given by the Patterson value. I cannot take you either. We can have a look after. Okay, and so what I'm doing, for given overburden pressure, and I evolve the water pressure. I increase the water pressure, and each time I look at the steady-state solution. And so, yeah, and then, yeah, before going to the results, Going to the results, then I can infer macroscopic or mesoscopic quantity like the shear stress and the sliding velocity, and then I can get what is the form of the friction law from this modeling. Okay, so then if you do that, you get this curve. Each big dot, it's 10% more of water pressure relative to the overburden. relative to the overburden uh pressure. And each small dot is one percent. So I I'm increasing one percent by one percent the water pressure. And what you can see is that for 10 percent of overburden pressure you don't have cavity. If I go to 40 you can see that you start to open a cavity at 50 percent, sixty percent, seventy percent and and you start to decrease as far as you have reached uh the maximum slope uh of the uh Slope of the bedrock. So here the maximum slope is inside the cavity, so the ice does not see anymore the maximum slope, and we have this weakening or this softening phase. So at the beginning, it's wetted mine type, where you don't have cavity, you find again the the wet mine type friction law, then you reach what we call the high tens bone, and then you have this uh soft. And then you have this uh soft softening. So now in this talk I want to question so that's for steady water pressure. Now if I if I'm if I for example here for this point if I start to evolve the water pressure and look how the friction law is modified and I will do it very simply I will use this perturbation in water pressure so 2% of perturbation and I will assume a period of I will assume a period of one day and a period of one year. And so I will do this for different points here, for different steady solutions. Great clarification to you, the part of your interface where you do play with water pressure. Yeah, is it fixed or can it? No, it's the wall the it's it's the wall border. I I I I because there is this film of water I assume that uh the ice the ice see the same water pressure. The ice see the same water pressure at the at the bed. Everywhere. That's enough itself to make the cut cannot be. Sorry, I can go back. The free surface basically on the entire, not only on your. Oh, yeah, yeah. These points are part of the solution. I solved for the contact problem, so they are evolving. Okay. So you said a day and a year, will you just repeat for us what they actually Repeat for us what the actual sliding velocity you're assuming and the wavelength of your sinusoidal bed is, because that's because you become massive. So, yeah, Didi. What is the wavelength? So, you're going to do this with a day and a year is the period of water pressure oscillation. Yeah. But there's an advective time scale for ice to traverse the wavelength of the bed. That's really the same thing. In my simulation, it's 10 meter. Okay, and And uh few I you can do it for different rootness. But the velocity, the sliding velocity is I don't remember, but it's quite you can you can you can do it for I think it will not change the results. Well, I think it will because it depends whether the variations in water pressure happen faster or slower than the effective time scale for ice to go from one to that to the next. Yeah, but yeah, I'm assuming that the world Yeah, but here I'm assuming that the wa the water pressure it's a g it's given. Yeah. Yeah, here I assume that uh I impose the water pressure everywhere uh to be the same. The water pressure. It's when you vary the water pressure in time, you introduce a time scale and there is a natural time scale on which the cavity wants to evolve and I'm interested in how the results of this. Just curious. Yeah, so for example, if you if you if you have a a period of one year of uh of one year sorry I already showed the the one paper but if you have a period of if you have a period of one year you you the cavity can adapt and so you don't depart from the steady state solution. So if you want though so that means that if you just take into account a yearly variation of point Variation of pressure, you can keep with the same steady friction law. But if you move to one delta, instead of 10 meters, if you're slightly longer, that may be a purely time scale is a bit different. I don't see it. We don't think of time scales that matters, and so there is a natural time scale, so we need to know what the sliding velocity is in addition to the wavelength. Yeah, but it's uh I I think it can be added somewhat. I I think it can be undimensional. It's okay, let let's dispute this later. So, but if you move to one day period, then then for sure that the cavity cannot adapt, the geometry of the cavity because of the trip cannot adapt to the new geometry. So, then you have uh a completely different uh behavior and uh instead of having having this softening, you you you get even a hardening uh behavior. Behavior. And if you superimpose a yearly and daily period, you can see almost the the same. So the point is, yeah, I will conclude on this, but the point is that how the friction, and you can see that here, for example, the Eichen bond is not even fulfilled because we have, I did not tell them, but we have points that have less. points that are that have larger uh uh value than one, which means that they are uh for the the the I can bond is not full file anymore. And so yeah, how we should modify the previous friction law, taking account this result is still not clear for me. I move to the second quick question. Um, have you thought about making the ice viscoelastic? Yes, but. Elastic. Yes, but it's not. It's viscous, yeah. Yeah, yeah, but have you thought about it? Yeah, but no, yeah, but as it has already been tell by someone, I can't remember who, but I'm looking at things happening at this w one day or so maybe elasticity is not that important, but for sure we we we we should or we could uh We should or we could uh but we we don't have the the feature right now, so we we did not. Okay, just maybe I will go faster for the last part. So now uh the last part is assuming we we have uh this friction law, uh how uh uh how important it is for uh if you want to start to modelize uh a glacier and especially the the grueling line uh dynamics here. Dynamics here. So, what's important? Because I expect that the effective pressure is evolving a lot at this place. So, you can expect to have almost zero water pressure inland. But as far as you come closer and closer to the grueling line, you have this, you expect to have more water pressure, and especially at the limit case where you are downstream the grueling line because of this. Uh don't scream the grueling line because of the ocean the water pressure is zero and at the groning line by definition uh you expect the uh effective pressure to be uh zero. Not the water pressure, the effective pressure. And uh so I will I will go faster because uh I'm too slow. Uh so I will I will test uh in what follow I will test uh four different friction law. The first is the uh classical Wertmann friction law. The classical Wertmann friction law that is plotted here in this strange plot, but I like it. So it's UB as a function, UB here and effective pressure here, and the ISO value are for the shear stress. So because the rest man does not depend on the effective pressure, it's straight line. The Coulomb friction law is vertical line because it does not depend on velocity. On velocity, and you have the psi friction law, which is a mixture of Weckman and Coulomb. You have the Libutree, the one I just presented just before. I call it Zhuf sometime also. And it's for the exponent Q equal to 1, so there is no weakening in this friction law. So you can see that ψ and Dibutri are almost the same. And then also I'm looking at the bud, and you can see that. The bird, and you can see that the bud friction law, which depends linearly on the effective ratio, has a quite different representation in this type of plot. Okay, so I will compare this four-friction law using the mismatch experiments. So, what we did we built a steady-state solution with the gorilla just at the top of the of the bump. The bump, of the bedrock, and then we remove the buttressing force here, and we expect that the growing line will retreat like this. And for the effective pressure, we assume a very simple hydrology model, which is that the water pressure is exactly the hydrostatic water pressure from the ocean. And we use the Libut 3 solution as observation and all the other. As observation, and all the other laws are inverted using this solution. And so that's the result, and I will end with this. So in purple is the Wertmann response, in green is the libutry, in red is the psyche, and in blue is the bud. And we did different initial startup for this simulation. So, interestingly, what you can see is that. So, interestingly, what you can see is that for some distribution of the friction for the workman, we can find steady solution in the retrograde slope of the bed, which is not expected from Christian Schulz paper 2005, 2007, I can explain why later if you want. But interestingly, also is that you can get, so that's the velocity, the So that's the velocity, the maximum speed, the maximum retreat rate of the grunting line. So you have order of magnitude difference between Wertmann and Bud, for example. So the conclusion is that depending on the choice, not only of the parameter but the form of the friction law, you will get very, very uh different uh results in terms of uh gruing line retreat. Of grooning line retreat. There is the same for a 3D application. See this paper, Bronx 2019, if you want to see more. And my conclusion, a bit maybe not pessimistic, but so from this last example, I think you are convinced that the eye dynamics strongly depend on the choice of the form of the friction law you will use in your model. But we are not yet sure which is the appropriate form. Is the appropriate form to be chosen, and so there is more work to be done, hopefully. Thank you. I was just wondering if you basically use kind of this notion that the ice is improved and that there is kind of a lot of fear that you draw that there's no interaction there. Do you have any plans maybe that it cover like that? Maybe that it couple like that. I mean there is some interaction certainly between the um water and the ice that would be on just having a um strict like binary interface. Yeah, you could think about uh for example having a volume of water and uh see uh yeah but it's it would be much more complicated uh in term of simulation. Uh I I agree that that's a strong assumption that uh the water That the water is uniform at the base of the glacier. But that's the very classical command assumption. I have just a basic question, and it's about one of your first slides. What are the equations that determine the geometry of the cavity? One of those is surface kinematical. Yeah, yeah, it's a free surface. So it's pretty straightforward to add melting. That was actually my question. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, for sure. You can add some melt or refreeze. Some melt or refreezing, but maybe it will make sense to have this, to add this if you have also the water circulation inside the cavity, because we need the temperature, which is more complicated. It's probably more a comment than a question. But when you showed that very nice picture of going from large cavities all the way to small cavities, you go from the ocean, you have a couple of Yeah, coupled with this question about thermodynamically, how do you determine the cavity shape? How do you determine the cavity shape? You also have a salt gradient. I mean you have salty ocean all the way to probably fresh ice. Exactly, and that's the assumption I'm doing. I'm saying that the water pressure at the base is given by the water column, the ocean water column pressure. In addition to that, you know, if you had In addition to that, you know, if you had salt water from the ocean underneath the sound. Yeah, that's another problem, that the density of the fresh water is not the same as the density of the ocean, and that you have in the vicinity of Berlin and you have these two water that certainly meets. No, I'm not solving this. I have a question actually about this last brontex result that you just showed. Yeah. So if I remember correctly, if I'm not sure. Correctly, from reading this paper. Part of the issue here, so the branched lines, right, the dashed lines, are you're calibrating the friction coefficient at different times during the simulation. You should see these dots as initial conditions. So you know the friction from the shoe the debut resolution, and then you invert for the workman. for the uh Weckman coefficient.
