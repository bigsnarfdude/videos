I want to cover very briefly the subject and the main ideas, and then leave it to the speakers in the following days to go into more details and newer results. So this talk will not contain many new results at all, but it will just give an introduction to the subject to those who are not familiar yet to this theory. Okay, so let me let me start with a quote which maybe lies at the heart of the ideas in the conference, going back to Paul Dirac, who said that in the paper in 19 In a paper in 1933, which I find is a very seminal paper, actually, and in fact, actually contains already the core ideas of what later became on the Feynman path integral, that the two formulations of Hamilton and Lagrange are closely related, but there are reasons for believing that the Lagrangian one is more fundamental, and I share that belief. Although Dirac didn't quite specify exactly why he thought that. Specify exactly why he thought that that was the case. But in integrable systems, the Hamilton approach has been very prominent for many decades, and the Lagrangian approach was kind of forgotten, actually, in the theory. And so the subjects that I'm introducing now gave in some sense a return of the Lagrangian approach to integrability. To integrability, and that's also the main reason for developing this subject. So, this talk will be a brief overview of the multiform theory and the underlying ideas. And so, this is mainly an approach to integrability in the sense of multi-dimensional consistency. So, I will give a little bit of an explanation what I mean by that. And it's really. And it's really a departure from conventional variational calculus and variational approaches to physical problems in a number of respects. First of all, the Lagrangians are in this theory no longer scalar objects. In any kind of conventional Lagrange theory, you have a Lagrange function or at most something which is a volume form. And that's no longer the case in this theory. There are genuine differential and Genuine differential and in the discrete difference forms with non-trivial co-dimension in the space of independent variables. And the action consequently is not only a functional of dependent variables, but in our point of view, are also depending over the manifolds or the surfaces over which you actually integrate. So they become part of the variational. Part of the variational calculus. And at the critical point of the action, subject to a system, a generalized system of Euler-Lagrange equations, which I will demonstrate briefly, the action then is independent on local variations of the surface. The other approach, I will come back to that slightly relaxed. And what I think is And what I think is the most fundamental aspect of the theory is that the Lagrangians have to be very special in order for this structure to be valid, to hold. So we were talking about admissible Lagrangians. And they actually need to represent integrable systems, but we can also consider them to be solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations themselves. And that is really probably the most fundamental departure from conventional variational. Conventional variational theory: that in most theories that are based on a variational principle or at least action principle, the Lagrangians are somehow input into the system which come from different sources like symmetry approaches, symmetry considerations, and you postulate basically the Lagrangian and then you do your thing, which means calculating the Euler Lagrange equations or quantizing the system. But the final. The finding of the Lagrangian or the postulating of the Lagrangian is independent from the actual variational process itself. And here it isn't the case. So I think that is a very beautiful aspect of it. Although it is very restrictive, it is, I think, also one of the most important aspects of the theory. Then there is the term plural Lagrangian systems, which was introduced by Bobenko Masuris as a slightly where some of the assumptions that we made in the multi-form Assumptions that we made in the multi-form approach was relaxed. And there's a slightly different perspective, I think, in that theory. I don't want to comment too much on that because I would turning out of my own comfort zone a little bit. But we will have a roundtable discussion where that kind of difference between these two approaches has been kind of somehow highlighted. And then there is, of course, the quantum theory that I think is probably. The quantum theory that I think is probably the most, to me, the most important aspect of it. How does this theory relate to quantum theory? And is that quantum theory perhaps related to some kind of fundamental physics? That would be maybe a big ambition, but that's mainly a possibility that we are looking into. Okay, so let's first talk about this multi-dimensional consistency. This is, for those who are familiar with. This is, for those who are familiar with discrete integrable systems, a very well-known concept nowadays, namely the fact that systems can, even if you have a two-dimensional equation, you can embed them in a higher space and then impose the same equation with maybe different parameters in all possible directions. And then that imposition is kind of consistent. Is kind of consistent. So, in the simplest case, you have, for instance, a quadrilateral equation, which is indicated by this symbol Q, which may depend on dependent variables. So this is also to explain a little bit notation I'm using. U is a dependent variable depending on some discrete variables n1 and two, and maybe possibly more discrete variables. And then the simplest type of equation can be organized. Equation can be organized according to an elementary quadrilateral in the lattice, where you have elementary shifts which are indicated by T1 and T2. So they are shifts in the horizontal and vertical direction. And then you have parameters also that are associated with the links along those shifts. And they measure somehow the kind of grid width of the lattice. And so they are called lattice parameters. But actually, we will see that there is a role reversal also happening between. Also, happening between parameters and variables. And then you have this idea that you can impose the equation, or you want to look for equations where you can impose this equation not only on a two-dimensional lattice, but on multi-dimensional lattice in all possible directions. And then that imposition will cause a kind of consistency problem. So, if you look at this consistency cube here, then if you impose Cube here, then if you impose on the black spots, you impose some initial data and you compute, and subsequently in the round corners, you compute the value according to that code equation. Then there will be a point where you will have possibly three different answers to your computation. And the requirement that these answers all coincide will mean that you have a consistent system. And then that means that And then that means that this quadrilateral equation has to be very special and needs to form in some sense an integral quad lattice equation. So this is an example of multi-dimensional consistency, but there's also in the continuous domain multi-dimensional consistency. So I'll come to that in a moment. And then you have variational formalism. Now, I assume that most people. Now, I assume that most people are somehow familiar with conventional Lagrangian formalism and least action principle. Maybe in the discrete case, that is less the case. So, in the discrete case, you have, for instance, action functional s, which depends on, so functional functions, which depend on the dependent variable u, which itself depends on discrete variables. And then you are, in this case, it's the sum over all the lattice sites of a Lagrangian, which contains u. Which contains u and its shifts. And then in the continuous case, this is the analog of the continuous case where you have an integral over a Lagrangian which depends on u and its derivatives. And then you apply least action principle that you assume that under local variations of your field variable, your function u, the action acquires a minimum. There's a minimum, and those are the then the corresponding equations are the equations of motion of your system. So the computation is very similar to what you do in the continuous case. You'd look at an infinitesimal variation, you expand by Taylor expansion in terms of the variations of the field, and then you have also the variations of the shifted fields. You have to do then a resumation, which is. Which is the analog of doing the integration by parts in the continuous case, and you end up with a condition that so this must hold for all arbitrary variations of the field. And then the requirement of this being zero, so your action being at a critical point, is that you get an Euler-Lagrange equation, which is in the disk case takes this form. And this is precisely the analog of an Euler-Lagrange equation in the context. Lagrange equation in the continuous case. So that is the conventional theory. Now, there are these two things now that we consider. We have this consistency around the cube, which is a fundamental aspect of integrability. And most of the systems that we are interested in in integral systems also have a variational description. But this variational description in general does not actually. Description in general does not actually indicate anything about the integrity. So, what is the problem? So, multi-dimensional consistency, that consistency that I just demonstrated in the disk case is called consistency around the cube. But you also have it in the continuous case. So, in continuous integrable systems, we are familiar with commuting flows, higher symmetries, master symmetries, and hierarchies, actually, the existence of integrable. Hierarchies, actually, the existence of integral hierarchies of equations. And in the discrete case, you have this consistency around the cube that I just demonstrated. Backloom transforms, higher continuous symmetries of the discrete equations, and so on and so forth. So all these equations means that you have multiple equations imposed on one and the same function. So this function u can depend on many discrete variables and many continuous variables, and then imposing. Was and then imposing all these equations on the same one and the same function should lead to a consistent system, and that is the multi-dimensional consistency. So, the compatibility is a very rare but also very structural element here of integrability. So, the question is: how, if, on the other hand, we consider the least action principle to be another fundamental building block of our theory, how can we Our theory, how can we merge these two ideas? How can we capture the property of multi-dimensional consistency within a Lagrange formalism? And that question remained unanswered and answered for a long time because the problem is that the Euler-Lagrange equations, whatever you do, you choose a Lagrangian and this Lagrangian may produce your equation that you're interested in. But then you have the other equations and the Euler-Lagrange equations usually only produce one equation. Usually, you only produce one equation at a time. So, you have to then pose multiple Lagrangians for all your different equations. And the question is: how do they hang together? What is the connection between all these Lagrangians that you have to separately impose on the equations for the same variable u? And the answer in hindsight is kind of obvious, actually, that actually the Lagrangians in an integrable theory, in this sense of multi-dimensional consistency, must be an extended object. Must be an extended object, and then it's then to reason that it should be a differential in the continuous case or in the discrete case, a difference form in the space of the many variables that you're looking at. Now, that is a good idea, maybe, and somehow you can kind of philosophize about that, but then something must happen in order for this to work. And that goes back to the kind of key discovery, namely that the Lagrange. Namely, that the Lagrangians, if you look at well-chosen Lagrangians that describe your, for instance, your quad lattice equations, they obey actually a very remarkable property, namely this closure relations, we called it. Here, delta is the shift operator or the difference operator, so the shift minus the identity. And this actually gives an indication of actually there being a form structure for these Lagrangian. So actually. For these Lagrangians. So, actually, the components of these different Lagrangians that you take in different components of your multi-dimensional system, they should have a relation amongst themselves for this to work. And that leads them to the idea of a Lagrange multiform. So these Lagrangians, which are separate Lagrangi to begin with, actually form together form a kind of extended object. Together, form a kind of extended object. That is the main idea, and that comes from this discovery of the closure relation. So, the simplest example, maybe, of where this happens is, for instance, a linear case. So, you can have a linear quad equation of this form here. So, this is a Q, you could say, that I mentioned in the first transparency with lattice parameters and shifts. And then you can find a Lagrangian for that. Find a Lagrangian for that linear quad equation, which is a quadratic Lagrangian. And it turns out that this Lagrangian has this property, but actually on using the quad equation. So that is a slight kind of point of discussion, namely, this quad equation is itself not the Euler-Lagrange equation for the Lagrangian, but the But on using the quad equation, so which is a slightly stronger equation, you can show that this relation, this closure relation between the Lagrangians of this type holds. And this is just a simple computation. You can do it by hand on one page for this particular case. Then associated with this system, so this quad equation doesn't come in isolation, they're also associated. Associated semi-discrete and fully continuous equations that are connected to the same equation for one and the same function u. Here, for instance, you have a linear differential difference equation, which is compatible with the quad equation, and also that has a Lagrangian of its own type, so this semi-discrete Lagrangian. And then there is a fully continuous equation, which looks even not so simple, actually. This is still a Is still a uh I should have used U here as a symbol. Um, so this W is the same, U. So there's this kind of awkward-looking partial differential equation, actually of fourth order, in terms of actually the variables that used to be the lattice parameters. So there's a role reversal that takes place here between parameters and variables. In this continuous equation, the parameters have become the variables and the variables have become. The variables and the variables have become the parameters. So the ends here, which are the discrete variables, they are now parameters in this equation. This equation also has a Lagrangian, which looks like this. And if you compute the Euler-Lagrange equation for this Lagrangian, this conventional Euler-Lagrange equation, you get this equation. And then it turns out that this Lagrangian obeys the clause. Lagrangians obeys the closure relations. So, here I will review something that probably will come up this afternoon, maybe, or later this morning, in maybe Matt's talk. If you compute this form here, so without assuming the equations of motion, so without assuming, for instance, this equation, then it turns out that this form, this combination here, which is actually a component in the differential. In the differential of a form object that contains the else as components, then this factorizes in two factors. So this actually, by computation, gives you this product, and that holds for any w, actually, any variable w. And so not assuming the equations itself. So this is equals zero if either this factor is zero. If either this factor is zero or that factor is zero. And it turns out that in the following development of the theory, these factors actually come out as part of the Euler Lagrange system of the corresponding Lagrangian structure. And this is what we sometimes now call a double zero expression. And this double zero means that actually these two equations come out of the system as separate equations by very Separate equations by variation of the Lagrange form. And not only that, but these two equations imply the two variable equations that I have up there. So as a consequence of these two higher dimensional equations, they involve three independent variables, you have the two-variable equation, which is in the top of this slide. Okay, so this is an example, a linear example, and there are A linear example, and there are also linear non-linear analogs of this whole structure. Okay, so then you can ask what is the corresponding actually variational theory now. Well, the theory will then, let's focus first on this continuous case. We will have now an action which is a functional of two things, namely the functional of the field variables. Here, the p's are taken to be the independent. These are taken to be the independent variables, and so they can form a surface, parametrize a surface, a two-dimensional surface. And then you can integrate over any surface and then look at this object here, which is a Lagrange two-form. So this is a two-form in the independent variables pi and pj. And consequently, this action functional will be a functional of these two. A functional of these two aspects, namely the surface as well as the independent variables. Whereas in conventional theory, you always take your entire manifold to be your surface. And so there is no really kind of dependence on variations of a surface in the independent variable space. And in conventional theory, you only have a functionality of the field variables. Field variables. So, this functional you can still compute for any choice of your functions or any choice of surface, and you get some kind of outcome. And then you have a least action principle. So, to be specific, this Lagrangian here can be a function of u and its partial derivatives. And I've only here gone up to second order, so two-jet case. And then you can, from the point of view of the multi-form theory, can to look at two types of. Can look at two types of variations, so two types of variations for which you do a least action principle. One would be the variations of the surface itself over which you integrate, and the other would be of the variations of the dependent variable, the U. That is the conventional way of looking at Lagrangian least action principle, but there is this possibility as well. But because we have a genuine form in multi-dimensional space, one has to be very Space, one has to be very careful about how we look now at the variations of the field variables, because there are variations of the derivatives or of the gradients of the variation. So when you do variational calculus and you look at the variation of this S and expand it in Taylor series, then you will find that there will variations of the derivatives of the variations of the gradient. The gradient, variations of the gradient of u, and these gradients can long go along the surface or they can go out of the surface. And if you go along the surface, you can apply the conventional integration by parts trick to get contributions to the Euler-Lagrange equations. But the orthogonal contributions you have to treat as kind of independent variables in their own right. So they actually give rise to constraints. And if you look at this, if you do. At this, if you develop this, then in the simplest case, actually in the one diet case, you get a system of equations. One would be the first one would be the analog of the Euler-Lagrange equations, but it now contains a lot of more stuff in there, namely the parameterization of the surface with the parameters s and t. And then you have this system of constraints that is in the second equation. I don't know if the pointer is viewable. Is viewable. And then you have the consequences of the variations of the surface itself, which leads to the closure relation. And we can think of this as a whole system of equations for which you can try and find examples, like the example that I gave before. But I think a more deeper question is: can we actually use this whole system as a kind of This whole system as a kind of defining system for the Lagrangian components itself. So, in other words, can one solve the Lagrangian components from this system of what you could call the analyzed Euler-Lagrange equations? So, this is kind of like from the point of view of the multiform theory. Mats Femier and Yurisuris, they developed also the Lagrange theory from the plural Lagrangian point of view. Actually, they used a technique called step surfaces, where you basically use coordinate, you approximate any surface by coordinate patches. And then you get a system of equations, which is actually in some sense more practical than what I've shown before. And that access the kind of set of Euler-Lagrange equations for the system in the case of two forms. I don't want to go into the details. I don't want to go into the details. Matz knows this much better than I do. But then there is also a third, in some sense, alternative approach, and that is to look at it from the point of view of a variational bicomplex. And probably tomorrow, Linux will talk a little bit more about that aspect. And you can think of the Euler-Lagrange equations being encoded in the variations of the Of the derivative, the derivative of the Lagrange form, and setting these equal to zero will give rise to the Euler-Lagrange equations. And the example that I showed you with the linear case, where you have these two factors, is an example where you apply that principle. Okay, an application is this example. This is a non-linear example, which actually goes back some while. This is a Lagrangian we found in 2000. And we found in 2000 with Andy Hohen and Lini Joshi, long before we had actually the theory of this multifon theory. So, this is a Lagrange for a thing that we call the generating PDE for the KDV hierarchy. So, in some sense, the Euler Lagrange or the Euler-Lagrange equations for this Lagrangians encode the entire KDV hierarchy. But it turns out that when you apply the model, Multiform theory, you get two more equations actually that appear to be crucial, very parallel to the two factors that I showed in the linear case. So, in some sense, if you compute the differential of this Lagrangian, you get the factor which contains this part here and a factor which contains that part here. And they imply then if any of these two factors imply the closure relation. With a closure relation. So, this is an example of a non-linear case for Lagrange multifold. Okay, what about the discrete case? Well, in the discrete case, then we have to set up an analog of the action principle. So, here then, the action will be a functional of dependent variables which depend on a discrete variable n. So, the discrete variable labels the lattice side. Labels the lattice side of a quad quad surface, a quad-lattice surface, where you can imagine this kind of picture here. So a surface that is made out of elementary quads with potentially a boundary. And then you can think of the components in the various directions of the quads. So each component of the Lagrangian can be indicated by this elementary square. This by this elementary square, which has an orientation, so depending also on the choice of the parameters, and then taking into account the orientation, so you can think of each quad have a little normal vector pointing out to it, and then you have to add all the contributions according to the normal vectors in pointing all in the same direction. And that gives you then the action functionale as a sum of all these elementary chords. All these elementary chords. In the notation that was introduced by Mansfield and Haydn of difference form, you can write this in a kind of formal way in terms of this two-form L, which has these strange symbols delta I and delta J, which here don't mean the difference operator, but it means a kind of elementary discrete differential. Okay, and then the surface independence. Surface independence can be seen as a kind of flip of the lattice. So, when you take, for instance, a flat piece of your lattice, that's most easily indicated, then you due to the closure relation, when you change the surface and you pop out an elementary cube out of this lattice, then you get contributions that are written down here for this S. And when the closure relation holds, then The relation holds, then these contributions add up to zero. So you have invariance under this popping up of a surface. And then you can ask the same question as in the continuous case, what are all the elementary or the fundamentally Euler-Lagrange equations. Now, if you have a three-point Lagrangian of this type here, then the Euler-Lagrange equations, as I indicated in a Equations, as I indicated in the conventional theory, will give rise to this kind of Euler-Lagrange equations. But usually, this Euler-Lagrange equation is kind of a weak equation, which is not give rise to the quote equation itself. So, what you need to do actually in the multiform theory is that you consider all possible surfaces. Surfaces and you can look then at, for instance, a closed surface. So, the most simple or the smallest closed surface in a quad lattice that you can think of is an elementary cube of this type. You look then at the action that corresponds to that particular cube, which gives you all these contributions. They are the same as we had before and an earlier slide, but here they are just thought of as contributions to. Contributions to the action itself. And then you can think of, then what you do is to look at all possible variations of internal points on this closed surface. So you basically take variations with respect to all the vertices. The outermost surface doesn't appear here. The the corner on the outer edge can't really see the the pointer. You see the pointer, but when you take variations with respect to all the internal points, then you get a system of equations, and the system of equations is written down here. And they form then up to permutations, rotations, and shifts in the lattice, they form the essential elementary set of all the Euler-Lagrange equations for the quad-lattice case. And then you can add actually the closure relation itself when you are interested in the question, like, can we solve, can we view this system of equations as a system of linear partial differential equations for the Lagrangian? So, one of the aims would be to actually not think so much in the conventional way as a kind of system of equations. As a kind of system of equations that gives you equations of motion, but actually as a defining system for Lagrangians. So, can we? So, in other words, one could think of a kind of classification problem where you basically want to solve all these equations in the most general form. That is probably not quite a doable project, but that's one of the possible aims that you could do, solving this system. Do solving this system of equations for the Lagrangians. There's a partial solution to this already, which is given by this rather daunting slide. This is work that we did with Pablo Scenitidis and Sara in the past. And that is when you impose in addition that your equations of motion should be compatible with a quad equation, which has Kleinian symmetry and for which you have this discriminant behavior, namely that the discriminant. Behavior, namely, that the quad, the discriminant of the elementary quads, which are quad-linear equations, factorize in this way in terms of a bi-quadratic, then there is a general Lagrangian that you can write down, which takes this form, which is a very strange and daunting-looking form, namely in terms of double integrals, where the dependent variable appears in the limits of the integration. This is a very interesting, I think, Lagrangian, which also has a kind of aspect that it is an interpolating Lagrangian. That it is an interpolating Lagrange, namely, it interpolates between initial fields u0 and final fields. Where if you do Euler Lagrange for the U's, you get the equations for the U variable, but if you vary with respect to the lower limits, you get the corresponding equations for the initial state. So, this forms a partial solution to that general question, but it is under additional assumptions. Okay, then one of the projects actually for the more or less for the future, but we did some initial steps towards that, was to look at the quantization of it. And in this paper with Stephen King, we looked at it from the point of view of quadratic Lagrangians. So, in the case of quadratic Lagrangians, so like the ones that I proposed in the linear case, when you have linear quad equations, then you Then you can do Gaussian integrals. So you can actually compute something like the affine propagator, which is here indicated by this k. And you can actually consider the variational aspects of this k propagator, which is a path integral over quadratic action. And you can see what happens under variations of the surface. So this K will actually depend when you take an arbitrary quad. And when you take an arbitrary quad lattice, like the same picture that I had before, then this k will depend in principle on this quad lattice, and it will depend on the boundaries actually, in the same way as the path integral would depend on the initial point of path and final points of path. It will be a function of those, and it's a propagator in terms of those variables. So it is a function of the boundary, but it will also functionally depend on the surface itself. But then when you look at But then when you look at the case of this integral or multi-dimensionally consistent quad equation, then there is a kind of miracle that happens again through for Gaussian integration. When you pop up a little cube like we did before, and you compute the contributions of the path integral over all these extra points, namely U3, U2, U1, 23, etc. Then actually you recover the The Lagrangian in the action of the original flat surface. So that actually means that indeed that the propagator actually is invariant under this popping up move of the surface. And that you can postulate as a kind of quantum variational principle, now a quantum variational multiform principle. Now, a quantum variational multiform principle that the Lagrangians need to be invariant under these variations of the surface. And that also determines, at least in the quadratic case, it determines the form of these Lagrangian. So if you would take a general three-point Lagrangian without specifying the coefficients, you will find that you will find that that condition actually predicts the particular form of this Lagrange and in particular this coefficient that is that is indicated here. And furthermore what that actually entices is some kind of idea that the real object in this theory that one should look at, the real theory in this theory that one should look at is not really the propagator itself, but something like Itself, but something like the sum over all possible surfaces of the propagator. And that makes a kind of connection with maybe that's maybe a point for discussion later, maybe with ideas that run around in loop quantum gravity and other areas of physics. Okay, so I want, this is my last, well, penultimate slide. So in when you push this idea of what would be a Of what would be a possible quantum one-form theory, then I postulated already in 2013 that one should probably look at an object like this propagator here, this K. So this is in the case of a one-form structure where the action is given by a sum over, not over surface, but over a path, gamma, and that path can be continuous and discrete. And in the continuous case, And in the continuous case, you could you have a conventional propagator, which would be this the second part of this integral for a given, depending on a given curve in your time variables space. And then you have to integrate over all possible paths, actually, so all possible gammas. So that will give rise to kind of extended propagator form. Forum. So, this is just a hypothesis. It hasn't been worked out very well, but actually, Sikarin will probably talk about that this afternoon in the discrete case. Okay, so a few final points. So, we have seen from many examples actually that have been studied since the idea started that this multiform structure actually applies to many cases and seems to be. To many cases, and seems to be a universal aspect. And one of the main motivations that I gave in the beginning is, and that's why it is kind of new and unique as a variational theory, is that instead of producing just one equation, as Euler-Lagrange equation, you get a whole system of multi-dimensional consistent equations. And what I think also is important is that there is a kind of democracy happening in this. Happening in this aspect, at least in the multi-form point of view, between dependent and independent variables. So the geometry in the space of independent variables plays a role. In conventional integrable systems theory, where you have a Hamiltonian description, the time variables are basically, and also the higher time variables are just kind of like very straight flow variables which have no really geometrical. Which have no really geometrical structure behind them. But this actually theory invites to endow the independent variable space also with a geometry. That is interesting. And then actually, the idea would be that in some sense, if you go to the quantum theory, you take a sum over all geometries. And so that is maybe also where there might be some parallels with loop quantum gravity. So tomorrow there will be a talk by Bianca Dietrich from the Pelimeter Institute. Janka Dietrich from the Pelimeter Institute, who will maybe have some interesting things to say about how they look at issues that are associated with scaling variance and perfect discretizations. So that's where I want to stop. Thank you for your attention.
