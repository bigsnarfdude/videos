Well, thanks for your attending, everyone. But we'll have the other fronts from MIT. And if the title wasn't obvious enough, I'll repeat it a third time. It's logical control for bedbacks with boundary model purposes. Yeah, thank you very much, Danton. Yeah, so I will talk about this, I mean, controlling the topology of pre-boundary minimum. Controlling the topology of free boundary minimal surfaces that are obtained via a minimum procedure. So, let me just say right away the setting I will work on. And I mean, in general, I will give it first an introduction about the minimax, prepoundary minimal surfaces, then I will state what I mean, our result. Then I will give some applications and at the end, maybe an idea of the proof. But so, yeah, let me write away. Let me right away say what's the setting. So we go one dimension up with respect to Jonathan. So we work in three-dimensional compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary. And we assume again like a convexity condition on the boundary, in particular that is mean convex. And we will consider, in this case, surfaces in this manifold that are again compact and I will assume connected and orientable just for the sake of the talk. Now we'll say how maybe the result can generalize also with all these assumptions with again boundary that is. That is exactly lies on the boundary of the Andien manifold. So we have something like this. Okay, so this is the Andien manifold. There's a certain surface inside. And here, like the topology of a surface like this is determined by two numbers. Which are the genus G. So in this case, like it's the maximum, the maximum number of curves that you can remove from the surface without disconnecting it and the number of boundary components. So I just say very briefly the statement of the theorem. The statement of the theorem for who knows already some terminology about mean-max. So we obtain a free boundary minimal surface in general. We will consider a Simon-Smith setting of the mean-max. And we will obtain a free boundary minimal surface as a limit in the sense of variable of this sequence of surfaces. And it's already been proven that the genus is lower semi-continuous along minimax sequences. But nothing was known about the number of boundary. Nothing was known about the number of boundary components. And if you want to study objects with boundary, you also have to control this number. And so what we do is that in general, this is not lower semi-continuous along minimax sequences, but if it increases, the genus has to decrease at least as much. So this was just, you know, to know more or less what we are expecting, but I will now enter more in detail of the statement and definition and so on. Definition and so on. And yeah, like I will do the talk on the Blackboard, but in parallel, I will have some pictures by Mario, which is also the collaborator for this work that I'm presenting. So, okay, so this is the first, I can maybe state, just define what the free boundary minimal surface is now. So, a surface like this, I mean, we saw. Like this, I mean, we saw basically already the one-dimensional case, right? Um, but let me repeat it: so is a free boundary minimal surface, and I'll just write a CMS if it is a critical point of the area. With respect to variations that can move also the boundary of the surface inside the boundary of the MMA hole. Okay, and if you compute the first variation, you add that the surface has to be a minimal surface. So, in particular, we can take variations that move out only the interior. So, the mean curvature has to be equal to zero. But we also have the same boundary condition. We also have the same boundary condition as before. So, sigma has to intersect the boundary of the NBN manifold orthogonally. Okay, so I mean, for example, here we are with this intersecting orthogonally the boundary of these solitarus. Okay, so let me give a couple of examples. Typical example is the one where, when, as an ambient manifold, we take the three-dimensional unit ball. So maybe instead of like doing the pictures here, I'll just show you the one that Mario did. So this example is just diagnosing manifold for the unit board, and we take the factor at this. It is flat, has mean curvature equal to zero, and it does have an orthogonal at the boundary. The boundary, and the second easiest example is the critical tagon. Okay, um, but we now know many more examples in the unit ball. So this is what is known so far, again, just in the unit ball. And one way to describe which examples we know is with respect to the topology that they add, right? So we have only two parameters, the genus. Only two parameters, the genus and the number of boundary components. And for each of these, I mean, these two parameters, we can say, does there exist a free boundary minimal surface with that topology? So we have these two that I showed you before, a controller disc and critical catenoid. But then, yeah, you see, we have many more. So let me write the question. It's like in an existence. An existence or a construction of pre-boundary minimal surfaces in a certain three-dimensional Riemannian manifold, for example, with a given topology. Okay, so we expect this table to be. This table to be completely filled. So, if you want, you can have that in mind as a goal of what we are doing here, of our result, for example, a possible application, but not necessarily. Anyway, so, okay. You see, there are already many examples. The method that has been employed are a few, and then we'll focus on the min maps. And I will focus on the minlax one. Just let me mention that some of these examples have been obtained thanks to the connection of the pre-boundary minimal surfaces with the stacklow eigenvalue problem. Then there are other examples obtained with a perturbation gluing method. And the last one that I want to talk about is this min-max theory that is very That is very powerful to obtain these examples, critical points, because it's basically obtain a critical point of a functional, which is the area in our case, as in a mountain pass. Okay, so I mentioned at the beginning that we will talk about the Simo-Smith approach of the min maps because there have been like several approaches, several different settings. Approaches, several different settings in which we do these meetments. The maybe most famous one is the Alger Tex or Marcus Naves one, which maybe you heard. In which, like, and I mean, in this setting, I mean, I just mentioned these games, but with work of several people, like the existence of Like the existence of infinitely many minimal services or pre-boundary minimal services in a certain ambient manifold have been obtained. And I mean, and what we will consider today is this Simon Smith called Vindalis approach. So, I mean, they are basically the same, but here in this Samo-Smith-Commitalius approach, we have a bit more stricter assumptions on the object that we consider. So, like we have the object that we consider as smoother or like stronger convergence of Convergence of what you will see stronger convergence assumptions with respect to algorithm peaks. So, I mean, this instance is in some sense like more flexible. But the problem is that the algorithm pits Marcus Navis approach give us a free boundary minimal surface or a minimal surface for which we cannot control the topology. So if we want to obtain a certain preboundary minimal surface with a certain topology, we cannot really use this approach. And so Simon Smith first introduced this smoother circuit where the topological control is possible. And so it's convenient for our. And so it's convenient for our purposes here. Okay. So, I mean, Simon Smith result, I mean, Simon Smith wanted to find minimal spheres, minimal two spheres in a three-sphere. And to say that what they obtained was actually two-sphere, they need some topological control, which is lost here. Okay, so let me. Okay, so let me maybe. I mean, I wrote more or less the statement of the Min-Max theorem in a very approximate fashion. Because it's not really important now to go into the details and the technical details of the statement. So, but at least having an idea. So, okay, we want to find a critical point of our area functional. Our area functional in this section with boundary. And so we start with a curve of surfaces. And as I said, the dependence of this curve with respect to the parameter is smooth. And here is where we are in the Samos Missecting. This smooth part here. Okay. Okay. And then, I mean, you take maybe one curve of surfaces and then you have to saturate. And then you have to saturate it. So, to take all the other curves that are obtained from this plan by isotopy, for example. Anyway, so it's the standard setting of a mountain pass theorem. You take a saturated family of these curves of surfaces that are called ZWIPALs, and you need to add a Montenegas condition. So it's just the infimum over all these families in the separated family pipe. In the separated family pi of the maximum of the area of the sigma t of the surfaces is greater than the values of the area at this at the boundary of the of the interval that you consider. This is, I mean, I stated it with a multi-parameter, but you consider just you can consider sweepouts parametrized by an interval, like here, for example. So, anyway, Anyway, it's just a mountain pass condition. I really is not important to do the exact details in this setting. And what the min-max theorem says, and here I'll just cite some names that contributed to this, Simon Smith, Cortin Delalis, Viketover. So, what they say is that we can find the three-pounder minimal surface gamma obtained as the Gamma obtained as the limit in the sense of variable. So it's just a weak sense, weak convergence of surfaces of a minimax sequence. A minimax sequence means just a sequence of surfaces in these families such that their area converge to this mean max value. So, I mean, it's just a standard Monte Bastille. Standard mountain bus theorem to obtain minimal surfaces. Okay, so what we are very interested in is controlling the topology of what you obtain, gamma. So what we have is that we have gamma, pre-boundary minimum surface, which is obtained as a limit in the science of variables. Of a sequence of surfaces sigma j. And you have to imagine that we know how this sigma j gave. That's like the input that we give to the min-max theorem, to the min-max theorem. So we control these objects. So we obtain this preboundary neural surface with this theory as a limit of these sigma j's. And okay, and again. Okay, and again, we assume, as I said before, orientability and connectivity of all these surfaces. So, what is already known is that the genus of gamma of the limit is less or equal than the limit or the limit. limit or the limit we want the j going to infinity of the genus of these surfaces sigma j so we have in input this surface sigma j we know the topology and in this way we can control the topology of the result and this was already known as i can cite some people so the the case not the min-max case but the minimizing case um was done in this paper by mix and oyal By Mix and Muyal, then there were, yeah, I mean, several people that did several versions. So Simon Smith did the same, the first case in the Min-Match setting, then the Lalis Pilandini. Ketober. Martin Lee, every boundary setting. Martin Lee, the free boundary setting. Anyway, just to cite some names. But yeah, I mean, here we are considering a few boundary settings. These objects have a certain number of boundary components. And it was not clear how the number of boundary components behaved at the limit. So that's what we are interested in. So what we get is, so you see. Is so you see, here you have a lower semi-continuity of the genus. We could expect maybe a lower semi-continuity of the number of boundary components, but that's unfortunately not true. What we know, though, as I said very briefly at the beginning, is that if the number of boundary components increases, then the genus has to decrease at least as much. So we have a lower semi-continuity of this quantity. Oh, yeah. You're a so this is number of boundary components of sigma j. Okay, so and this is like the main result that I want to present together. I want to present together with Mario. Okay, yeah, so I wrote it here. I don't want to enter in the details of this now, but everything can be done also imposing a group of isometries to all the procedure if you need to for the applications. But let me just say this comment in case you're interested in that. You're interested in that. Okay, so let me show you why this quantity with this picture. So, what can happen in this limit? This limit a priori is only a limit in the sense of barifuls. So, what can happen, for example, in this case, is that sigma j is topologically a sphere with a Like a tube attached, like this. So here we have genus one, but imagine that when j goes to infinity, this tube becomes smaller, thinner, and thinner, and it disappears in the sensor variables. And so at the limit, you get just the sphere. Okay, so here it was genus one, and here is genus zero. And I mean, we cannot, we can just get So we can just get, we can lose this topology. There's no way we can control it in general. So this is what we expect in the closed case. In the pre-boundary case, we have exactly the same. We can have some loss of genus in the same way. But what will happen is that also we have some small ribbons, like in this picture here. Like in this picture, here, right? This is just a ribbon attaching these two boundary components. So we have only one boundary component, genus one. So when J goes to infinity, in the min-max procedure, there's no way this can happen. We can add a small thin ribbon that goes thinner and thinner and disappears at the limit. So Anime. So, I mean. And in the limit, this disappears, and the two boundary components disconnect. So we have two boundary components. But the good thing is that actually removing this ribbon, also like the genus, so the number of boundary components goes up, but the genus decreases. So this is genus zero. So, this is genus zero, and we started for something with genus one. Okay, so that's the statement. Now, I'd like, do you have questions about this? Are you open for the last? Yeah. No, no, no, no. No, they're not minimal. No, no, no. You start so the so yeah, maybe let me spend time. So, yeah, maybe let me spend the so what you do is that you start from surfaces that are not minimal and you want to find something minimal. Okay. What you can prescribe is just like the topology or something like that. Okay. It's like, you know, in the picture here, the critical point is just there in the mountain pass. But and you get it as limit. But and you got it as limit of things that are not critical points or something else, um, but is what you know that you can control. Yeah. Oh, yeah, sorry. This is genus. Okay. So, yeah, that's the behavior that we have to control. So, let me do some remarks. Yeah, as I said here, we cannot expect just the number of boundaries. Let me write it down. Of boundary components is not the lower semi-continuous along Miemax sequences. Remote sequences. Okay, another remark that I want to make is about this connectivity assumption. So when the surfaces are not connected, connected. The right quantity is another one. Here's another one is the genus plus the number of boundary components, but we have to subtract the number of connected components with non-empty boundary. So I preferred for the talk just to speak to that case. Stick to that case, but just to know that it's not a problem. So, with an empty boundary, also, if you don't assume connectivity, and why this, because so this sigma j's can have like small disks that go and disappear at the limit, okay? And we don't want this to contribute so and. So, and like, so there are kind of spurious disks that this quantity sees, but that quantity doesn't. Okay, just as a remark. The other remark is that in the non-orientable case, the quantity that we can prove is lower than. The quantity that we can prove is lower semi-continuous is the first Betty number. And the first Betty number is more or less like more or less 2G plus B. So you see, this is kind of, I mean, this is a very, very general statement. General statement: assuming nothing. The first battery number is lower semicontinuous, but it's weaker for the applications. So we like to do, I know the proof is kind of easier, somewhat. But yeah, it's we care for the application. So that's actually really this behavior that you need to have in mind. Okay, what else I wanted to say? What else do I wanted to say? Yeah, I mean, as I said, also the equivariant version is possible. And maybe let me show you some applications of this. So maybe I can convince you that something that can make sense. Yeah, sure. Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. Maybe I go there. Does it work? I'll just walk back. When does it stop doing right now? Okay, so yeah, yeah. Right now, okay, so yeah, you can try to start on the call. Sorry, yeah, so uh, maybe I want to leave and start here. I want to leave the statement, but anyway, I will also have the slides on more or less. Um, I mean, let me know if you don't see something. So, thank you. Um, okay, so the first application is constructing three-boundary minimal disks. Constructing three boundary minimal disks in convex bodies. And this was already being done by Guruto Jost. So here, I mean, the sweepout is like, is like a one-parameter family. So it's like a curve of surface. A curve of surfaces that are all disks. Okay, so sigma j is topologically a disk. So the genus is zero and we have one boundary component. And I mean, actually controlling the topology in this case is easier. We don't need the full power of this theorem here because the disks are simply connected and this helps in the proof. But anyway, Proof. But anyway, with this, we obtain that the resulting free boundary minimal surface is a disk for free. Because we have lower semi-continuity of the genus, and we started with genus zero. So the genus of gamma is zero. And we have lower semi-continuity of the sum of boundaries and genus. But the genus is zero, so we obtain. Genome is zero, so we obtain that we have one boundary component. So, in convex bodies, let's say of R3, so we cannot have like zero boundary components because there are no compact minimal surfaces inside. Okay, so this is an application. And I mean, now there are, there have been like some other recent papers by Marcelo, Keto. Uh Marcelofer, Ketover and Maze, I think. Yeah, Maze Mendes. Doing more more, like more advanced things, Maze Mendes, like finding two free boundary memory disks or more in the generic, in the bumpy setting, or characterize the Or characterize the one with least area. But anyway, just saying that also in these cases, some sort of control of the topology is needed. And okay, it's a bit easier in this case, but we can use that. Okay, another application. Great. Okay, another application is I mean, we can use this to give another shorter proof of the existence of pre-boundary minimum surfaces in the unit ball with connected boundary. So this we have connected boundary boundary. So, some time ago with Alessandro Mario, we constructed these examples. So, these are the numerical simulations. And to do it, we set up a min-max set, like a min-max where the input surfaces at genus one and one boundary and let's say. And one boundary, and let's say genus, uh, any genus, so or like fixed genus gene and connected boundary. Okay, and we ran the min-max procedure to obtain a pre-boundary min-max surface. And the argument that we did back then was a doc for this topology. For this topology. But now, with this theorem, we add that the genus is less frequent than one. Sorry, than G. Let me maybe, let's do the crease of equal to one, which is easier to, so it's the first example here that we can do every genus, but it's a bit easier to think. So we have genus less or equal to one, and genus plus. Than one and genus plus number of boundary components less or equal than two in the limit because these are the values for sigma j. And so, okay, and from this, it's not difficult to see that actually we need to have the quality, but not as many details, but we can actually obtain exactly the qualities here. Yeah. And this is much faster than what we did because we really needed something for like adopt for this case to control the number of boundary components. Okay. Another application? Yeah. So here you have the required change that's going to look on star symmetric conditioning. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not saying because I don't want to be confusing, but for doing this, we are in an equipment. Um, we are in an equipped, we have to set up everything in an equivariant fashion. So, we need the group of isometries acting. So, you see, there are some symmetries for this object. Yeah, thank you. Um, yeah, exactly. Um, okay, so um, a third application. Um, so it's the following. So, what we obtain, let me state in this way, is like Let me state it this way: it's like the existence of a free boundary minimal surface in V3 with index phi. So, so far, so another property of a pre-boundary minimal surface that you can consider is the index, the number of negative directions of the area at second order. So, so far, we It's very hard to compute the index, and we don't actually know many examples in which we can compute it. We just know that the index of the equatorial disk that I showed you at the beginning is equal to one, and the index of the critical calculus is equal to four, and that's it. We don't know how to compute any other index. How to compute any other index. And with this method, now we can construct a freebond women service with index 5. How do we do? So, like another recent paper by Adrian Chu. So, we use this where Adrian constructed a five sweepout. So, it does a five parameters minimum theory. That is actually detecting also the algorithm pits, the fifth algorithms with okay. You can forget about this if you don't know what I'm talking about. So if I speak out of surfaces sigma j that have genus less three than one and Than one and genus last number of boundary components less or equal than two. So same as here, right? And so in the paper here of Adian, what he gets, it just says, okay, what we get is a surface with genus less or equal to one. But in this way, we can also control the number of boundary components. And what we can get is that the number. And what we can get is that the number of boundary components plus the genus is less frequent than two. Oh, sorry, I wrote again here. Okay, let me go yet. So, okay, what we can get is that with the pipe zip out, we get that a surface with A circuit with genus less or equal than one and genus plus number of boundary components less or equal than two, from which we can get, and I say just like this because actually this weep out as surfaces with many topologies, but they all satisfy this. And what we can get is that we have two possibilities. The first one is that we have genus equal to one and one boundary component. One boundary component, which is this subject, or we have topologically anomalous. But Adian says that in this case, select the critical cathoden, but which is not the critical catenoid. And the other thing is that since it's a five-swipped out, we also get that the index is less frequent than five. And these topological conditions, together with work of Dadiver, proves that the index should be actually five, cannot be less than that. So in this paper, it's the paper where Daviva computed the index of the critical catenoid. As a corollary, you can also get that if you have these topologies, then That if you have these topologies, then the index has to be fine. Okay, let me say just okay, we wanted to show you, I mean, I just maybe showed the picture of another application, which is this time based on a sweepout constructed by Keptover. We can apply this method and construct reboundary minimum surfaces that resemble... That resemble the doubling of the disk. So you have zero, zero, and as many boundary components as you want. Okay, maybe just in the last two minutes, let me just say the two ingredients for the proof. So So, the two ingredients, let me just write like this. Don't have much time. The first one is a surgery procedure. So, we start from the sigma j and what we do first is to see these long thin ribbons that disappear already. Disappear already at the limit. So we like through a surgery, which means really if we have like a tube like this, we can remove it and replace with two disks, same at the boundary. So we can obtain some other surfaces, sigma j tilde. And the good thing is that they are close to the limit. So they are contained in a neighborhood of the limit. So small neighborhood of limit. And the second ingredient is that at this point, what you can think is that sigma j tilde, very, very roughly, I mean, this is just the idea that one can have in mind, converge Converge smoothly, not really, but it behaves in this way smoothly away from it to be many points to the limit. So, after this surgery, what we get is that What we get is that, I mean, you can think like that the behavior of this sigma j tilde is a smooth convergence apart from finitely many points that behave badly. And the way that, I mean, the idea to implement this goes back to Simon Smith, which is a Lippin Lerma for curves. So you cannot really prove what I said before here, but you can prove that if you have a curve in the limit, If you have a curve in the limit, you can lift it to the surface sigma j. You have a curve in gamma, you can find the curve close by on sigma j tilde. I mean, I don't want to go over time, but so Simon Smith does this for closed curves, and we need to do this for curves connecting. Curves connecting points, so maybe this last part is if you already saw the Samos-Witting lemma somewhat. So the curves connecting points on the boundary of the limit. Okay, so points like what they were considered before. So you have your gamma limit and you have a curve like this. And we can leave that. Okay, so let me just stop here. Okay, so let me just stop here and thank you. Any questions for Alex? Yeah. But then he over here does improve gene accounts for annotation to account providers. Can you do something similar to that? Yeah, no, it's not clear. Clear. I think maybe with the betty numbers, lower semi-continuity, I think it's possible. This, I think, is more of a multiplicity one result. But, you know, in basically all the applications, the multiplicity is one. So, and this was stronger. So, we decided to state it, I mean, this as the main theorem. This is the main theorem. But I think, yeah, the other one that I stated, the lower semi-continuity of the Betty number can be adapted and do with multiplicity. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. This is Lustern Michniremann. It's in the paper of Advian Chu. It's a Luster Michigan Nirelmann argument. Argument is in the paper of Argiando. You know, it's like because the first width detects the equatorial disk, up to with four, you detect the critical catenoid. And so, since we are we have a file sweepout, we can prove that we obtain something more. Just because you have the picture up, so but it's it's not like it could still be one of these two cases, yeah. It can still be one of these two, but if the critical, yeah, this I didn't say, but if you know it's be it's believed that this does not exist, right? So, by the critical catenoid conjecture, this should not be possible. Possible. So the Ketena-Catenoid conjecture says that if you are topologically nanolus, then is the critical catenoid. So if that's true, this is not possible. And so what we get, which is actually what we expect, is that we really have genus one, one boundary component, index five, and this then. And index 5, and is the next the next free boundary minimum surface after these two. Yeah, equatorial disk, critical cathenoid, and that that. Yeah, yeah, thanks. Any more questions to John? But in your construction, do you know the index file is that or is that okay? Um, do you compute the index? No, no, no, no. Do you compute the index? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. So far, like there are some estimates, but one can compute the index only of equatorial disk and critical catenoid. And now we know this, that we have one of these two cases of the topology. But now, like of the one that we constructed time ago, we cannot compute the index. So yeah. Numerically, yes. numerically yes yeah yeah yeah numerically i mean yeah numerically matrix computing also so this is actually almost a minimum a free boundary minimum surface the sense that numerically the mean curvature is small an interceptor more protograph in the boundary and the index is five yeah numerically Oh, this thing got a good gift.
