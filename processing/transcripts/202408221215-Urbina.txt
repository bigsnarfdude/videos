Some variable the vector space. Okay, the whole stage is yours. Thank you very much. So this is okay. Okay, so first of all, thank you for the possibility to talk here. I'm very glad to be here. I'm very glad to be here and share with you. And I have field during the worship, it reminds me the fable of the elephant and the blind, right? That there were this group of blind people that didn't know the elephant, right? And then they start touching and each one has... They start touching, and each one has a different perception, right? So I will talk about the elephant from the harmonic analysis point of view. And I have confessed that I have tried to study and do the jump from, for instance, Luigi point of view. I admire Emmanuel that has been able to do that. I haven't done, I have been. I haven't done, I have been unable to do it so far, but I will try. I promise. Okay, so one of the main studies of harmonic analysis in the 20th century was the boundaries of classical operators in LP, the Vega space. And in the last 30 years, has been the The variable LP, variable Lebesgue spaces. But the case of the Gaussian variable spaces is a little bit more recent, like at the last 10 or 15 years. And so we have, well, a group of people have worked with the maximal functions in the very In the very various versions of the Gaussian singular integral has been extended to Lebesgue spaces. And then Gaussian risk potential and Gaussian Bessem potential were not done yet, until a couple of years ago. And for reasons that I hope you become clear, we need to consider for To consider for Gaussian risk potentials, the only way that is possible is the kernel approach. Or as a friend of mine says, the matchaway, right? You deal with the kernel directly, not with probability or things like that. That was Dick Gandhi, by the way. So, well, we have the Gaussian measure in Rd, and then we have the And then we have the normalized Hermit polynomials that are tensor product of one-dimensional Hermite polynomials. And then we have the Hermite polynomial, they are orthonormal and complete, and therefore is an orthogonal basis. And then we have the Orthodox unit of the operator that, yes, you can write it use as an inhibator and Inhalator and creation operator, as and is what is called the number operator, but we don't use, we haven't been able to use that in the theory. And they are also eigenfunctions of the Orthodox operator. And then you can decompose L2 in closed superspaces generated. Closed sober spaces generated by all the Hermite polynomials of the degree k, right? And they have this dimension. And then we have what is called the wiener chaos or etho-wiener decomposition of L2. And then we define the projections in L2 on the orthogonal. To the orthogonal projection over CK, right? And therefore, there is this nice way to write the expansion of any function in L and then, yes, these guys are the Fourier mid coefficients. Okay, so then we have the Austin-Ulimbeck semi-group that is generated by the By the Austin-Europe operator. So formally, p sub t is e to the minus p L. And then we can write the action over, since the remit polynomials are the eigenfunctions, then we have the spectral decomposition of the Ersting Ullenbeck in this form. And then we have to go to kernels. And then, thanks to Meller's formula, you can write the Ersten-Hulenbeck in this form explicitly, that putting together the Gaussian measure with the kernel can be written in this form. And then you realize that, or doing a change of variable, you can get it this way. You can get it this way. And from here, it's clear then that the Orston-Buyenbeck is kind of a perturbation of the heat semi-group, right? But it's not a convolution semi-group, because before anything, you have to expand or contract, you prefer the variable X and then do the convolution. Okay, so. Okay, so well it's well known for I think everybody that is here that this is a Markov operator semi-group is positive conservative symmetric diffusion semigroup strongly LP continuous and with the Orston-Ulenbeck operator as the infinitesimal generator and then yes is the parabolic solution of the parabolic equation. Solution of the parabolic equation. Oh, that was close. God, what? So the Orthodox-Ulenbeck is not only a contraction semi-group, but is hyper-contracted. That is, not only sends LP to LP, but sends to LP to LQ, where Q is exactly this guy, which is strictly bigger than P. Okay, so. So and then by the way because of and we are going to use that because of the hypercontractive property of the orthony unemployment it can be proved that the projections the j case are not only live make sense in l2 but they are continuous in lp and then uh we are going to introduce then in general To introduce, then, in general, Gaussian spectrum multipliers that is just multiplying the projections by a certain function m with complex value. One of the most basic results in Gaussian multiplier theory was a friend of A friend of Luigi, Paul Andre Meger, right? That thanks to the hypercontractivity, you see that if the M is of the form H1 over K to the alpha for some alpha bigger than zero, and you don't need to start at zero, but you can start at any point, then that spectrum multiplier will emit an extension that is L. Extension that is LP bound. And something that is nice is that this, the norm of the multiplier, is independent of the mean. Right? And we are going to call, whenever we have multipliers of this form, as in the theorem, we call them bigger multipliers. Yeah, but we are in the real analysis side. So we don't go to, yeah, but you are totally right. And there is an extensive area in that part. But I'm running out of time. Okay. Yes. So then, for instance, we have the maximum organ Europe semi-group and And it's easy to prove these days that T star is bounded in L P. You can get it directly from the Markov semi-growth theory, or you can do it by hand. Okay, and of course, if you know the LP boundedness of the maximal. Boundedness of the maximal function, then that implies, and we are going to talk about that later, that implies immediately the LP boundedness for the orthogene, right? But that's one way to get it. Additionally, we have the Poisson-Hermit semigroup that is subordinated with the Orton-Eulenbrex semi-group using the Bogner subordination formula. And then you get an explicit kernel. and then you get an explicit kernel for the Poisson semi- Poisson Hermit. And then it's easy to prove that it then is again a strongly continuous symmetric conservative semi-group with infinitesimal generator the square root of the orthogonal unit. And yes, we can define also the maximal function for the Poisson learning. Now for the Gaussian Bessel potentials, The Gaussian Bessel potentials are defined spectrally in this form, which means that if you put the Hermite polynomial, this means that you have this action over the Hermite polynomial. And then it can be proved that it has an integral representation of this form. Actually, there are two representations. Actually, there are two representations: one with respect to Poisson, one with respect to Hermit, but for the tradition in classical harmonic analysis, we do it with respect to Poisson. Well, this guy happens to be a major multiplier, right? Where the H is simply one over one plus square root of. over one plus square root of a raise to bet so is it so it's immediate from from multiply your theorem that this is lp continuous in the case of this has the advantage that the all the eigenvalues are different from zero but when you go to the grease potential Greece potential right are negative fractional powers of the or singular index operator that this should be capital L by the way but typo and then therefore because the orthogonal operator has eigenvalue zero we cannot define this in all L2 but we need to subtract the the the the part corresponding The part corresponding to the eigenvalue of zero. And again, you can say that, well, here, this is one of the problems of copy and paste. Now I changed the notation because I am using beta over two. I apologize for that. Okay. But the action then, in any case, is one over the modulus of the multi- modulus of the multi-index to beta to the square root of to the square root right so when you want to when you try to get a kernel you get this in a integral representation that you you need to subtract uh the the component of the eigenvalue zero right corresponding to the eigenvalue zero and Value zero. And it's still Mayer's multiplier, actually, is the simplest one because then you only have the identity as an A. But then when you get to, you can get a kernel for this. And this term corresponds precisely to the subtraction of the part of the eigenvalue C. Of the part of the eigenvalue C. Okay, so all these operators then are LP with respect to the Gaussian. Not my fault. Not my fault. So, what can we say about variable Lebesgue space? Well, variable Lebesgue spaces is, I mean, for a long, long time, there was this intention to extend harmonic analysis for Erliex space, but the results are scattered. There were not that many because there was. Many because there was kind of not enough structure there, is my interpretation, by the way. But then, as I said, the variable Lebesgue spaces is a particular case of the Orlix in which you have more room to get the result, right? So, of course, the idea is simply that instead of P constant, you want to put P a function, right? function, right? And then you have any function that goes from Rd to one infinity, we call it exponent functions. And then you take the essential infimum, this is P minus, and the essential maximum, the sexual supremum is the P plus for any subset. And well, if you don't specify, you are taking all You don't specify, you are taking all Rb. That's a general, because this is a general measure, arbitrary measure. Not probability necessary now. Actually, the first generalization in this direction was using mu delevémation, right? Okay, but of course, if you want to do analysis, you need the cannabis. You need that cannot be simply a measurable function, so you need to have some regularity. So, I will not go into too much detail. So, you need that the alpha, oh, here again is the cut and paste. Alpha should be P is log holder continuous, right? Right and that also you require some control at the infinity, so this is log holder continuous at infinity, are these two conditions. So you require that and then we say that an exponent function function is in this case is in PD log if also the inverse is log holder continuous. And then as in the traditional case of Orlix you define what is the modular based on this integral expression, right? Right? Where this guy, by the way, is where the function p is infinity, the omega infinity. So you define this where it makes sense and then you add an L infinity in the part in which the function is infinity. The function is infinite. And then, using what is called the Luxembourg norm, you define the LP variable, LP variable, where these guys are divided by F for some land, divided by lambda. For some lambda, this is finite, right? And this is the Luxembourg norm where this. Nor where this is less or equal than okay, so this is a crash course in variable Lebesgue spaces, but of course we were interested in the case that mu is precisely the Gaussian main. Right? So for instance, it was proved by several authors like Several authors that the maximum taking the Lebesgue measure, the maximal Hardy-Littlewood function is bounded in space. And this class of exponent is sufficient also for the LP boundedness for the classical singular integrals of Calderon sigmund type. So, the story of with respect to Gaussian variable Lebesgue spaces start with a paper by Stefania Delmaso and Roberto Scotto that they introduce an additional condition. So, the conditions for the general measure was not enough because, well, we know that the Gaussian measure is very centered around. Comp is very centered around the origin, right? So they introduced this condition in I think 2017 and they proved that the singular integrals, Gaussian singular integral were L P bound. So, and it turns out that this condition is crucial for the proof of any other operator. Proof of any other operator. So it's so we have two results. We prove that the maximal function is LP bounded in variable space. And as a consequence of this, we have that, yes, then the Orston Eulingbeck is LP. The worst thing you linger is LP bounded because I have to confess that when I saw the paper of them, they say, Well, they are proving the third type of operator, if you wish. But what about the semi-group? There was nothing about that. And I wrote to Roberto and says, I don't know. We haven't think about it. So I say, well, let's work on that. So, and here there is a problem, though, because this constant is. Because this constant is bigger or equal than one. So this constant is bigger or equal than one. So the orthonormal semi-group in LP variable spaces is LP continuous, but that's trivial, but we don't know whether it's actually a contraction. And if it's not a contraction, much less is hypercontractive. This is completely obvious. So, this is completely open, right? And we don't know whether it's necessary, strictly necessary, or it's just a matter of the techniques that we use, right? So an open PhD thesis could be the major multiplier theorem for in LP variable, right? If that makes sense somehow, right? If that makes sense somehow, right? Because even try to make sense of the Qt is not easy. Okay. So, but from there, because of the subordination, you get immediately, from that result, you get immediately that the Poisson is also continuous and the vessel is also continuous. Is also continued. But so, conclusion: the boundaries of the maximal function t star give us the continuity that null contractivity of the osteoulenbec semi-group, of the Poisson Hermit semigroup, and the vessel potentially in LP variant. So, the natural question is: what happened? This was a this is with This was a thesis with Jorge Moreno in Venezuela. And well, he's still teaching at Universidad Centro Occidental, but he leaves not from the salary because the salary is like $30 per month. So he sells these days cheese. Okay, what happened? So, what remains is what happened for the risk potential, right? So, the risk potential, we cannot apply the same trick simply because the kernel is not positive. So, the second result that I just want to mention is that we are able to prove this. That yes, it's still LP bounded, but going into deep into the kernel, right? And with blood, sweat, and tears, right? Because we obtain that, we send it for publication. We haven't convinced anyone to publish the paper yet, but it's available on our key, right? So. So, this theorem also gives us an alternative proof of the risk potentials in L P, because of course, trivially, P constant is in the class of exponents that are available, right? But of course, the constant is dependent on dimension, right? And it has the B has to be. Has the B has to be strictly bigger than one. So there are some restrictions for that. Okay. Both proofs follow the same scheme, which is nowadays a standard in Gaussian harmonic analysis. That is you split the operator in two parts, right? What is called the local part, in which you control the Gaussian and then the Gaussian. And then the Gaussian is essentially constant. And guess what? What do you see there is a classical operator. And the global part, which is away from there. So if you consider what we call proof. You said you gave a definition of variable Lebesgue. Yes. But I'm not seeing this definition. I'm not seeing this definition. What is here? I mean, the I mean, this definition was, this is the general definition for mu, right? For any mu with these conditions over p. So the Gaussian, well, probably a good point. The Gaussian Levego spaces is because the exponent is a function. Right. So you need to use this definition, that is what is called Luxembourg norm in the Ehrlich theory, because of course you can raise to p to the x, but you cannot take the p to the x but you cannot take the the square root the the the the pth one the pth root of a variable function that doesn't make sense so that's why you have to take this define first the the modular this is the modular and then you use this trick of the luxembourg norm oh it's not the norm no the norm is this here is the infimon of the lambda such that this Of the lambda such that this f over lambda, the modules are evaluated, and f over lambda is less or equal than one. But of course, I gave previous conditions about the exponent, right? But as I said, then for the Gaussian, you need to add this additional condition. Conditional condition. Okay, so as I was saying, then, what do you do? You split the operators in two parts. You first consider what are called admissible or hyperbolic balls that are defined in this way. Defined in this way. Well, there are equivalent definitions, but this is so. And the idea of this ball is that you can control the Gaussian measure there. For balls like this, the infimum and the maximum of the Gaussian multiplier can be controlled. And then you split, say, for instance, the orthodox. Say, for instance, the orthogene in two parts: T0 is integrating over the ball and T1 is integrating in the complement of the ball. And therefore, then, of course, in the case of the maximal function, these are the operators that you need to see. This is the one. This is the one that you will be able to see that is essentially a classical operator, maximal operator. But this is the one that give you problem. Similarly, because of that, since here you are using the You are using the classical theory, that part is easy because it's using already well-known theory. But this one is the one that take you a while to be able to prove. In the case of the risk potentials, well, you do the same, you take defining the local theorem. The local term, the local part where and the global part. So of course, again, the local part here, what you are going to see is a classical risk operator potential, but here this is a really complicated. Complicated for us was, I mean, Roberto and Stefania proved the classical and the LP variable boundedness of the RIS singular integrals. We prove with the same technique another class that is what we call alternative singular integrals. Singular integrals. And but the proof of this is even this is the basis of, I mean, the risk potentials and the basic risk transforms, risk singular integral is negative the minus L to the negative To the negative alpha over 2, and you take the derivative of this. Those are the Gaussian risk transforms. So you are using the Risk potentials here. But the proof of these guys happens to be more difficult to prove it. Well, we suspect that a nicer proof should be possible, but we didn't find it. But don't worry, it's about time to have lunch. I will not torture you with any computation. So, this is just like an overview of the topic, right? So, here is the paper by Talmaso and Escotto that opens up the area and So, here is our paper about general alternative Gaussian singular integrals. This is the paper for the maximal function. And this is the one that we have been struggling to publish about the reason. Okay, so let me just thank you your attention and let me. Your attention, and let me give some propaganda about my book. Thank you very much, Fredo, for the nice talk. And are there any questions or comments? Okay, thank you. So, in particular, this includes the LP boundedness of the risk transform, right? No. No, no, we have proof different because this for the Ristant forms, you need to take the derivative of the potential. That's not included. And actually what happened is that our proof for this is more difficult to prove the global part than what is for the single integer. And that doesn't make much sense, right? But it is what it is because it's the problem of. Because it's the problem of the non-positivity of the kernel. So we have to be very careful about that. Okay, thank you. Any other questions, comments? I have a very simple question. So as maybe you know, what was the original motivation for passing from LP spaces to LP variable spaces? To LP variables in general, yes, well, uh, one of the main authors in that area is David Cruz-Riben. And well, it was just, well, there are applications. Actually, they have a book. They have this book, there are two books. This book, there are two books about variable Debecke spaces in general, the one of Rusurive and Firenza in 2013 and this one. And actually, in the book by Kruzori, there are some motivations in certain problems, but I'm a few mathematics. But I'm a pure mathematician, I'm sorry. Thank you very much. If there are no other questions or comments, well, I think we can thank the speaker at once. Thank you. It's in my nature.
