Yeah, so this uh I'll explain if you're something alright. Um so you have to like have the error attention to the matrix that we need to find. And here we have armatrix. In UQP we don't have arm matrix. But what you're saying is that for those things which are specific. It's not the same thing on the T size as well. It's the same thing on the T side. Well, I guess not just close. Yeah, yeah, and then it's a little bit more. But in practice, how they usually show up is either or somewhere near the boundary, you just have like a little T-reach and mobility outwards. Yeah, so yeah, this one you understand. I mean how I guess I don't understand how the big parts are coming together. It is kind of just taking a shit. No, no, no, they they do come to us. So the quasi-coherent we mean quasi-coherentially after stuff. So Yes, article here are just motivated to talk about the same category, right? The action is the is like your two defined actions could be technically the same. So I mean we have the chronological person. If you want like a general position, actually it's consulted in so many sectors. Well, frankly, what I know is soft for SOP just for my concept for Maybe there's some other sort of examples, but I think we're going to be able to do it. I would say not much of the other side. Well, I don't want to say it so I guess if you look at the document, right, with like the T here on the doctor, that you can just get, there's some way of cooking up an algebra from it. And that algebra is both generated by the Jones polynomial and looks like the Val algebra on button. So it would be, it's like the conjecture would be there's a specific algebra we can cook up using this, which is generated by Claudio Jones for cyclotrie quantity. Are you saying you have substantial reformization of HM conjecture in the version? Well, I mean I understand you can put it in your language like sort of plastic or Yeah, we do transl it would be translated popular language about presentations and certain modules and stuff like this. But I think it's it's not we're not it's not like yeah we have to figure out this stuff. There's something more. This isn't a publisher part because there's some instance in which this defect should be long that sometimes you can converge it and get rid of it and that needs a bunch of pirate gun here and you have to go through it. So let me ask you this. So how do you write? How many papers are you writing? So, how many papers are you writing? One, two, or three on this subject? Um, two actively, and then if the AJ conductor goes somewhere, it's a distant third. So basically, this will be a paper. The defects will be a paper. Yeah, the defect is a paper. Oh, actually, there's four because we're proving that the scan category thing is given by stratified factorization homology. We're just meeting the system, right? Okay. So, why would we just have it? So, why would we discount it? But yeah, so why don't we disappear? This field. Yeah, so why would it be disappear? There's one with just some technical stuff that you don't care about to be six year old. Okay. And then there would be one of how to use this to quantize the A polynomial. That one's hard because we want to include with it like actual computation of the point of the A polynomial and there's a way you should be able to do it by stratifying the three maps for it. We're not so triangulating three maps for it. And you should. And computing it for the tetrahedron and all of it together, and we have some in like dependence on triangulation that we can all assign here, but we can't figure it out because it's just sage code stuff. So there's that one cause for insane staring at me. Alright, well I will wait for the papers. Before you did this defect version, Before you did this defect version, and we would take your scheme category and take the animorphisms of the empty set, then you got the scheme algebraic. Which was a, you could say it was the quantization of the coordinate negative category. Then you get the algebra. I think you would just, you could just, oh, I don't know about that, but you would just walk through the same definition of the same algebra, but you'd have to. To be an algebra, but you'd have to stratify here, right? Like it would be an analogous object. Through and write out this up, so you might just staring at the ceiling because this picture, what you would get in the three-manifold case, is still the character variety, but what you would say is that some subset of one manifold passed the variable. So here it would be like an octopus. Like the whole character writing, so if this is like a compliment, it's like an absolute monotony. They say this peripheral something has to be Peripheral subject has to lay. That's what you'd be quantizing, and that's one of the reasons we keep this with the eight-poller, because that is what they work with in the definition of colour. So it'd be like you'd say some subset and some colour. But if you had just like this, like a surface with some fun manifold embedded in it, you wanted to click the algebra, but you could see something. That seems like you'd be able to push everything back in. Push everything back into the G reg. If you have closed loops that are not topologically disturbed somewhere, I could just shove them into a GNS part. Yeah, I think this could be. I think you'd actually get it. Right, if you take a surface with, I'm thinking a surface with punctures on the boundary and you're putting those T regions around each punctures, this is the same as the usual Is the same as the usual, I think this usual quantization of the typefuller space, or I don't know how you want to use things, but this contains the skein algebra, like T regions for doing absolutely yeah well so the T regions what they do is set up is they're saying fix a flag, like realize that puts a point set, fix a flag compared to that. So it would be like you have a surface and you have its punctures and you have a local system and a converting flag and there's actually There's actually a paper called Ordinary Child for March. I heard everything we talked last year, so this so one way we could like characterize this is that we're taking these clung to decorated character sets and making them scale. So the underlying skein category should be saying they don't have skein modulation, but it's not clear how do you get these what you do or what you have to hold. So that's what the skein description is. A general subject would just have that field. So here's the problem: B is it a greater term. So if you want, so if you are trying to make a state theory with these three-dimensional tables, like you have to clarify every category in order to evaluate and make sense. And with B is fine because you need to have all this. Yeah, yeah, we have to go it's just pivotal, so it can just be on the surface, it can't be I mean it can be basically it could be people how would you not have process I mean basically I think whatever we need coming down to something like that. Yeah, you should have the sheet go down lower. I'm guessing it's not complicated enough. You should also have a way to go between different URLs. So you should have some sort of extra layer of the defects you need if you want to do um like quantum trace map sort of stuff. Wait, wait, wait, this is I mean, why why do I mean, why in yellow? What is the beak line? Different colours. Two different brails. But why would you represent it later? Why would you colour a line like this? I would imagine that you have different arcs with different boreals. Yeah. Yeah, yes. There's a... Oh, sorry. Yeah, I guess this is also. Also online. Or here is maybe I don't see. Yeah, yeah, it's very. And this is like from the planet from the from the file. I think it's not clear, it's the file remote. I heard it from comic because I think it's unnecessary. Did you want bright colours? White. I make use of that. No, I'm just curious. Yeah. You might think the board before is smart. I'm not sure I can do that. No, it's just I. Sorry, I had a scary plan out what would go everywhere. Basically is the is the going from G to T to B? Two yeah, one blueword image where it's a different circle. I don't know maybe I'm just curious what is the one dimensional blueberry kind of oh yeah, my guess would be so associated so these are you know so I think. You know, so I think the G and T are both like G and T alphabets and really cool. What are you talking about? Okay, deductive. Yeah, so they both like what we had here was like we had two different categories and we had maps like this on a categorical region of the body. So one division lower, I would expect to have two associated. Dimension lower, I would expect to have two associated algebra. Yeah, but that's what I would expect from a dimension lower. It's going to be true. But it's not something that you know and that this whole comes from that intuition. No, I think the category theory, I think it came from this intuition. Like these things are like the one algebra we have. Two algebra we have, and one of the two is corresponding to each, and the other side is by all that's. And it's cute. You like to be a little cute. I keep having a package. Like I won once and um yeah anyway, um it's been it's nice in the summer. It's been it's nice in the summer. Like I think it's July. Yeah, so I mean does he have the simple decisions? I don't know, I have to check if I can make it. They can say yeah and they may I have to see another Yeah, and then maybe I have to see a moment speeding up some of the time. And then we're just doing this. No, but it's just it's it's not just like the person, like the and then all of a sudden all these things. Yeah, it's really learning about this person. Oh, you know what? I can do it. So why can't I session? I can do it because I'm going to put in Grand Rather than me and then it's not personal and it doesn't matter. How does it do? Yeah. I don't know if I've Sure, sure, sure. You know, if you want literally and I think that's what we have.    And I apologize if I should think that we get to be putting information. So I was going to ask audience topic. I mean, we don't like it.  Today, yeah, that's Thursday. I just want to get water in all the coffee all over. They don't want baby matches.
