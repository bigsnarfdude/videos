I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to the beautiful band, also for the opportunity to present my research here in this conference. So this talk is essentially a continuation of the talk of Maxime. So let me first fix or repeat the notation of a field F. And now let me denote by g S a classic split group by the screen-single algebraic group over F. And also, let me just from the very beginning fix a A boreal subgroup inside of this quasi-speed group. The typical examples, there are mainly four examples here. So AM2, DN2, D62, and D43. So the exceptional, the two exceptional cases and two classical cases related to Cases related to unitary groups and to orthogonal groups, but with a non-trivial discriminant. Well, there is also G46. Yes, but it can be reduced to this one or this one. So it's looking these at the These are the most rich cases. So let me just recall what, I mean the formula, what Maxime just told you about the motive in the inner case, when G is not quasi-split, but split. So then let us take some three toes. Three torts are over F. And so then we considered the variety of Orl subgroups, so finite coefficients, and then it was a decomposition of this kind. That's why I changed a little bit the notation. The notation, because I like these notations more. So we have an indecomposable motif and the one correct polynomial of this motif has a very nice shape. So if you pass two splitting fields, so then we have a formula. These kinds of product of polynomials which look a little bit like cyclotomic polynomials. So, this was in the inner case when G was split. So, now what happens if G's class is split? So, unfortunately, So, unfortunately, first of all, this is not true. It's not true that the motif of E-mode B consists of shifts of the same motive, the same and decomposable motive. Actually, sometimes it's true, sometimes it's not true. Say it in this way. Moreover, even if it's true, or even if it's not true, you don't have four. You don't have formulas. I mean, sometimes you have, but sometimes you don't. So, formulas like this: product of polynomials of this type. So, moreover, if we look more precisely into the proof of this isomorphism in the inner case, then there is an exact sequence of Grotendieck and it plays a crucial role in the proof. It's a crucial role in the proof, namely the following one. This is for split groups. So BB is the classifying space of B. And well, if you write here quasi-split, then it's not exact. If it's split, it is. So you see not only the statement but also an important step in the proof, but it doesn't work. So all this is very frustrating. And now I explain what one should do to recover all these nice numerology and also to recover from all these kinds. This can be fixed. And for this For this, let me give you one definition. So, we can keep it here for a while. Not exact in general definition. So instead of chow rings, let us consider the normal chow rings. So in these cases here, we have our ground C of F, but we have also some extension over F of degree. Or what F of degree 2 or 3, which is a part of the structures. So it's given from the very beginning. So actually, we have some finite field extension. So let me give a definition. So in this situation, if we have a field extension, a separable field extension, definite And some smooth variety X over F, we can define the normed Chowlings Max, which we denote like this. I have to stress K as the ordinary showing of X moduli. Showing of X modular Nanzial of the following type. So take all intermediate subfields between F and K and so then there is a So then uh there is a natural map from x over e, so x, and you take it's push forward and the image, the models. So these are normal showrings. So the normal showering of x. You could write direct sum, but like sum. I know what I don't know how to write it, but I know what the functions are. Well, actually, we have a quadratic, I mean practically speaking, we have only a quadratic and cubic field extension. So there is only one field. So that's what is a direction. Yeah, but what I'm talking you, it's true also for any simple groups. If you have such fields of coupon degrees, you'll try. Well, even this is zero. Are the directs are inside the let me give you um some example how this ring ring looks like. How this ring ring looks like. So example, and again, I would like to compare the split case with the quasi-speed case. So for the split case, you take the ordinary towering, and for the quasi-split case, And for the quasi-split case, this version. Let us take again for the same variety as before, and quasi-split or split, two cases. So if we decide to describe this ring, say, is an abelian group. Is an abelian group. So it's a free, so we have a free abelian graded. And its Poincaré polynomial is null. So the Poincaré polynomial is given by the theorem of Solomon, and it looks like And it looks like t i minus one, t minus one, one n. So n, it's the rank of g and ei's are very famous. These are degrees of fundamental polynomial index. So what happens in the quasi-split case for the norms child groups? The answer is as follows. It's almost like this, but a little bit different. So we have two types. So maybe I should say plus. Maybe I should say plus and then the same product, not the same, but looking similar, ones with minus and one times with plus. So a funny thing, and then if you, I mean, this is a Poincaré polynomial, so its coefficients should be non-negative. So this is okay, but this is, I mean, if you divide, the coefficients can be negative. The coefficients can be negative, but they compensate. So the final result, all coefficients are non-negative. What are these parameters? Sorry, this is for AN2, DN2, and E62. So this par this so let me give you an example in the case DM2. Is dm2. So it looks like. So this fundamental polynomial invariance have degrees 2, 4, 6, then 2n minus 2 and n. So the Drinking diagram looks like this. And now let us fold this diagram. When we fold it, we get the root system Vn minus 1. One in the picture. So the fundamental polynomial invariants, the same numbers for Bn minus one are two, four, fixed, CO2, and minus two. And now you see the difference. So these are EI plus and this one, the difference, it's The difference is i minus. So there is only one in this case for di such a funny formula. For the missing case, D34, so the answer is as follows. Plus a split it's like this. And again, you see two and six here. These are the degrees for G2, which is not surprising because by default D4. D4 three times. You get G2. And if you look here, well, then maybe you recognize that one correct polynomial of the prosth motif as precisely these four. For symbols in H3 modulo 3. Of course, it's not a coincidence. There is an explanation why this like this. But still, it's very strange because this is purely combinatorial story. Actually, you can find almost these formulas when you open the book. When you open the book of Carta, finite groups of V-type, but close to the end, it will look very similar, almost like this. And of course, there is also an explanation for that. Well, so this is just an example. So uh I forgot to say this is also a three abelian group. Sorry. Sorry. These these two products that you wrote, are they supposed to be polynomials? Both of them, or are they supposed to be polynomials? Yes. So minus is odd or? The right-hand side? How can that be a polynomial? Well, if you divide, the final result is a polynomial. It only can be a polynomial if minus one at the root of it. But it's not. But it's it is no no, the other ones. I don't know. There are no separate people. But here that was my question. Are they separately polynomial per month? Not in this case, but altogether it's a polynomial. But sometimes they are if n is even. Well, when you do it like this, so if you replace everything, all ordinary child groups by the north child groups, then indeed everything works. So, first of all, indeed. So this normal shell mode, actually, P should be 2 or 3. It's the most interesting case. So it's indeed a direct sum of copies of the same indecomposable normal model. Motive and moreover, when we consider this exact sequence of Rottendrig, so let me for simplicity assume from the very beginning that the G is adjoint. So G quarter split of B quasi split. So it's exact, indeed. So it's recent result to Pananovsky. And moreover, also this is subjective as it was also. Objective as it was also before. And actually, this ring here exactly. We forgot K. K everywhere. So the normal, which how it works. And so this is a Hopf algebra, exactly as it was in the speed case. And it can be actually computed. And it looks exactly as in the top of the case. Exactly as in the top of Maxi, but with different parameters. So it looks like Fp, then some generators, and then relations of the form like this. Of course, it's unknown. We need to calculate R and Kr. As soon as we As soon as we, and if we know them, then the same proof as in the split case proceeds, and there is no difference between split and quasi-split. So it fits into the same scheme. So what remains is to compute these parameters and also the co-dimensions of xi, which you know by d i. They know the DR. So they should also be explicitly computed in all these cases. And this can be done, but the arguments are slightly different. I mean, sometimes even very much different, so depending on the time. So let me sketch just a very rough idea what arguments are used. So let me first take these two cases for exceptional groups. Exceptional groups. So for exceptional groups, first of all, they are not very big because the rank is, it's not like E8. It's only E6. And you can do it just computing with definition, if you want. Of course, I did it to be sure. But if you need some But if you need some actually when you do it, you arrive at the following answer. So for E62, the answer is, I mean this answer, is the same as for E7 and for T4K, the same as for F4. And of course, it's again not a coincidence. There is an explanation. There is an explanation for this, and the explanation is: so, this, so there are embeddings, I said G is adjoint, but in this case it doesn't matter, so we can assume it's simply connected. Then there are embeddings, and they have Rost multiplier one. So the Rost invariants of them are the same, so are compatible. So that's the explanation why we get the same answer. For example, for E62, the answer will be Rs3, D1, DI R359, and Ki are all one, one, one, not one. Actually, the final story, this five and nine, it's also not by chance, but there is an explanation why it's five and nine. Explanation why it's five and nine, and it is related to the variety E7 modulus seven. So, if you look at the child group, then codimensions five and nine are special. So, you will get, these are precisely codimensions when you get, when the rank increases by one. So you get so three not but five and nine. Five and nine, and you can actually write it. Relate it. Just to compare in the case of E6, the E61, so the answer was R is 1 and the D1 is 3 and K1 is 1. So completely different. Much smaller. Different, much smaller. Well, so this is the situation with exceptional groups and for classical groups. So the unitary type is a little bit more complicated than the orthogonal type. And it looks as follows. So let me consider this unitary case. So in this case, In this case, we have a central simple algebra over K in the unitary evolution. So let me say the case K M2 and the degree of B is M plus 1. Remember, we also have a quadratic extension. Quadratic extension in case a quadratic extension of n. So now some special cases were actually known before. So if n is even or if n is odd, but be split So these cases were known by Finot in a slightly different way, but it's equivalent. So actually in this case we don't need to do anything, we just refer to phenomena. But if n is odd and b is arbitrary, so it's more tricky. It's more tricky and for this case, It's more tricky, and for this case, we use the same idea as the idea of Maxine from the last talk. But not quite, because this is a central simple algebra, not over F, but over K. So instead of this, we use the Weil restriction. So it looks approximately, roughly speaking, as follows. Just an idea. We consider the while distribution of the separate variety separate algebra of this algebra. separate algebra of this algebra times, well, let me call it maximal unit in Cosmen. Well, so n is what, by the way, in this case, let me denote it by 2m plus 1. So then this maximum unit regression is of Unit regressmanium is of the type AM2 module P, if I computed it correctly, m plus 1. If n is 1, m is 1, yeah, looks good. The middle point on the Dinkin diagram. Well, and now, also, it's very similar to what Maxime. What Maxim was telling, we need to understand how the rational cycles look like on this product. But it's a little bit tricky because we understand some sort of temperature, and the difficulty is that it can happen, and it happens actually, that we take some non-rational cycles here. I can't take it times one, and this is rational. So it can happen, and it gives, so it changes the answer for the JNA. But in the opposite way, it can't happen. And then this part, it was almost essentially the same as. Essentially, it's the same as what we noted. And so, this part, the contribution of this part to the J invariant, requires some work. It's related to the index reduction formulas as before. And the final answer is that I just write down the final answer, the formula, it's like this.  So this is, I mean, this part is the part of Finot plus the contribution from the first term, it's another generator of degree 2, of codimension 2. Of codimension two, modulo this relation where k is such that we take the highest power of two, which divides this number. But this will be the number k in this presentation. And the orthogonal case can be done in an analogous way using some computations of Alexander Wichit instead of computations of Final. Computations of phenomena. So, thank you for your attention. Questions? So, what's the easiest explanation for these coincidences for such long groups? Uh one should write a couple of exact sequences. I can I mean it's it's not I mean it's not quite short. But well, if you first you recognize that you have already seen these numbers and then several days of thinking you find an interpretation. I mean it's it's it's I mean all these minimalogies very philosophy. Do you have explicit formulas in some examples for the new how to compute? Compute is six, for example. If you take a group, like an algebra with evolution, can we place J1 for instance in terms of the same? Yeah, for small degrees, so if you think the degree is one or two, like this, A1 over here, A2, so one, then there are precise formulas in many situations. Say it like this. Let's say for author E6. Alter E6, you can describe in terms of the Rost invariant. So depending on the Rosten. So I think it's even one-to-one correspondence between the J invariant and some properties of the Rost invariant. Like the symbol length. Is it the previous symbol? Is it the sum of two symbols? Is it sum of more than two symbols? I think it's one to. I think it's one to one. Other questions? Oh, let's think the current principle, in theory, we would start again in one minute, but. But I've been given special dispensation for a slightly longer break. So we'll start in three minutes. No, it's good. Ten hours. Well, five hours would be a one.
