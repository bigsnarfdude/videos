Little chapter there. It's called semi-geometric patterns by Jay Bonner, and it is here that I first saw this pattern. And here bookmark, let's see. Very poor bookmark. There we go. Yep. So, just to show you a little bit of where we're going to go, we're going to go for this pattern right here. If you have the book, it's on page 44. page 44 and there's a little uh background there written on on why it's systematic and where this pattern might um might be significant historically and geometrically etc etc it's a great book it's a great pattern and so okay so we're off into constructing it might as well make the most of time so all right first things first we're gonna need a square so i have here a rectangular piece of paper uh depending on if you're in europe mexico the Depending on if you're in Europe, Mexico, the United States, the size will change invariably. We're going to get a square anyway, so it doesn't really matter. Start by putting the short edge onto the long edge. If you already have a square, then you can skip this step entirely. By the way, thank you for the opportunity to teach you this. I'm very grateful and I hope you enjoy it. We rip out the square. So here I am using the Using the, I wish I was as good as Sarah's remembering my axioms, but the one that says that if you put a line onto itself, you get a perpendicular line. So here I'm just making sure that this line matches to itself, and then I get a perpendicular. Maybe it's the second or third axiom. So we're going to follow Tom Hall's construction like we did yesterday, but with little changes, sort of where I put in my style, where we Sort of where I put in my style, where we can skip entirely steps nine onwards. If you have the Tom Hall instructions, you can find that online. There's an article you can rarely find in his book, Project Origami, or in his other book, Origametrix, I think it's called, or something like that. It's the newest Tom Hall book. There's a chapter there on constructing heptagons. Anyway, we have here the square, and so we begin the Tom Hall construction. We fold this in half vertically and horizontally. So that's one we unfold, and that's two. Now, any little mistakes will compound, so you gotta make sure that you are as accurate. Are as accurate as you can be. Now, at the end of the day, the intention is what counts. So, even if you're not perfect, it don't matter too much as long as you can keep your Tom Hall. It's Tom H-U-L-L, Tom Hall, or Thomas Hall, I suppose. So, once we have the two by two grid, we now fold two quarters. So, going to be here or here, it could be either way. But you want to be able to fold like this one first into it. First, into it, me personally, sometimes I feel that I can see the mountains better than I see the valleys, so it really is a matter of preference here. I'm going into the valley side, but usually I go the other way. So that's one, and that's two. By the way, sometimes I fold a little bit too fast, I get excited. So, if I go a little bit fast, feel free to unmute. Little bit fast, feel free to unmute, tell me oh, and I'll and I'll stop or go slower. So we combine those folds now. Sorry that I rotate around too much. This is also one of the problems of teaching origami that the figure changes quite a bit with the orientation flipping around so much. So we combine these, right? And now we want half of this. So you can either do it like Sarah did yesterday, which I kind of like because. It's like Sarah did yesterday, which I kind of like because it takes away from the error that might compound. So I'm unfolding and I'm folding now the edge to the quarter. So from here there. You can leave this folded too, but again, optional. Like that. Yeah. Yeah, we combine these now, and it might actually help in this position to turn it over in order to have these be hidden and not get in the way of our construction. So, I'm just going to simply turn it over, and the information is the same. So, now I'm going to be wary or be aware of this point right here, this eighth, and this fourth. This fourth actually, this is the line of the middle, but then we're going to take these and we're going to fold them onto the origin lines, so the horizontal and vertical origins. So take these two points and fold each of them to their respective. So this is line one. Point one falls on line one. Point two falls on line two. So right there is my point one, and over here is my point two. Sometimes what I My point two. Sometimes what I like to do is I will set only one point and then pivot the rest of the paper over. So once one solved, all right, then the second one needs to be solved, and I pivot. I find where I need to be for my second point to land on the desired line. So there and there. And once that's done, I simply fold. It usually happens that these layers on top will want to get away from you, but it doesn't matter because the real objective is underneath. Underneath. So even if these look a little bit out, it really doesn't affect our construction. So now we unfold. No, wait, we don't. We mark a point here, right here. So where your edge is on the line. I like to do this by pencil, by a marking, but you can also just pinch it for whatever you want to do. But the point is that exactly where this point comes into contact on the line, we want Into contact on the line, we want to draw perpendicular. Is that clear? No, not clear at all. Okay. Did we get to this? No, not either? No, okay. So I'm going way back, way back. Should I start over? I'm wondering. Okay, we started with our half here. Now, this is the quarter, the half-quarter. The half quarter and the quarter over here. These two points. Can you find these two points on your square? Could you go back a little bit? Sorry, I'm way behind, so I might have missed some things. Okay, okay, yeah, we can go back. Can we just pause for a minute? I don't know. I'm just want to catch up. So I need to start by folding in half both directions. Sorry. Sorry. No, no, no. I got really hungry and I had to go more. Get food. So I was trying to fold and get food at the same time and it didn't really work. So maybe I should just be behind. I don't know. Well, I think it's good to reiterate these instructions because we're going to get several heptagons either way. So we can use the other one for. We can use the other one for more hectagons. So, first step was to get the square. In my case, I just really drive the nail into it. Weaken the fibers. There we go. We have the square, and now we want to fold. We have the square, and now we want to fold the vertical and horizontal half. So that's my horizontal. Just making sure that the vertices are lining up properly. Hold on the vertical. So far, so good. We fold now one side in half and the other side in half as well. Half and the other side in half as well. So this one you fold onto the half. You see how this parallel, this edge of the square falls on the half. That once, we unfold, and we do it for the top side as well. So far so good? Yeah. Okay, now you take the bottom edge and you put it onto the quarter we got on top. Take the bottom edge and you put it over here. And you unfold. So far, so good. Alright, so now origami is tricky business in that there's two sides to the paper. So go ahead and put a pencil on a pencil point. On a pencil point on these two points. It's the one that goes from the origin. That would be a, if this is zero and this is one and this is two, that would be a zero, one. Well, maybe it's two really here, but it doesn't matter where that hits and where this one hits over here. On the fold, we just did these two points. And if it helps, scry them on both sides, but just make sure that they are like that so that my So that might help you. If it also helps you, you can also very not subtly, what's the word? Tenue in Spanish. But just like very subtly, just write in the vertical and horizontal if it helps as well. So the line that goes through here to the center and the line that goes through there. So the first folds we did, if it helps. And so now the idea is to fold these two. The idea is to fold these two edges at the same time, so these quarter folds at the same time, and have it be like this lightly. Thank you. So now two simultaneous folds, and now I'm going to turn it over. And you're going to see that my points that I selected are there. You see those points? The two that we marked. And the reason why I wanted. Marked, and the reason why I wanted to lightly mark the horizontal and vertical is because this is the bellock point, the belloc maneuver moment. This is where we're solving the cubic. So, we're going to take these two points and put them on these lines. So, this point right here, which we can call like point one, is going to fall on line one, which we can call the vertical line, the horizontal line. And over here, this point we can call point two. And over here, this point we can call point two, and point two is going to fall on line two. Question: So we folded both the top and the side over again. What order did we do that in? Oh, it doesn't matter. Are you asking like which of these do we fold first? Yeah, it doesn't matter. Yeah, it doesn't matter. And they're both the quarter folds again? Yes. Yeah, you're just trying to get those two points on the edge so that you can find them. Okay, yeah, yeah, my two points are on the edge. Okay, thanks. Two points are on the edge of anything. Labeling them sometimes helps. And now we're going to take these two points to their respective numbered lines. So two goes to two and one goes to one. And they have to be at the same time. So both of them have to be hitting. The same fold has to make those two points come into contact. Now, of course, the paper might get a little rebellious, doesn't want to do it, but you got to make it. So in these kinds of moments, I like to place my point on the line and then sort of use my finger there. Then sort of use my finger there to make the paper give way. And once that one point is set up, then I can pivot and find where the second point is, keeping in mind where the first point was in contact. So then in this case. Can you show what fold you just? Because mine looks way smaller and I don't know. I tried to fold along those two points that we'd highlighted. Well, you're not trying to fold a line that connects the points. You're trying to fold so that. You're trying to fold so that these points come into contact with the lines. So you're trying to make a fold that has point two falling on line two and point one falling on line one. Oh, I don't know if I know which line. You're not trying to connect it. You're trying to just have these, this condition be satisfied. Okay. I got this right. Yeah, you can see there, that's my point one here, and this is my point two. One here, and this is my point two right there, but it looks more like yours now. So, cool. All right, so point two on line two, point one on line one, and you fold that. Now, it might be a little again rebellious and that the top layer might, I don't know if you can see very slightly it's coming out, but again, it doesn't really matter since the objective or what we're trying to get is underneath. So, we fold this now. Where point one hits on line one, that very Line one, that very, very point, that's what we're looking for. So you can, again, you can use your pencil to mark it, or if you have no pencil and you're just using your imagination, like a I was gonna say like a chess player because they kind of play in their minds, but you wanna keep track of it in your mind, you can again just pinch it or just mark that point where. That point where that is come into contact, yeah. So you can either unfold here, but just be clear on where that point landed, right? So my point landed there. I have it there, a little line that I put in, right? So what I'm going to do now is draw or fold a perpendicular line on that point. Now, this is easy to do in origami because all I have to do, I'm going to do it in mountain fold because I saw. Have to do, I'm going to do it in a mountain fold because so I can see it, but all I have to do, I'm going to you can see I turn it over because it's a mountain fold, and so as I fold it, it just sort of goes on to the side so I can see. And again, there's a point that I found. And I'm just making sure that this top edge lands on the top edge, and that the bottom edge simultaneously lands on the bottom edge, and that it goes through the point. So there's only going to be Point. So there's only going to be one line that satisfies this condition. And that condition is two edges match and the point is crossed. And I fold that. And because the folds are not intersecting, it's kind of convenient to just fold it and just be and just verify that that point is the same. Yes, when has her hand up? Yeah, so when you said you marked that point where point one hits gold one. Point where point one hits gold one. Does it matter if you use the other point where it hits its line? Are they symmetric? We don't, no, that point's not symmetric, and we don't care about that point. Are you talking about line two? So it does matter. I have to get the right one. Yeah, it does matter that you select this point. I want the one at your right hand. Okay, good. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. And so at that point, the perpendicular line, so then this line that I just drew, this is a right angle, right? This is a right angle, right? All right, cool. So, this is the most important part. Is everybody here so far so good? Feel free to chime in and go like, no. Or raise your hand and say, Yeah, I mean, I'm getting it, but I'm not sure. You can be either one. Now, completely unfold. If you are here, welcome to the heptagon construction and pretty much there. Now, we're going to put in a new Now we're going to put in a new point, which we already have, but it's just to be clear. We want the center, the very, very center of the square. Just mark it. And if it also helps, mark the closest X point, the X, what is this, the X direction where that hits the edge. So the outermost X value right there, that one also mark it. So, you know, just be sure that you have your center mark and this. Sure, that you have your center mark and this x-point mark. The one that's closest to line this line that we just constructed, this perpendicular line, we can call this actually L3. That's what Tom Hall does. He calls this line L3. And if we wanted to, we can actually call this point 0.3. I don't know if he does that in his construction. No, he calls that C, but whatever. So now we're going to take 3 to 3, but this fold will actually. But this fold will actually go through the center. Now, here's where I sort of vary from Sarah's construction: I'm not going to fold the edge, although it is more convenient. Perhaps it might work for you. I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. I'm going to mark my center on both sides of my paper, just so it doesn't, you know, just so I can be clear on where it is. And again, I'm going to take point three and land it on line three. And it's going to go through the center. So here's how it's going to go. I start to lift my paper. I keep an eye out. I keep an eye out for my center. There it is, my center. I can see it. I can see it. And so I sort of select it and then I can pivot this. You see how the paper is pivoting on the center. So I pivot it in such a way that the 0.3 I selected right there lands on my line. See? And so I select that. I'm sure of it. And then I commit, I decide, and I have faith and all that. Hi, can you just unfold it and show where point three is again? I think I marked the wrong point. Sure. Point three is just the very where the horizontal line hits the edge. Okay. Great. Thanks. But you know, you gotta be aware that perhaps in your construction, it could be like this. In this case, then this is the point three. So you want the point that's just beside line three. Right? So because this could happen. Right, so because this could happen in anywhere on your square, so you want the point that's closest to line three, that one. So, as you can see, my fold goes through my points on the center, and when I fold it, point three lands on my line three. You good? Okay, do you see this line? This is the horizontal line, it's the line that goes and. Horizontal line, it's the line that goes and actually makes contact with line three. Conveniently, this fold should be a valley. Conveniently, if it isn't a valley, fret not, but make it a valley. So have these two folds be opposite folds. So have this one be a valley and this one be a mountain on this side of the paper. Notice that this changes due to that when I fold it, what's underneath is now on top. Is now on top. So now this that was mountain on the front side is presenting itself as a valley when folded, right? So now I put my hand inside of all this, all this layering, I put my hand inside of there, and I start to push the paper upwards so that this valley fold is activating. And there it goes. And then as I fold it, you're going to see that the paper is going like, whoa, and what you want. Like, whoa, and what you want to do is use your finger there to use the horizontal and extend it on the horizontal. So, here I'm just going to lift it up just to make sure that this vault, which we already have, is a horizontal line. And now you got all this bulging, you got this bulging that's sort of happening there, wanting to become something. And you just bring it down, you just bring it down so that this top layer over here, this point, this vertex, lands on the backside vertex. Lands on the backside vertex and you fold that. Would you be upsetting if we ask you to rewind to the valley mountain? No, of course not. This is why we're here. Yeah, can you imagine if I was just like showing off? Sorry, anyway. Yeah, so we're here on the valley formation. Formation, right? And now, the idea, the whole concept, like if I can break down the intention, we want to put, we want to use this fold which we folded and copy that on the other side. So we're going to use this as the mirror line. So this is like a little analogy I like to do and compare folds to light. So one of these lines is going to be a light line and the other line is going to be a mirror line. The first fold we did is the light line. And this valley fold right here is going to be the mirror line. Valley fold right here is going to be the mirror line. Okay? So, first I fold my light and then I fold my mirror and then that just copies the information on the other side. So there's several ways that we can do this also because we already have this fold. So if you wanted to, if you really wanted to just make life a little bit easier for yourself, you can also just fold the whole thing and just fold. Whole thing and just fold the whole layer, and that's the same thing. So, that, but it's a little less accurate, so depending on how you want to do it, right? Is that clear? Is that a little better? Yep, that was helpful. Thanks. Yeah, all right. So, what we want to do is we want to be here, though. We want to be in this moment. If we did it in the way that we just had it folded like that and we fold both layers like this, then you want to do what's Like this, then you want to do what's called an inside reverse fold. That is when you put the folds just together like this, right? So you want to have this tucked in there, okay? Now it's important that here we're all on the same page because after this, it's going to get a little crazy if it wasn't already. So, how are we doing? Everybody, all right, up to speed. Speak now, or forever, hold your peace. Speak now or forever hold your peace. Right on. All right, cool. So, we're going to do what's called a hinge move. We're going to take this and we're going to lift it. So, you also want to hold your rest of the paper together. You want to take your hinge and you lift it. And notice how my valley line, the one we use for mirroring, actually follows through on where the fold is, right? It's all seemingly on the same line. We unfold this, we fold it back rather, right? So, we folded this one using. Right, so we folded this one using the hinge. Now, when you lift it, remember your paper is going to want and get a little away from you. So, you got to hold it in, you got to show it who's boss. Fold it down, and then you fold it back. You turn the paper over and repeat this process, repeat the hinge move. Now, if we did this correctly, both of these lines should be matching, so the one we did on the back before and this. The one we did on the back before, and this one should also be on the same line. Now, everybody got the both hinges to get this shape kind of thing. All right, so here's where it gets crazy. We're going to open it up completely and we're going to pop it. We're going to bring this point that's sinking and make it go up. So, notice that my right hand here is on the back of my paper. I'm going to use my left hand here to push the paper. Use my left hand here to push the paper and use my finger, my right-hand finger there on the bottom and bring this point upwards. And you can see that these two lines that we did are now falling. And now I pinch this and I bring it in. And now it looks like this. And we repeat the process of the hinging. Process of the hinging. So again, we hold it together, we hinge, we unfold, turn over, and rehing. We unfold, repeat, we open it up completely. Repeat, we open it up completely. We pop it. Could you do this whole step again? With this getting the center on top, because some parts of my paper are doing curious things. Yeah. So you mean the vaults before? You mean when we were here? Or when we were here? Here the first time you did the center, the little block, the first block, yeah. So you got this one though, right? The first hinges, yep. All right, so now when we did the first hinges, you can either you can also mark your lines though, because they're valleys, so they're easy to draw into. You can just use the fold itself and just draw a line. That's also helpful. Right? And now we open it up, and you open it up so much that it closes on the other side. Now, the problem with this method is that it might get away from the center a little bit. So, even though I think it's a lot of fun, it sort of can produce inaccuracies. But that's sometimes a risk I'm willing to take, perhaps a little too. Risk I'm willing to take perhaps a little too harp haphazardly, and so we get here. Are you guys are you here though with the pop and getting to the reduced version? Okay, you can also see how we're here and now because we have these valley folds we can sort of you know sync it within. And what we're doing is pretty much just copying this angle all across this point. This angle all across this point. Then, once we're here, we repeat the hinge. Use your pencil also to mark your values. Helpful. Right? And then repeat this process. Then repeat this process. Now, again, you want to be careful that when you do these hinges that your paper is not getting away from you because as the layers get higher, then the possibility of varying is also greater. So you can also verify by folding both hinges. So you fold one and then you can fold the other one on top of it. And so we are also using congruency to be sure that these angles are the same. We start with one angle, which we suppose is correct. We suppose is correct, and we are pretty much just copying it. And so we see that if they match, then we're copying that angle over to the other side. And then we can pop it back. And now we're reducing to the minimal right there. So, as you can see, this accordion thing is becoming smaller and smaller, and we're sinking it on this line: sink. Line sink and sink and we repeat the hinge move once more again. You gotta hold it in, make sure that your layers are not getting too away from you. Whoops, sorry, can you just go back one step? I've done hinges on one half of the paper, and then I lost how you got to the second half of the paper. Sure, sure. Second half of the paper. Sure, sure. So one back. All right, let me go one back. I'm moving back. So are you here? Does your paper look like this? Let's see. Yes, it does. Okay. So you hinged here? Okay. Yep. Okay, then it might be helpful to just mark it in with the pencil? Might be. Might be. Do it on both sides, right? So we do it on this side, and then I turn my paper over, and as you can see, my folder. And as you can see, my folded thing is now on my right hand. So it was before on my left, now it's on the right. And I do the hinge as well. Good, yeah. All right, to verify that we're going all right, we can also fold this down. The one that's sort of hanging in. We fold it, and we're just making sure that they're the same. That these two are the same angle. Good, good, yeah. These two fins. Yep, that's all fine. All right, good. So once you're there, what you want to do is you want to pop it back. So you want to open. You want to pop it back, so you want to open it again so much that it goes to the other side. Now, keep an eye out for the symmetry of this thing. So, this is the horizontal line. So, this is what's closing in. As you can see, there's my valley lines that I'm inscribing with my pencil. And those are the ones that are sort of functioning like an accordion shape, like it closes in. Do you see how these are closing? Yep, all good. So now it should look like this. Yep, and now more hinges. And more hinges, yes. Thanks. Yeah, no problem. By the way, you guys, I am aware this is kind of crazy, so I hope it's not too complicated. I hope you guys are having fun. I think this is fun. And again, we can repeat this process of just hinging once more just to make sure that the edges, that the hinges are all copying the same angle. Now, here where it gets a little bit tricky, because we have so many layers on the right-hand side, and my right-hand side, on this side, that we're going to inevitably produce sort of a little deviance. It's inevitable because there's just so much pressure. So we can. Pressure. So we can alleviate that a little bit by just hinging over one more and just giving it that, we're making sure that these are all the same, that these fins actually are on the same line. Does that make sense? And we do it again for both sides. It doesn't hurt to inscribe these valleys with pencil. So we're almost at the end. Now for this moment, I actually don't recommend to pop back because of again because of the inaccuracies that might come up as we have too much on one side. So what I recommend is that you find in this moment where your right angle is, that is where 0.3 was. Angle is that is where point three was. That's my point three right there. You can see that there's actually some symmetry to this. There's one, two flaps on my right hand and one, two flaps on my left. It looks like a little fox face with a tail. You guys see that? Okay, so now the idea is we lay the fox face flat on its face like it's going for prey on the snow. On the snow. We have the tail hanging in there, yeah. So now, this tail of this box, we're gonna match it to these triangles. We're gonna get inside of the tail and spread it and then try and match it to the edges on the side. So we do one. And we actually go back to the tail shape. Or you can leave that in, actually. You can leave that in if you want. And you can hinge here. But again, I think that, yeah, this is possible. This is nice. So we hinge there. And then finally, we have the last spin, and we bring this one down. Do a final hinge and see how accurate we actually got it. Mine isn't that accurate. Isn't that accurate? Many times we've had this discussion of is it better just to use the approximation because of the error that gets introduced when folding. Well, I think the error is actually introduced because of all this like hinging and popping and whatnot, because I think it deviates a little bit from the center. So it might be better actually. So instead of doing all this popping and blocking and all this back and forth. And blocking and all this back and forth. I think it might be better to just get the fold and extend the lines, maybe hinge once and just extend the line since they're all on the same. So all the lines are radial and collinear. You can also just like, you know, work on, I mean, maybe this is a little too advanced. I'm not sure how advanced it is, but what I'm doing right now is just pushing my edges so that they're all lined up so that I can make my angles as close to themselves as they are. As close to themselves as they are, so that this space in between is closed off and have these be the same. So, this is just like course correction, a little bit of uh yeah, just just damage control. So, what do you guys think of this method? Was it harder, easier? You guys like it, didn't like it? Make sense? I wish we were done, but we're not done. I wish we were done, but we're not done with the heptagon. We still have one more step to do, and that is we got to cut it away. So, how you guys doing? We got this far so far, yeah. All right, so find your point three again. Now, find the line after it. This one right here. Yep. Now do a fold that goes from point three and is perpendicular to this line. So, what I like to do is again, you can fold the horizontal completely if you wish. Completely, if you wish, like this. You can even fold this back if you also desired, just to have the edge be a point, and then bring this down on the line so then this line matches to itself. That makes sense now. If you had a pair of scissors, this is the moment to take them out. If you don't, then follow along, but if you do, what you do is you return to your slice and you can use this line and cut it at there. You can cut on this line. And that's going to go through all the layers. Ricardo, is this a smaller heptagon than the one we did yesterday? No, it should be the same. Oh, thank you. Yeah, no problem. Interesting, innit? Can you show that again? I'm trying to get it back to the slices, but I'm a little bit lost. Yeah, so the slices are what we call the preliminary. Slytis are what we call the preliminary folds, and they're a sequence of valleys and mountains that go, you know, just mountain, valley, mountain, valley. They alternate. So when it's an odd number, the state will change after the center. So it goes from mountain, hits the center, and then changes into valley. It's kind of what makes odd number construction a little bit challenging, but more and more rewarding, as is anything. And so what I'm doing here is I'm folding the Is I'm folding the horizontal line and I'm just including this because I want to eventually get to my pizza slice again. Not pizza slice, but just a slice. Horizontal. Have these folded into a valley form right there, like that. And boom. And so with this, where you can see there's my line three, there's my point three right there. And here was the first line that we did. This one was the first one that we folded, yeah. So I have that line. So I have that line, the first one that we folded, and I'm folding that onto itself coming from point three. That part I've got. So as you can see, I also included a pencil line on the back. The pentagon, the heptagon is full of moments where you think, is that matching? But no, it isn't. For instance, this line that we're doing, this perpendicular, is not hitting where the radial is coinciding with line 3. They are not matching. These three lines are not intersecting. Neither is this point on the edge matching to line 3. They're also very so little apart. But anyway. Right, so little apart, but anyway, we get this. And so, once we get this line, which is a perpendicular, we can fold now onto the slice like that, back again. That was just magic that just happened. I couldn't tell what it was going on. Oh, you got it? No, no. Back to where you suddenly like pressed O and suddenly something changed. Yeah, this, well, this moment right here when we're in the slices, and I changed my one. And I change my one layer to the other. That's called the little miracle. One step back, please. Yes. So here. So again, 0.3, horizontal line, it changes from a mountain to a valley after the center. You're muted, Max. So this is pretty clear. So, this is pretty clear. And now, when you fold it back together, they'll have the problem. Okay, okay. So, it's really dependent on your mountain valley configuration. So, just find where your hinges are, pretty much. So, here, my hinges are here. So, as you can see, I have my so I begin to. I can either take like this shape, this one that has a This, this one that has a right angle there, or not a right angle, a perpendicular line there, and I can set that on the table and just start to open and spread. Open and spread, and then come down to this was that clear, Mike? Was that helpful? Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, all right so now we set the the heptagon up in the in the way that we can see where the horse this line that we inscribed in here is and Because time because we've spent already 50 minutes on this I'm gonna go ahead and use a knife and cut at this thing right there on that line if There on that line. If you don't have a knife, what you can do is fold and on the intersection, it's kind of hard, it's kind of like a challenge. But what you can do is you can find the points of contact that these lines have. And then from that point, you know, keep folding so that these lines fall on themselves. Yeah. Like these lines that we inscribed, these valley lines, they all fall on themselves. And they all have an intersection point. So you can leave them folded in as well. You can like leave this one folded in. As well, you can like leave this one folded in and then just fold the one next to it, and then where that hits, fold that one down, making again sure that this valley folds in there. Again, you find the radial where that's hitting. So, I guess I'm not going to use a knife. Tom's method is, yes, this is Tom's method, except the popping and locking and all this. That's sort of my take on it, which can prove more fun, but also can prove a little bit too playful for accuracy. Tom's method is actually involved more in just extending lines, and he does do one copy of the angle, but then extend, so it's a lot more. If you see his. If you see his instructions, we skipped steps what was it, nine through twelve. Anyway, there it is, my heptagon. So So, oh, Tom's method follows the work of Margarita Belloc and Lil and uses what I described yesterday with the cubic polynomial in order to construct the heptagon. Now, for today's construction, we're going to need three heptagons to get To get to this, to get to this pattern from the anonymous Persian Compendium, we're going to need three heptagons. So, we have options. Option one, we take our heptagon, put it on top of another piece of paper, and of course, this is going to be a little bit like some deviance is going to definitely happen. But you want to hold it down and you want to inscribe now lines and. Inscribe now lines and cut another heptagon from this. So this is going to be like a mold. There's no rule that we said we can't do it, that we shouldn't. So we do. And so this is one way. Second way would be to actually refold, which is a lot of work, but it's fun too. And we can get like specifically accurate. Third way would be to print a heptagon and cut it, which is more efficient in a way, but it also might produce. Efficient in a way, but it also might produce slight deviation. As depending on where your knife is. And I guess a fourth way, if you have a cutting machine, you can simply cut out, make your machine cut a heptagon for you. And if anybody has a fifth option, I'm all ears. Although I guess, now that I'm thinking about it, we could, in this case, use a compass because we have the points. So I guess we could use like a reference here. Well, maybe, maybe it's the same thing as doing what we're doing. So there I've inscribed the heptagon onto my piece of paper. And if I wanted to be a little bit more efficient, I could place several pieces of paper on top of each other. So I'm going to put three pieces of paper here on top of this one. I'm going to use some clips just to hold this thing together so that it doesn't try and get away as I'm cutting it. Try and get away as I'm cutting it. And then I'm going to get out my cutting board and cut this thing out with a ruler, matching with these lines and see how that goes. By the way, any questions, comments? By the way, any questions, comments so far? We good? Um, I have a thing, you know, this the last move we did, when I compare my today's heptagon to yesterday's heptagon, I got it by doing the cut on the, you know, the horizontal line, the edge of the paper. I just cut it there. I don't know if I did it wrong or misheard because. It's wrong or misheard because I kind of lost the plot a bit after that. But I so I did it one move earlier and it's the same size. So I feel like that's cool. So you know where your left hand is? Oh wait, no, no, where your right hand is? Just the one below it. That triangle. So I'm pointing at my screen like you can see. But you know, just the horizontal line. Well, you know, if I visualize the construction, the horizontal line, it had an edge of a hectagon on it. And that's where I. A hectagon on it, and that's where I did the cut. So I don't know how and why. Yeah, where is it on yours now? It shouldn't end up the same size. I mean, because somehow if you make this your edge of your heptagon, you're using this distance as your apothem rather than your radius. And so your heptagon would go outside of your square and get cut off. Exactly. I need to investigate this because I've got them all the same size. Investigate this because I've got them all the same size. That's interesting. And I did one move less yesterday because I thought I was quite cocky and just went ahead of myself. And then I ended up in the same place. So yeah, I should figure out what I did because I didn't do that last movie, did. But anyway, I thought I'd share that because it seemed to work. It seems to match. But maybe I don't know. I'd know what I did. Sorry. I mean, did you do kind of like a one-cut thing? Did you have all the slices overlapping? All the slices overlapped and stuff, yeah. One cut, and it was done. So, there might have been a way. I don't know. Sorry, my headphones are talking. So, there might have been a line which was perpendicular that you used, perhaps, maybe, because if you did use the edge, then the heptagon wouldn't have come up unless it's so badly inaccurate. I don't know. Yeah, that's on me, that's on me. That's on me. That's on me. No, no, I'm saying that's on me. Yeah, I did it really inaccurately, and it almost looked right. But yeah, no, it's very good to see what's going on. Yeah, but thank you. Yeah, I'm making my hept again. Yeah. I don't think we're going to have time to show both of the characters. How much time have we got left? We got 30 minutes? Yeah. It's a damn shame. Well, we're going to go through one of them at least. Go through one of them at least. You have to. Let's see here. Where's my ruler? Sorry. Now, we might not have time to show the whole thing, but I do want to show you one little nice discovery that I did while folding these. And that's how to get both hexagons from these heptagons. And I think that's very, very fascinating and interesting because the person who I Because the person who I referenced, Jay Bonner, he has a different way of getting the hexagon. So I think it's worthwhile actually sharing this with you. Because it also shows the power of the folds. Anyway. So I have here two heptagons, and I can do this construction on these two. I'll cut the third one from the one I used, and we'll see how this goes. Can I ask one question, last question for the heptagon? Sure. Okay, so I was there. You see it? Yes. And then I did these two folds and I got. And I got a moment. I got here. And I have this little nose. Yes, yes. So where to put this nose? You place your finger inside of it and spread it. Ah, okay. Like this. Yes, exactly right. Exactly right. Thank you. Right, okay, thank you. Yeah, no problem. Now, the problem with this method, with this idea, the whole thing was that as we were doing the pop in and locking, the center might move a little bit. So that's the trick, and that's hard to maybe sometimes be completely aware of. So it might have resulted in a little deviance. But I like to present this alternative way of getting it because I think it's fun and it's worth doing and it's worth knowing. But if you have the heptagon from yesterday, you can also use that to get a mold. So, you know, depending on how you're doing. All right, so here's what we're going to do. Alright, so here's what we're going to do. I'm going to show you the star that we're going to get. I'm going to show you how to put the star into this thing, and you can then use the instructions that are on the Google Drive folder to get it. How's that sound? We good? We ready? All right, guys, we're going to try and make it happen. You can feel the excitement. Okay, so first off, we start by folding this thing in half, like so. Like so. You open it up, and now we're going to turn it over. Now, this is an invariable for both of our constructions, but we might as well start here because this is what I think the most. Well, start here because this is what I think the most important thing, depending on which one we want to do. All right, so we can actually leave this folder in. Let's leave that folder in. Now we can use the bottom of this line, this right here where it hits, so the one that's half the edge. And we pull the paper up and we fold. And we fold where the edge on the other side falls on itself. So we're folding a perpendicular line to the edge on the other side. So you can see that that little bit, that little edge there, is falling on the edge. So this line is perpendicular and it's hitting at the bottom. And then we can use that, we can turn the paper over from here, turn it over, and just do the same thing. But because we have the same fold on the other side, we can simply just match these to there. So you have like this little plane arrangement Right where these two are falling on the edge We have this thing lifting up there we have this falling on the edge coming in from this point So this is not at the corner, you're not it's not at it's not going from the center to the corner. It's going from the center to a point very close to the corner. Exactly right. The angle of this right here is it's 4 pi over 14, so it's 2 pi over 7. This angle right here is 2 pi over 7. And yeah, so it just so happens that that actually falls. So, it just so happens that that actually falls perpendicularly to the edge. So, that's nice. All right, so we're gonna put this same thing on the midpoint to the right and on the midpoint to the left. So, same deal. We can also have these match up. So, we can just fold now on this to my right. You can see the variance on my thing. You can see how off I was on the center. My thing, you can see how off I was on the center there, but hey, the intention is what counts, and we can always do it again, so it doesn't have to be perfect. But I think it's worth sometimes to make mistakes and move forward from them because it's not the mistake that kills you, it's the second mistake sometimes. You gotta roll with the punches. So, again, I'm doing this. One was the first idea, and now I'm moving. This one was the first I did, and now I'm moving to the one on my left, the midpoint on my left of it. All right, the same deal. So we're from folding on the midpoint. Now, even though I'm sort of, as you can see, sort of wonky away from there, I'm actually focusing more on that this line be perpendicular to my edge. Why? Well, I don't know. Today I prefer that than being off the edge because I need it. I need this point to be a perpendicular line. So same deal. From that point, I'm going to make sure that the edge falls. I'm gonna make sure that the edge falls on itself. Yeah, perpendicular line. And the way that you can also keep an eye out for this is that it won't look too much going in. Actually, if you got it exactly, it should look like it's falling exactly on it, right? And it helps to have this folded because you can use the corner there as a reference. You can use the corner there as a reference. Looks like a lion, doesn't it? Like a tail, the mane. Anyway, turn it over, repeat this. And now you have a little plain figure. Right? So, the way I've solved for it, I have. So, the way I've solved for it, I have this one, two, and now three over here. One more, one more, you guys. One more, one, two. Again, making sure that the edge there lines up, the edge is matches, boom, boom, and then fold. The intention is what counts. These three lines should go through the same points as they all share a common center. So, right now, I'm focusing more on that, even though that you can see. Right now, I'm focusing more on that, even though you can see there are little variants on the thing. It doesn't matter, it's all good. Repeat the process: a little line, a little plane. Fold it from the midpoint, a perpendicular line. Turn over repeats. So now I have one, two, and three of my 12 over five line. I should maybe get into that a little bit, but anyway, the angle being the 2.5 over 7 line. Seven line. Now we're going to do a fold, what I call the seven, three line. That means that there's seven points around the center, and you're going to count it off. I think that Craig actually has a method to counting these off. I forget the nomenclature for this thing, but it goes. Choose a point. We're going to choose that. We're going to, again, work on a line that's on top of the three points we did. My three points are there. That's my vertex. And now I'm going to count it off. That's zero. And now I'm going to count it off. That's zero. Zero, one, two, three. And that's the fold I do. And so two things happen. The line goes through the vertices, hits the vertex, hits the other vertex, and the first line we did, this line, falls on itself. That's its perpendicular line. And so here we use this top that we folded as our guide. We now fold back on these lines. I like to fold this one first and actually will hit on the top. I like to turn it over as well so I can see there the edge on the back. And so again, these do hit. And so again, these do hit my vertex on the top, ideally. So one, two. Now, because I'm constructing the hexagon, I want it to have smear symmetry. So even though I might be off, because there is some offness there, I don't mind because, again, I'm just copying this box. I'm just copying this bottom half over to the other side. That's what I care about right now. Right? And so now finally, just fold this back. All right, and so it helps here to have a pencil. And what we want is to inscribe these lines where the star lines that we folded intersect. Star lines that we fold that intersect, we want to fold these on all the layers, these lines. So, you know, you can hold it down and just see where the line is, and you can fold that. And you don't have to fold the whole line as long as you fold these little bits. That's really what's important. So we're using the mirror symmetry of this thing, or the fact that we can overlap to copy information. To copy information from one side to the other by just this congruency, this overlap congruency, which is nice. And so here, the lines that I've inscribed with the pencil, I have folded on all layers, right? So they're going, it's going to the back. Now I can unfold and just retrace my star line.  And so this is one hexagonal tile from the heptagon. So, what's nice about this is that Jay Bonner suggests that we actually have the heptagon sort of cross each other by intersection. But what's nice is that it turns out that the hexagons are actually an integral part of the heptagon itself, which is nice. Could you turn it over, please? I just want to see the back. Oh, right. Okay, got it. Thank you. We cut these out, by the way. These, we don't need to have them there. By the way, these we don't need to have them there, we can cut them out completely. But I'm gonna leave those in just for now. So we can we have about 20 minutes, so I think we can do it, guys. I think we can do it. Well, I don't want to just do it myself. It would be nice if you guys stayed with me. So, anybody got this far? We got this. Any doubts on the process of this? Anyone get lost in the way? I'm gonna take your silence as a disagreement. I got some doubts. Yeah, so when I don't know if my drawing is dark enough there, but I still got the lower part here seems but then when I But then, when I, it seems that is the distance from this point to this point here, should it be the same on the other edge? No, not on the hectagon itself, see, because we are working inside of. Okay, then I see that's my problem. Yeah, I find it helpful if you cut the hexagon out before copying those lines. Yeah, because you reduce overlap as well. Thank you. Overlap as well. Thank you. Yeah. What's interesting, it might worth noting, these two lines are actually edges of smaller heptagons. So when we start to put it together, we're going to actually see that a heptagon here is being uncovered, which is nice to think about that these two pi over seven lines are actually allowing for this internal angle of a heptagonal triangle there. Yeah, interesting. See, I'm trying to think of the angles. Working with radians is a lot easier than working with degrees, at least with this kind of construction. May I ask a question before you fold that flat? It almost looks like an equilateral triangle. Which above your the top is the hexagon. Yeah, yeah, but no. Because these lines are actually part of the star line. Are actually part of the star line. So that actually, we know what angle this is. And so we can actually, let me draw it out for you. How convenient that I have here in Heptagon. Let me see, real quick, real quick. So we're folding that was 012. So we're going from here to here. So 0, 1, 2, and over here, 0, 2. So the formula for the star angle is n minus 2k times pi over n when the star is in the form of n slash k. n being how many points are on your polygon and k being how many points you jump in yours. Points you jump in your polygon to draw the line. So, this particular arrangement, if we kept this going, we would have a 7/2 inside of our bracket. This is the Schlafly symbol, right? So, 7 slash 2, we substitute the 7 for N and the 2 for K. So 7 minus 4, because 2 times 2, over 7. So, 3 pi over 7 is what this angle is, and so we have this. And so we have the, if we actually draw it in completely over here, we also have what then this angle would be, which is going to be what this angle is right there, what it should be. Right? So just by that, you know that that angle is not going to be pi over 3, but 3 pi over 7, which is actually interesting, because then we could also, you know, we work around as to what these other angles are. And further, we can then get. And further, we can then get the value of this hexagon. Because instead, the hexagon is going to be 4π, the sum of the internal angles. So if we have that our denominator is 7, then whatever numerator we put into these, whether it be like I'm putting a 3 there, for example, whatever numerator I put into these, it has to add up to 28. And I think for this one, I actually broke it down. This is going to be a 5 pi over 7. 5 pi over 7 right there, it's a 5 over here. It's a 5 pi over 7, 5 pi over 7, 5, and then 20 has added to 28, so this one's going to be 4 pi over 7 and 4 pi over 7. And so now we're going to move on to the second hexagon here on the other list. And we got time, you guys. We're going to do it. We're going to make it. All right, so this one is the harder one, but it is what makes this pattern, what makes it. Patterns, what makes it Sarah? Likes to call the figure inside of this a roadkill, and I and I have to agree, it kind of looks like a roadkill. Way to call me out on that, yeah. I agree, I agree. I'm telling you, but credit is doing. I mean, if it turns out the name actually sticks, you know. I kid, I kid, I kid. All right, we begin once more with the line. Begin once more with the line on the center there. Now, in this case, we're not going to start right away with the star line, although we could because it's going to be the same star line, and we know that that point is actually a point of contact. From this time, we're going to start with a little bit of something different this time. We're going to start again with the 7-2, not again, but we're going to start this time with a 7-2. So you can keep this folded in. Now you're going to fold from one vertex and you're going to count it off. Zero, that's where you start. One, two. So we're going to fold the line that goes from zero. So we're going to fold the line that goes from zero to two. Modular, modular, right? Modular arithmetic. Now, because my heptagon again is a little bit wonky, some inaccuracies will come up, but I'm going to work around them and make the most of it now. Ideally, if this were Now, ideally, if this were actually accurate, which I'm having my doubts, the next fold would actually go through these two points. But we don't need it to be too accurate. What we do need, well, we have those folded in and we can leave those folded in if we wanted to, or we can unfold them. Doesn't really matter. What matters in this case, but these are important to have. Next, we're going to take these two vertices of the heptagon and fold them onto the top edges, having this line fall on itself. Yeah, so we're going. Fall on itself, yeah? So it goes up, up, up, up, up. You can also place it on top of the line and have it slide, slide, slide, slide, slide, slide until you come to your edges. One vertex on the edge, other vertex on the edge. Now, of course, as you can see, deviance, deviance, but I'm going to make the most of it. So, as you can see, if I were correct, these two lines, the fold should actually match these two vertices, which is interesting. So what I did now, if I was going a little bit too fast, I apologize. What I did, well, first, of course, I folded the vertices to the edge, perpendicular. I unfolded. I refolded the I refolded the seven twos. I refolded that line. And now I'm going to fold these. I'm going to use the edges that are lining up to take away all this space. So I can then hold this and turn it over and then just push that top layer up. And you're going to see that it sort of like lifts up there. And you know, I just bring that down. Top layer, I push. Top layer, I push and it comes down pretty much by itself. It has a little nice motion that it does. And there you go. And now you take away the little cap. So I think this is very worthwhile and interesting because, again, it sort of shows that these hexagons are not the product or they are also a product, like Jay Bonner suggests, of putting heptagons together and finding the negative space that these provoke. But they also found within the heptagon itself. Found within the heptagon itself. And because they have this mutual edge where it starts, it will match to these. Right? So it all works out. And no need to match negative spaces or nothing. So this is what the little discovery. This is my contribution to the pattern, which I think is nice. Anyway, we're going to unfold this thing. So at least we have the hexagon, right? I'm going a little fast because we got 10 minutes. I'm going a little fast because we got 10 minutes, but we can do it, you guys. We can do it. So, because this has mirror symmetry from this line to the other, we only need to construct, construct, we only need, again, quote unquote, because we can do the same thing on the other side. But we only need to put the pattern on this half. And then we're going to fold it and print whatever's on here on the other side. That's the idea. So, all right, to solve it, well, we know what star is going to be there, right? We know what star is going to be there, right? It's going to be the 14.4. Was it? No, the 14.5, sorry. I'm going to go, well, yeah, during the, after we're done folding it, I'll tell you why it's a 14.5 if you if you care to know anyway but repeat the process of from the edge making sure that that falls perpendicularly right on the edge this is off this the these two This is off. These two should be on the same. So that's my that's on me. Okay, so what I did here was first horizontal line, not horizontal, but that's a vertical line from the midpoint to the vertex, which we use as a reference. I folded that because it's easier for me to work with it as I can push on that. And then from this point, I do a fold that has this be perpendicular. So a perpendicular line from this edge where my right hand is that lands. Where my right hand is, that lands on this, where my left finger is. And so, what I do is I lift my paper and I push it until it hits my corner here. And then I arrange it in such a way that it makes this edge lance on itself. Again, don't follow to the T because, again, my inaccuracies provoked some, yeah, whatever. I'm saying that a little bit too much. Depending on my own nerves. How are we doing, guys? Good. All right, so here's a little beautiful thing. I think it's just a wonderful little thing. Alright, so now you want to be where this is a mountain, where the hexagon that we installed. With the hexagon that we inscribed at the beginning, you want to be with this amount. Why? Because we want to put it back. We want to tuck it like this. Now here's the crux. Not a crux, but it's a beautiful thing. We're going to bisect this angle. Right? The bottom angle of this hexagon, we're going to bisect. How do we bisect? Simple, simply, or simple. Just take the edges of your angle and put them together. Put them together, and we're not going to bisect the whole line, although it might come useful, it might come in handy. So let's go, let's go ahead and just bisect the whole thing. But we only need this line onto where it hits. Oh, look at that. It's actually part of the star line. Isn't that nice? So, again, bisecting this angle. I'm always finding new things with these. So, you see how I'm bisecting the corner of the sexagon, and they have this mutual point of contact right there. And they have this mutual point of contact right there. Yep. All right, here's the nice thing: we're going to use this line as a mountain, and then this line as a valley. Now, I'm deviating a little bit from the instructions because I want to give you a little fresh look at it. But what I'm going to do, you can unfold this also if it gets in the way a little bit too much. But we want to do, I want to show you because I think it's worthwhile to sort of put this in your tool repertoire, this light bounce idea. I'm going to take out a blue. Balance idea. I'm going to take out a blue color. I'm going to draw this line until it hits my this line that I that I described. Until there, I'm going to draw a line. So, I'm going to draw this blue line until it hits this. I want to make sure that both my blue line and this line are opposite. I shouldn't say they're both opposite, rather, that they are different. So, I fold this line first, this blue line first. And then I fold this pencil line. It's worthwhile to have it be like completely in the air because of the move. Now this whole line changes. You don't have to fold the whole thing, but what we want is just that which is folded, and we just can extend this too. But the point is. But the point is, you see how these match, you see how these I know this is maybe I'm getting the feeling that it's weird. I do get a feeling of the feedback, even though that we're virtually and online, I do get feedback, and the feedback I get is, what? Well, again, we see this point where it hits, and perhaps there is, well, yeah, maybe, but that's also worth noting. If you want to completely avoid the mirroring, keep an eye out for this hexagon line as it's going to fall on itself and it's going to come in contact with this point. You can also do it like that. So just keep in mind the points and do a fold. Mind the points and do a fold that has this line falling on itself. Another way to do it. So it really depends on how you want to work with that. And you know, you could make a case also that we only need to solve this on a quarter as it has. Quarter as it has mirror symmetry to the left and then mirror symmetry to the top. So we're going to solve right now because time and whatnot on this quarter. Three minutes, it's getting tense. So these lines are all coming in from the midpoint of these polygons. That line is the midpoint, and now we're going to find the line of this midpoint. So what we're going to do is fold this corner to this line, to the top of this intersection. To the top of this intersection. So just take your vertex of the hexagon and match it to where the hexagon bounces off, right? So take from here and match it to there. And this line has to fall on itself, of course. Which is that, there, boom, and we fold it. And if we did this correctly, this line we got should intersect with the center as well. So these lines should all be mutual. This blue should hit on this. This blue should hit on there and this these should all share a center. What you can do also again a little mirror trick which you can do to save time simply fold and we're not going to do the whole mirror bounce thing. We're simply going to fold find where your fold is. So my blue line is there. I'm going to fold, I'm going to inscribe it on the other side. I'm sorry for turning it over. I'll be right back. Just making sure. There we go. There we go. So, this blue line, I'm gonna mirror it on this line. So, I'm not gonna do no bounces, no fancy stuff. Simply gonna fold this mirror line. There's my blue line. And simply gonna fold this with all the layers. Doesn't matter right now. The whole thing, the whole shebang. So, this blue line gets copied. I sort of missed. That's the reason why I prefer not to use this, but again, it's just a little coarse. Prefer not to use this, but again, it's just a little course correction. No worries. It's all under control. And so off it goes. And it should actually hit the center of this hexagon, which is very, very nice and convenient. It's also a variation on this pattern. All right, finally, finally, you guys, we're almost there. Ain't amazing. Last line goes from here, goes up. These two points should be collinear. These two points should be collinear. Wait a minute, it's not those two points. It's here, here. Wait, let me look at the handout. I think it was that point. One of these two points. Let me just be sure. Let me see. Let me see. I don't want to make no mistakes on this. By the way, how are you guys doing? I think. I think by only doing it on one side, we might be missing one of the points. Oh, interesting, interesting. True, true. Let me just zoom in, see if I can find another intersection on this. By the way, if you're following along, I didn't have the hand that opened. I was just kind of going on what I've remembered. But we're in step 17. Yeah, all right, so it is where this line matches to this one. So it is, it is this one, it is this point. So it's where this first blue matches with this line that goes from that corner to the center here. So that line right there, that point. At that point, fold the perpendicular toward the edge right down. So from that point, That point lift and have this edge on the bottom land on itself again. If it works for you, mark it on both sides. A little bit higher. There it is. All right, beautiful. And so there it goes up. So that's a right angle right there, and this line is a right angle on the bottom. The bottom, and so this quarter information we now can copy over to the rest of them. But you know, to our defense, we only need two of them. Like for this, for this construction, there's only two quarters of this present, one quarter here and the other quarter there. So that means that we can simply, you know, because we're going to eventually cut that into this and we're going to work with it, what you can do. Um, what you can do is simply fold this in half. Well, you can also cut the hexagon at this moment, cut the hexagon out, and then pretty much just mirror. I mean, right now what I'm going to do is just mirror all around and cut this out. And, you know, technically, we're two minutes over time right now. We're two minutes over time right now, but we're almost done. So, notice that for this kind of cutting, I don't use knives, I simply fold, and I imagine that there's a I imagine that there's a point that I'm sliding down the fold itself. So I have my hexagon there with a quarter, and I'm going to put this blue lines over to my right. And with those imprinted, that should be enough information for this thing. I only need two of these. But where I am lacking, sadly, and I'm going to. Where I am lacking, sadly, and I'm gonna have to do it real quick, is that I'm gonna need another one of these. So I'm not even gonna bother by completely doing it. I am gonna use my first heptagon and just really quickly just do a quarter of it because I only, again, I only need two of them. I don't need the full hexagon to do this. I need a full hexagon like this one is, two quarters of this, and two quarters of these, and that's it. So there's cut there he is. All right, good. I'm going to cut this hexagon out because of reasons. Now, the instructions were designed and. Now, the instructions were designed in such a way that you could get the pattern by the least effort possible. That was the intention of it. But there are many other ways that you can try wearing. Use our opposite, aren't they? Let's see like that. So then this one completes. On there, this is another one. Is that even a thing? There it is. There it is. So it's on the other side. Anyway, I'll take out my initial heptagon here. I'm not even going to cut it out, but I am going to get the hexagon as fast as I can and cut two quarters of it. Maybe, maybe, just maybe the cuts were too slight. I can say we didn't try. All right, so first step was to get the star on the midpoint. So I'm just going to leave it all folded in. So I do want to be as efficient as possible. Now, I've never done it with the folds, and I don't know if these lines are actually matching. It would be interesting to see if these lines are actually that. That would be pretty amazing, actually. I usually cut the heptagon out from the square. I don't know why these are lining. Oh, that's. Where I don't know why these landing. Oh, that's that's weird. We knew that by rushing, you could find solutions. That's interesting. Why is this? Is this, damn, I gotta look at that on software or something. That's really fascinating that this is matching. Didn't expect that. All right, so there, now just missing the bounce one, two. Then there are many many ways. So at this point, you're just making copies of it so that we can piece the whole pattern together, right? Exactly. I'm not doing anything new. I'm doing the first hexagon we did once more just to finish it off. We're kind of just like speeding through it and copying angles where I know I'm sort of using the advantage of foresight.  Now, personally, I like to mark my patterns with a permanent marker with a Sharpie pen. However, I wait until the pattern in this case is all sticky taped together, and then I do my markings with a Sharpie pen. Because if I do them individually, then I run the risk of, wait a minute, I run the risk of them not matching quite as nice. And there is then an expansion you can do. An expansion you can do. So, this is not necessarily the end. There is a way to make Islamic patterns 3D. There is a way to reinterpret the lines and add some more to get some volume onto these things, like to make shadows and actually make a sort of a mechanism on these things. They move and they twirl and whatnot. And as you put them together, they will also look. It turns out I already had like some quarters there on the side of me. But yeah, so you can make these work as sort of mechanisms. And there are many, again, many ways to reinterpret them and play with them. That's exciting, that's fun, and it's new. Okay, so I got the quarters that I was looking for. Let's put it all together. All right, where's my ticket take? Alright, where's my tiki tape? So I want to make sure that these kind of match to each other so I can make a bigger one, right? So for some reason, oh yeah, I remember now, these they're cut from the silhouette camera, so they're not the same size, so we're not equally constructed. There's one, there's the other, and that should match up like that. Boom, boom. Okay, so there it is. Now to use the stick tape, put it together. Just turned it over to make sure that they're not too dirty on the other side. A little bit, but acceptable. You know what it might be worth actually to go into it. I just realized I was muted. The last page of the hexagons from heptagons PDF in our Google Drive folder shows how many quarter motifs you need in order to make the whole. Oh, and it also shows how you can play with the hexagons themselves. So you can also, you know, not do the combination of them, but just play around with the single hexagon file, which is also interesting. And there's many ways you can play around with these. Like this is not the only way, but this is the one that's in the compendium, which is actually, there are instructions in the compendium to construct this. And Sarah actually did this on GeoGebra, the way that it was described. On GeoGebra, the way that it was described in the compendium. I think that was fascinating. So, I think, do we have a link for that, Sarah, in the drive? Is that there? So, that diagram is in the paper, in the drive. So, I think, in a way, Sarah has a more intimate relationship with this pattern because she actually went through the process. The scribe didn't. The scribe in it to be fair, the anonymous Persian Convenium only gives you the first few steps, and then it says the rest is easy, God willing. Right? So God willing. Yeah. And of course, they say to start with three sevenths of a right angle, right? So they don't show you how to get the first, you know, difficult. You know, difficult angle, right? It's assumed they would use a set square that was already fixed at that angle because the diagram and the compendium doesn't.
