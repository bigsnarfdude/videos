Organizar is de Congreso tampadre esta reunion of Matemáticos Mexican pronunciation in the world. That first, y está muy padre vera tan mámács conviviendo y con partiendo idas. That's a nor estraca. At the time, I do platform a little bit like this structural. Labradors que la chambi. Structural amiplática. Labrades que la chambé, y lelleron en el resumen y va blar de two models different modes, but decided in focarmes only one and the more context so that all we have in the same dimension. So we are talking about our interests and investigations on muidivers. So if the change is there, so we started, but not rapidly because the very rapid, so Calmart. Well, first, a clásica question provided when reciprocal events. For example, the metro, the time, or conveniently, when people present, that I can't very conquer the platform, and function. And we have a little bit. I want to see how a resume of the institution is put because my platform will. My plateau can go and other complicated things. When the exponential distribution is a distribution that models independent to constantly, and this rhythm constants are represented by Lambda that is positive and the interpretation. If Lambda porgy two is unidentified, or the time is performant, it is made united. And one of the races for the distribution of pronunciation. The rationales for the exponential distribution is very powerful, which has a function of supervision explicit function. If it is a land, here we have all the positives going to be a exponential position. If it is a Bland exponent, the function of supervision is explicit. And the reason why the integral is superficial because they are integral, but they are going to be explicitly. So, how do you see the relationship because it can be the Been the relationship because it is going to process that exponential, but it is complicated. You want to say that recording when the function of encouraging, but when the integration of tiers the function of superior function for yourself. Now, we are going to because my platform is time to simultaneously. So, we have to paradox. The time is much more like English, but that is a time for you. It is a time. It is a toy that is more complex a dimension. For what is the process of this? This is in this film, in case of a filtration. Yes, in filtrations, like information that we value through the time with the text. And there is a example of algorithms that we have so that you can significantly state condition of mentorability in terms of practices. Exemplos of time for example, that when the president action cancel maximum story. President Action Maximo historic cancer. Because well, I just decided that significantly decir que cuando el timepo para suc, when poor menor que Tom instante en que two is parado, your sabes que succeed with the information, the filtración represent the information that has disponible time. It is for example, when the president action can be maximum historical, it is the past, the information that is conformed to passing the time and here is the maximum history. A time for it. Maximum history. Un tien puede parada. E other cuando el presido del dollar vegalos miente pes, también un tien puede parada. El tiempo erruna dun empresa o default time. Y lo quales el clásico jemplo de algo que no es un tiemi pues parada. Es wheno tienes que vernen el futuro. Y el clásico esemplo es la úlimabes que es alien. Because when the cuandunto is alien for 10, in this moment, no sabe que es la utimabes que loves. Necessitarías ver in the futuro y saber que yállo asaber as a persona para saber que esa. So that moment here is that this is eventually in the future, very, but it's the classical example. Because first one can paradox and part with more charge, mathematically, in cosas of the vid. You have the objective. Trust the objective is constructive for an exponentión, a exponential distribution, and complicated. Because this, but you can say that based on the first vendor, the infimum, the infinite in which this is. So, where exponential exponents of one and here the function of superior function, well, this is super fascinating, and we're projecting in the vertex image. If you have this. Y tengo aquí este mitiempo y aquí pua poner la function lamba dé té y aquí tengo mi exponential el evento de tado major y vigual así parcáno esolo voesecer una graphic vimas y para decides how, but But this aquí y ago la function lambda dete, you want to see when it major, that is here. That may be the lambda, and how set an exponential comparable because the function of supervision here the tab. Probably the thousand exponential of Lambda. This is what you are doing from the platform, but a format, complicated, and other positive. How you can construct, I think, here, what represents a more like, I can represent like the integral. If you are Lambda, and the integral will be the Lambda, which is what we have here. But the mathematics generalizing things, so they can say that a rhythm constantly imitates going with the time. The podcast, you see, if you can lambda, a function of time and that variety and your construction and a time. And what I can do is a passive and decided that my variety of stochastic management. Now, we are clear and in the But I think that this here passes a stoast process, but it is a function that is stochastic function, but like this application, a process, this stochastic process, and construction can be paraded. In some filters, because we also pass journalists, when we paradox, we will do a society. We will see in the positives. This is like the introduction. Now, we will present. Brazil will present the model important. The platform dividend parts in the first part, the mathematical model, and going to result a result that is important for the second part of the platform, which is the application to a model of defining models. And they first launched to implement it, and it is the model. So, now we are talking about time for content, potentially summarize that space complete. Complete probability with filtration all functional function of cash, also here that is a stochastic adapted and CATLAC in Red Catlax continues to reach and collimites the municipality pronounced because we have here the differences. Clara, you can go ahead and see this process that is a martingala. That is a submarting, because adapted, is adapted for the proprieties of the time for the project, so we have this theorem of stochastic processes of process, the composition of double composition, that have a martingala existing unicorn predictive in our process and continue the dream, and also the compensation ADT. This is a message. A forma biennial intuitive pension that has this. And we can assume that this compensated company is here to join some ideas because this will be parcel what is in the positiva. And this proposed, we can summarize the. And the more general form in the queue of ours, the final tengu large references. But the most important part is that this construction can be a tau, you describe the alpha de associated. The function associated or not recognized this function, but also means the alpha. But if you have the question. But if you have the question, and now the alpha y quier determines the associated term. You can respond to that, and that is what construction of COCs, but for the space of probability that has spoken with a variable independent electorate, and independently, this process is here. So, this variable of this process and have technical. And have these technical practices to grand filtration so that the object will create a time of paradox in this filtration. This alpha is without how the intensity must be going to a consultado page. For this alpha, it's like the lambda of the process of exponential processes. That is the intensity with which they are in the exponential, which is constant, but this is not constant. It is a positive function continuum function and not authority. And the construction of Cox creation. And the construction of COX, I can't paradox in the filtration, which is the same thing that presented two positive. This is the exponential of parameters. And it can demonstrate how when this divided passamente the same thing that conditioned in the filtration, because conditional in the filter because they have intuitively like removing the stochastic part that records that here is adapted to this filtration. So this part is a process. It's a process of theory, and it is a variability for the condition. And that applies to it, and obviously very facile, but the reason why the crime porque in the rest of the presentation can be much experienced, and that recognition experiences with respect because a stochastic. And here, if the specific case in the alpha, the function is constant. In the alpha, the function is constant, what I recuperate is that if an exponential of alpha en other palaces recuperate the first in a process operation, because we have the process option first, if a exponential con lab, the parameters, and if we are changing generalized to this, but with the time, so the first process can be generalized, and this. Generalizing more and more stochastic as stochastic construction for the heretengo a process of stochastic or the construction of coconut construction. Because, but if you have some interrupts that are good, if the altitude of the presentation is not, but it is simultaneous, we have to varios. Tenguel caso of two caso two, two constructs very cumulative, but one and two queer independents identify distributed as exponential for one. All the conditions that one and two have distribution is continuous, and more data F data filtration is one and two independent. So, the probability when the probability of two variables. When it's the probability of what variables continue and iguales, the probability. So, this is with this project, because we want to control a distribution with one and two, so that marginally parallel this, but the probability that for positive and because very convenient is multiplication of the epidemiology load, because this project is the This project is the pandemic. This is also in the epidemiological models and many infections, if a variable exponential is independent of the people, so they don't have infections, but in the reality, what we are seeing is that these events massive control in the people enforce the same time. You want to elaborate a model that allows incorporating that. Permittier incorporated that, but the meritorama for epidemiology, because it is the expertise of my sensor, the amount for finances that will present in the second presentation of the platform. They are functions no authorities continuously positive. Yes, yes, yes. And also a very general, but obtain results or explicit results to a connection. And one like a more razor por the model can be interesting, in other types of applications, where you have two or more events simultaneously. I think a catastrophe. Simultaneously, I think a catastrophe, for example, this difficulty that is here in Florida, where this was three or four things, but passed the beginnings for collapsing. So, the model that we proponemos that we have applications in more than that in our dimension. But now, we are demonstrating how comments with TECI Professor Philip Proter in Colombia is inspiring in the paper that is carried on Marshall and Olkin in the past, obviously variadists, and work. And work for these authors that I propose in similar, but not in a direction different and different. What recording is constructed with probability positive probability of positive? What we do is we are constructed three times for them, and we have one of the three independent identities of distributed identities with one, but one distribution is. And how definitely possibly for one, that we are interested, like the minimum of one, and two, and this three. If I go for construction, it has a tad not independent. So, how do you obtain the proprietary and effectively the optimos and my first queue is one of the papers that we have. Follow Caprotin to Catlag if we are with CADLAC in a diffusion as a. One discussion, like the movement with their Spanish, their drift and tendency, gracias, and the variability. Gracias, and we say that so that the probability of this definite problem when infinite infinite function of distribution with Function of distribution conjunta que está recorden esta experanza espor que tengo la parte la toya enequis, está escondida poraca, but tengo está ahora en la síte de positiv avoya co pernamas está ultima linea porque les godar unas observación est altrespecto. Y aho, buena prudenta. Mais maximo, si maximo. The maximo de estite. And that is precisely what we have to do that is buscando. Or a question. However, I cost the same notation. Maque is the last line of the positive anterior position. So, recording that there is the integral and that force the part of the authority that we have the observations that comment. The distribution with distribution has a absolutely continuum, and a singular part that is not trivial, and expresses what I see the proprietary of one and one. And the singular part of it. And how singular? Well, we are the crusades of this function with respect to integrals, and we have the integral note. So there is a part of this part that is singular, not trivial. Is that marginal if I want the process of this cox? What is present in a positive case? Because with this there, it is integrated. So, we are presenting a multivariate of the process of COX. And the trend is that if alpha yaw alpha and constant positive constant, obtain the exponential vivid of Marshall Northwind, with those parameters. Vivaria de Marsha Norquin with those parameters. So our proposed generalization of exponential vivid exhaust North in the stash cancastic and the correlation is that possible or cooperating that the problem is a two positive and not only and that also can calculate explicit form. And if you have a specific integral and we are in these lines. Forgo in this lines. If you want to record a positive, my first part of the platform, that is because they facilitate and segue when the application is going to be like complicated by attention to positive attention. If we have to interest in that paradigm, but this is the one with distances, epsilon. We also calculate with the model that And when you have a esados. Ados, a uno y the trees are the two enlightenment. Because the permutations per manyas cosas, because it has catient porada and whatever complicated. But recuperation is also the permutation of these elements. If you encourage them to be able to do that, If you encourage here, if the comment that alpha is the intensity, when they can paradox, and if it is for if you present this positive presentation, what you can recoup, when we have the probability of what you instantaneously recognize, it is like the exponential alpha. Because this is a generalization of the constant exponential, we have the probability instantaneous probability that they eventually exponential eventually. So, unicorn wanted to result that when it was made, allegedly that the two in the interval of time, what I recuperate is alpha 3 that is that one to the two, that is the common. Because if it's my treasure, and the minimum of tads and estates. Tarvez, there is a Talves to document the library as here in this result and because explicit to register. Otherwise, there was one minimum of taught and three, two, es minimum of tads and three. So, the same to say that this three is the minimum of the three. So, that is the crux of the demonstration basically. That is what the probability of this one and for the. So I think positive queue instantaneously when one is more than that, it is one, tad is more than more than that, have divided by epsilon alcaldado for obtaining. Por epsilon alcaldado for plener unlimited tribi. Now move to the asiente part of the plateau that is the application, but gustari de más que learn, which me gusta mucho una porque nación to a platica que día y mijiero en esta pregunta, miam very intereste, y pusamos traines and bonito. Distribution to a mass general in the anterior part, all what is assumed that it is one, these are two and three are independent, and identify distributed identities as exponential parameters. This, one can demonstrate that the covariance is one and two, pass positive, all, and that the distribution for a covariance is negative, you know, and now we are going to summarize that one. That one are dependent, but the ambos are independent of these three. This is one vanilla distribution with distribution, and this terminal will be dependent. And this will exponential exponent, clarify that if I put delta and the cash value, because it's a status, you can independent in restoff definition that. So unicorn chambiar is that one is going to have a conjuntary and independence. It's good important is that this is our distribution exponential distribution vivid, but this por combo. And that is what restrictions I think can make one problem, not yet. The rest of the definitions that defined, and this term is very partial. So, the function of supervision is conjugate that if I decide and recognize the first part of the platform, this delta and We are with the three elements that have the first part of the plate. Well, it is a generalization. And now, we are going to say a cover negative coverage. We demonstrate the case of alpha constants, lambda y, which is a positive constant, and the proposition is that for the first proposition of the cover negative coverage, this proposition is very intuitive because what is that in the case? In the case, in the lambda, it is different, the probability of one is better that when you are delta zero for the problem and all and because intuitive because if the comment with delta different covariance negative is significant that That significant queue when we go on the other seventh, so that we have chances that have a covering negative because in directions differently. So, austere intuitive ahora, but if you present it, but you can see that this caso is when Lambda is igual esto. So, Lambda one. So, one, we have one proportional 3, and 2 proportional 3 and have delta yu la. So, if you have this condition, recover that the covariance between two negative parts for what is because together, y cotta superior to the function of error complementary. And there are many superiors. And there are many superiors. When you are trying to see the demonstration, many superiors, but I only have a cotton para here one. Vikota no zuena y indexo porque no function para aquí, menora uno, pero para équis major iguala one, está cota es mejor de l'a que yo contra y entos me first progo del tiorema que quería representa. Quere quería este demos. So that is a possible generalization. The other presentation. The other presenter generation property of this and presentation is generalization that is a possible interpretation of this distribution with a system of two components, taught and two to represent the vida that came components. Fience in a computer quality of two systems that have function bienn so that this computer function. Because here the two components of functional components can receive a Functional despite receiving a description or second. And the descriptions like three processes of COCs independent processes, one, Lambda 2, and Lambda 3, or 3. If we are familiar with the processes of COCs, pi processes of processes. We are going to see in the case of the constant and one, lambda, and 3, what is the difference between the 3, es que este process va de notar shock? This process will not shocks that affectance on the component one. Lambda two vaccines shocks that affect all the components, and lambda trees will not shock, that affects simultaneously components. So, if I want to see what the probability that one major is and all that majority, it is very recording that because theory, but if they don't exist, it doesn't have to be the problem, it's two to three. But also the three don't in that situation is that the time that is more encapsulated like the distribution or how the process cox or the process. So, the process of COX or the process of Poisson can recuperate this because exponential of this recovery, exponential of this recovery, and exponential of this data, is there. If you have recorded one, it is the one that is the integral in the case of the process opposite. So, that is a possible interpretation, and if the presentation is a generalization, Presentarian aqueous presentation to what in the second part of the plate. Well, if you para construct two times for necessitating three subsidies to construct, you have to need one. That is what you have here to do, camas uno, and vanacer el minimimo de está uno, y esta sero, esta seros à presentos llos. So, for construction, these times of the. This time for Taiwan, they are not independent, and express the distribution of supervision with distribution. And this part for this work is a singularity. Algona question: a application of critical applications. But that's the same. Credit, but for that, instead of a context, consider the possibility of the collapse of the system of financial system. This was pointed to the two miles. And this history, the unique thing that was very complicated, recovered from the collapse of the bank of systemic importance. That banana is here, and that created many causes. I have many causes and here can be what we do with ours to see if they regulate the government, everything that we are actioning so that we financier collapsing. So this banner, Lima Brothers, created in English, it is too big to fail. That is not cabanada here because they are migrants, but because this inspiration regulators characterized the probability of the collapse of the financial collapse. The financial market, also with risk systemic. And presentamentees in this part of the political party is going to proponent a risk systemic idea, using the model of what we present in the first part. But it is a little bit of these banks of systemic importance, like era, Liman Brothers. This is a terminal event of 20 events. In English, with globally systemically important. Globally systemically important banks. Some banks do sufficient integral, which is a collapse, affected the saluda in the financial system, or brothers. And a bank of signals as well, if you have financier sites in certain limits. And they are designed for the financial stability that has public. In 2002, in 2013, how can they? How can they part of the world of America, Europe, Asia? That has what you will represent their time to paradox, default, that are not. That's a good question. And I'm going to say the commentary that when we came to the list of banks, but no vex, no. Now, the model of the fundamental history as to this part of financial partners, this can be with Robert Jarro de Cornell University, and Philip Rocher. This voyage definitely first part, probability complete. So, we have my probability complete, filter, blah, blah, blah. But here that is a Catalan and have exponential independent identifiers with one and the hint of GSIP or muirandes, now that you will represent here. Including macro variables and cosas specificas. How is this? Now, I definitely can paradox because you can see two types of tiene paradox. So, we have cadets, but you have to go in two categories. In a yosyncratic event, that is one. It is only the best specific and Specific and vanced one, which is one, but this mimic establishment partially de la presentation, to mentor this, panel with the event idiosyncratic event, and practices conversion fraudulent or a malada between the GCI. That is something that the GISP specific, for example, solo a Goldman Sachs or Bank of America and Yes, yor the tip tienpoes parada de 's variable 'tenercano, and there is a que especial. The special es event of stress of toddling or market-wide stress event. As you definitely enlist paper, it is the first thing that could be an event of stress of all the mercado and baser that will affect all the GIS different collapse, but a GIP for an event identical specification because affect all implicitly included influences. Implicitly including the influence of the rest of the non GIS and the internet and the GISIPs. For example, the Economic Act with no GIS that collapse a pandemic affects everything, and that is a threat in all the markets. And now finally, final time the collapse of the GC, like the minimum between this, This and it is decir between the top and the syncratic event that affects the specifics that some of these two passes. And the functions of superior marginal y demands obtained directly to the connection to the first part of the plan. Now, what will happen to the systemic system? It is the probability of two G-SIPs collapse in the two GCIPs collapse in the same time. And that are coming because more in a time Epsilon for some ijota in between all the time. So what two is more of Epsilon circa y cuand as going through a collapse of the mercado por two rations. Avento esto o cure este esta sero o cure there tendamos que el collapse el mercado cure or two experience experiment eventos yosyncritic event. Experimental ideosyncrates that provoke the collapse of ambos during an interval of time. In what idea of our ecosystemic ideas, is that if a G-SIP collapse, as one production, the regulators can administer the crisis resultant crisis to a collapse of the mercado, but if two more GCIPs collapse in a cortex, so that you can see the crisis in control, and The crisis in control and the collapse. Now, here is the term, and here are the speed that positives that permutations for very, but explicitly. This is our ego systemic explicitly for what you did form, but we don't know what significance. First, well, the experiences record in which. Recording that because stochastic aquí, that is subject, because we are experiencing this summary that experiences all the possible permutations of one aca, one because they have to be a passage, but you can cuando becreto que tener quido, y esta jota es una mutación specifica y a está esjota es la idensida de es. This is the density of this. Pience in this density density exponential density. Because you expose alpha constants, you can put alpha and here of this, in many positive things, that is, and the function of incident exponential. Look what we are variants on the parameters associated with your function of encidnarity, and this, if you think that it is very parallel to the case of it. There is the most epsilon that is also positive, but how did you get a little I can sorry integral in many cases, but it is constant for the power and that we can assume permutations and there are some students of licensing, ajugar with different things to this. But the idea is that this is a explicit expression and when we are made the probability of marketing, can calculate facilities from estimations of these alphas. We have more proposals in the model. And some of the alphas consent. When alpha is constant, or if imagines have alpha, solo alpha, and if you put this alpha, so this is the integral of sero, of alpha as a function of escalation function, so when you integrate alpha of here, so we have. Tamil, that is the presentation, but the articulation: OK, if not, don't have the case of alpha constants, but also in which alpha, as a function of this, and this is a proportion, two pods have the probability. But what is in the article that is one of the mathematics and other applications, have the reference final reference, but that solution in the mathematics model. And only for the probability that it has a toddler. But in theory, But in theory, if you are resolved, because this positive sufficiently explicit, or more, and the cases on the permutations. Really, the complicated part, because computational, including for the case of alpha constants, much, because the final porjemplo y siblings, and it is a very important thing that we have computation. So, if you want to computation, and if you like, discuss with the paper of the paper, for the last quiet presentation, a result that I uses much, because we start very institutional, it is a result that present paper of the application in the United States, but the number of GCIPs. To finish regulatory, it is very important to understand the impact of more GCIPs in the economy, to allow the number of these GCIs. Records that 2023, or 2020. The intuition is that for dismissal, the probability of the collapse of the market is the number of GCP dismissed. How dismission conviction is banks very great in banks more than a risk for the economy, but mathematically our model. Because if our intuition is correct, because we have a more. So, my probability myself. All the more in the article, and we have good aquifers as very natural. As very natural, is that passing if the number of G6 could recover the probability of this one and effectively what their number of infinite probability of collapse of the market will be one, and that is very good when intuition coincided with the automatic password. So, this consequently the number of GIS. The number of GCIs limited by the regulators for the probability of collapse maintenance units of the acceptable probability if using the system. And what these extras converted. And that is the references. So, in this problem, in this limited limit, when we say the alphas. How the estimate is the alphas. So, you can estimate the alphas. Because a function, then we have estimated a function that the How estimate is a function that is part of the more fashion, but more like alpha is constant. But if alpha is constant, then it's a constant that I would say continue, but the more the false data, because the great problem is that it is a very good thing that you complicated. But for intuition, don't say the points that are one. The points that are one, one cosine of probabilities. No, no, no, we don't cross with the three. Because other things that the promotions are very complicated. So, 2020 is going to be very very complicated. So, that we have to assume with a study of licensing, I trust. We are saying that some obligations. We are going to assume that they are constantly, and we have 3. So, if you are thinking, for example, I don't know if I can say no. Nera voluntaria or pacific algae. There are no circumstances because more of the regulators. But it is like very pacific. And if you have a set, varios set, capital segment. Y just without redesign, because we don't casinate it because we don't have, and cases preguntan is today, but you consider that all different. Default, notes like clusters that have default, no. So if you can, like the sesame, we can explain it, if you have the three, three, bananas, or three times of default, can have more cases. You can have what the three, because one and two times, that two time, or that one and three. And that can facile or in the model, tomato. Or in the model, to be 2 minimum. Ah, vases have to be proposed because one of the trespasses or one of us, one two three, and one of three. So you have to, for example, is one vase minimum of this one, minimum está uno two, que representa que uno y el dos avanifo, está uno tres y minimo esta uno two tres. Y eso te includía las possibil. And that included possibilities, all the possible possibilities and scenarios, but to respond to your question to consider these clusters, have because in my case, I don't know, but if you have here the unique thing that involuntaries, that is what connects all and everything in difficulties or independently one. But there are some connected two apart all these trends, and these two, and these two. So, how secretarians are not like clusters, no? At the mejor estos in the usert sector of the economy, but this is very constant for the transaction economic transaction or something.
