Alessandro Tomasiello, and he will be talking about bounds on two spin fields, Kaluza-Quine, two spin fields. Thank you, Ruben, for the introduction. And let me thank the organizers for this great workshop. It is not easy to recreate an atmosphere of a bump event with all the interaction going on, but I think they have done a great job so far. The title is Title is the talk will be about some bounds on calorie-line spin-to fields in compactified theories of gravity. The calorie-line spectrum is, of course, one of the most important pieces of data that we can associate with compactification, but perhaps we have not focused on it as much as we should have, perhaps thinking that not much could be said in general. Much to do, not much to be said in general about it. And yet, recently, well, semi-recent, it has come to the fore for various reasons. And let's say it is relevant to the topic of this workshop in various ways. By the way, I apologize to some of the people in the swamp land community might have heard an earlier and shorter version of An earlier and shorter version of this talk, um, you know, Harvard in collaboration with Romo de Luca, and um, but okay, this is a longer version which also has newer material, so don't despair, only the first couple of slides will be the same. The uh Caluta Knight scale, of course, uh, can be evaluated already from dimensional analysis, more or less we dimensional analysis more or less we don't know what to expect cameron was uh commenting about this that of course we expect it to be proportional to the diameter of bi-dimensional males to a power of the of the of the internal volume uh this n little n will be the rest of this talk the the internal dimension by the way can you see my cursor Also, using my pointer, good and sorry, the diameter is defined as the maximum distance, maximum of the distance between any two points in internal space. It is hard to compute in general the color-defined spectrum. That's another reason that we stopped thinking about it in detail. There are many problems. There are many problems. I mean, some are reviewed in this classic piece of work in the 80s. Basically, the presence of the internal paths mix the different spins that you have in your original theory, and disentangling all the effects becomes the mass. So just to quote Just to quote the final result that is present in this review, not quite final, but one of the main results that is reviewed in this work. You see here that obtaining the spectrum is reduced to a set of internal differential operators and some are some old acquaintances. So for example, here you see the Laplace del Trami. Laplace del Trami operator, just Laplace and a short space. And here you see the analog of the Laplace and on two forms, for example, here on one forms. But as you can see, they get mixed non-trivially with fluxes. The seminance is a parameter that is present in a flux. And this is actually only for the Twan Google case. So if you want to look at another type of compatification, we know that most propagatification. That most of most compatibilations are not point-wooding type, then you have to start over. So the task is kind of complicated and still should find the eigenvalues of all these operators. Here, another older acquaintance is the so-called Likner, which operator that acts on internal intuitive fields. But so. Um so it's so complicated, but you need to then compute the eigenvalues of these internal operators. But for many, for several cases, people have computed these eigenvalues. So typically you can do so when there are many symmetries and you somehow finding the eigenvalues of these operators is reduced to some algebraic computation using the theory. Bright computation using the theory. More recently, there has been great progress in maximum LDP and maximum undersymmetric cases, but enormous progress where the whole total second power in certain cases can be inferred from exceptional or generalized geometry, which is great. But if we want to think about more general cases, again, you should for every new competitive. You should for every compatibility should start over. Except, if you look at this case, here this is a case where they are for this is for spin two fields in the space-time. And then in that case, the terminal operator whose eigenvalues you should look for is the ordinary Laplace Beltram. So this is, in fact, In fact, we think it's too more generally, or rather, it gets generalized very easily. Namely, the internal operator, generalizing in this case, the internal operator is always this simple guy here. Well, it might not look that simple, but for f equals zero, when the warping, this up here, a short time for the warping, for f equals zero. Uh, for f equals zero, uh, this just becomes the ordinary Laplace pan. And by the way, this is the definition of the working. And just a side note, here I'm defining the internal metric in a slightly different way, as always, as many people including myself always do, because it will be convenient to work for all of us. Namely, I take the working as multiplying the internal, the whole metric, not just. The whole metric, not just the external stuff, the external metric. Okay, like I said, the equals zero case represents Laplace detrami. And the simplicity of this operator is such that in many of the cases where people didn't feel like computing of this fashion, they just looked at this particular tower, the tower's input, because it is very easy to compute. Very easy to compute the operator, at least the operator is already up. And so it has been computed in the cases where it has been computed. There are any way any symmetries. Sometimes, of course, there is the case where the internal space is homogeneous, in which case it's really very simple. It's completely used to good theory. Otherwise, sometimes you're lucky and You're lucky, and well, you reduce it to some operator of some two dual problem in one dimension, and sometimes you can solve it explicitly, which is probably coming along happening because exit basically. In particular, so another application of this is that in some cases, looking at this spin-to tower already tells us that It tells us that there is absence of scale saturation. So, because after all, the scale saturation demands all the calories that are spectrum to be much above the scale of the cosmological constant. So if you already see that this particular power doesn't satisfy that property, then you have shown that there is no scale separation. And that is for the classes of supersymmetric ADS7 and ADS6. This six, this happens. Okay, you can show this. So, this is already mini case where you can prove absence of scale separation using this particular tower. But however, so these are still only a few cases where people have looked at this tower. And how about looking at it in general? Well, first of all, theorems about you need some general. You need some general statement about the structure of this operator, and there are some general statements, but they are until recently they were typically formulated not for this operator that I have just presented here, but rather for the ordinary Laplace that run the A equals zero case, the case without working. So here I'm just quoting there, there is a long list of such results. There is a long list of such results. Here, I'm just quoting one of the most famous such results, which bound the smallest mass, the smallest, basically the smallest eigenvalue of this operator from above and probably. Again, this m is the internal dimension, this is the diameter. And well, in both these cases, you see that there was a requirement, namely that the rich sheet. namely that the Ricci tensor is positive that in it. So from now on actually whenever you see this symbol applied to the Ricci tensor or to some matrix, I just mean that it's a symmetric matrix and I'm thinking of it as a quadratic form. So it means that the quadratic form is positive at under this, if you have a manifold with this property, then this follows. There are analogues with the There are analogues with less restrictive conditions. But okay, this is just an appetizer, let's say. And so why is this not enough? Well, first of all, this is not the operator that we need. This is the Laplace Belchami, not this weighted Laplace Belchami, but where the working is also appearing. And also, it's not clear if we try it. If we tried it, it's not clear at all how the equations of motion give up should give a bound on the Richie pencil. And people who have tried typically get typically see that the problem lies in the, exactly in the working. So there are two ways that the warping interferes with our plans. But in this talk, we'll see that these two problems kind of solve each other. Kind of solve each other, and we will see in particular that the equation summarian gave a certain bound on this particular quadratic form pointwise. And this will be, so you might say, well, okay, why do I care about this guy? But the thing is that precisely this combination of the Richie tensor and of the Hessian, this is the Hessian of a function. This is the function of a function, is what several mathematicians have considered independently of our needs. They assumed it for their own reasons, not because they were studying string theory, of course. And in particular, there's something called Bakri-Mary geometry, where this was studied in various directions, generalizing, it was thought of as some sort of generalization of Riemannian geometry. And this is quite enough already to get some results when the internal space is smooth. In various string theory solutions, of course, the internal space is not smooth, namely if you have some symbolizes that are induced by T-brains or O-planes. And at that point, we first hit that series of problems because all the hearings seem to have seen. All the adherents seem to assume smoothness until we found that there was a theory of so-called synthetic pitch bounds, where the entire space is not assumed to be smooth at all. It's a further generalization considered by another community of people. And it's a, let's say, a new, relatively new field which has come together by bringing ideas from mean ideas from probability, optimal transport and the ones. Okay, so I'll use these two tools. So the end point of the introduction is that I will use these two tools to obtain several bounds about the color-draft line spectrum. So first of all, you said the okay, this is the plan, and of course I'll obtain the bound and the Richie tensor that I mentioned. The Richie tensor that I mentioned. Then I will explain this fancy piece of math very quickly, let's say. And then I give some results and some. So the first the Ricci bound. This is really the core of the talk. So as we start in general with the theory where this Mb is the Planck mass and you have the understanding. And you have to understand it that plus some matter. At this point, it doesn't matter what you consider really. And you consider compatibility, which means that the external space is maximally symmetric and then you have an internal manifold. So the equations of motion of phase reverse can be written like this, and I call this p hat. I call this p-hat. Okay, so now you decompose them into internal and external parts. These are the internal equations, and you will be forgiven for thinking that they look like a mess. And in particular, if your aim is to find some the fact that this quadratic thinking of this is a quadratic. Thinking of this as a quadratic form, you see that there are objects that have not either signed. For example, here, this guy, so he's just say the Laplacian of this function, which could have either signed. So, what do we do about it? Well, this will be also true about this Hessian term here, but I'll take care of that later. For now, let me notice that the external equations are motion. Motion also looks complicated, but perhaps a little less. Maybe if you use them, you can see that there are some cancellations and you find a simpler result. Now, this guy here is not so problematic because you can, as a quadratic form, again, you can bound it in this way. And this guy here, well, in general, perhaps you don't know, but it is. But it is non-negative for all the bulk fields in type 2 supergravity and d pulse 11 supergravity. It's easy to plug it in, take the stress energy tensor of the fields, of the bulk fields of this theories and check a species that this is the case. And we call this the reduced energy condition. It's not really an energy condition that we use for. An energy condition in the universal sense of the word because those energy conditions don't make any reference to a compatibility, but we call this nevertheless just for ease of explanation. So this REC sometimes call it this a property that we need for the stress energy time. So in this sense, our results will be more general than just for type 2 and equals 11 for reality. Okay, however, for now on, I will you're encouraged to fix your attention on that particular case. For brain sources, we also check that this is true. However, brain sources and localized objects in general are a bit funny because we don't typically check these equations of motion on an object, not even in general relativity on the fast field solution. This is a problem that I don't want to comment about for now. Comment about for now, but perhaps you can ask me about it later. Okay, so we have the result of what we obtained in the previous slide is that all this stuff that I put on the left-hand side has a bound by this negative number. So it's not strictly positive, but at least it has a bound from below, where I introduced, sorry, I introduced this sigma, which is the Which is the minus for soup, so there's the supremum of the working function, which is pre-managed to simplify matters. Okay, so certainly for smooth cases, there will be such a supremum. And for cases with range, we will see almost always actually there is one. This is in part because the metric that we're using to compute this. And to complete this norm here is the dewped metric, the one with the walking has been put in front. So this guy, I mentioned earlier that this is the Hashan who knows what sign it has, but it doesn't matter because this is exactly the combination that people in this people who talk about this pre-MP geometry like to think about. Geometry like to think about the it comes up naturally, it's not quite a coincidence. So, here it looks like we have a amazing lucky, amazingly lucky strike that exactly one of the combinations that appears in the equations of motion of various gravity theories have been considered by mathematicians for other reasons. But if you dig a little deeper, Dig a little deeper, it's not a complete coincidence, let's say. The reasons that this appears are similar as the reasons why this appears in our context. But okay, it's reasonably, we are reasonably lucky. And we don't see that this is quite enough to the Eyes and Megalvadue balance in those note case. Basically, we at this point after having obtained our contribution so far was to Our contribution so far was to notice that this is found and to notice that this is exactly what mathematicians are looking for or considering. However, before, so that now I could go and fetch appropriate results from the literature and tell you already what results. However, in the non-I want to comment first about what happens in the non-smost case, because after all, we know that many cases that many solutions. That many cases that many solutions we are interested in do have singularities. So, here the like really memory petitioners are not enough for us and we need the big guns. And this is the field of optimal transport, which I mentioned in the introduction. They suggested what they consider a natural generalization of our Natural generalization of our Ricci bound. In particular, there is a definition which came together in the last few years. Essentially, the final piece in this definition was given in 2014 by these fellows. And this notion is a space that can be singular. And this is And this is why it is useful for generalization for us. But another reason that it is useful for us is that what they provide, once attached, associated with this definition, is a definition of weighted Laplacian. So with this function, and not just Laplace by Grammy, but it's Laplace with the weights, which is what we would like to think of as warping. As warping, which is self-adjoint, and also otherwise, if you don't give the sometimes you just give the expression of the thing, but you don't say in what domain it acts, it might not be self-adjoint, but only formally symmetric. And in fact, because of that, they also are able to give bounds on eigenvalues, which is what we care about today. Okay, so this here is a book. I forgot to mention this this year is a book which I, if you are curious about this field, this book highly recommend it was written by Vilani. It's not completely up to date because it was written in 2008. There are also some lectures he gave in 2015 at Takabi. But it's But it's a the length of this book is a thousand pages. So I will now try to summarize it in one slide. So please forgive me if I don't completely succeed. In particular, I will have to sacrifice a lot of rigor on the altar of speech. So the half-analogy that these people proposed is These people propose is this. So, suppose you have this notion of a theory with a positive second derivative, and then you want to generalize it to non-smooth functions, functions that might have an angular point. How would you do it? Well, this is well known, you would say that the matterization is the notion of convexity, which Which doesn't require the second derivative to be well defined everywhere, but it is a more global property. You don't need to actually do any derivatives anywhere. A global property that you can check just by, as it's well known, it just requires that given any two points, the segment joining them is above the graph of the function. Fine. Fine. So the generalization that they propose is of our notion is the following. I will do it for k equals zero for simplicity. There is a slightly more complicated notion for a bound which is negative, which is what we actually need. And in this case, the X C D by the way this RCD stands for Riemannian for virtual dimension. For Riemannian curvature dimension, there was an earlier definition called the curvature dimension because it's not from somehow mixes the both the involves both the dimension and the manifold and the covert. And then the R is for reminding, which is a refinement that I'm actually not explaining. But oversimplifying, really, the idea is that now they talk about convexity. They talk about convexity, a deep convexity or something, but convexity of what? They consider, well, you can think about them as two functions, let's say, but you can also think about them as, so these functions should be non-negative, and it is proper to integrate to one with certain measure, which might not be just the square root of g, but it would. Just a square root of g, but e to the f square root of g. And so maybe it's better to think of them as probability distributions, or if you want, as piles of stuff, you have a pile of stuff which has been assigned to you, and you have to turn it into different pile of the same stuff, but arrange differently. Say that you have a mound of earth, you need to move it somewhere else, okay, with a given assigned shape. Given a sign shape. And what is the best way? What is the most economical way to do so? Well, intuitively, if you had to do it in a cross space, you would think that you take every piece of this pile and transport it along a geodesic. So the problem is perhaps not of obvious solution, but there is a whole theory of how this is done. This is done and it's it defines if you want a distance of among two probability distributions between two probability distributions on your space. And this distance has a name, it's called cantorobich passage time. There is a very entertaining account of how this came to be and of its interpretations in the context of the policy. In the context of the politics of the Soviet Union, in the field by Vileni, which is funny because Vileni is himself a politician, as our French friends here know very well. And this picture also is taken from Vileni's book. So the idea is that you define, so this is a very physical, I mean it has a physical flavor really. You define, so you consider this integer, which naturally they tend to call an entropy. They tend to call an entropy. And somehow, so what you require is that this entropy in going from the initial configuration to the final configuration should behave as a complex function along the best way to transform one into the other. This is what this picture here is meant to convey. Somehow the thing will expand. The thing will expand while you move all this stuff around and then repollapse at the end. Okay, so why on earth would they consider such a definition? Well, the thing is, if you do this on a smooth space, it will turn out that the requiring of this stuff coincides precisely with this bound. This bound. But the point is that this property makes sense of some singular cases. So why am I telling you all this? Well, because let's see, are brain singularities, do brain singularities have this property? Well, this is a problem that you can consider or less locally. In the case of GP. case of uh d p brains with uh p less or equal than five then article zero is actually with this definition that i get here d working uh the in thermometric uh article zero is actually at infinite distance and so mathematicians are completely unphased but they do consider that uh so they article zero is not even in the metric so they can see that the space at this point is smooth moreover this uh sigma here Moreover, this sigma here is finite, so very good for our purposes. The D6 case is slightly funny because it has an infinite sigma as we defined it earlier. However, you can still give a bound if you want because this guy, upon examination in the neighborhood of D6, you see, even though the general argument I gave that doesn't guarantee it, if you look. If you look closely, you'll see that this is bounded anyway. And for this case, we actually gave with our mathematician friends definition, sorry, a proof of the fact that this is actually in this class. But sorry, I forgot to say, but one of my collaborators, I should have said it in the very first slide, one of my collaborators. The very first slide. One of my collaborators is Denukam, with whom we collaborated on both papers. But in the second paper, we enlisted two refined mathematicians to help us who are experts in this field. And they are the Ponti, a professor in CISTAM, professor in Oxford. The D7 and D8 are a case where these sigma is automatically finite. Automatically finite, and also in this case, it was not so obvious that the species are RCD, but we hope that. So, in any case, if all this was too long for you, the short answer to the initial question is yes. So we can, in this RCD notion, it's indeed relevant to the physics. Okay, so now we can finally read the benefits of all this. Of all this in the let's see in the smooth case first. First of all, so we have a bound like this which we took from our bound on the Richie and from the results in the free energy thermometer. This mass here would reduce to one over the volume if A was zero. But it is most useful thought of in terms of the Planck masses of the M capital D of the original theory, the M10, for example, M11, and the reduced Planck mass in lower dimensions. It is rather nice to look at, maybe it looks long, but this alpha and data are some constants of over a few thousands. Or there are 2000s, let's say, but I think they can be imposed from NDP. But all this, first we are started, but then this is not enough to exclude scale separation, basically because of the reason that Cameron was mentioning and many people have realized over the some time. So you can make this volume to be This volume to be really small by considering portions, and so that this one over the volume will get very large. And so, this bound gets less and less useful. Alternatively, you have several bounds, both from above and from below, in terms of the diameter. And this look more useful in this respect. So, if you want to So if you want to prove scale separation in smooth case at this point, the presence of this bound tells you that it would be enough to show that there's a lower bound than the dam. Or that on the other hand, if you want to disprove that converted there is no scale separation, there is no case, you might just want to, if you exhibit If you exhibit a case with a small parameter, you will know automatically from this bound of that convergence disproven. Now let's move on to cases which also allow for singularities. And there are a few. So this actually adapts. You're running out of time. I'm running out of time. It's four or five. Okay, I'll try to wrap up in how many minutes do I have? Two. I'll do my best. So how do I pronounce this? Okay, so good. So first of all, I have this. Uh, I have this bound on the first second value on the first on the smallest mass, and this involves something interesting. It's something called the Shiger constant, which is small when your space has a small neck. So, this is basically a perimeter of area, and you're supposed to look for something that has this quantity to be small, then this will happen when. Small, then this will happen when your space has a small map. In this situation, so by making this h1 small, for example, you'll see that m1 gets small. Moreover, we have generalizations, and this we proved ourselves for cases where for higher eigenvalues, which involve similar definitions, which detect presence of more than one map. One application that I think the present card might be interested in is this. If, in particular, as a consequence of the previous slide, we have this. And in particular, if M1 is much larger than this quantity, basically then the modulical constant, then if you have this, which implies You have this, which implies what if you lower n1, basically it will want to drag all the other eigenvalues with it. And this is actually in agreement with one of the, so in agreement, and this regime proves one of the, in the KK case, one of the cases, let's say an application of the spin-to conjecture. Now, since I am running out of time, I've got a message. I'm coming out of time. I've got the message. I'll jump, skip right ahead to another thing I wanted to say about this. Well, first of all, compatible analogs. There are mainly to the examples here. Some motivating examples were by Parkas et al., which are very nice. So this put us on the center of this Jiggle constant, which is the Of this J-Ref constant because they were considering spaces basically like this, and they provide compatibility with like in two fields. But let me skip to another example, which is mother synonyms. In this case, many of us know these types of solutions, and the point here is that the The spectrum, if you want a light spectrum, you can obtain it whenever the Riemann surface is such that it has several small maps. Moreover, as a consequence of the so-called Pan decomposition of Riemann surfaces, the number of small max is competitive unabook, which means that you can obtain as many light eigenvalues as you want. Many light eigenvalues as you want, and here is an example where you can get even one small eigenvalue without all the others falling down. So, before we had this phenomenon that if M1 was far above this line here, the others had to follow. But we can, in this maldestenominius case, we can provide examples where they don't go down. However, okay, from conversations with the authors of the conjecture, that became. It became apparent that their conjecture was motivated best in cases with lambda equals zero, so perhaps it's not surprising that it is in this generalization. And here are my conclusions. Sorry for slightly over time. In the smooth case, we've got some balance in terms of the volume, weighted volume really, and the diameter. Diameter, but we also have some bounds and physics with brain singularities. I should say we are working on improving these bounds so that they also apply in the physics with brain singularities. But right now, we have these in terms of these results in terms of the G-G constants, which we saw are already of some use to various conjectures, swamp-long conjectures. And okay, so there are various organizations you might want to consider. But let me mention one last thing. That let me mention one last thing. So, I feel that this field of optimal transport has a physics flavor to it. And I think it's not a complete coincidence that we were able to use it for this problem. It might be of deeper significance, perhaps, especially this notion of distance between solutions that they introduced. Okay, thanks. All right, thank you, Alessandro. And please go ahead and ask some questions. Please, Thomas. Okay, thank you. I was wondering concerning the conclusions. So I guess the idea would be to use this formalism and to apply it to actual examples that we are discussing currently, correct? So for instance, in the case of type 2A vacuum, there is a class without Romans. There is a class without Roman Smiths, but on a non-trivial generalized Calabria. Would you somehow then see that the lift to 11 dimensions turns the bound with the Sigar constant into the bound that you first put? And could you actually say something about it? Do you think you can show the consistency or the inconsistency of these constructions in this formalism? That's a good question. Are you referring to your latest paper? So the first one, I didn't understand your first. I didn't know if I can understand your first comment because I would contend that I already applied it to some cases of some interest. But could you apply to the type 2A vector which are claimed to be scale-separated? Maybe you could uncover a problem with them. Do you mean that the ones that you consider that which then can be lifted, the one that you consider with Jungans and this is a good idea actually? I don't know why I didn't. I don't know why I didn't think of it. But does that mean that you have some doubts about it? So let me get this. So from what I recall, the possible things that you didn't know was about the gluing with the regions where the O sixes get lifted to a TI heat chin spaces. Spaces right. So, I guess you could try to apply Chiga. I didn't think of it, but I guess you could try to apply Chiga to those regions, for example, to see if the... So the problem in applying Chiga, as far as I can tell, I mean, the problem, the challenge is to find some good candidate. Of course, if you are a mathematician, it's on a complicated basis, it's a mess. Complicated spaces, it's a mess to apply. But for example, in the cases by Bacchus, there was in that case there was a clear candidate for where the trigger should constant should be realized. Namely, I mean, there was a clear map. And in that case, with some effort, we were able to compute the Tiger constant. And the result agrees quite well, I would say, with Morris. Well, I would say with more explicit computations done by Pacas and Laptas. You might think that in your case, for example, one could apply it to something that has a boundary on the region where the O6 used to sit prior to the lifting. Maybe that's a good idea, and maybe you should try that actually. That's a good point. Now I might look stupid that I haven't thought about this, but what I had thought about is the question I expected was NFPK to BPKT, where I had an answer which was that unfortunately currently we cannot apply them to orientable singularities. But we're also working on that, but I all right now Alessandro starts asking his own questions. So I just think that you know. I told you not to do that. So you told me not to do this. Any more questions by other people? No. All right. So thanks again then. Thank you.
