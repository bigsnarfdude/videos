Cal Floyd. Today I'll be talking about dissipation and large mechanical energy fluctuations during cytoskeletal self-organization. So, this is work that was done during my PhD at the University of Maryland, which I just finished in May of this year. And it was co-advised by Chris Jarzinski and Garrick Bapoyan. And Garrick also gave a talk during this conference, I think, on Monday. So, to start, I'll just introduce the system of the status quo. The system of the cytoskeleton and how it can be viewed as a biological active matter system. So, the cytoskeleton is a very central player in cell biology. It's very highly conserved across all of life. All cells from every domain of life have some form of a cytoskeleton. And more than just being the skeleton, it's kind of like the musculoskeletal system of the cell body, because not only does it support the body of the cell, but it's also involved in these numerous physiological processes that require it to exert. Processes that require it to exert useful mechanical work. So, these include things like cell migration, where a cell moves from point A to point B, endocytosis, where a cell brings a foreign body inside of itself, and cytokinesis, where a cell will divide and form two daughter cells. And so just to kind of highlight how important of a system this is, there are dedicated textbooks and dedicated journals and special issues of journals all focused on the cytoskeleton. So, the cytoskeleton performs many different functions in the cell, and that's kind of allowed for by a very vast array of accessory proteins that modulate the cytoskeletal behavior. But to kind of simplify the problem a bit in our talk today, we'll be focusing on a sort of parsimonious subset of components that make up what's called an actinyosin network. So, we'll just be focused on three components. First, are these actin filaments, which are visualized as These actin filaments, which are visualized in red here, these are semi-flexible polymers that form a kind of scaffolding system. We also have these myosin motor proteins that consume ATP and they bind to pairs of filaments and walk along in a directed manner along the filaments. And by doing that, they generate force and motion in the network. And then we also have these cross-linking proteins shown in green, which are passive, meaning they don't consume ATP, but they bind kind of ATP, but they bind kind of at a short distance to nearby filaments and mechanically connect the network. And they actually kind of act to amplify the force that was produced by these myosin motors. So the cytoskeleton falls into this very broad class of systems called active matter systems. These are defined as being made up of particles that individually can transduce some energy source into directed motion. So this is in contrast to a system where you might just like be pushing on the boundary. Just like be pushing on the boundary to drive it out of equilibrium. There are many examples of active matter systems at a range of different scales. We can think of like a flock of birds that kind of look to their neighbors and individually orient, but still have this kind of collective self-organization pattern. There are also these robots of collectives that can be programmed and interact in various ways to also give rise to the self-organized behavior. We can think of like a film of bacteria where you get this kind of really complicated. Where you get this kind of really complicated texture of pneumatic defects that are constantly being created and annihilating with each other. And then also we have the cytoskeleton. So here's a cell that is migrating in to close a wound, and the F-actin cytoskeleton is visualized. And you can see how it's like very dynamically causing the cell boundary to change as this wound healing process goes on. So at least one feature. So, at least one feature that unifies all of these kind of very different systems is that they're not at thermodynamic equilibrium. So, they're all kind of individually consuming energy to carry out this kind of dynamic patterns. So, that's kind of the perspective that we'll try to analyze the settle-skeleton through in this kind of perspective as an active matter system. So, there are two routes that ATP is consumed in. ATP is consumed in through in cytoscultal networks. The first is through this route of active filament polymerization. So the individual actin monomers each bind ATP molecules and will hydrolyze ATP and then release the phosphate, converting it from an ATP bound form to an eventually an ADP bound form. And then because of the different association and dissociation kinetics at the plus and minus ends, this ATP hydrolysis sets up a non-equilibrium steady state in which the Equilibrium steady state in which the filament can move forward without its total length changing. So that's shown in this simulation video on the bottom here, where a bundle is kind of treadmilling towards the right boundary. And this is an active ATP consuming process. The other route is through these myosin motors. So we'll be considering a myosin mini filament, which contains many of these individual myosin heads. Every head has an actin binding site and an ATP binding site. The ATP binding site can The ATP binding site can hydrolyze ATP, which drives a power stroke cycle that causes the filament to step forward on the actin filament. So, in this simulation video, we're showing these two actin filaments on which this blue myosin motor is kind of walking, and it generates a net sliding force that separates the filaments. So, we'll be interested in the kind of energetics of these active processes. So, just to kind of put us on the thermodynamic back. To kind of put us on the thermodynamic background that we need, our system contains water and the actamiosin material, and we assume that it can exchange heat with this environment. And it's a liquid system, so we assume that if there's like a negligible amount of PV work being done, so even though our simulations are at constant volume, we'll be talking about the Gibbs free energy of these systems. We also assume that the boundaries can supply a constant concentration of ATP units hydrolysis products. So, for every kind of process that happens in these So, for every kind of process that happens in these networks, there will be some associated delta G of that process. And we can break that up into a delta G from chemical reactions and a delta G from mechanical energy. So that's given by this thing here. The definition of delta G is that it's equal to the change in enthalpy of the system minus T times the change in entropy of the system. And the change of enthalpy of the system is equal to minus t times the change in entropy of the environment. So delta G is really just equal to minus T times the total change of entropy of the system. The total change of entropy of the system and environment. And this we say that dissipation happens when delta s total is positive, meaning that there's been a spontaneous process in which the total entropy of the system environment has decreased, meaning that delta G is negative. And if we break it down into this way, we see that this can happen when the amount of chemical energy that's been consumed is greater in magnitude than the amount of mechanical work that that has been used to fuel. So there's been some dissipation of. So, there's been some dissipation of that chemical energy. So, just to give a simple example of a dissipative process, we can think of something like a block sliding down a hill, where in the beginning we have this gravitational potential energy, which could be used for useful work, but as it slides down, the friction just converts it into heat. And even more simply, we can just think of burning a hundred dollar bill because at the beginning we have something useful like money, and at the end, all we have is heat. So, given this background, So, given this background, there are a couple of questions that were interested through this work. The first is that it's kind of well known that there is this free energy transduction process inside of sculptural networks, but it's very hard to like kind of put numbers on how much chemical energy is being consumed and how much work is being done. So the first question is kind of methodological. How can we quantify this energy transduction? And then, if we could quantify it, then we could ask about the efficiency of this transduction, like how much of the chemical energy is. Like, how much of the chemical energy is actually being used to do work and how much is being dissipated? Then, there are also these papers that kind of show that the mechanical relaxation, so like things like filament unbending and the release of mechanical energy inside of cultural networks, has been observed to be fairly unpredictable. So, there's actually this paper called The Dissipation of Contractile Forces, The Missing Piece of Cell Mechanics, where they argue that there's something that's poorly understood about the nature of mechanical relaxation. Understood about the nature of mechanical relaxation in status sculptures networks that is underlying these widely variable force measurements that are made on cells. So, our final question is kind of how can we think more about mechanical relaxation inside of sculptural networks? So, next I'll talk about some of our methodology based on Medium. So, Garrick introduced this platform on Monday, but I'll just describe it again. So, Median stands for Mechanochemical Dynamics of Active Networks. Dynamics of active networks. It's a simulation platform in which the volume is composed of these compartments. Inside each compartment is a well-mixed number of diffusing species. And between compartments, we have a reaction-diffusion master equation that describes chemical reactions within one compartment and hopping events representing diffusion between compartments. So we can have concentration gradients on the scale of the entire system volume. Then, on top of this compartment gradient, Then, on top of this compartment grid, we overlay a representation of the mechanical polymer network. And then we can have reactions that happen between polymers within some compartment and the local concentration of diffusing particles. So this could be things like linkers binding and motors walking or polymerization events. So we have mechanics and chemistry both represented, but we also include a coupling between mechanics and chemistry through these certain force-sensitive reactions. These certain force-sensitive reaction rates. So, like a linker could be under some tension, and that tension will alter its unbinding reaction rate. So, this mechanochemical feedback is also included in these simulations. So, here's just a video of a median trajectory. This is a 3x3x3 micron system. There are six cube compartments. So, there's six compartments per side. And here are the concentrations of the different components. The different components. And the way that median simulations kind of move forward in time is by iterating through a cycle of four substeps. So the first step is that we do a short burst of stochastic chemical simulation using the Gillespie algorithm, which is like a Monte Carlo approach for simulating the reaction diffusion master equation. We do a short burst of that, so we have a bunch of chemical reactions happen. And then those chemical reactions could be things like motors walking or linkers binding. Motors walking or linkers binding. So there will generally be some change in the mechanical energy of the system as a result of the reactions during step one. So in step two, we compute what those new changes are. And then we require that the system is always kind of near mechanical equilibrium. So in step three, we just minimize the mechanical entry function with respect to other positions of everything, and we bring it back to like a kind of a net zero net force situation where it's at equilibrium again. And then in step four, we account for this kind of And then in step four, we account for this kind of mechanochemical coupling by updating the reaction rates based on the new forces in the system. And so typically, this cycle is about 0.05 seconds of real time. And so there's like, yeah, so it happens about 20 times per second. And we just kind of keep doing this to move the simulation forward. So we want to kind of bake into this protocol a way to characterize the change in Gibbs-free energy of the system. Characterize the change in Gibbs free energy of the system. So, we first can think about the net change of the Gibbs-free energy across the entire cycle. We call that thing delta G dissipated. So, this is an isolated system. So, any decrease in the Gibbs free energy is just dissipated free energy. And that's made up of several terms. The first comes from this first step where we just have this chemical simulation. So there's a bunch of chemical reactions happening. And for each one of those reactions, we compute the delta G and then we sum them all together to get this delta G K. And then we sum them all together to get this delta G chem, which is the total change in good for energy coming from the chemical reactions in step one. Then in step two, we think about how the mechanical energy has changed as a result of the chemical reactions during step one. And that could be positive or negative, but usually it's positive. And we call that quantity delta G stress. And then we think of delta G chem dissipated as the amount of chemical energy that's been consumed that has not been used to kind of put new not been used to kind of put new mechanical energy into the system. So the difference of delta G chem and delta G stress is called delta G chem dissipated. It's just the heat of reactions. And then in step three, we are minimizing mechanical energy. This is like a mechanical dissipation step. So that will always be a decrease and that's just dissipated mechanical energy and we call that quantity delta G mech dissipated. And then finally the net change of the mechanical energy across this entire cycle is the difference of delta G. Is the difference of delta G mech dissipated in delta G stress? We call that thing delta G mech. And we can compute the total delta G dissipated as either the sum of delta G chem and delta G mech, or as the sum of delta G chem dissipated and delta G mech dissipated. So to kind of put this into simulation, we just need to figure out ways to compute these quantities at different steps of the simulation cycle. First, we'll talk about how we do the mechanical energy parts. So this is the mechanical energy model that's used in median. the mechanical energy model that's used in median. A filament is discretized into a sequence of thin cylinders that are joined at these hinge points. Every cylinder has a stretching potential and there are bending potentials between the hinge points. There's also this potential to prevent cylinders from overlapping with each other. And then in addition, the motors and the linkers also have a stretching potential. So we can just evaluate this function, this U function, as a function of this. function as a function of the positions of everything in the chemical topology at different points during that cycle to get these quantities delta G stress and delta G mech dissipated. So to get the chemical for energy changes that actually required some more new work, there are these textbook formulas that say that delta G for a reaction is equal to delta G naught plus KBT times the log of the reaction quotient. We tried that formula, but we actually found that we're getting really incorrect. Formula, but we actually found that we're getting really incorrect results that didn't make any sense. And we realized that that only applies when your copy numbers are continuous quantities. So, kind of in the large copy number limit, the continuous approximation is okay, but we can have things like just tens of copy numbers. So, we needed a discrete version of those formulas. So we derived new formulas, which is reported in this paper. And this is just to show two test cases where we implement these more formulas and show that they give better, more realistic behavior. Give better, more realistic behavior. So, in the top one, we have this reversible reaction of A and B going to C. And the red, the blue curve shows the rate of change of gift-train energy coming from the forward reaction. The red curve shows the rate of change of gift-free energy coming from the reverse reaction. The black curve is the sum. And as this thing settles to equilibrium, the total rate of change given by the black curve should stochastically fluctuate around zero. But it only does that if we use these updated discrete formulas for the delta G of reaction. If we use the original formula, If we use the original formulas, we wrongly center this thing around negative 0.08. And we also have a similar formula for the delta G that happens when a species jumps from compartment to compartment. If we use our kind of new formulas, then this thing will fluctuate around zero. But if we use the incorrect formula, then actually this thing is very strongly biased and it gives us like a very incorrect equilibrium rate of change of Gibbs free energy. So that's kind of how we compute the delta jet. That's kind of how we compute the delta G chem and delta G mech quantities that were in that energy level diagram. Okay, so one of the first things that we looked at was the dissipation that comes from this active treadmilling process. So first we had to kind of make sure we understood the chemical reaction network that described this process well. So we had this paper where we just did modeling of an ODE system to describe this polymerization process where we distinguished between unpolymedization. We distinguish between unpolymerized and polymerized actin and the different hydrolysis states of the polymerized actin and unpolymerized actin. And then we looked at the dissipation that accompanies this kind of polymerization process. And what we found is that you'll start from some kind of pool of unplumerized actin, and then you'll polymerize. And as it happens, the dissipation rate will always kind of go to this low, steady state. And that can be understood just as a kind of feature of this chemical reaction network. So if we just Reaction network. So, if we just for now neglect these reverse reaction rates here, which have very small rate constants, then once a monomer is polymerized, it's kind of like a one-way street to the ADP-bound polymerized F-actin form. And then, once it's in that form, it's a fairly inert molecule because its kinetics are limited by the number of minus n's, which we take to be a constant for now. So, you kind of have all this actin that just gets kind of shuffled eventually into this very inert. Eventually, into this very inert ADP-bound form, and that results in this kind of monotonic decrease of the dissipation rate as you kind of start from the sun polymerized pool and go to the steady state treadmilling state. We next looked at kind of full median simulations where we keep track of like things for the Gibbs for energy change from motor walking and all the mechanics and stuff. And so here's another video of a one by one by one micron system. One by one micron system. So here's in the bottom, we see this plot of these different contributions to the dissipation. So the blue curve is the total, delta G dissipated, and the remaining curves are these contributions, chem dissipated, mech dissipated, and so on. And we see that there's this very large initial transient phase, which comes from, if I replay this video, we start from these short seed filaments and a big pool of unplymerized actin. And then within the first 10 seconds, the The polymerization process basically reaches its own steady state. And so we have this big spike of dissipation immediately. Then the polymers are at their steady state lengths. And then the slower process of myosin-driven network reorganization happens. And during that, we see this trend where the chemical dissipation starts to go down and the mechanical dissipation starts to go up. So this happens because as the network is becoming more and more densely cross-linked during this kind of contraction phase, more of the chemical Phase, more of the chemical energy is actually being used to put mechanical work to the system, just because the linkers are basically there to absorb it. So over time, the efficiency, which we can think of as like the rate of delta G chem dissipated over delta G mech dissipated, will go up. It also changes as we vary the concentrations of myosin and crosslinker. So in this spar chart, we're looking from here to here to here. We increase the myosin concentration, and within each set of three, we increase the crosslinker concentration. Each set of three, we increase the crossinger concentration. And so we see, like, especially for this one, as we increase the crossinger concentration, a lot more of the dissipation is coming from mechanical dissipation compared to chemical dissipation. So basically, when you have crosshinkers, then a myosin motor will cause filaments to kind of buckle rather than just slide past each other. So these cross anchors really kind of mechanically connect the network and absorb some of the work that's produced by myosins. And thereby, they greatly affect the efficiency of that process. Greatly affect the efficiency of that process. Another trend that we saw is due to the stalling of motors. So here's that video again of the myosin motor walking. It has some walking rate, which depends on the instantaneous force along the molecule. There's some characteristic stall force that controls the force that is needed to kind of prevent the motor from walking. So this is the force that I'm talking about. And then we looked at different conditions. And then we looked at different conditions of crossing or concentration and stall force. So, if the stall force is very large, then the motor is very hard to stall. But if the stall force is pretty small, then it's easily stalled. And for high concentrations of cross-linkers, as shown on this blue curve, we see that like the network tension builds up slowly over time and the typical force on the motors increases. And so their ATP consumption rate will go down on this kind of slow time scale just due to this kind of. Slow time scale just due to this kind of mechanical self-organization process. So we have this kind of general trend of like a dis of a minimization over time of these dissipation rates. We can also, instead of looking at trajectories, look at like, if we just take the steady state and look at like the fluctuations of each of these quantities, we can compute histograms. And what we observed is that the mechanical fluctuations have these very heavy tails in their distribution. So they're actually not visualized in these. Distribution. So they're actually not visualized in these plots. They're cut off here. But we observe that they have much heavier tails than Gaussians. And we observed this, and then we found out that there are these papers in the literature that also claim to observe heavy tail distributions of cytoskeltalital fluctuations. And so we became really interested in this topic. And that kind of fueled the next part of the talk that I'll get to. So we did this whole other kind of separate project on this topic of cytoskeletal avalanches. Cytoskeletal avalanches. So, just to give some more of the background of the other papers, there's this one paper in 2016 where they placed microbeads on top of these cells and they attached it through the cell membrane to the underlying cytoskeltin cortex. And they just looked at the displacement in the XY plane of these microbeads and how they were pulled by the cytoskeltin over time. So, here are two trajectories here and here. They then plotted the distribution of the magnitude of these displacements. Of the magnitude of these displacements from time point to time point, they found that these distributions had these kind of Gaussian centers plus these noticeable heavy tails. There was another paper in 2019 where they placed cells on top of these flexible micropost arrays, and they looked at the displacements of these microposts from time point to time point. And there they also found these kind of noticeable heavy tails in the distributions of these displacements. So in the earth science literature, the So, in the earth science literature, the Gutenberg-Richter law says that the probability of an earthquake occurring has a power law dependence on the energy released by that earthquake. So, by analogy with the heavy-tailed distributions of there, these authors coined the term cytoquake to refer to like a large sudden event in cytoskeletal dynamics. One reason that we think that this is a very interesting topic is that we think that because of these kind of inherently large fluctuations, it may imply that the status quo has an inherently large. The Scottish culture has an inherently large susceptibility to a changing local environment. Just to think of an example, we can look at this video of kind of very famous video from the 1950s of this white blood cell following around this bacteria and then eventually overtaking and capturing it. So it's following this kind of gradient of chemoattractance, and it needs to kind of very quickly adjust its direction to keep up with this bacteria. And so there's a changing chemical environment, and then it's kind of quickly able to. And then it's kind of quickly able to steer and move towards the new direction. And we think that these kind of inherently large fluctuations in the statuskeleton may mean that there's a large susceptibility to a changing field. We can think of an analogy with like the Ising model near its critical point, where it has a large inherent fluctuations and also has a very large susceptibility to an applied magnetic field. So, this connection is just a speculation right now, but we think it's plausible and would be. We're really interested to see if this kind of And would be really interested to see if this kind of is borne out by future work. So, we're interested to kind of study these large events in our simulations. From now on, we'll just be focusing on the mechanical energy, which we call U. And we'll be looking at these increments, delta U, just from time point to time point. So this is like delta G mech from the previous slides. Here's a trajectory of U over time. If we blow up into this trajectory, we see that there are these occasional events where U is decreasing by these very large amounts. By these very large amounts, and also occasionally it will increase by large amounts, shown by this kind of green slice here. So, here we're plotting the CCDFs: it's one minus the cumulative distribution function of the positive in green and negative in blue delta U increments. So, we see that, and then, so those are the solid lines here. The dotted lines are the best fit Gaussian. So, we see that they definitely both have heavier tails on a Gaussian. Have heavier tails on a Gaussian, they're better fit by these stretched exponential functions. And furthermore, the negative increments are more broadly distributed than the positive increments. So even though both things are heavy-tailed, there's this kind of comparative slow accumulation of mechanical energy that is released by these more broadly distributed fastened releases. So, this supports this kind of avalanche-like picture of slow energy gain and fast energy release. We can look more closely at what. We can look more closely at what's happening to the rest of the network during these kind of rare events. So, here we're looking at simulation cycles in which delta U was less than negative 100 kBT, between negative 100 and zero, and so on. And we look at the total filament displacement during each of these cycle types. And we see that during these kind of sinoquake events where it's less than negative 100 kbt, the total filament displacement is greater than during all their cycle types. So there's a large net motion of the network during these rare events of energy release. Rare events of energy release. Moreover, this is not just coming from kind of highly localized large displacements, but actually all filaments in the network displace more than usual. So we can rank each filament, each of the 50 filaments, according to its displacement during that cycle and plot the displacement against the rank. And this blue curve representing cytoquakes sits entirely above those of the other curves, meaning that all filaments in the network displace more than usual during these cytoque events. In addition, we can look at the spatial distribution of tension in the network and look at how, and then for that distribution, we can compute the entropy and we can look at how that entropy changes during these cycles. So, if this thing goes up, then the tension has become more uniformly distributed. And we see that during these cytoquake events, there is a spreading out of tension. And this has a more kind of heavy tail distribution than any other cycle type. So, cytochakes are kind of correlated with a large collective motion and a A large collective motion and a spreading out of tension. We're also interested to look at the vibrational normal modes of these networks to see how they might be connected to these cytochrome events. So we constructed the Hessian matrix of the energy function, and we can diagonalize that to give the vibrational normal modes. And the corresponding eigenvalues represent the stiffness. We can also define a measure of mode delocalization as Rk, which just basically tells you how many degrees of freedom are involved in that vibrational mode. In that vibrational mode. So here we're looking at a fairly delocalized mode because the entire network is kind of involved in this motion. We constructed the density of states at just some time point. So we're looking at kind of the proportion of eigenvalues that are in a certain range. We see that there's kind of this twin peak structure where there's a lot of stiff eigenvalues and a lot of kind of soft eigenvalues. We can plot that against the delocalization data as Rk. That's the scatterplot data here. That's the scatterplot data here. And we see that the soft modes tend to be much more delocalized than the stiff modes. So we have this picture of like highly localized stiff modes and more delocalized soft modes. We can look just how these things depend on different conditions of motor and crossfinger concentration. So here we're changing the motor concentration and going up in color, we're increasing the crossfinger concentration. Crossing your concentration. And we see this kind of interesting non-monotonic dependence of the mode delocalization. We were kind of able to understand that by considering also a graph representation of the network, where we consider nodes in the graph to be filaments that are connected by crossing curves representing the edges in the graph. And if we look at the mean node connectivity of this graph, we see that this trend kind of correlates pretty closely with the mode delocalization trend. So the degree of connectedness by The degree of connectedness by cross-linkers kind of informs you about how delocalized the modes are able to be, which I think is a kind of intuitive connection. We can also look at how these things change over time. So here we're just looking at a time trajectory, and we see that as this network kind of self-organizes and stiffens, the mode delocalization kind of increases, as does the typical stiffness of the network. So both the mean of the R and this typical value of And this typical value of lambda goes up over time. We next want to kind of see how these modes were connected to the side quick events. So we can track the whole motion of the network by d, which is a 3-n-dimensional vector, just saying how the network moved during that cycle. And we can project that onto each of the vk. So that gives us this projection d sub k. d and v are both normalized vectors, so the sum of bk squared will be equal to one. squared will be equal to one. And we can use that to define this measure of effective stiffness as the weighted sum of the eigenvalues given by these displacement weights dk squared. So it's the stiffness weighted by how much displacement there was along that mode. We can make a scatter plot of the delta u of every cycle and its corresponding effective stiffness. And we see again that it has this kind of very asymmetric structure about delta u is equal to zero. So if we marginalize against this new thing lambda p, we get the same thing lambda p we get the same asymmetric distribution of delta u that we were looking at before but now we can see that left of this cytoquake line at 100k there's this kind of concentration of probability below the stiff soft threshold so there is enhanced displacement along the soft modes during these cytoquake events the final thing that i'll show is that um we were actually able to predict when cytoquakes could occur using the hash and eigen spectrum as an input Spectrum as an input. So we constructed a machine learning model that takes in the hash and eigen spectrum at a given time, and we trained it on the simulation data. And we're able to kind of recall, then we try to predict like the probability of a sidequake occurring within the next couple of steps. And this model achieves pretty good performance. We're also able to kind of vary the inputs. And these trends are not like super strong. So we're not claiming that this is a great way to understand what's going on, but Understand what's going on, but we at least thought it was interesting that you can use some instantaneous information about the network's mechanics to predict a little bit into the future whether or not there'll be this kind of rare event happening. Okay, so that brings me to the end of my talk. So just to quickly conclude, we developed a computational tool to quantify the energetics of these actomycin networks. Then we applied that tool to study this self-organization process. We found that steady states typically have this minimized dissipation. States typically have this minimized dissipation coming from both treadmilling and motor walking. The efficiency of this transduction process depends on the network connectivity by cross-linkers. And then we presented evidence showing that these anomalous energy fluctuations can be correlated with large motions of the network and some motion along the soft vibrational nodes. So I'd just like to acknowledge my co-workers in the Papoyan and Jarzinski labs, as well as Herbie Levine, who was a collaborator on the Saturquake work. Who was a collaborator on the Side of Quick work? And this work was supported by the NSF. And I'd just like to thank again the conference organizers. This has been a really great meeting. And yeah, so I'll stop there and I'd be happy to take any questions. Thank you. Thank you, Cal. Great. Any questions? I might have missed at the beginning of your cytochake portion of your talk. So, what is it different that you're simulating in median to get one of these large size events? Is there something special in the initial condition or how are you thinking of that? No, so we think it's really intrinsic. So, we didn't add anything new to the simulations. We actually tried to make it like as simple as possible. The simplest model that would still give us. The simplest model that would still give us the statistics. And other work by our colleagues at Rice have shown that if you add branching molecules to the system, then you can actually accentuate these heavy tails. So we think it's like an intrinsic thing that could be accelerated, but you don't really need anything special to bring this about. That's cool. Thank you. Any other questions from Zoom or in person? From Zoom or in person? I think we're okay. All right. Well, thank you again, Cal, and thank you, Tom, as well. Oh. Oh, just, yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. And thanks, everyone. I think this wraps it up. Yeah, thanks for everybody who stuck it out today. Everybody have a good weekend. Everybody have a very good weekend. Good travels for you all. And thank you to the organizers for a fantastic workshop.
