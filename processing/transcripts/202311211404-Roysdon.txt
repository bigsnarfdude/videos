So, what I'll talk about is comparison problems for Radon transforms, and it's based on the joint work with Alexander Khodovsky and Arkuzdovich. Okay, and just to start, I mean, we all know what a comic... Okay. So, the main feature of the talk is going to be start bodies, at least for the first portion. Now, start body is, you know. Body as you know something reasonably nice with the origin inside, and you can connect everything going through the origin by a straight line. You have continuity of the Minkowski functional. Often, we'll consider the reciprocal of the Minkowski functional, which is the radial function. I wrote rho of k, and it never appears again. So I'm sorry for this. I'll always write Minkowski functional k to minus 1. Okay? Okay? And then a star body is origin symmetric if, whenever you've reflected about the origin, it's symmetric. And it's a convex body if, in addition to being a star-shaped set, it's a convex set. Something that's useful for us is the polar formula for the measure of a star-shaped set. So mu of k can just be written in polar coordinates as the integral from zero to the radial function, r2m minus one, f of r theta, dr d theta. And in the case when you have volume, And in the case when you have volume, you get the honest Polar formula for the volume: that the volume of a convex body or volume of a starved body is 1 over n the integral over s n minus 1, our radial function of k to the n d theta. And so the main source of inspiration for the talk are this list of ten problems by Boozemann and Petty released in 1956, the first of which has been solved in its entirety, and the first Has been solved in its entirety. And the first problem stays the following. If you have a pair of origin symmetric convex bodies, can we see if I can if you can see this and if I can fit it, this is okay. You have a pair of origin symmetric convex bodies K and L. I don't know if I'll be able to draw in three dimensions, but I will at least try and fail, but it's okay. And you compare their sections. So if I look. You compare their sections. So if I look in the direction theta and I look at the volume here, and again I look in the direction theta, you know this volume, if for every direction the volume of one convex body, the section of one convex body is bigger than that of the other, is it necessarily true that you have an inequality about the volumes of K and L? Now, of course, if you fix a direction and you were to cut like this, and this were true for every And this were true for every parallel section, then the answer is yes. But this is something much harder. You're fixing a section and you're changing the direction. So it's a non-trivial question. So the solution to the Boosman-Petty problem took many, many years. Many authors contributed to this. But it was answered as full generality in the late 90s. And it's true that the Boosman-Petty problem is an affirmative answer in dimension four below. 4 below and is negative in 5 in above. So you can find counterexamples starting from dimension 5. Okay, the full solution to the Busim and Petty problem is fairly analytic in nature. So you translate this question to a question about harmonic analysis, and you use techniques from harmonic analysis to solve it. But another key feature that you meet is this connection of Wundock from 1988. He introduced a very special question. 1988, he introduced a very special class of bodies called intersection bodies. And with these, you can have an affirmative answer to the Bosom-Mempedi problem. And it turns out that this gives you everything. In addition to some further analytic techniques from several authors later. So just a little bit of background. To any integrable function f, its Radon transform is the integral over the affine hyperplane phi of x dx. Of x dx. I assume integrability over hyperplanes, but you don't need it. The Radon transform is bounded on L1 almost everywhere for any integer function. What is useful for us is also the Fourier transform. So I write fancy f, I don't repeat it, but this is phi hat, which is just the integral over phi e to the i is the overproduct x of xc dx. Okay, so we pick this normalization, and it's good, but it makes this connection between the Radon transform and the Fourier transform pretty clear. Fourier transform is pretty clear. It says that the one-dimensional Fourier transform of the Leydon transform of an integrable function is exactly the full-dimensional Fourier transform at this point z, theta. And this is something which is essential, actually. This is, I mean, it has a name. This is the Fourier slice theorem. The class of functions that we will work with are the Schwartz class of super smooth complex values. Smooth, complex value of rapidly decreasing test functions. And the Fourier transform is actually invertible as an operator on this. So you have the inverse Fourier transform. And we also consider the space of tempered distributions, which act on Schwarz test functions by integration. And then the Fourier transform of a distribution is defined by duality. So the Fourier transform of a distribution acting on a test function is just the distribution f. Is just the distribution f acting on the Fourier transform of the test function q. A test function, if it's even, and you take Fourier transform, or invert Fourier transform, then it's just 2 pi to the n times phi itself, and then you have this Parsifull identity where if you take the Fourier transform of both f and phi, it's 2 pi to the n, and then the action of f on phi. And then we say that a distribution f is even homogeneous. Distribution f is even homogeneous of some degree p and r, if whenever you apply f to the test function phi of x over a for non-zero a, this scales out. It's the absolute value of a to power n plus p, the action of f on t. And then there is this nice limit that says that the Fourier transform of any homogeneous function of degree p is itself an even homogeneous distribution of degree minus n minus p. Okay? And then finally, we say And then finally, we say that a distribution or function is positive definite if the Fourier transform acting on non-negative test functions is non-negative. Okay? And then, let's see. We also consider, so a non-negative measure is called a tempered measure if you can find an absolute constant beta so that the integral over r of the 1 plus Euclidean 1 of x to the power of minus beta over d nu is finite. And then there's a beautiful thing. And then there's a beautiful theorem by Schwartz. It's a generalization of Bagner's theorem, which says that a positive definite distribution on Rn must be the Fourier transform of the tempered measure on Rn. And then there's a very nice lemma that actually says that if you have a tempered measure on Rn, which is at the same time an even homogeneous distribution of greater minus minus P, or some P between 0 and N, then you can in fact find a measure on the sphere, an even Borrell measure on the sphere, and extend it. Even Borel measure on the sphere and extend it. It's a homogeneous distribution and get this polar coordinate formula. So this is nice. Now, let's look at the Radon transform of a very specific function, the characteristic function of a convex body, right? The outer parallel section function a k theta t is just volume of this section here, right? This is height t, this is volume k intercepted. Volume k intercepted theta plus t theta. But it's honest. This is just right-on transform of the characteristic function of k at the point t theta. Because of convexity, so if you assume that the object that you're dealing with is convex, this is true for any set. It's okay. You have this Brumankovsky inequality, right? And Brumenkovsky inequality tells you that this is concave only to you. And what does And what does this give you? Exactly that the maximal section over all T is the one for the origin with the body symmetric. This is because of concavity from Bruminkovsky. Very good. And then finally, you can do the same trick with the polar coordinates if you take the polar formula in the section. It's just 1 over n minus 1 integral over the part of the sphere belonging to theta per and cost the function of k to the power minus n plus 1 inde Function of k to the power minus n plus 1 in du. But ah, this is something beautiful. This is the spherical Radon transform of the function k to Minkowski function of k to minus n plus 1. And here is the trick to connect it to harmonic analysis. So what the spherical Radon transform is just when you operate it from space of continuous functions on the sphere, and it's a self-development. Okay. And then with this Woodwock definition. With this, Ludwig defined the intersection body of a star body to be that star-shaped set whose radial function in every direction is the volume of the central section. So if I have an ellipsoid and I take this direction, and I take this volume, whatever it is, I make that the radius in the given direction. If I look like this and say this is the direction, I do the same thing here. I do the same thing here. I do this over all directions and I generate a star body. If the body is convex and origin-symmetric, then its intersection body is also an origin-symmetric convex body. But okay, even though you have volume of the central section, we actually know that it's this multiple of the spherical Radon transform of this continuous function on the sphere. Okay? And so, in this way, you can rephrase the original Boosum and Petty problem, right? The Boosum and Petty problem is that. The Bozeman-Petty problem is a question about inequality of spherical Redon transforms and a comparison of their L and norms. So it says if you have over dimensional information, can you expect higher dimensional information? In 1988, Wuvak showed that if the smaller body K is the intersection body of some other star body L, the answer is yes in all dimensions. And in fact, And in fact, he also showed that if you perturb the higher body else slightly, so if it's a non-convex, if it's a non-intersection body, if you perturb it slightly, you can construct a counterexample. So the Boosum and Petty problem is affirmative in all dimensions if and only if the convex body K is an intersection body. But in fact, you can do something more general. You can introduce what they call intersection bodies, not of a star body, but intersection bodies. And this is This should be an integral over Sn minus 1. I'm sorry. So, an origin symmetric star body is an intersection body if you can find a finite bore measure mu on the sphere so that the integral over s n minus 1 of the radial function k times any continuous function of the sphere is exactly the same as the spherical Radon transform of f, integrated, I guess, the measure mu for all continuous functions in the sphere. So they're equal as functionals. Okay? When you made the specific choice, mu. When you made the specific choice, μ is this function, then you get intersection bodies of star bodies back. So this includes the class of intersection bodies of star bodies. And we denote this class by fancy I of n. We'll come back to it at the end of the talk. And then this beautiful theorem of Koldovsky says that an origin-symmetric star body in Rm is an intersection body if and only if its radial function is a positive definite distribution on Rm. So it's a Fourier transform of the temperate measure on Rm. Form of the temperate measure or not. This, with Woodlock's connection and some expressions for the derivatives of the outer parallel section function, finally concluded the proof of the Boosman-Pettit theorem. And so this gives another way to find intersection bodies. You can look for those functions. You look for functions which are representable as Fourier transpones of measures, and you can do some experiments. For example, all For example, all mergent symmetric convex bodies in our intersection bodies. However, starting from dimension five, counterexamples can be constructed to the Boosum-Mempetti problems. Actually, as it turns out, Ardhem studied the Boosum-Menpetti problem where you replace a volume by an arbitrary measure. He said that if you have this inequality about the measures of sections, The measures of sections? Can you expect measure of case more than measure of L? Say, if you have an inequality about Gaussian sections, can you say something about the full Gaussian measure? And it turns out that the answer is exactly the same. So the answer to the Bosom and Paddington problem for arbitrary measures is yes in dimensions 1 through 4, negative in dimensions 5 and above. But, okay. So the Bosom and Petty problem is wrong in most dimensions. So, the bosom and petty problem is wrong in most dimensions, unfortunately. So, it actually maybe you pay by some constant independent of the dimension. And this is actually what Neilman and Peugeot, that they said, can you find an absolute constant such that the Brussels and Petty problem is true for any pair of origin symmetric convex bodies, and the constant shouldn't depend on the dimension, shouldn't depend on the bodies involved. All right? So it says: if you have an inequality about the spherical Radon transforms, can you expect that the volume of P is smaller than C L? Smaller than C L. And we know the answer for C is 1, yet the convex body K is an intersection body. But what about other classes of convex bodies? What might you expect here? And this is something which many people have worked on and it's still open today. Okay. So with these things, we actually decided to ask the question: what if you replace convex bodies and Minkowski functionals with arbitrary even functions in the sphere? Are even functions in the sphere. So if you take a pair of even functions, let's say f and g are just reasonable even functions on the sphere, non-negative, of course. And you know that the spherical Radon transform of F is smaller than the spherical Radon transform of G. Maybe this implies something about the LP norm of F. So instead Okay, of course it didn't close the bosom emphatic problem, right? For specific choices of functions f and g and specific choice of p. So in general, it's not correct, but it's still something interesting to consider, right? It's something which builds both on the original problem and on Ardham's generalization. You can reformulate Ardham's problem as the spherical Radon transform of certain functions on the sphere, certain continuous functions on the sphere. Sorry, continuous functions on the sphere. And so this is what we did. We said, if you have some p bigger than 1, you have a pair of even continuous functions on the sphere, can you, such that the Radon transform of F is smaller than the Radon transform of G, is the L P norm of F smaller than the L P norm of G? When does this happen, in fact? Okay, so we actually had the following generalization of Ulbrock's connection, which is intimately related to Kodrovsky's characterization of intersection bars. The Kodovsky's characterization of intersection bodies. So if you take a pair of non-negative, let's say strictly positive, even continuous functions of the sphere, you take p bigger than 1, and you take f to p minus 1, and you extend it as a homogeneous distribution on Rn of degree minus 1, and you assume that the spherical radon transform of f is smaller than the spherical radon transform of g, then in fact, the L P norm of f is smaller than the L P norm of G over S n minus 1. over s n minus 1. And when you make a specific choice of f, f is the Minkowski function of k to minus n plus 1, g is the Minkowski function of l to minus n plus 1, this tells you that the radial function of f, extended, radial function of k2 extended homogeneously degree minus 1 must be a positive definite distribution of Rn. So it includes the business methodic problem, right? And actually we can even give a counterexample We can even give a counterexample in general where if you have an infinitely smooth function, which is strictly positive on the sphere, you have p bigger than 1, and this does not represent a positive definite distribution, then you can find a function f even on the sphere, so that you have an inequality for the Raydon transforms, but the inequality for the LP norm slips. So, this is what we ended up doing. And then, okay, why just restrict yourself to the sphere? Why not take functions on Rn in general? You ask the following question. General, you ask the following question instead. I don't want to erase this, but instead of spherical radon transforms, you ask: okay, what if you have a pair of even continuous functions on Rn? The and C, even non-negative continuous, non-negative continuous. And you know that the spherical Radon transform of F is smaller equals than the spherical. The smaller equals and the spherical Radon transform of G for all T theta. Well, automatically, once you have it in one direction by Kevilieri's principle, you know that the L1 norm of F is smaller than the L1 norm of G. This is for free, right? What about L two? What about L one half, right? L one half, right? So it becomes a question. Well, what about p not equal to one? This is a question. Is such a simple solution true in this case? But if p is equal to three halves, can you expect the inequality? No, actually you can't. And it fails horribly for even very simple functions. So we call this a comparison problem for the Radon transform, where if you have a pair of even continuous integrable functions, so I said the radon transformation. Functions. So I said the radon transform of one is always smaller than the radon transform of another. Is the L p norm of one smaller of the other if it's p greater than one? The answer is no. And one example is you can just take characteristic functions of Euclidean balls and scale them appropriately and actually maintain this inequality about the Raymond transforms, but the inequality about the L P norms flips. And we have this for every p bigger than n over n minus 1. So for n big enough, I can get p close enough to 1. P closeness up to 1. There's something interesting about this n over n minus 1. It is exactly the value of L P, where the radon transform becomes unbounded as an operator on L P. But there's something interesting happening here. I don't know what happens for p smaller than n over n minus 1 actually, in the general case. But this is exactly where the Radon transform becomes unbounded on L P functions. Okay, so it's interesting to think. Okay, so it's interesting to think about. However, okay, it's not true in general, but can we construct a family of functions for which this problem has a meaningful answer? And we do. So what we do is we replicate Ludwig's ideas and try to find a class of functions which emulates intersection values. And this is what we do. So we consider the class of functions g defined on the cylinder, r plus 1 minus 1, 9, negative, even continuous, and integral. And then we say, And then we say that a function f defined on n is an intersection function of g if the action of f on any test function is the same as g acting on the spherical on the Radon transform of f. This exactly means that f is the dual Radon transform of g. So this is one example. If you pick this function f, you use Fubini's theorem, you'll show that this is satisfied for every test function. But as it turns out, if you do a little bit But as it turns out, if you do a little bit more work, if you take a function, and that's an intersection function of some other function g, if and only if it is of this form. It is first you take g, t, and you take the unit vector in the direction of x, you take the Fourier transform by t. You then evaluate this at the length of x, you multiply it by the length of x to the minus n plus 1. And you take the full-dimensional Fourier transform and multiply it by 1 over pi. Okay, so you have two Fourier transforms involved, one in one dimension, one in full dimension. And this tells you, because of even. And this tells you, because of evenness and meaning to stir for the Fourier transform, that the intersection function of the function is in fact unique. So the only example is the Double-Radon transfer of a function. And actually, as a result of this, you get the following thing. An even continuous function half is an intersection function of sub g, if and only if in every direction, this one-dimensional function, this is actually the derivative of the Radon transform, the minus first derivative of the Radon transform, is a positive definite function. Is a positive definite function of R for every direction. So for every direction, this function of R must be positive definite. Okay? And I mean, okay, this is good, but we want a bit more. We want to be able to deal with measures, like Woodvach, Goody, and Weil did. So what do we do? We actually take this as a definition, in fact, to get a more general class. So let's first look at some examples. If you take n cube between 0 and 2, you take a strictly positive even. 2, you take a strictly positive even function on the sphere. Then, this function h, you Fourier transform that looks something like this. These Fourier transforms for q between 0 and 1, 0 2 are known to be positive, right? On our end. So this function f is actually the intersection function of this function g on R cross S n minus 1 for any Q between 0 and 2. And you can start finding non-examples the moment you look bigger than 2, because the Fourier transform of this is not necessarily. The Fourier transform of this is not necessarily positive. MQ is so these are examples of intersection functions, not examples. You're free to scale. You can have Gaussian kernels, for example. So this is nice. And then, okay, we want limits. We want to be able to have, take limits, take convolutions, take products. So what you can do is you can say an even continuous function on Rn without a dependence on G is an intersection function if for every direction this function. For every direction, this function is positive definite on the line. And once you have this condition, you have convolutions with intersection functions, there are intersection functions, products and limits. And what does this tell you? That if you take a Gaussian kernel and you take the Minkowski functional of k on to minus n plus 1 on the sphere, and you take limits, that in fact the class of intersection functions contains the class of star bodies. Of star bodies, of intersection bodies of star bodies. Okay, so this extends in a very natural way with box intersection bodies. Okay? Okay, so this is beautiful. And actually, this is an analytic characterization, but it's nice to have a geometric one. And we actually were able to show that, in fact, there is a geometric characterization. You have a function, is an intersection function, if, in every direction, you have a positive Borer measure, finite. Positive Borel measure finite. So that's first, this is integrable. And second, you have this whole coordinates. The action of f on the test function is the same as first the action of this measure on the Raybonne transform of one dimension and then integral over S m minus one. And it's this which allows you to study the comparison problem. Okay, so maybe we get the following actually. We get the following actually: that if you have p bigger than zero, this should be p bigger than one, actually, p bigger than one, and you take a pair of even continuous functions, which are in Lp, and each of which is integrable over a hyperplane, so that this Radon transform of f is smaller than the Radon transform of C in all directions. And if phi to the P minus 1 is an intersection function, then the L P norm of F is smaller than the L P norm of C. L P norm of phi is smaller than the L P norm of C. It's not too bad. I mean, we take this inequality. We assume that when I take the smaller function raise it to p minus 1, it's an intersection function. It's according to the characterization for every direction. I can find a non-negative Borel measure u sub theta so that this function and this function are integral in the sphere. And then you have something like this. You integrate this over Rm with respect to this measure, and you have this inequality. So v of theta is smaller than. So phi of theta is more than c of theta for all theta. And then you integrate it over s minus 1. So you have the integral over s minus 1 of phi to p minus 1 times p, which is phi to the p, and then you go back, and you have this. So it's the L P norm of phi. It's smaller than the integral over Rn, phi to p minus 1 times c. Then you use Holder's inequality. Holders inequality. And then you have the inequality about the OP norms. So this is beautiful. And then actually, if you don't have this positive definite condition, the intersection function condition, you can construct a counterexample. So the comparison problem is true if and only if the smaller function is an intersection function. Okay. I don't want to go through the proof of the counter example. Proof of the counterexample. This is the rotation invariant case. I want to talk about Brigain slicing problem. So we mentioned the Boosum emphatic problem and the isomorphic version, right? The isomorphic version of the Boosum-emphetic problem is in fact equivalent to the famous slicing problem of Briggs. The slicing problem of Briggs says that you should be able to bound the maximal volume of any origin symmetric complex body by some absolute constant. This is still open. The best-to-date estimate is this constant C is bigger than big O. Is this constancy is bigger than big O with the square root of the logarithm of the dimension with a cartoon? And okay, starting in 2015, Alexander Koldovsky actually began to say, okay, why take volume, take measures instead? Can you study the same problem in a meaningful way if you replace volume by an arbitrary even measure? And actually, he proved that if you take an origin-symmetric star body in any non-negative even continuous function, then the integral over the Then the integral over the star body f is bounded from above by 2 times this outer volume ratio distance from the class of intersection bodies from k to the class of intersection bodies, volume of k, and then the maximum of the radon transform of that sphere of the radon transform of that form of the sphere. This encodes the best constant that you can expect for such an inequality. Why? Because if k is an intersection body, this distance is 1. Right? For example. Right? For example. But okay, what's nice about intersection bodies is that in the convex case, ellipsoids are here. The ellipsoids belong here. And so John's theorem says that you can bound this outer volume ratio distance by the square root of the dimension. So actually, if in fact k is an origin-symmetric convex body, John's theorem exactly tells you that the outer volume ratio distance is bounded by the square root of the dimension. So this inequality becomes, say, comes, say integral over k of f is smaller than 2 square root of n. Some constant times the square root of the dimension. Volume of k to 1 over n times the maximum of the ceregorium transform. And then in 2018, Kodowski and Kartog found a counterexample to this. And then Billy and Alev Schitz and Kartog improved it and showed that in fact this is optimal. Square root of the dimension is optimal in the slicing of equality. Okay. So they're somehow disconnected. I mean, they are connected, but you need to make some additional assumptions to expect better than square root of the dimension in general. Okay, so actually, the Boosum-Mpetic problem that we studied in the spherical case gives a slicing inequality of a new kind. If you pick the bigger function g to be this constant function, so 1 over the spherical Radon transform of 1, times the maximum of the spherical Radon transform. And then f and g will satisfy the conditions of the comparative. The conditions of the comparison problem. So, in fact, if f is a positive continuous function on the sphere, p is bigger than 1, and you extend this homogeneously degree minus 1, and it's positive definite, then the LP norm of f is bound from above by this constant multiple, the maximum of the spherical Radon transform of the function. And when you pick, you make this choice, f to minus 1 over p, p is n over n minus 1, it's Briggs slicing the inequality for intersection bodies. Bodies. Okay. That's it. Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much for your big time.
