All right. So this is GLN, certainly. So G is for until further notice, G will be G L N. And there are, I want to say that there are really two kinds of L functions. Two kinds of L functions for G. We have spectral, we could call them automorphic, we could think of them as spectral L functions because they have to do with the dual group and representation theory. And I guess I'm really thinking of standard automorphic L functions. And as has been mentioned in a couple of talks so far, they were done for GL constructed, well, they have an earlier history, but in present. Earlier history, but in present-day language, they were done for GL1 by Tate in his thesis in 1950. And for GLN, they were constructed with analytic continuation and functional equation for general linear groups by Gaudeman-Jacquet in 1972. So there's, we could call them orbital L-functions where R is an Where R is an, I might say a little bit more about the construction later, but R is an order in a field. If we're in the general linear group rank n plus one, it's an order in the field E over Q of degree n plus one. These things actually are essentially the zeta functions defined by Zhiwei Yun in. By Zhiwei Yun in 2013. And they're very striking. They generalize Diraclay L-functions and they have a role on the geometric side of the trace formula that's every bit as striking, I would say, as automorphic L-functions implicitly have on the spectral side. The problem The problem is, for our purposes, is unlike automorphic L functions, standard automorphic L functions, LS pi, the local factors of these, so I'm calling a G-way L function, an L function, an orbital L function to simply be the quotient of G-way, the zeta function. Of G-Ways, the zeta function, by the Riemann zeta function. So it's just a little bit smaller. It's like the, for GL2, it's like the Diracle character as opposed to a zeta function of a quadratic extension. But the problem is, unlike these, there's a very explicit way to construct the local factors of an automorphic L-f function. The local factors of G-way L-functions are not. Way L-functions are not explicit, except for GL2, where they actually were introduced quite a long time ago by Zaguier, 1976. They're not explicit. What you would like for these local factors is to be able to have a Diraclay series for them to go into the corresponding Euler product. And you'd like. Euler product, and you'd like to know the coefficients of that Diraclay series. Well, they're very closely related, actually, to piadic orbital integrals. And I'm thinking of p-adic orbital integrals, not general p-adic orbital integrals in which the test function fp is an arbitrary smooth function of compact support, but what we can Support, but what we could maybe think of as the unramified ones, these have come up a number of times in the talk and earlier talks, and these were the real troublemakers. If you'll excuse me for saying so, Chao, but these were the real troublemakers in the theory of endoscopy. They were the ones that were the subject of the famous fundamental lemma that Chao proved in around 2008. 2008. They're the orbital integrals defined by this familiar formula, but where Fp is the characteristic function of the standard maximal compact subgroup, let's say of GLN. Now these things are defined. There's a nice way to state how these Of state how these things are calculated in terms of buildings, but it's just really a translation of the definition here. And it's very hard to calculate them or has been very hard to calculate them as the number of fixed points of this element gamma acting on the vertices of the BrouHa. Vertices of the Bruhatitz building. And I should say that the Jun zeta function is modeled very much like that. It's an extension of the orbital integrals. And instead of calculating vertices on the building, you're calculating, roughly speaking, modules over a given subring, R, of the integers. integers. This would be sitting inside an extension E of degree n plus one over q. So in other words, they would be as difficult to calculate explicitly, more so I guess, as the orbital integrals on the unit functions. But we need these things. I mean these are these are fundamental Fundamental ingredients of the trace formula. So Fp is this characteristic function. Our goal is to describe explicit formulas for these orbital integrals for GL3 and also for the local invariant related local factors of the orbital L function. And our conclusion, or my conclusion, I guess it is, I don't know if you will agree with me, but my conclusion is that the orbital integrals of these unit functions have an unexpected, unexpectedly hidden structure, certainly for the group G equals G L three. Their definition, as I say, is in terms of, say, fixed points of gamma on the building, but they have a simpler structure that's hiding in that and for GL3. And it seems to me also that will be the case for GLN plus one and possibly even for. And possibly even for any quasi-split group G. That these orbital integrals, and at least for G Ln, Jun actually constructed these L functions only for general linear groups, but orbital integrals and the orbital L functions seem to have a remarkably striking hidden structure. A hidden structure. So, this is about the trace formula. This is where these things, this is why you need these things. They occur on the geometric side of the trace formula. So let me just review in very simple terms the trace formula. And it's an approximation of the trace formula. Of the trace formula. I think the trace formula is quite complex. There's geometric terms. So, right here, we've got a geometric expansion equal to spectral expansion. Some of the terms on the geometric side are simple to write down, if not to work with, namely the orbital integrals. But there are more supplementary terms. But there are more supplementary terms that are much more complicated. And the same thing on the spectral side. There's some terms that are simple, it's just the discrete spectrum, the irreducible representations, cuspital, let's say, for GLN that occur discretely. And here we have the elliptic orbital integrals. So what I'm going to, the approximation I'm going to take is Going to take is the more complex supplementary geometric terms and the more complex spectral terms, I will just ignore. They are certainly going to be a part of the story for beyond endoscopy, but I think I would say their role is not as critical at this stage as these more as these primary terms. And so the approximation I'm going to take for the trace formula is just to Is just to say, pretend that this, well, so the primary terms are the orbital integrals. So that's the sum over elliptic elements, regular elliptic elements in G of the volume, a volume term times an orbital integral. So the volume term is the volume of the centralizer of gamma in the Adel's modulo, the centralizer. modulo the centralizer of gamma in q for a discrete subgroup for a subgroup of the center in order to make this volume finite these are the elliptic regular orbital integrals uh excuse me these are as i already said these are the elliptic regular conjugacy classes in g2 these are the elliptic um part Take corresponding orbital integrals, the integral O of G A modulo G A gamma of this. And so as I say, I won't talk about the supplementary geometric terms. They're very interesting, but not a part of the story at this early stage, I would say. And on the spectral side, we have the familiar discrete spectrum, cuspital discrete. Discrete spectrum, cuspital discrete spectra. So it's the sum over cuspital automorphic representations of GLN. Let's say which are invariant under this discrete, I haven't said suitable discrete subgroup. Oh, yes, I did define it. This is a discrete subgroup of the center of GLN. It's basically the diagonal scalar wheel. The diagonal scalar real matrices. And you would have to divide out by that if you wanted GA modulo GQ to have finite volume. So we'll do that. And then we would take a test function f in GA modulo, on GLA modulo, this group. And then we've got on the spectral side, we've got the multiplicity of pi, the trace of pi of f. Trace of pi of f, summed over irreducible cuspidal automorphic representations. Actually, for GLN, this multiplicity is always one, but let me put it in because, you know, principle we should be thinking about general roots. And these are irreducible characters, these guys here. So let me write, we'll write the eye elliptic regular. Right, the I elliptic regular F is somehow using a little equivalence symbol, is equivalent to I cuspital F. So these are supposed to be, well, this is it, that we'll just pretend. You're not supposed to pretend the mathematics, but we will pretend that this is an identity because the problems that we face at this stage of the game are severe for these things, anyway. So they have to be, I think. So, they have to be, I think, solved first for this part of the geometric side. And so, this would be for motivation for what we're looking for. Clifton, can you say something? Just say hello. Hello. Okay, good. I can hear you. Thank you. Thank you. It seemed very quiet. So. So, this is about beyond endoscopy. It's our topic of this conference. It's partly you could think of it as a dream of Langlands and partly it's a strategy. And it is to establish the principle of functoriality by combining the trace formula with general automorphic L functions, L of S pi. functions L of S pi R. So these are not just the standard L functions, those are the ones where R would be the standard n plus one dimensional representation of G L N, but in general you would have a representation of G L N C, the dual group of G L N, of arbitrary dimension. And it's that this supplementary piece of information that goes into the definition general goes into the definition, general definition of automorphic L functions. And Langland's idea was, a strategy was to do something that nobody had ever suggested before, to combine the trace formula, which has been very successful in other situations, in particular endoscopy. But for this beyond endoscopy, it's the big gap. In fact, the sort of Sort of the most fundamental unknown question in many of these things is Langland's principle of functoriality. And nobody had a strategy for using the trace formula to attack that. There's other methods and possible methods which Chow talked about and others have talked about, and a third method that Yannis will talk about. Yanis will talk about, and I think that they all have to be. Things are sufficiently uncertain that I think we have to pursue any method. These three methods all have striking properties, and I think we have to pursue them all until we have a clearer sense of where we're going. But this Langland suggested the trace formula, and it was to combine Combine automorphic representations with the trace formula with automorphic L functions. And his basic idea is this, to go onto the spectral side, and instead of taking the sum over pi of just the multiplicities, which are all one actually in this case for GLN, to weight this sum by something else, namely m lower pi. m lower pi of r, the order of this L function at s equals one. It's a positive integer. And it's going to complicate matters considerably. You're not going to have just the sum of multiplicities, just the sum basically of one times the trace pi of f, but you're going to have this multiplicity. Multiplicity, excuse me, this order at pi, which is going to vary. And what it does actually is this L function is going to have more poles at L s equals one if it has irreducible constituents that are the identity. And for anything that And for anything that's not somehow as large as possible in GLN, that is to say, if it's something that's the functorial image, according to this principle, of a representation from a smaller group, you'll be able to concoct out of that L-functions that have a pole more often than what you would have for representations that have. Representations that have pi that are not functorial images from some smaller group. And so this would be very promising. This contains subtle information about pi as a functorial image. So the fundamental question that Langwins posed, or at least it was implicit in what he posed, is is there a geometric expansion, i.e. not I geometric not but with a superscript R, just like we have a superscript R for this one, such that this equals this. We could call that the R trace formula if it exists. And it's by no means clear exactly what form it might take. Langlands had a very nice way of describing it as by a Tauberian theorem. Talbarian theorem as a limit as a certain quantity as s goes to one of something built from the traditional geometric side of the trace formula. And I won't say too much about that because I've got a number of things I want to talk about, but it's a very subtle question and somehow is the heart of this particular approach to functoriality. Particular approach to factoriality. All right, early progress. Well, a seemingly simple change of things, but one which is really quite far-reaching, was in the paper of Franklin Langlands and Goh. And it was to simply replace the matrix gamma. This is a matrix gamma, this is an elliptic regular conjugacy class, by its characteristic polynomial P gamma of lambda. So or P A of lambda, where A is the set of coefficients of that characteristic polynomial, or in slightly more sophisticated terms, is a point in the base of the Steinberg. The base of the Steinberg-Hitchen vibration, but for all of this, it's really just a point in Qn times Q star. So in other words, elements gamma, elliptic regular elements that index the geometric side of the trace formula, are bijective with numbers A and Qn cross QC. And Qn cross Q star. Well, if I'm dealing with elliptic terms, these would be numbers such that the characteristic polynomial is irreducible over Q. That'd be most of them, but that's what we would then take to be the image of these gammas. And then in an early paper of Langlands, just called Beyond Endoscopy. Just called Beyond Endoscopy. And in the first of three papers written by his student, Ali al-Tu, there was a simplification made. And I'm going to make this simplification. The problems that we face are there in this simplest of cases, and it's a good idea to work with these cases until we better understand the problems with the hope. Better understand the problems with the hopes that extending the case that you would be working with to that it wouldn't be as hard once you've solved the problems here. And the simplification is a natural thing. You take F infinity to be an arbitrary test function on GR, but you take F upper infinity, the complement on the piadic places, to simply be the unit function, like I wrote down before for at a given p-iadic place, the unit function at every p-adic place. The unit function at every piadic place. And then consider only those gamma such that this piadic orbital integral is non-zero. And if you do that, you're talking about a smaller subset of indices A. It would be indices pairs B epsilon, where B now is just. B epsilon, where B now is just in Zn, and epsilon is plus or minus one. But terms, numbers like this for which the corresponding polynomial is then irreducible. So they correspond to these things, the terms in the trace formula with this simplification, with this particular function, then correspond to irreducible, monic. Irreducible monic polynomials with integral coefficients whose constant term is plus or minus one. And I would argue, well, I think it's doesn't you don't have to argue too much about it, simple as it may seem, it's a fundamental change of outlook. Just in general terms, philosophically, what it means is that the two sides of the trace formula Sides of the trace formula are indexed by objects that sort of represent possible ways to classify Galois extensions of K over Q. And this is, in this sense, it's like what happens for abelian class field theory. On the left, on the geometric side, we're talking about the indices are these characteristic polynomials. Characteristic polynomials. And so you're talking about that the indices on the geometric side represent splitting fields of irreducible polynomials. And we can think of that as kind of a geometric way to classify extensions of degree n plus one. And on the spectral side, well, what we're talking about is irreducible representations of their Galois groups. That, of course, it would be to say that that's what. Would be to say that that's what is going to be on the spectral side is going to is assuming Langman's functoriality. As a matter of fact, in this case, because the class number of Q is one, there aren't going to be any of these things. So I'm talking about what we would have if we chose an arbitrary function at the p-adic place. And even then, a lot of the cospital automorphic representations on the spectral side. On the spectral side, don't have anything to either correspond to mass forms or Galois representations over the p-adics. But I'm thinking of this as just irreducible representations of these finite Galois groups. But I think one can argue that, well, I won't try to make the argument, but somehow this. Somehow, this can really be put together in a way that really is kind of parallel to this. And so philosophically, it's a very, it's a reassuring way to think of this change. And now suppose I have an A with this property, then we've got the geometric. Got the geometric side of the trace formula is then going to be a sum over gamma of p-adic orbit, the product of p-adic orbital integrals at the unit function at HP times an orbital integral of this Archimedean function. So the first steps to try to understand this is To try to understand this is to do what Harish Chandra always did. Instead of taking orbital integrals of a function on the reals, you multiply it by the square root of the absolute value of the vial discriminant. That way, it's still not quite smooth, but it's bounded and it's very close to being smooth. And that's the That's the same thing. This is the usual vial discriminant. That's the same thing as the discriminant of this extension field E, absolute value to the one half, times a product over all P of nine powers. And the volume of gamma, that occurs. That's that occurs here. That is, well, there's a way in number theory to rewrite that. This represents the regulator of this so-called regulator of this extension field E over Q. And the class number formula for this extension has a way to rewrite this as the discriminant. Discriminant of the field extension to the one-half times the value of an L function at s equals one, namely the quotient of the zeta function at E of E divided by the Riemann zeta function. This is the sort of pretty much class number formula for E over Q. And so that would be DE, the discriminant to the one half, times the quotient. times the quotient zeta e by zeta q at one. It's the value of that L function at one and so if we put those things in we get that the geometric side of the trace formula is then going to be a sum over epsilon, a sum over certain elements b in z n and then I'm going to put this together with this the value The value of a zeta function with the product of these p-adic orbital integrals. And I'm going to put those together and think of those as the global coefficients of what we're considering. So it's a little bit of a change where we just had the volumes as the global coefficients before, but it's appropriate actually to put in these p-adic orbital integrals as well and consider the problem. As well, and consider the product of these as the coefficients. And then the local objects in this linear combination are then just the orbital integrals of the test function on I wrote Rn, I mean on GR, the orbital integrals of this Archimedean test function. And where sigma prime, again, means the sum only over only those b such that the characteristic polynomial. Characteristic polynomial is irreducible. Okay, so goodness. On Poisson summation, question. Can I modify this so that I so that this is the question that was posed in that same paper? Can you modify? Was posed in that same paper. Can you modify this formula? This formula here? We've got a sum over elements b in z n, and so and then there's there's a test function there. So this looks a little bit like what Chow was talking about, Poisson summation. And it's in a slightly different context, but it's no doubt related. And the question they posed: can you modify this in order that you can so as to apply the Poisson summation formula? Apply the croissant summation formula to the lattice Zn, B in Zn inside U in Rn. The answer in this context was an emphatic yes with lots of subsidiary things that made it very useful. He uses remarkable techniques using Using explicit, the explicit orbital L functions for GL2 that I mentioned that were introduced by Zagier. Well, I mean, at first glance, this looks pretty rough. There's a lot of, first of all, Poisson summation isn't supposed to apply to a linear combination of Schwartz. Combination of Schwartz functions over a lattice. It's supposed to just be the sum of values of a test function over points in the lattice. We've got these coefficients here. What are we going to do with those? A less severe problem is this isn't quite smooth. So, in any case, the obstructions for tupoissan summation, which were solved by L2 for GL2, that they're open. For GL2, but they're open in general. The function theta e isn't quite smooth, doesn't extend to a smooth function of u across the singular hyperplanes. L2's solution was simply to multiply it by a small power of the vial discriminant. And that looks a bit harsh, but it makes them smooth, and actually, they decrease rapidly. Rapidly along the singular hyperplanes, and it becomes a smooth function. More severe are these coefficients. I can write them as c epsilon b, the value of the zeta function at e with these p-adic orbital integrals. Well, this zeta function of an extension e E has functional equation. And what you could do is use what's known as the approximate functional equation for the Diracle L function, for this Diracle L function, to express its value at s equals one, which is what we're doing, as the restriction to this set of b's. This set of b's of a smooth function that's actually defined on all of Rn. So it does exactly what we want. It turns this into a smooth function of u, which we could tack on with the Archimedean function, this thing here. This function here, you could tack on another smooth function and get rid of this. I still have these p-adic orbital integrals, and they are trouble. But there is a remarkable fact that this coefficient that we're trying to get rid of and replace by a smooth function on the underlying real vector space. The underlying real vector space. And actually, Dudekin zeta function, but of a bigger zeta function or L function of the orbital L function L of S R, which is defined as a zeta function, the so-called Jun Zeta function attached to the order R within the field E divided by Field E divided by the Riemann Zeta function. Since this Jun-Zeta function is known, he proved that it has, in addition to introducing it, he showed that it had analytic continuation and functional equation. And it therefore also will have an approximate functional equation and do exactly the same thing. It'll take the value at one. The value at one that gives us all this trouble, this thing, this whole thing here, namely this thing, and replace it by a smooth function of A. So, this is what AL2 did, but you need, in order to use this, you need to have an explicit formula for the An explicit formula for the local factors of these things, as say Diracle series. Altu used, as I say, he used the function that was introduced by Zagier, which was explicit. He did further analysis, but in the end, he obtained Poisson summation formula over B. He then showed actually that the Fourier transform term in this Poisson summation formula. This Poisson summation formula that the elliptic side of the trace formula has become, the Fourier transform term with the Fourier transform variable c equals zero actually gives the contribution of the non-tempered one-dimensional representation of GA to the elliptic part of the trace formula. You need to do that. The elliptic part of the trace formula is not a tempered distribution in F. It's all of the terms are tempered. It's all of the terms are tampered, but because there's some bunching, accumulation of terms, when you take their sum, it turns into something that is not a tempered distribution. It's a distribution, of course, but it's not tempered. And if you don't have a tempered distribution, you're not going to be able to count, to even formulate the question about what I mentioned earlier to getting a geometric expansion of the refined spectral. The refined spectral side introduced by Langlands. And what you have to do is take away the non-tempered representations, in this case, the one-dimensional representation, to get something that's tempered. So you use Poisson summation formula. You then take the term c equals zero and you throw it away, and the resulting thing is going to be tempered. What you throw away basically is the one-dimensional representation, and you don't want that in it anyway. And you don't want that in it anyway. I should say that the original answer to this that in Frankl Langlands and Go, they also did Poisson summation. They showed it could work for any G, actually. And they also showed that the proof of the term with C equals zero and Zn gives the contribution of the one-dimensional representation to the ellipsoid. Dimensional representation to the elliptic side. But they have very general techniques. They use a very striking idea of Jason Gutz to do this in the first place. But they're abstract techniques and they don't give you the kind of control over the remainder term that they're going to need. But it's very good nonetheless because it shows that this conjecture about Poisson summation. Works in principle for any group, and that the idea of subtracting away the one-dimensional representation works too, even if you can't estimate the difference. All right, so I'm going to have to move. Can I, I'm going to go quickly. GL3, we'll talk about GL3 now and local orbital integral. Local orbital integrals, and I'm talking about local orbital integrals over the unit function. That's what this is, O gamma of f. And I will assume that gamma is unramified, but it works perfectly well if gamma is ramified. If gamma is unramified, then the bile discriminant to the half is equal to q to Is equal to q to a number delta, which is divisible by 3. And this theorem says that this orbital integral is a fairly natural thumb. It's the sum of from q with increasing coefficients, q to the delta, all the way down to 2, minus a corresponding sum of q of only even powers. Only even powers all the way down to q squared. This is the contribution, this turns out to be the contribution of the regular Schalica germ, this top one, and this is the contribution of the subregular Shellika germ. This comes from a paper of Kotwitz, where he actually calculated these orbital integrals for GL3 in a rather complex expression. Rather complex expression that wouldn't be was unsuitable for what we would need it, what we'll need it for for Poisson summation, but it satisfies a difference equation. And if you solve that, you get this thing here. He had a very similar formula if gamma is ramified, and so the same thing works here. It's almost the same as this. And if gamma is not elliptic, the problems reduce to simpler things. Reduce to simpler things that come from orbital integrals and levy subgroups. So, I mean, this is much, it's a lot simpler than I expected. So, for example, if m is equal to 3 and delta is equal to 9, it follows easily from the theorem that the orbital integral of gamma of f is 1 plus What is basically the inverse of the local L function of E over F at S equals one, that's what this is, and then a series that starts at delta and goes all the way down, and you are increasing and then decreasing. Or even better, if you don't have this in, if you multiply it out, you're going to get something that increases by one at each step. And then when you get to M. To M, it starts to decrease, but it decreases in pairs. And so that's a very simple formula. The pattern is clear, and it's exactly the same for any M. Okay, I'm really running out of time. I apologize. A little rattle because of my difficulties at the beginning. But so out of that, one would like. So, out of that, one would like to construct explicit versions of the local orbital L functions for GL3. And what happens is you can use theorem one and the general analog of the example above. So this example works for, excuse me, that works for any M. And you can use that to write the orbital. To write the orbital integral, unramified orbital, the orbital integral over the unit function of sum of one plus the local L function to the minus one, and then plus something, a sum there from q to the delta down to q squared with very explicit coefficients. And to get the l function, what you do is you inflate this expression to a function of s by four operations. You translate it, by which I mean you multiply the expression by Q to the delta 1 minus s. That's the whole thing you multiply by that. You replace this special value of the Diraclay L function by its general value at s. That's what you do here. You inflate each monomial, q to the m, q to the 3m minus 1. You inflate it. minus one you inflate it to q to the k to q to the k times 2s minus 1 and then something perhaps the most important which is kind of a desingularization of this thing desingularization the higher multiple desingularize the higher multiplicities by replacing each coefficient by the sum i going from 0 to k pi minus 1 of q to the 1 minus of Q to the one minus S times I. So you simply replace this multiplicity by a sum of monomials going up by one with multiplicity one. And then let me write L tilde for the resulting function of S, where R is the local R is R is the local, R is R is A is the local order attached to A, E is the local field extension attached to A. And then we have the following theorem. That the value of this thing at one or at zero is the orbital integral. This is obvious from the construction, and this follows from this, which is the functional equation, that this thing equals that at the value. Of that, at the value of this thing is the same at s and one minus s. Okay, so one is trivial by construction and two uses elementary but quite tricky combinatorics. So to simplify, well, I have to go. You can simplify, you can write x equals q to the s. q to the s and you can write y you can write s as q to the y x y is q to the s and x is q to the 1 minus x s and then you're going to get in that example you're going to get this so it's more complicated but you would have to show that it's invariant by replacing by y and inspection of this can one convinces oneself that it happens that it's correct and the That it's correct. And the general case uses some tricky dominatorics. Same thing works for ramified gamma, and it's easier in the case of the case where a gamma is not elliptic. And then, as in the local case, for each local case, then you replace, you write L of S R as the you write L of S R as the product of the local of the local zeta function of E times this modification L tilde times this exponent. And then you can define the global L function as just basically the product of all of these things together with an Archimedean factor. And then as a corollary, you're going to get the functional equation for the global L function because the thing you've added to it, this L tilde, it's To it. This L tilde satisfies its own little functional equation, and so it just reduces to the functional equation of the Dedekind zeta function. Okay, so I have to stop now. I'm terribly sorry for going over, but the bottom line is I believe that these formulas are much simpler than. These formulas are much simpler than I expected, and I think they suggest what you should do for higher general linear groups you would use to do so. Yep. Okay. How long has that been going on? Just for a moment. Just for a second. Okay. So this for the case of GL2, beyond what Ali did, one would like to extend Ali's results to GL3. I think I expect to do that. But then one can ask also. Then one can ask also: Can you extend the global results to an arbitrary base field F? This has actually been done by Espinosolara, Emery. Sorry I've misspelled your name, Melissa. I have an E there. Kundu and Tian. And up here, for G. For GL2, Espinosa Lara has shown that this L function, which is basically the same as the Zagier L function, that this really is the L function defined, in the case of GL2, the zeta function defined by yuan. Okay, so in any case, to work with general, you can make To work with general, you can make general general general linear groups. You can, there's a lovely paper of Rogovsky, which allows you to make guesses as what it should be in many cases. And there's two papers by Wells Perge on germs by which you can try to establish these guesses. This will be for the orbital integrals. And finally, I would say that. I would say that I would hope that you could still find manageable formulas for the orbital integrals for other groups. And that's despite the paper of Hales, which is entitled provocatively, Why P-adic Harmonic Analysis is Not Elementary. So somehow it seems that it's possible, maybe even likely, that Even likely that you can get around that for these orbital integrals of the unit function. And if so, there is a rich and hidden structure on the elliptic terms. And it's given by duality between local Shalika germs and the global parameterization of non-tempered representations by unipotent, nilpotent elements in the dual group. And I won't, I mean, this is conjectural, but it looks like it has just an enormous amount of structure involving all kinds of operations on unipotent classes, duality, and two different classifications of unipotent elements. But it looks like there is going to be a very nice structure on these piadic or unramified p-adic orbital. Unramified p-adic orbital integrals. I mean, the orbital integrals of units.
