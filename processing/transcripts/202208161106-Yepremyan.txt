I had user issues and it took too long for me to get there on time. So, today I will talk about some joint work with Carl Cronenberg, who is at Oxford, doing a postdoc, and Johan Letzter and Alexei Pokrovsky, who are both based in London, UCL. So, what I will be talking about is related to a conjecture, which I'm sure many of you heard of. Sure, many of you heard of, and that's the linear arboreicity conjecture. So, let me define what linear arboreicity of a graph of G, graph G is. So, this is denoted by L A of G and it is the minimum number of edge disjoint. Linear forests in G whose union covers all of G. So basically what you want to do is you want to partition the edge set of G into linear forests. And I think probably you know what the linear forest is. Think probably you know what the linear forest is, but just to remind you, it means that all the components are paths, they are linear and so on. So that's linear forest. The conjecture that I want to mention goes to 80s and it's by Akiyama. Harare and Echo and it says that for any graph G with max degree delta, the linear arboricity of G is at most delta plus one over two. To actually see that You actually see that this is a tight bound. It's not difficult. You just look at it and see how you could make this forest to be actually edge disjoint. Like what is the... You look at the maximum degree vertex. But the hard part is to prove the upper bound. And in fact, an equivalent form of this conjecture is the following that That if G is delta regular, then the linear arboricity of G is maximum degree plus one over two. So what's known about this conjecture, so it is widely open. It is known for some classes of graphs, so it is known for Which is known for whenever delta is at most six, delta is eight, some small cases delta is ten. The first asymptotic result was proven by Alon in 88, and he proved that the conjecture is asymptotically true, meaning that the linear arboricity of G is at most delta over 2 plus. is at most delta over two plus some term so delta so here this is a little of delta term it's um delta times log log delta over log delta and then there were more results but i will not mention them uh just uh maybe also let me say that uh alan also proved that the conjecture is also true for highard graphs High gird graphs. And what I mean by that is that the girt of G it's omega of delta. Okay, so this is the setting we are thinking of. Another result by Bruce Reed and McCarney. Uh-huh. Is there a question? Okay, no question. Okay, another result by Rayden McDermott says also from H, he says that's true for also random regular graphs. Okay, so for general graphs, there were some more updates on this asymptotic term. I will note. Asymptotic term. I will not mention all of them, but I'll let me just mention the best result which is out there at the moment. It's by Ferber Fox and Vichesh, who is also at this workshop from 2019. And he can, if there is any updates, he can probably tell us about it. But by my knowledge, this is the best known bound is that L A of G is at most delta over 2. most delta over two plus of delta two-thirds minus alpha for some absolute alpha and this was my understanding of this is a this was a big deal because for a long time this there wasn't any any improvement like this okay but today I will not talk more about this conjecture but I'll talk about About this conjecture, but I'll talk about something related. So, therefore, let me first mention that when Akiyama, Harari, and Deho conjectured this linear alborosity, they posed their linear albosity conjecture, they also proved that it's true for cubic graphs. So they showed that L A of G is true when G is cubic. When G is cubic. In other words, I can partition every cubic graph in two linear forests, which are edge disjoint. Or in other words, we can two color any such G such that both red. Both red, black, and blue components are linear forests. So let me give you a proof of this, how one proves this. I don't know if you have seen any proof of this, but it's not hard, but I just think it's nice and it uses some ideas that later we used. That later we used for our problem. This is a proof by, it's not the original proof, it's a proof by Akiyama and Huadal. It's a much shorter proof from 82. And let's suppose we have G cubic. So then what do we know about its edge chromatic number? By B Zinc, we know that its edge chromatic number is between three and four. Is between three and four. Okay, so now let me take an auxiliary coloring of G by four colors. So let's say ABCD B four coloring of CG. And now I will consider the following recoloring. I will Recoloring, I will call A and B to be red and I will call C and D to be blue. And what do we see now immediately? If I denote by G R the red graph and by G B the blue graph, then you immediately see that by discoloring both of these numbers. Coloring, both of these numbers are at most two. The maximum degree of the red graph and the maximum degree of the blue graph, they are both two. Is that clear why? It's because the first coloring we took was a proper coloring, right? So if I'm seeing something, if I see a vertex with three red edges, well, how could that happen? It could happen only if I had something like A, A, Something like A, A, and B, or A, B, B. But that can't happen because our original coloring, it was a proper edge coloring graph. So here I meant proper four edge coloring. So what does this tell us? That already the maximum degrees are at most two, which means that the monochromatic components are either pal. Monochromatic components are either pads or cycles. Well, pads are good. So we are happy if there are paths. So monocomponents are paths or cycles. And the side paths are good. Now we need to understand how do we get rid of the cycles. And this is how we will get rid of them. So suppose I'm seeing something red. So, suppose I'm seeing something red, like a cycle, which is red. Then, what I will do is that I'll take one of these edges, let's say E1, and I will make it to become blue. So I will recolor this to blue. What can the problem be? The problem can be that there is some blue path sitting on this edge E1 and now I have created a new blue cycle. New blue cycle. But I claim that such a picture, right? Such a picture cannot happen both with E1 and E2. And why? Well, imagine there's also a blue path going via, you know, sitting on E2. So how would it go like that? Well, How would it go like that? Well, that can't happen. This vertex has degree three. It's a cubic graph. So this can't happen. So, what should happen? So, this can't happen. The other option, if it's this path is going like this and joining here, well, but now this vertex has blue degree 3. So that can't happen either. So, the claim is that one of the edges, so either E1 or E2, Or E2 won't close a cycle. And we can color, recolor one of them, at least one of them. You might now wonder, is it possible with this recoloring whether I can create new cycles or not? So, can I create new cycles? Any answers? Yes, I may create new cycles, and how would that happen? Well, it's possible that, you know, I took one and I made, I killed it, I took, I killed a red cycle and then I killed another red cycle. Oops, and I got here and And I got here. And one by one, this weren't a problem, but there eventually they are a problem because there is like another one, like another two paths going like that, one here, one here. So joining these two blue edges. So there can be a new cycle, but that's not a problem because I have to create one such blue cycle, I need to kill at least two red cycles. So eventually, after like doing one by one, iteratively, I'm Doing one by one, iteratively, I'm killing all the monochromatic cycles. Okay. So iteratively repeat killing cycles until none is left. And that's the proof. So, is there any question? Okay, I assume no. I assume no. So, but now I will talk about the main problem. And this question, so it was a question asked by Bermoux, Fouquet, Habib, and Peroche. And it was a conjecture which was asked in 84. And it says the following: that every cubic graph can be two-edge colored such that every monochromatic component is a linear forest. Which we already knew it's possible to do. So I need to tell you something more here. It's a linear forest of paths of length at most five. Okay. So this, the extra new thing is this one, that they are conjecturing that these parts are extremely short. And there were some results on this. Jackson and Wormald proved in 1996. In 96, that this is true for up to length 18. And then there were some other results, and eventually Thomason proved that it's true. So this was in 99, and the conjecture is true. So Bermont Fouquet Habe Paroche conjecture is true. Okay. And then And then, even stronger, so related, but not exactly the same, because you will see why it's not. So, this is about the length of the paths. Now, a different variation you would ask is how similar can this forest be, this linear forest? And that's the conjecture I want to mostly talk about. And that's a conjecture by Formalt, which says that It says that, so I think it was done in 87, and it says the following: that if G is cubic on n vertices, n is zero mod 4, then g can be edge partitioned. Into two isomorphic linear force. So, here the new ingredient, the new structure that we request is that these forests are actually isomorphic. And what we can prove is that This is true for G connected and enlarge. Here, this G connected part, it's kind of proof method failure. We don't know if, so it's kind of we need lots of big connected components, like we need like one big. Want to like we need like one big connected component, something of size n to a polynomial, which is a half plus epsilon. So it's not exactly that we need g to be connected, but we just need like a large connected component of size n to the half plus epsilon. So I don't have enough time to show you a proof of this theorem, but what I will try to sketch. I will try to sketch is an approximate version of it and how we derive the main theorem from an approximate version. So an approximate theorem. So as a first step, what we prove is that G Is that G can be colored by red and blue, such that three things happen. First one is that both the red and blue graph are linear forests. So this is the bare minimum we can ask for. The second thing, what we can prove is that for every k if I K if I look at the number, so RPK, which is the number of so this is the number of red pKs minus BPK, which is the analog, so number of blue pKs. It's not too far from each other, it's of n to the two-thirds. So, ideally, we want to show it. So ideally we want to show it zero, but in the approximate version, we are showing that it is bounded by some constant times n to the two-thirds. And we also show that every monochromatic path is not too long, is of length of and we derive the main theorem from here. But how do we actually But how do we actually prove this approximate theorem? So, we use the Thomason's result as an auxiliary step. So, the first thing what we do is proof sketch for approximate theorem. So we color EG by By purple and green, like in Thomason's result, recall that this gives us that every monochromatic path in this coloring is of length at most five. Length at most five. We don't exactly need to be to be at most five. We can also deal with if it's of logarithmic length. And then for every monochromatic path, we flip a coin. If I have a path like this, I flip a coin and I either recolor it to be red, blue, red, or the other. Or the other option of it. Blue, red, blue. Okay, so with probability a half, it goes here, with probability half, it goes there. And what happens again here, it's not hard to see, is that the maximum degrees of the red and of the blue graphs again is at most two. Why? Well, because how could you have How could you have? So recall that we never have so purple and green, they are monochromatic components, are always tats. So maybe I have a degree three vertex which looks like this, but it's never like three green coming out or three purples. And such a thing always goes either, let's say red, blue, and then the next one could be either red or blue. Be either red or blue, or maybe it's red, blue for the first path, right? So this path becomes red and blue, and this one either becomes red or it can become blue. So there is no chance for me to have a vertex of red or blue degree tree. So this already gives us the first condition. So first condition is First condition. So, first condition is done. Now, well, I still have to guarantee that I'm not going to get, like I should get rid of cycles. And for the cycles, we do something similar that I showed you in the proof. Whenever you had a red cycle, for example, so we need to break cycles. So, we need to break cycles. And whenever you want to break a red cycle, what you do is you flip an edge on it, either this one or one of the consecutive. So you pick uniformly at random two consecutive edges, and one of them will slip. And of course, as we have observed before, it can create a problem. Before it can create a problem, but we can iterate until there is no problem. So this is how we break cycles. So like in Chibatal Akiyama proof, what we also need is to break long paths. is to break long paths. But I won't tell you how we do that, but it's something similar. For every path, monochromatic path, we toss a coin and we do some recoloring with a similar trick. The main thing here I want you to take away is that everything we do, we do symmetrically for red and blue. So for us, there is no difference whether it's a red It's a red between red and blue colors. By doing this, doing everything symmetrically, we guarantee that the expected number of red peaks and the Red PKs and the blue peaks is the same. So, in expectation, they are reachable. And now what we need to, some technical part is that we need to show that this random process keeps these random variables to be lip shifts. So, technical part to show that To show that RPK and BPK stay ellipses and which means that at any point in our process, if I change one of the outputs, I'm only going to modify this RPK or BPK by a constant amount throughout this. Amount throughout this random process. And then once I have this, I apply concentrations. We actually use McDermott inequality to guarantee to guarantee concentration. So, what I mean by that is that I know that in expectation they are the same. So, if I show that RPK is concentrated and also BPK are concentrated with an error term of n to the two-thirds, then they are also not far from each other more than by n to the two-thirds. So, that's the approximate version, the very quick sketch of it. We need this, this part of This part of having each monochromatic path to be of length of log n for our exact to derive the exact result. So when we prove the main result in the next two minutes, I hope to be able to say is that so to prove the main result, so we pre-color Pre-color some part of G by red and blue. So you can somehow think about this as an absorber by some gadgets, which I'll tell you what they are. In a way, such that this absorber can later. This absorber can later on be used to do the balancing of RPK and blue pK. So then we prove this approximate result and then we derive so for every k we balance Balance RPK and blue PK by using the gadgets. So, what I mean here is that if I see, for example, that RPK for some K is bigger than loop PK, then I try to make them equal using the gadgets. And here we go by decreasing order of K. So I start with like the largest K, which is log n. K, which is log n, and I keep going until I get to the edges. And for my final slide, let me just draw you a gadget and say what I mean. So a gadget is something like this. So I have a path of length L, and then also I have some red paths sticking out. Sticking out. So these two parts are of the same length. Let's say A and A. There's some red stuff coming out here and another red thing here. Sorry. And this one is also, sorry, this should be L. Okay, so this will be a gadget, L gadget. L-gadget and of color blue. So the gadgets also have a color. And what you will notice here is that if I do a switch here of colors, so if I make this blue into red and this edge here into blue, then what happens after the switch is that For blue paths, so nothing changes for RPK. So, RPK doesn't change if I do the switch after the switch. But UPK does change. And how does it change? Well, first of all, I killed the longest cycle, which was sorry, the longest part, which was K equals L. Which was k equals L. So it goes by one for down by one from k equals l. It increases for k equals l minus one because of this guy. It also increases for k equals two, right? So this guy here also increases. I have now a longer path. It also it decreases for k equals one. k equals one. But the important thing is that I killed one path of length depth. So yeah, I think that's all. I hope I gave you some idea of how the proof works. And thank you. I think I'm over time by three minutes. And I'm ready for questions. Are there any questions? Uh, are there any questions? Um, I had a quick comment. Can you hear me? Yes. Hi, Liana. Um, so I wanted to mention, oh, thank you. It was a great talk, by the way, and a nice, a really nice result. Um, I did want to mention that there is an improvement to Ferber Fox Jane. So I believe Rick Flang and Luke Postel have the current best bound. Namely, they do at most delta over. They do at most delta over two plus some constant times square root delta log to the fourth delta linear force. And also, yeah, so it would be like root delta times log to the fourth delta. And I think the constant's like three, log to the fourth delta. Okay. That's lang post all. And they also link it with the list coloring conjectures. That's also the Coloring conjectures. That's also the current bound for the list coloring conjecture. And what's the second last name? Is it Richard Lang? L-A-N-G. L-A-N-G. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yes. I think, or it should be. Okay, very nice. That's good. Any other questions? Comments? Now then, that's uh thank you. And uh choose the line yet.
