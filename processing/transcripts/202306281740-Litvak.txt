Hello, thank you very much for the invitation. I'm sorry I couldn't come in person. And I'm going to speak about joint work with Daniel Galitzer, Marianne Merzbeicher, and Demian Pinasco. And we will discuss volume ratios. So I'm So, well, we always assume that the body contains a region in its interior. And we also will use shifts because we pretty often work with non-symmetric convex bodies. So, just a moment, I want to add you some picture. So, I don't know what's going on. Something doesn't work. Well, sorry. It was one year that I didn't give online talks. I don't know what's going on. So, in any case, whenever we have non-symmetric convex body, we should choose some appropriate point which will play the role of center. Play the role of center because for most problems, for example, it's not natural if center is very close to the interior, so we will shift our body. And as usual, we denote by BPN unit ball of the space LPN. I always work with n-dimensional spaces, and volume ratio is defined here. So we try to Here, so we try to find a fine map which sends second body L into inside K. And then we estimate, in a sense, measure volume loss. So we take ratio of volumes of K and C L, assuming that T L is on K, and we take one over n power of. One over n power of it because volume is n homogeneous, so we want to make it one homogeneous. And of course, if when I say a fine map, it means that in fact I can first choose appropriate centers shifting my bodies and then consider linear maps. And if my body is already symmetric, it's easy to check that I can choose. Easy to check that I can choose center of symmetry as the region to get infinite here. And this notion already was considered in 50th of previous century by Macbeth and by Levy. They considered volume ratio and they considered product of volume ratios, I will say later. And also in many, many works there is. Many, many works, there is term volume ratio related to just one body, and it is defined just as volume ratio of K and B2. And standard notion of outer volume ratio of body is volume ratio of B2 and K. So, in first case, you just inscribe the ellipsoid of maximum volume inside K, so-called John ellipsoid, which already was mentioned here, and outer volume ratio just opposite. Volume ratio just opposite you inscribe body inside ellipsoid, or you consider ellipsoid of minimal volume. And I also want to mention that it's enough for most problems, it's enough to consider centrally symmetric convex bodies, at least for volume ratio, and at least if we don't care about absolute constants. Because first of all, Because first of all, volume ratio satisfies multiplicative triangle inequality. You can put body inside, and volume ratio will be less than product of two volume ratios. Second, Roger Shepard in 57 proved that if I take difference body K minus K, which is obviously symmetric, then it is bound that its volume bound. Is bound that it's volume bounded by fortune of volume k by bar side and the node n-dimensional volume and stain proved in 56 that there exists point such that if I take this point as the center I shift my body by this point then intersection of k and minus k which is also symmetric is larger than 2 to the minus n. Is larger than two to the minus a n times volume of k. Stain proved it just using random points. In fact, this is true in average. And then Vitaly, Minman, and Pajor proved this inequality for Barrett center, because in stain we don't know what center to take. And there are two small improvements which are not very important for this talk, but I want to mention by Frank Schlonket question Friedz. Frank Slunk at quotient read, so they improved this 2 to the minus n by exponential to square root of n. And then, very recent result is CAMPAS one hint or more recent SIBA, they further improved it by E to the N over locan. In fact, they use some L K and use and then Boas recently Boas Kalartic recently proved that it's less than square root of log n. Less than the square root of log n. In this paper, it's some other bound. But C always C in this talk means absolute constant, which is independent on any other parameter. But for us, it's not important. What is important for us is that between K and L, I can put two intermediate symmetric bodies. First of all, K intersective minus K. I mean, I already appropriately choose. I already appropriately choose center and second body L minus L. Then volume ratio by this triangle inequality will be less than product of three of them. And first is bounded by what? By two, last bounded by four. So we get eight times volume ratio of two symmetric complex bodies. So most problems related. Most problems related to volume ratios, they immediately reduce to symmetric convergence bodies, unless you need to get shark constants. I mean, unless you don't want to have some absolute constants like eight here. And a couple of examples with volume ratios which are big. So if we just compare ellipsoid with octahedron or cube with ellipsoid. With ellipsoid, we will get square root of n, which is very big. And on the other hand, another example is that, in fact, if we pass to dual body, we will get essentially the same volume ratio up to absolute constant. We can find two centers because when I take polar body, it's important what center is. So we can find two approaches. We can find two appropriate centers for K and for L, such that the volume ratio between K and L is the same as volume ratio between K polar and L polar with respect to these two points. And it follows from Centaloo inequality and inverse Centalo inequality proved by Borgui and Milwaukee. And for some time, it was an open question: what is maximal? Was an open question: What is the maximal possible volume ratio? Can it be, in particular, much larger than the square root of n? And this question was answered in 2002 by Giannopoulos and Herzulake, who almost proved who proved almost sharp bound up to this Logariform. So, volume ratio between two bodies is bounded by C square root of n times Logariform N. So, and like I said, above that. And, like I said above, that you cannot avoid square root of end, so creation only if you can remove Lagari from N. So now I'm sorry, sorry, but in this example, two bodies are very specific, and Khabrov proved that this result is sharp in match. In a much stronger sense. For every convex body, he was able to construct another convex body such that the volume ratio is larger than the square root of n up to this double logarithm. And this double logarithm was removed by Michael Rotors recently, but once again, what is important here is square root of n. So the So, I would like to repeat that if you can remove this logarithmic from men or not is still an open question. And next, what I want to mention for our which is important for our results is so-called Banach-Mazberg distance, which comes from functional analysis. It's distance between two Banach spaces, or in finite dimensional case, just Nord spaces. Case with just Nord spaces, but we can extend it to the case of non-symmetric convex bodies also. And it looks like this. So we need to find two centers, shifts of K and L, and then to find linear operator such that Kx is inside of T times, well, this linear operator times L, and T L is inside. And Tl is inside lambda kx. And then infinite over all such lambdas is Banach Mazur distance. It's a very important notion in Banach space theory, but also in asymptotic geometric analysis. And of course, it started from functional analysis, so it started only from centrally symmetric convex bodies, but which are unit balls of corresponding norms. But it's also important in non-symmetric case. So once again, Case. So once again, this distance is multiplicative. If you have intermediate body, then distance is bounded by product of two distances. It's the same as volume ratio. If you have two centrally symmetric convergence bodies, that it's easy to see that for infinite, it's enough to take x equals y equals zero. Also, from John's theorem, Also from John's theorem for two centrally symmetric convex bodies, distance between K and L is bounded by N. So it was mentioned in Vigoy Yvanov's talk that distance for a joint position, we already have that ellipsoid of maximum volume is inside of k and k is inside of square root of n times ellipsoid. So the distance between Between k and b2 is square root of n, and the same for a, so product is less than n. And it was open for, I don't know how many years, probably 40 or 50 years. What is, is it, is it bound sharp or not? For distance and Glusk in 81 proved that there are two centrally symmetric convex bodies. Centrally symmetric convex bodies such that distance is larger than c times n. So, this n for centrally symmetric convex bodies is sharp estimate up to up to absolute constant. In the non-symmetric case situation is different and the bound to the best bound was proved the best known bound was proved by Rudison in 2000. He proved that essentially its bound. It's bounded by n to the 4 over 3. This power 4 over 3 doesn't look natural. If one tried to adapt the Glueskin example to non-symmetric case, one gets also Cn, so we have gap between N and N to the fourth of 3. And by the way, just to mention that John's theorem in non-symmetric case gives that distance between Bozi and the absurdity is bounded by. third is bounded by n. So if you try to apply at the angle inequality, you will get n square. So Rudolphson improved this power 2 to 4 over 3. And of course this distance from ellipsoid to centrally symmetric convex body square root of n is sharp say for case of octahedron and in non-symmetric case simplex gives n so this So, this is some history. And what is more related to us is the following extension or relaxation of Banach-Mazard distance, so-called modified Banach-Mazr distance. And this name comes from Herabrof paper when we, instead of considering a norm of operator, which is very very strong, it's essentially. Wrong. It's essentially measures the worst point. We substitute it with volume ratios. Volume ratios is more kind of average than cargo and so it's so we take volume ratio between K and L and volume ratio between L and K. And it's very easy to see that it's smaller than Banach Mazu distance. And this distance was essentially introduced by Introduced by Mark Beoff, who considered this and well, he considered algorithm of this because he wanted additive triangle inequality. And this distance was used in several work to prove lower bound for one of master distance. In particular, in paper of Guerary, Kaditz and Pantsaev, they found upper and lower bounds. Bound upper and lower bounds on distances between LP and LQ balls. And for lower bounds, they essentially use volume ratio without introducing such distance. It was also implicitly used by Gluskin in his theorem that I mentioned. And also, probably the only place in my talk where I do care about absolute constant. In our paper, we have worked. In our paper with Gordon, Meyer, and Pajor, we proved that this distance is also bounded by n for any two convex bodies. Of course, if bodies are symmetric, it's immediate, like we mentioned, because Banach Mazov distance is less than n. But in non-symmetric case, we can do symmetrization, we will get 8n. So we Get 8n. So we prove that 8 is not needed. Well, and now I probably will pass to related to our results. And the main motivation was, well, one motivation, of course, studying volume ratio. And main motivation is the following theorem by Woodison, who considers the following distance type parameter. So for Tutson. So, for two centrally symmetric convex bodies, he considers the following distance, delta k, which is Banach Mazer distance between two projections of bodies K and L, projections of course of the same rank. And what he proved? He proved that such distance is bounded by the following maximum and. And interesting that threshold here is n to the power 2 order 3. What is larger? K square order n or square root of k. And remark that he also proved sharpness that up to logarithmic factors, this bound is sharp. This bound is sharp. So, this is what we have for Banachmazer distance. We wanted to get a similar result for volume ratio. So, on this slide, I will repeat Rudison's theorem. And what we proved, we considered volume ratio. So, we consider the following parameter, we take Naturally we take K and we proved that we can find centrally symmetric convex body L always such that infinum over projections of rank K of volume ratio of PK with respect to Q L is a bound. L is bounded by K u square root of n times log L. So I would like to just to mention that because we take volume ratio and not product of two volume ratios, this result should be compared with square root of Rudolphson estimate and it corresponds to first bound in Rudolphson estimate, k over square root of n. And our result also, in some sense, So, in some sense, quite sharp because if you take k equals b1, then for every l, upper bound is k over square root of n. So if you want general result, we cannot get something better than k over square root of n. So, this is main result, and I will just outline, I will not provide more, but. Outline: I will not provide proof, but I will outline some ideas which we used. So, first we just rewrite volume ratio in terms of ratio of volumes of K and L and then infinum of operator norm of operator from L to K. Here L is also symmetric. To K. Here, L is also symmetric. So we have just a standard operator norm. When I say from L to K, it means that the operator works in Rn with norm defined by L. So L is unit ball of this norm. And similarly, it's from Rn with L as unit ball to Rn with norm defined by K. So K is unit ball. So it's very easy, of course, to rewrite because what does it mean? If you remember, volume ratio means that I take such a ratio and minimize over such that T L inside K. T L inside K means that norm is one. So instead of minimizing all your such operators, we just take norm and minimize our operators of determinant ones. They preserve the volume. And idea for construction is Construction is actually quite standard for constructing counterexamples in examples with very bad behavior. In asymptotic geometric analysis, it was first used by Gluskin, and then after Gluskin, it was used in many, many papers to get some quantities which are very big with respect to dimension to prove sharpness of such. Dimension to prove sharpness of such of some results. So it's so-called glueskin polytope. And essentially, it's an absolute convex hull of just of Gaussian vectors. Sometimes, and it's very convenient, it's not necessary to add a standard unit basis multiplied by square root of n because Gaussian vectors they They are Euclidean norm concentrated around square root of n. So, either to consider Gaussian reactors or just to consider random points uniformly distributed on sphere. It's more or less all such polytopes are called Gulskin polytops. And Gulskin proved he used exactly such polytopes, two such polytopes independent to show. To show the distance is maximum. So that's what I said already: that here bar mean Euclidean norm. Euclidean norm of standard Gaussian random vector is concentrated around square root of n. Moreover, Glutkin also proved that it's well. Well, such polytope contains Euclidean ball of such radius, and of course, it's inside two times square root of n because of concentration. So, this is important. Another ingredient of our proof is the following result also by Gluskin, Carpagour, and Barani Khuridi from 88 also. From 88, also that if you have polytop, when you control length of vertices and number of vertices, you have a reasonably good estimate, which is written here. So it helps us to, well, later to choose some capital. And another estimate, well, Well, because we use random polytops goals in more or less standard way, we use union bounds. So, for union bound, it's very important to estimate, to get individual estimates when you fix we fix some operator and we fix two projections. Then we want to show that the norm of operator is small. norm of operator is small. So we prove it with high probability, then we try to construct nets which nets for operators and nets for projections. So we need individual bounds which I wrote here and it's now you can see that volume is involved. Then we construct suitable nets for operators and for projections and for projections. For projections, and for projections, we use the result of Scheik from 82 on how many projections we have. Then we apply a formula which I wrote before for volume ratio. And then, of course, we need to adjust and to choose all parameters so that all bounds work with high probability. I mean, parameters, well, there are some absolute. There are some absolute constants inside nets, inside probability, so it's quite technical and delicate work, which I refer to here. So these are just ideas, of course. And finally, I want to mention, just to make several remarks. So first of all, we can rewrite our results using the following parameters. Using the following parameter, so we call it projection k-volume ratio of k, and this is exactly what we estimated. We take a supremum over all bodies L, then infinum over all projections P and Q, and volume ratio between PK and QL. So, what we proved in terms of this parameter is that for every K, For every k so rejection volume ratio is larger than k over square root of n, and on the other hand, this result is sharp because for octahedron, this is smaller than k over square root of n. And another remark that, of course, just using using dimensional consideration because we Dimensional consideration because we take projections of rank k and the Giannopoulos-Herzolaki result would immediately give a bound square root of k log k upper bound and result of Glueskin, Carpazor and Barrain Foueti on volume of polyotope with not large amount of vertices will give that it's bounded by essentially square root of k up to get. Essentially, the square root of k up to derivative. So, depending on the range of k, this estimates or these estimates could be better. And another remark that, well, our previous parameter is volume ratio. We can similarly introduce outer volume ratio, but and to study suprium over L. Suprium over or L, infinite over two projection of P and Q and volume ratio now P L with respect to Q K. So instead of taking L inside K, now we will take K inside L. But this parameter, at least if we speak about the worst body, is probably much less interesting. It's interesting just for specific bodies because if you take ellipsoids. If you take ellipsoids and K say proportional to n, then this quantity already bounded by a constant. So our previous result was to show that such quantity is bounded below by something significant, say k or square root of n. So if k is proportional to n, it would be square root of n, maximal possible. Here it's opposite situation that you It's opposite situations that using so-called amposition and standard properties of amposition, one can prove that for anybody you can find a projection which has volume ratio, which gives the following: that projection k outer volume ratio when k is proportional to n of ellipsoid is bound. n of ellipsoid is bounded by by a constant which depends only on proportion on the other hand it's probably would be interesting to study how other bodies say bp or more complicated bodies behave so i would like to stop here Thank you, question or comment. Do you hear me? Yes, yes, yes. Okay, so my question is the phone, but in this like outer volume ratio, I would rather say that it's not the the projection, but I would take a section. Projection, but I would take a section if it's the opposite problem. Well, if section by duality, I would say that it is the same. The point is that we consider here QK and PA and we want to interchange them. But if you want to interchange them and pass from projection to section, then it will be the same as before. Then it will be the same as before. Say if we restrict ourselves to centrally symmetric convex bodies, then by fact that I mentioned before that we can pass to dual body because projection of L is dual to section of L polar. If you interchange order and substitute projection with section, you will return to our previous result. At least for example, this is Result. At least for centrally symmetric convex bodies, because for non-symmetric, you need to work quite a delicate way how to choose center. For projections, it's not important, but for sections, it's very important. Yeah, I agree. Okay. Another question or comment online? Well, if not, if nobody, we thank you. Nobody, we thank again Sasha. Thank you. Thank you.
