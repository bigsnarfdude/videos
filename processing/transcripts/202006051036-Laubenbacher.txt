Finite fields. So it's a pretty straightforward generalization. The proper generalization of the AND operator is essentially any binary operator that turns the network into a semi-lattice. So that's for strongly connected dependency graphs. So what's the What about general networks? So, for general networks, one can do the following. You can take the interaction graph, you can divide it up into strongly connected components, and these strongly connected components form a partially ordered set. You can have edges that go from one component into another one, but you cannot have any edges that go back so. So, what you get is a partially ordered set. And for general networks, we have one of the results we have is that we derive a sharp lower bound for the number of limit cycles of a given length in terms of the limit cycles of the strongly connected components. Strongly connected components and the number of maximal antichains in that partially ordered set. And that lower bound is in the form of a polynomial in these data entries. And it's not important what this looks like, but the important thing is that the ingredients are knowledge about the dynamics of the strongly connected components and some of the structure of this partially ordered sand. So, let me get to what this has to do potentially with modularity. So, let me just explain this result in a slightly different context. So, let's assume this is the partially ordered set of strongly connected components. So, if you think of the very top component, the maximal component here, so that's a strongly connected network. So, I know everything. Network, so I know everything about its dynamics. And so that's one of the maximal anti-chains. If I were to remove that and I look at the maximal nodes in the maximal elements in the resulting partially ordered set, then one of the things I get is a maximal anti-chain. And again, I know everything about the dynamics of the network. The networks in this layer. And I can work my way down in this way. And so, what I get in this way is a filtration of my dynamical system, of my Boolean network, so that at each layer, what I add on top of it is something that I know everything about in terms of dynamics. And so if I what I would like to explain to you now is how one can turn this into a something like a program for understanding modularity. So what we need is for this is we need to be able to do two things. We need to, given a model, we need to be able to compute its modules. So in particular, we need a good Modules. So, in particular, we need a good definition of modules, and we need to compute the attractive structure in terms of the attractive structure of the individual modules. That's one. And the other one is we need to characterize the way in which we can combine these models, in which we combine simple modules to get general models. So, it's sort of a decomposition theory we're looking for. Decomposition theory we're looking for. And of course, mathematics is full of decomposition theories of different kinds. The one that I want to think of, and one can probably choose others. So the paradigm I want is the theory of finite groups. So if you think of what that entails, so you have the key result that says every finite group has a filtration of subgroups. Of subgroups so that each of each successive quotient is a simple group, so there's no normal subgroups. And the next step is to classify all simple groups, so you know everything about the pieces. And the third part is you want to know something about how you can take a group and extend it to something larger using another simple group. Now, that's, of course, largely unrealized. Unrealized. A simple example of that would be, say, a description of semi-direct products of groups. And of course, one of the great accomplishments of 20th century mathematics is the classification of all finite simple groups. So that's the paradigm that I want to apply to studying modularity in Boolean networks or more general models of the sort. More general models of the sort. So I'm thinking of a HELDA program, so to speak. And what would that entail? It would entail identifying a good class of Boolean networks that are decomposable. Certainly AND networks are too small for this. Certainly from an application point of view, they're too small. Very few biological systems can be described in this way. In this way, then you need to find the analog of the simple groups, and they should be sufficiently rich so you can actually characterize them and find out something about their dynamics. You need some notion of a quotient so you can look at, you know, if you have a subnetwork, what's in the whole network that's out there. In the whole network that's outside of it. You need to show the equivalent of the Drawdown-Holder theorem. And you need to classify the different ways in which decomposable Boolean networks can be built as extensions. Among other things that requires things like dynamic equivalence of networks, you need to get a proper definition of that. All of that is probably done best in the context of. Is probably done best in the context of category theory. Having been a category theorist in a former life, I like that idea very much. So, let me just say a few things in the last six minutes I have. Let me say a few things about these different steps. So, the first thing is what's a good class of decomposable Class of decomposable networks that are from applications interesting and rich enough to be meaningful. There's this concept of cannalization that has been around since the 1940s that developmental biologists have coined. And those have been studied quite a bit. So canalization and functions that have so-called canalizing properties since the 1990s. Since the 1990s. Here's one study we made on so-called nested canalizing functions. So, what's a canalizing function? It's essentially one that, say a Boolean rule, it's essentially one that has a variable that if that variable gets a particular input, it determines the value of the entire rule. So, for example, A and B, if A is set to zero, Is set to zero, then the formula will be zero regardless of what B is. So A would be a canalizing variable with canalizing input zero. Now, if A is one, then you don't know, then it depends on the second variable. And if that second variable is zero, then again, it determines the value of the function. So nestic analyzation essentially says you can work your way. Essentially, it says you can work your way down all the way to through all the variables. Now, one of the things we showed is that if you think of these as polynomials, they actually have a very nice nested form. One can write down very nicely what they look like. They're totally parametrized by these two sets of parameters. So, for example, it allows you. So, for example, it allows you to very easily write down all nestic analyzing functions if you're interested in doing that, which, for example, is very helpful for all sorts of simulations. They have, if I use them to build network, and I should say, of course, the end networks are special examples of those. They have nestic analyzing networks, have very nice properties, dynamic properties. Properties, dynamic properties. One can prove all sorts of things. A lot of people have done work on these. In particular, Gleib and I, together with a couple of high school students, published a paper on this just a few months ago. And so these are good from a mathematical point of view, but how about the biology? It was sort of unclear whether biologically they're actually meaningful. So here's a slide. Meaningful. So here's a slide that Klaus Kadelke gave me from Ohio State. He and the group of students looked at hundreds of published Boolean models of different kinds of networks and looked at all the Boolean rules that were used and essentially classified them with respect to their canalization properties. And they showed that the vast, vast majority of the rules that show up in published models are in fact nested canalizing. And even those that aren't have very And even those that aren't have very nice properties in terms of symmetry and others. So, what this indicates is that this concept of canalization is a very useful concept from the point of view of biology and might also be a very useful concept from the point of view of mathematics. So, looking at the class of nested analyzing functions as the class of decomposable systems, I think would be a reasonable choice. So here's a paper I just want to mention that where we started to develop a category theory or theoretic framework for this. We never really pushed this farther because it was sort of not clear what it would be useful for, but actually now it's pretty clear that it would be extraordinarily useful. So let me just say, end with some very concrete problems that I think one could Problems that I think one could pursue here. The proof in this 10-year-old paper we have is a combinatorial proof. But I think actually there might be a very nice proof in the language of computational algebra and algebraic combinatorics that I think might shed a lot of light on the relationship between the combinatorics of this whole situation and the dynamical systems. And the dynamical systems properties. I think that studying nestic analyzing polynomials will be interesting. We started this in the paper that I put up earlier. And then the next step would be to carry out this Holder program for larger classes of networks. So one could, instead of just AND networks, one could study AND-NOT networks, some other generalizations, and work. Other generalizations and work one's way up to nestic analyzing networks. So, let me just end by thanking sponsors for the various support we received over the years. And I'll end with this, and I'm happy to answer any questions. Okay, thank you, Reinhardt. Our questions to the speaker? Just unmute yourself and ask. Just unmute yourself and ask. Then let let me ask a question. So you are proposing nesting networks as a potential candidate for an ND composal for being simple group, right? That's correct. But would it be... No, no, no, no, I'm sorry, no, no, for the simple one, so I'm yeah, for the simple ones so so yeah i forgot to mention that right so so in the um for the end networks the analog of simple groups were um were those with strongly connected dependency graphs so they may or may not be the right choice but um what I would point out is that if you if you go to the same situation in for biochemical reaction networks, so they are strongly connected dependency graph means Dependency graph means weakly reversible systems. Those are closely related to toric systems, so one might guess that those have very nice properties. Okay, but so my question was, would it make sense to think that canalization is not a brick, but actually a way you assemble bricks? So you might get some simple networks and Some simple networks and assemble them together in a candleizing way. I see. That's an interesting idea. Yeah, that's an interesting idea. I had no thought. Other questions to Reinhardt? I have a stupid question. Yeah, sure. My question is: you said, Reinhard, that in the Is you said Reichard that in the many many biological models they use the occurrence of canalizing functions is high. But do you think that this depends on the biology or what we can model? They are simpler to model. Well, so the way these models are typically built is you either use experimental data or you go through the literature and you find biological mechanisms that you then try. That you then translate into rules basically. And it's the exact same process by which you build differential equation systems, differential equations models. So I would guess this is how it comes out. I mean, we could, you know, you can build any mechanism that you have in biology, you can represent through a logical formula. Through a logical formula, anesthetic analyzing or not. What Klaus looked at is a vast range of models in different fields of biology and the findings were pretty universally available, universally the same. Now, I mean, I know, so I understand your question, basically, you know, we maybe. you know we uh maybe maybe what we model is what we what we see and and what we see is is inaccurate or incomplete but i mean it is what it is right that's uh that's the best we can do and and you know yeah that's right thank you when it comes to this uh Modular structure in biochemical networks or biological networks. The work in the biology side that I am most familiar with is by Uri Alon and his group, where they show that there are these so-called network motifs that are over-represented in biochemical systems. They show up much more than they would show in random graphs. And I was wondering if you looked at those and if you can make any. And if you can make any comments or connections between your approach and this motifs, so-called. Yeah, it's a bit different, right? So what Alona and others studied were sort of graph theoretic motifs that show up, and they were mostly motifs involving three and four nodes. So, for example, incoherent feed-forward loops that involve three nodes with Three nodes with arrows going in one direction, one arrow with one path with two arrows, one with one, they might have different signs. And in essence, what the study really, what this work has done is to show that certain motifs show up more frequently. But these motifs are quite different from what one would consider modules because they might be embedded in. Because they might be embedded in much larger components of the network that would be modules. So, in some sense, it's different. What it might tell you is what sort of structures you might find within modules. Yeah, makes sense. Thank you. Other questions? Okay, then let's thank the speaker and all the speakers for the day.
