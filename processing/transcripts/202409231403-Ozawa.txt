Introduction. Uh so that o only in the introduction these emails are reminding my story. Re type just late and the potential product which is fading or L2. So people want some ingredients for tea and then for D and when M is when M is compact you know that D spectrum of D is discrete fully transformed regularly. And the terminology this is a solution space to some differential equation. It's finite dimensional. And so the one works with Opera Cancing index field. And then at the it really at the started the non-compact case, when when the this end becomes non-compact, uh a lot of difficulty arises. That's the spectrum is no longer distant. The spectrum is no longer discrete, it's continuous. And the solution space is not finite-dimensional, but intimational. And so he said that so well, in this case, you need operator GPAC instead of operator C1. And so he he started like F2 index here and using on layman twice to regions uh uh infinite dimensional space. Infinite dimensional space. And then Devil Kun and Jung Lo worked on system for this. So we work on the finite performation functions. This is m times m to see. This function is finite performance. This function is finite propagation if it's supported on finite propinate proponent if there is R such that the X Y is gradient. No, John's already think this is okay. This one is an integral operator Tk on L2F or other space L2F. As our space, valid F and space print K X Y this is Hilbert Stream if M is compact, but it need not be Hilbert Stream. And this is a finite propagation operator. And the rho system algebra is defined to be the one defined by rho, is that this operator tk, such that tk is quite easy. More concept or to be thankful. Uh yeah. This is uh Rhodes algebra and the uh the Rhodes discovery was that the K-theory of this Rohssist algebra is a very interesting thing and the index theory of like this D, the value of index takes in the takes value of the K-theory is for what to this is for today's store. So in general, we just consider the M metric space or bounding or propa, usually propa, it doesn't matter what we use, propa metric space, bound geometry, which I will introduce later. And the H is a kilbert M module. By this, it means that the function algebra signal M, continuous function branching that thing, acts on the M2 acts on H. In a non-degenerate way, that's approximately almost demon, and also that it has infinite multiplicity as well, you know, infinite multiplicity. It's essential compact, it doesn't meet, it doesn't meet with compact properties. And then the T in V of H is positive. So these operators, this integral operator is not compact unless it's not obviously compact unless M is compact, but it's locally compact in the sense. But it's locally compact in the sense that if you restrict this TK to a compact subset of N, it becomes Hilbert Shu, so it's compact. So if it's compact, if F T or T A or compact or any F and D C or T C or D Uh is valid propagation or hot pilot propagation? I can like it here for me for the If the finite propagations like this are here, so the if there is R such that any F and G in C naught M if they support this R array And here Fg then the F D G is zero but this is project for migration and the C star rho M is uh s uh same C star gotino file. Locally compact and finite. Locally compact and quiet operation operate that So the the quick thing is that So the the good thing is that the so like inferential operator is actually not not only locally compact, it what finite propagation, it's local, yes, it's a differential operator depends only on the local behavior. But the differential operator is unbounded, so that if you do the exponency exponential ide, this becomes uh bounded terminus and it's easy to check. That's operator easy. To check this, that's all very easy here. But some people like earlier noticed that the pseudo-differential operator need not give rise to it's actually not the model but may not give rise to a finite propagation operator. Instead, they they express to a quasi-nopen operator. So the t is a quesine opener. Any cycle, there is R such that the same distance anymore distance of support F support E greater than R. Then FTG norm is small. Small. This is like the finite propagations compared with the CC function, a compact support, compactly supported function. And the first I look at thing is that its sample corresponds to C. Corresponds to C naught. And the good thing is that the C star desi local operators, this is locally compact and plus I local. This is already a C star job. You don't need to take closer C star job. Oh, by the way, these are closed. Oh, by the way, it is a closed and star operation program, so it's a system. This is already system and of course there's incoming junk. And it's nice if they are equal because you know given operator you can relatively easily easy to check if T is quasi-local or not. But it's usually hard to check if it's in a low algebra or not because it takes closure of something and but the opposite operators in low algebra is very nice because it's approximate by fine propagation operator for the user. Those are twist to me, but they are equal. Well, actually, John Rhode introduced these algebra in 80s, and at that time he didn't distinguish these himself. And later he Later he realized that they may not be equal. So it becomes a question. And the answer is yes. If the answer is yes. If M is sufficiently nice. So So, this the first result is by law in the 80s, like very simple cases. And even the operator, and actually after that, I don't know, at some point he noticed that the operator theorists have a working on this for the case of M is RB or ZB, okay. Operator service communities for RDXF. And finally, I put on Jam proved it for property eight metrics I did talking today about and a point of eight. And the answer in general is no. Which I proved last year during I was in Philippines. I was speaking. Yeah. So there's a also for some. So post a connective space. There's a actually, it can be reflected if you want. There's a face I know can operate but it is not approached mine to the finite property. Still it there's a still a small possibility that they may be the same in the K-theory. But I don't know. And even I would say that the K-theory of this itself is not very important because our conjecture, etc., that the K-theory of this is the same as K-theory of the C-star algebra. If the K-theory of the C-star algebra is very nice, Punctor reads. Actually, what it is doesn't matter. If there is a if two sides are equal, you can compute this side and you know this side is a very good top. I don't know if this one has So, uh, what is uh sister rows raw sister algebra? I I this is continuous continuous into that shell. This is rho. That's the C star rho n is isolar. Is isomorphic to E, or this is the row N, if M and N are coarsely isomorphic. So what is coarse isomorphic? Mm coarsely isomorphic if there is a well. So it's just network space and even it's large scale geometric so that need not be continuous whatsoever. The local structure doesn't work, such that any xn yn in m xn y n distance in n tends to infinity. If I know only Of going. This happens if and only it happens in the language in the edge. So just powerful, that's the outcome. And the second condition is that this is just embedding. So the second condition is that quasi-surgery. Meaning that it has some number R such that M is containing the R neighborhood per set M. Examples M is coarsely isomorphic to a point if uh M is bounded if diameter is bound up, then it's it's the same as That's an it's thing. Uh Rm is isomorphic as Zm or it just embedded. So isomorphism should be steady isomorphic. H has the information. No this is not the information. Is not doing for much. Uh yes. And M is important. M is growing since some other examples are that Some other examples are that which people write like this absolute binary gamma. That's the discrete group gamma or count of the discrete group, finitely generated with a watermelon. It's a finite general. And also, if M is compact manifold, connected, then the universal covering is classically isomorphic to the fundamental diagrams. Oh, so the particular this this algebra does not depend on the choice of the On the choice of the space, C not M module, two parts. If it is non-degenerate, then essential doesn't mean compact of the problem. So the rest of the talk, I work with discrete segment is now discrete. And with uh not only discrete, you uniformly locally find that is uh any r the any r the su of our x, of the ball of x. The whole of X ray is R, the coordinate E is bound. This is definitely from group 35. And if you remember the metallic space M was called bounded geometry, M is bound in a general metallic space. M is bound in a general metric space M is of bounded geometry fund they only pierce models as a positive is not recognized. And instead we consider uniform Gua algebra this is uh T T or finite propagation. There's no local compactness as a chunk of reality. So it's discrete space. So it is supporting and no port. Uh this is uh simply power version of new working. AQL same, yeah. If you are saved, yeah. Press sign up. So the normal result is that so example is that C star u gamma. Gamma, the gamma viewed asometoric space with one metallic is isomorphic or isomorphic as we used cross-poor since a p2 gamma generated by diagonals and the first patients. This is also C star jubilee. We used to look C star jubilee with some cool point G Jeez, only your home voice and this M there's amenability like condition M has property A. So the just simple amenability condition is that there is a huge parallel set. But this is not good at all for L because if there's a X, it has huge parallel sets, so amina X, and there's some strain crazy Y, then the union becomes amino in that sense amino V. Right? So that this this has other other proper property. Property is more more suitable for making power box. I don't define it because it's level C, but says if I'm only if this for any memory space in this uniform algebra is actually the first group group on the algebra with some group point corresponding to the real transformations. Or this at least et al group on this algebraic group. Group or disability as I type for some rather too many too many people and in that example these are these are property A and this has property A if and only speaker just hit the spatial channel Uh M plus A then then the D1 J plus C U is U Q L and C star O is C star Q L. So now I spoke about counter example. I knew this subject of course geometry for 20 years, but I never worked on it. And but last call I was in Kilt Institute and Julius Para asked me something. Elias Para asked me some question about the quark space. Uh without it, I didn't tell something about the quark spaces. So uh here about here They somehow worked on the problem which is bizarre to the problem is that if any If a normal algebra embeds into the C-star uniform algebra, I don't know what's the point of this question, but but the assumpt the assumption is that the so that's why that's why I I I guess that's why there are too many. Yeah, it is not why they have too many this problem to themselves and solved in this L1, L infinity of continuous L infinity. Does not match into this UQL. UQL. No, Jamaica. That does not point out. Actually, Ma Masa doesn't MASA cannot be said, says such and such. You call you final? Because if you don't have this condition, it can be arbitrary. Yes, be able to make So the remaining cases that's the type 1 final case, final type 1 control tables. Those are the normal tables like the main cases. On the labels. And uh for last following in Peerless Institute I I worked on this program because I was asked for my part. Same as asked for my parameters. And the solution was surprising, so answer was surprising. This does not embed into uniform actual any informal functions. But it embeds into UQL. To UQL if M contains expanders. So I explained later. Expanders most well-known construction to property A. Uh I I believe this actually empathy to here if I know that it does not have property A still I wasn't a good I wasn't thinking. So the polarized that the uh these are not the equal and the same thing for us for uniform, non-uniform plus the same. So there are there's all foreign affiliates in uh low closer but it's not approximately fine component. So, about proof of uh so why is somehow So why is somehow why somehow look so obvious? Not uh because everything is somehow made becomes larger and larger, you cannot find uh proper foundation matrix after So, about two for simplicity, M is M is a graph. Uh expand bus is a sequence of graphs, hybrid graphs and connecting. Such that any subset of X and H Xn grows some with at least 1.01 Yes so-called chivalron standard. I don't know which greater than one such that any Any n, any e subset x, n. So I view everything as just points, I guess, but with graph method points. Neighborhood insight, just everything happens in the single parameter. Neighborhood in the Xn of the E cardinality is a growth of is a close up at least h times e this doesn't happen if e is uh is whole x n because there's no room to grow uh so the here's condition is that uh so e is that t is allowed but anyway so At most half, right? This is the condition that so that for each finite graph, any finite graph there is a such Hn. Hn satisfying this, but this Hn is uniform with this computer. So, if there's a subset A in Xn it's one neighborhood grows, one times one, and they always exponentially grow until it reaches one half. And after this reaches to the one-half, it reduces the The remaining part reduces the exponential, decreases exponentially because it was easy with the same thing for the expression, the component. So this expand a graph with like COVID disease. That when some people have COVID disease, that's implicated disease grows exponentially until it hits some hair. Something and zinc exponentially exists. If there's A and B X Then the what is when do they meet this tensor when do they meet size of A? Size of A with respect to X, size of B with respect to X smaller one is at least one half of the H to the minus distance of one half. Of course, you you just iterate, iterate as many, iterate as many distance. As many iterate as this kind, iterate of this many kinds, and still they are disjoint, but both both, if you want to practice this, both have at least one half of If x n. Why this is good is that the if x n, the size of x n is much much larger than n than random project, of owner project, random random Oh, okay. P L has property that the has a property. Pn is a random projection on random and orthogonal projection Pn in EL2NCN. Restricted to some L2E with what E is going to xn. E is to xn but the size of f is less over xn is less than or equal to theta. This you have flip over this, you can easily estimate this. Random projection Pn satisfies ONE E with small small quagina here. It's how many octagons? Ten? Here's a little funnel like here, but it's still a random vector. Random vector means that it's a sphere of dimension, size of xn. It has almost the same structure. As almost the same as trap, almost the flat, vectors, random vectors are almost front. So that if you restrict it to L2P, the norms will look at the delta. And if you do the random scene, which are on some ratio of the number of delta is uniform as well in n? Delta is independent of any delta. Yeah, xn is equal to n they are independent of that. Yes. Estimate is independent of delta for any delta, yes. Until random projection has proved has proof what oh, random projection. So it's over So it's over I I omitted I omitted part that has a property with overfemmy probably but what is delta? I mean there is a universal delta somewhere at the start But then why block one over delta delta? Then you could call that for a constant. Oh, D delta C. Ah, sorry, B, that's right. That's right. So single vector squared delta, but they hit the as the main E. No, no, single, well, two, single reptiles of your cardinal view. Then the Things are Pn B over X two X N T N or that this is isomorphic transport of M n is cosine of U Q L M X And x if if xns are in x, that is if x contains in expanders, xn disjunct, then this happens. The reason is simple, that if A and B in Xn, so they are in these strengths, so I have shrinks in the same uh distances. Instances that there's a PN restricted way to A or P N restricted to A to B or this is small, yeah. Distances, if distance is large, then because of X. Is large, then because of the expanders, the size is small, and either A or B has small size, and in that case, not small, so that any of our small for simple reason. But if you cut from A and B, you cut from A and B. Yeah, the reason you use probabilities that uh also you need to do this in Because you need to do this in a oh I I just I just explained that this one is a single scale, single data, but you also need to have this property for all the scales, all small. But there will be some probabilistic argument. In particular uh I I was I in particular we proved the way that we proved that the disk is not the same as QL. QL but uh this proof doesn't give us any single example of operator which is you know does not have approximate finite propagation because the proof is probabilistic. I even don't know the proof of one this is also probabilistic. I even don't know this this Pnth uh is not in for GN. In particular, I don't I I have no idea how to check.
