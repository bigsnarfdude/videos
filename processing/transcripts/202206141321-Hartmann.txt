The organizers for inviting me and for giving me the opportunity to come here to this wonderful place and celebrate this wonderful occasion and speak in person. Of course, I was not going to let that opportunity go to waste to give a blackboard talk because I haven't done that in over two years. So hopefully it'll still, you know, I still know how to do it. Hopefully it's like riding a bicycle or something. So okay, so this is a subject that's maybe a little bit tangential to the rest of the workshop, but there are some algebraic groups related to this. To this, but certainly involves some of the things that many of you have been thinking about. It's motivated by a talk of Suresh that we heard about a year ago in the QFLAC seminar. And David and Danny and I finished this project just a couple of months ago, and it can be found on the archive. So let me start with a little bit of motivation, which is the period index problem. which is the period index problem and then the route so throughout this talk f will always be a field and I want to recall a couple of things that set some notation so this will be a barber so we're looking at center simple algebra Looking at center-simple algebras up to error equivalence. And if we have a field extension, then that's factorial. So I can take an element with the verger group f and I will denote an induced class by alpha sub in the variable b. And then the index of a class alpha is the smallest degree. of an extension E of F such that alpha is E is terminal. So that's called our splitting field, and we're saying E splits the class alpha, and the period of alpha is, of course, ordered in the bargain of F, which is a torsion of the other group. And so then there are two well-known facts. Namely, the first is that the period always Namely, the first is that the period always divides the index. And the second is that they have the same prime factors, and in particular, there exists some D such that the index of alpha divides the period of alpha to the D. And of course, this D will in general depend on the class alpha that you're looking at. And the period index problem now asks the following question, given Now ask the following question. Given F, does there exist a D such that this is bounded independently of alpha, so such that the index of alpha divides the period of alpha to the d for all alpha in the market with F. And of course, really. And of course, really, we don't just want to know that such a D exists, but preferably in the case when it does exist, we would also like to determine D. Okay, let me just remind you of a couple of known results. It's always nice to cite some people in the audience, right? So classically, it is known that the period of alpha equals the index of alpha, so that would be d equals 1 when f is a global field. So either a number field or a function field of a curve or ever a finite field. It's a result of Disoltman, 97, that if F is the function field of a chadic curve, and alpha is an element in the bar group such that the period is not divisible by P, so P is the residue characteristic here, then the index alpha divides the square. Divides the square of the p of all. And even though that isn't quite d equals 1 for everything, I'm just going to sort of think of this as d is equal to 1, sort of 2. So even though we're making this restriction on the period, you'll see that come up a lot more later in the talk. So we'll just consider that still the HD equal to. Then there's a result of De Jong. Then there's a result of De Jong in 2004 that says that f is a function field in two variables over a separably closed field K and again alpha is an element of the Brower group such that none Element of the Brahma group such that the factoristic of k does not divide the period of alpha, then again the index of alpha is equal to the period of alpha. So again, pass d equals 1. And if you're wondering why I didn't say function trial than one variable, I didn't look at that case, well then the variables would be trivial, and then d equals 0 would work. Okay, so. Okay, so the idea is that for most reasonable fields, such a D should exist, and it should somehow grow relatedly to the cohomological dimension of the field. And so in particular, if you take a one-merged function field over a field whose sort of bound you already know, then you were expecting to bound to go up by one. Or if you took a complete, discretely valued field with resident field, that field for which the bound you already know, you would also expect. The bottom you already know, you would also expect it to go up by one. Now, that's not always completely the case, but there's a result that goes a little bit in that direction. And this is something that Daniel David and I approved, and also Max Nieblick proved. And the numbers I'm giving aren't always the numbers because of the publication, so they're not always exactly numbers, always proven. And this is for what we call semi-global fields. That's the word that you already saw in the title. So, what is that? So, let me make that the definition. f is a one variable function field over a complete discretely valued field, capital K. And I also need its residue field. So its residue field is capital K. Fields locate the characteristic of this resume field log, which can be zero. And then, first of all, I need more space. We want to somehow relate, using this sort of general principle that I just phrased, we want to relate the bound for F. The bound for f, somehow using what we know about k and little k. And so what we also, what we actually need is the following. So suppose the following, that the index of alpha divides the period of alpha to the d minus 2 for all finite extensions L over K. And of course I should say all alpha in the bar group of this X. I'm not going to write that every time because that's going to get really long. And we also need that period alpha is not divisible by P. So let's call that star because I sort of terminate that a lot. Those will come and need up a lot. And suppose, moreover, so we know something about the residue field and its finite extensions. We also want to know something about one variable function fields over the residue field. And there, we'd expect the bound to be one bigger. So suppose we also know that. Again, an all-alpha in the bar group with star. Then we can get something about semiglobal fields. Then we know that the index of alpha divides the period of alpha to the D for all F semi-global overcap. Over capital, okay, and again, all alpha with the property that p does not divide the period of alpha. But we want to apply this kind of result inductively, and so we actually get something more. We also get that the index of alpha divides the period of alpha to the d minus 1 for all finite extensions, oh, not the left, L over capital K. And all other. And all alpha and the power group of L with star. So this is kind of a procedure that allows you to use this for sort of iterated fields that have built up in that sense. Okay, notice that this generalizes Saltman's result, which is still here, because this is a prime example of a semi-global field. But it also does other things. For example, you can get that if you take a function field. A function field over the complex numbers in one variable, and then you take a Laurent series field over that, and then you take a function field over that, then you get that p is equal to 2. And that's using De Young's result as input. Or you could play that same game with Saltman's result and say, well, I can take QP, double parentheses T, parenthesis X, and then move that D plus 3 using the theorem and solving this result. Okay, the proof that we gave of this used a local global principle for the Bar group. And that local global principle was for a certain collection of overfields of our semi-global field that come from what we call patching. But before we go there, and I tell you something about patching, let me tell you about the problem that we're considering in this talk and the results. So, what about higher formality? Well, so far, we haven't really seen any polymorphios, have we? Well, the burr group is H2 of F Gm, and if you have a class H. Gm, and if you have a class in here and it has period n, then it's in the n-torn part, and so we can view it as an element in H2 of F mu n. And so Cato suggested that we should look at generalizations of this in the following way. We can look at higher homology groups. But then we take the group of the nthrops of unity and we twist it as a Dalmat module. So this is i bigger than or equal to 2. And those are the cohomologic groups we're interested in. And we're going to focus on the case when n The case when n is a prime, and to remind you of that, I will start parting out. And now, if you, that makes this whole thing about the period a little bit easier, because if you now have a non-trivial element in there, then it's period, which is L. So I'm going to want to consider a generalization of the period index question, so I want to know. Question: So, I want to know how high in the degree do we have to go up to split this cohomology class, and how does that relate to the period of the class? So, first of all, I need to define what the index is of the class. And it turns out that the definition is a little bit more subtle. You have to actually take the G C D of all the degrees of splitting thetas. And then there's a lemma that you can prove. Recall that in the barber setting, we knew that the index and the period had the same prime factors, so if we wanted to see that here, we would need to know that the index is a higher of L, right? Because we already restricted to the case where the period is L. And that's indeed the case. And, well, how would you see that? So, let me not write it down because of time, but it's not difficult to see. So, what you do is you take a field F, you adjoin the root of unity, then you can forget about this twist here. And in particular, you might write tensor to the ith power, and then you know by the norm-residue isomorphism that everything is a sum of symbols. Is a sum of symbols. So it's coming from degree one chromology. And so you really just need to, for each sum n, you just need to split the first class and the cup product of n degree one cohomology classes. And you can just do that explicitly by taking a Lth root of something. So you join all of these to your field. Then you realize that what you get is a nice, the Gao group of the extension that you get is a nice L group. Of the extension that you get as a nice L group, and then you can use Galois theory to make that descend to an extension of S that flips the class that still has L power degree. And so you get rid of that ridge of unity that you adjoined. So now we can ask the same thing as before, which is the period index problem. So given F, L, and I as above, does there exist? Does there exist a D such that the period of alpha, that's the index of alpha divides L to the D for all alpha in HI of F mu L times L minus one. So that's the generalized theoretics problem. I think that's a good question. We thought about that for a while. We didn't really get out of that. I think, in general, if you need it, and we concluded that we didn't know how to get rid of it here. Okay. So not much is known about this, except when i is equal to 3. Then there are results of Paramala and Suresh and of Suresh. So it's known that the period is equal to the index when either f is a function field or the p-adic curve. Function field of a p-adic curve, f is the function field of a surface over a finite field, or f is the function field of a curve over an imaginary number field. That's the last result this user's rest that the talk was about that I mentioned at the beginning of my talk. And that kind of motivated this work. Okay, so we're going to consider this, of course, when we have techniques to work with this, namely when F is a semi-global theater. So that includes the case of a function field over a other field, but also, of course, so we consider this for F semi-complex. Oh, and by the way, what's the connection to other algebraic groups? Well, for some of those we have homological index. For some of those, we have homological index that take values and groups that look like this. For example, phi equals 3 or i equals 5. So a little bit of connection parallels. Okay, so recall that k was this underlying complete discretely valued field. Residue field, little k, and f, the semi-global field, is a finitely generated field over f. field over capital K with transcendent degree 1. So the talking field over K. And we're going to always, because I'm going to forget saying that later, assume that L is not equal to the characteristic of the residue field. So that's the same kind of restriction we've seen in all these other results, except for the classical ones, when there was some kind of residue characteristic involved. You always want to stay away from that. Okay, we call that for the Brown group, the Recall that for the Brauer group, that's the result I just erased, we needed to know something about the residue field and its finite extensions and its finitely generated extensions of transcendence degree at most one. So we want to somehow record this type of information. And so we're going to define the following. The stable splitting dimension. Of F is the following. So this is going to be the minimum over all the D, such that for all extensions of F that are finite, and for all homology classes over those extensions. Over those extensions, the index of any element, of these cohomology processes deviates L to the z. Now I'm cheating here a little bit because, of course, this actually depends on some of the parameters that we have. So it depends on i, the degree, right? And it also depends on the prime. The prime, but just because this is already a pretty ugly notation, I'm going to not write i or l when it's clear from context, and I'm going to only write it when it matters. And we're going to see that this result that we have for this, actually the bound that we get does not depend on L itself, but only on the parity of L, so only whether it's a 2 or an odd prime. And this I is only really going to come into play later. So here's the 0. Here on A. So with F and capital K and little K and everything, at most the stable splitting dimension of the residue field. So this looks at residue fields and finite extensions of it, the way I've defined it, plus the stable splitting dimension of non-variable function fields, because they're all finite extensions in this field, which are some parameter x. And then there's a correction term. is a correction term that is equal to 2 if L is odd, or 3 if L is 2. So we call this really kind of depending on this L is in here, I should write. Okay, so that's the result. And for the proof, we're going to first reduce to the case of unramified homology classes. And I'm going to keep that reduction very brief, but we're going to actually prove a But we're going to actually prove a slightly variant of the statement there. It turns out that you only need those correction terms to go from the general case to the I-ramified case. So I equals to correction terms? Okay, no. So for I equals to our results for the Barado restriction. So this is really something for I, Sumi, and Apple. Is it a primary previous that this number is finite? I mean that depends. Of course, we use this. I don't think it's IPA obvious that. Is it? I don't think it's obvious that it's fine. If you came up with some very strange fields, I don't think it needs to be fine. It just says, yeah. No, I don't think. I don't think so. But of course, we're going to apply this in cases where we know that this is fine. It follows from the proof. The question was, can can you see the result of proving this inequality just to say that this number is fine? To say that this handle is fine? That is a good question. We need to need the assumption of the residue field, but otherwise this assumption. We do need to assume the residue field. Yeah, I mean, we're assuming that this is these are finite, right? Otherwise this isn't the term, yes. Okay. Let me think about it. There's a little more Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to work with what we call a regular model of f over ok. So I'm going to call that x. So this is going to be a regular scheme, flat and projective, over ok and of relative dimension one and with function field x. So it's similar to what we saw in Igor's talk today, but Um eager star of today, but for the any slide, but for the diversity of groups. So then this has a closed fiber, which is the base change to the residue field. And so we can think of this curve, this model X somehow as a thickening of the closed fiber. So the closed fiber is not a projective curve over K. It might not be irreducible, but we can work with the geometry from there. Work with the geometry from there. And so, what is known is that for every discrete valuation v of our function field f, there exists a residue homomorphism that goes from the cohomological group that we're interested in and lowers the degree. And lowers the degree and goes to the residue field at that discrete valuation. And we're going to say alpha is unramified if it maps to zero. Unramified at V if it maps to zero under this del V. And we're going to look at specific discrete values. Specific discrete valuations, namely those that are diffusorial that are coming from codometric black points on our model. So we're going to say alpha is unramified on X if it maps to zero under, well, del V for all V Coming from codimension one points of this particular model next that we chose. And then what we're really proving is the following variant of the theorem, call that theorem A prime, that if alpha is a cohomology class, which is unramped, Which is unramified on some regular model at x, then the index of alpha divides L to the stable splitting dimension of k plus the stable splitting dimension of k plus 1. So that's kind of the statement over there, except you don't need the correction time. And that's really the theorem of proving. How do you reduce to this case? Well, the way you reduce to this case The way he reduced to this case is using a proposition due to Sorak Bazabi, which is really based on a strategy that was first used, I think, by Barut and then by many others, that allows you to go to a degree two or well, no, degree L square or L or eight extension and make the class on that one. So that reduction was fairly straightforward, given what other people had already done. But now I do have to tell you a little bit about these patches because that technique of patching that David and Danny and I have been using for a while. David and Danny and I have been using for a while comes into play here to prove this second version of theory. So, again, we're working with that regular model. And we also need a uniformizer of our complete discretely valued field. That is F. Value field that this F is a semi-click field over. And remember, we have a closed fiber. And I want you to think of this curve as a thickening of that teatic thickening of that closed fiber. So for example, if the fiber was P1, then I would just closed fiber was P1, okay? Then maybe the curve you take it as thickened is P1. Now we're going to take a look at the first one. Now we're going to take a finite set mod empty of points in a closed fiber, so that those are closed points containing all the singular points on the closed driver. And we're going to let you. And we're going to let U be the set of components of the component. So maybe in general my clothes forever didn't look that nice, but it looked kind of like this. And so then I want to take a finite number of points that at least contain these intersection points of irreducible components. And then I want to look at the set of components of the problem. Are you assuming that the X is proper? I was assuming it's projective. Yes. So I guess. So now for P and P, I can define a ring and a field associated to that. So the ring is just going to be the complete velocity ring of x and p. And fp is going to be the fraction field. And for u and u, and I can do this actually in fact for p and x, for any. For any p and x. And for u and u, I can look at our u hat, and that is going to be the t-adic completion of the set of functions that are regular along u and again f u with the expansion field. The expansion field. So, what have I really done? I've covered my closed fiber with affine opens and points. So, we're thinking of them as sort of big patches and little patches. And associated with that, on the whole curve, we have the spectra of these rings. These are kind of big and little patches on the curve. And we look at the fraction fields. That gives me a system of overfields of F, it's a finite system of overfields, finitely many. System of overfields, slightly many, and they actually give rise to an inverse system. So for each u repe, there's something bigger that they include into with inverse limit in the function field f itself. And that's not really going to be obvious here, but that's sort of what's behind something that's happening. And the nice thing is that the such these fields we proved in a paper that came out in 2015. In a paper that came out in 2015, a local global principle for these higher-degree cohorts. So with notation as above an i bigger than one, we have an h i well, okay. An HI well, okay. So I'm not going to write that. The induced map on the cohomology from F to the F u's and to the product of the F u's and the F P's is injective. But let me write it a bit more simply. Alpha in HI splits if and only if alpha F P and alpha F U split for all P and P. P and P, and I know U and U. So that's a local local. So I can check whether a class is split by checking it locally on these patches. And then I can give you a sketch of the proof of theorem A prime. And I will just give you the basic steps so you have a little bit of an idea. Basic steps, so you have a little bit of an idea of what goes into it. So, first of all, we were not stuck with this particular model. So, we can choose, well actually we are now stuck with the model because they're unramified for this theorem, but we're not stuck with the p and the if. We can enlarge p, the set of points that we're taking out. I mean, I'm forced to take these points, but I can add more. So we can choose p and u such that Such that the classes that we get over these fields FP and FU for all P and U are all what I, for the purpose of this talk, want to call integral so as to not introduce confusion with the unramified notion. What do I mean by that? They are in the image of The map from the cohomology over the associated way. So here. Psi can either be a P or a gift. So for FP, we can do this by a result of Sakagai tool. And for FU, it can be done by shrinking u. And that's okay because if I shrink U, I take away finally many, so I shrink it by taking away finally many points, and I just add them to the script text repeat. So the second step is. So the second step is I've got to get down to the close fiber, right? Because I have information there on the cohomologic classes. And now I can do that because I've reduced myself to classes that are integral in that sense. So what can I do for these integral classes? I'm going to relate my integral classes to classes over the respective resume fields. So I have to write a little less to stay within my time, but basically, what we're going to do is look at the case. Do is look at the case of R p-hat, for example. So I can now use Pupper Base change to reduce it to a class over the residue field. The residue field is a finite extension of my field little k. But I know the splitting behavior over finite extensions of little k because that was part of what I'm putting into the theorem. So I know that there's an extension of degree at most L to the stable splitting dimension of the little k. And because Rp hat is complete, Because Rp hat is complete, all these rings that I'm looking at are complete. I can lift that to an extension upstairs, to an italic extension, I can take, that turns out to be a domain, and I can take its fraction field, and I get an extension of F of the type that I want. So similarly, one can do this for the U's. There you have to use Gabber's analog of cover-base change. So, what we get Change. So, what we get from the residue field, and by lifting, using the completeness of these rings, we get extensions EP over FP of degree dividing L to the S B of K. And extensions DU over FU. Now, if you do that over the big patches, then the residue field that you get is actually the function field of that affine open on the closed fiber. And so there you're getting function fields over the field little k. So the degree that you're expecting there would be This one, right? And so that this split is alpha, right? So such that alpha is split over those, all of those. So step three then says I could use patching. Of course, I want to use my local movie principle, but right now I don't have an extra. But right now I don't have an extension of f. I only have these extensions of these patches. So, but you could actually use patching to globalize these extensions to some E over F, again of the appropriate degree. So now this will be a degree dividing the four. The full bound that I'm expecting. And such that this alpha splits over what happens if I tensor E up to any of the FPs or the FUs. But now what I can do is I can What I can do is, I can look at an associate curve to this field extension. So these are really patches on a new curve. Y maps to x, and there I can use the local logo principle. And that tells me that alpha sub E splits and finishes. And finishes the proof of the theorem they're correct. Okay, I really kind of owe you some applications, but I want to quickly say a generalization because that shows up in the applications of this. It'll make it easier to phrase. And this was um first considered for borrow classes by Gustami again. Kosaame again. And there we're looking at collections of our classes or homology classes. And we're asking, can we bound the index simultaneously for all of them? Now, of course, you can because we have a bound that's supposed to be for all classes. But what we mean is actually, can we bound the degree of a splitting field that is a common splitting field? So we're defining the index of this. On a subset, finite subset as the G C D over all the degrees of extensions that split alpha for all alpha and B. For all alpha and v. And then you can generalize this notion of the stable splitting dimension, and you can define the generalized stable splitting dimension. And yes, we should define the counter there's more splitting dimensions. We didn't come up with anything better. So it's the same thing that I had for the index of alpha, but now for the index of a collection of classes, which is defined in this way. And so the theorem B says, which is due to Bazami for I equals 2. Which is due to Rosami for i equals 2, that theorem A holds if you replace SSD by GSSD everywhere. So on the left-hand side, on the right-hand side of the inequality. And the nice thing about this is that this can be used inductively if you know a bound. A bound for collections of cohomology classes of degree I, then you can get a bound on cohomology classes and collections of cohomology classes of higher degree. Because you can again use the norm residue homomorphism to write things as cup products, and then you only split factors of those, sums of cup products, and then you only split factors of those. And if you can split them simultaneously, Simultaneously, for each sum nth, you can take that set B of the first factors of all the sum n's. And that's the same kind of strategy that you already saw earlier once. Okay, now applications. So we actually do get some numbers. So Actually, do get some numbers. So we can start up with any field, and then we can take over that iterated Lebron series field in, let's say, our variables. And then we can take a one-variable function field. over k sub r. And we want our prime to not equal the characters except this base field, k0. And so then there are two important cases where we can say something. So one is if k0 is of one variable function field over the complex numbers, ls on. The complex numbers, L is odd. Then you get, for example, for degree 3. Now remember, this is for collections of classes, so if you go from up there to other degrees, so this is at most. This will of course depend on this r, so how many variables I added as Lorentzier's variables, so you get a formula that looks like this. R squared plus r plus 2 over 2. 2 over 2. And the formula looks slightly different. If L is even, then it's R squared plus 3r plus 2 over 2. And we can go up higher in degree. Like I said, for these single classes of degree 3, things were already studied to some extent. But here, we can go higher. And we get, for example, r cubed minus r plus 2 over 2. This is for r. This is for R bigger than 1, so that this really makes sense. And so if you keep going and you increase these indices, then this slowly decreases. And it decreases to 0. It becomes 0 when i is bigger than or equal to r plus 3, because at that point you hit the cohomological dimension, and you just get 0. So this uses that we knew what the cohomological dimension of k0 is, of course, and also Of course, and also k0 of x. Two, if k0 is a global field, okay. Then let me just say what we get for the GSSZ, 3 of f. So here it depends on L, we get 2 plus r over 2 r plus 3, so this is if l is odd. If L is odd. And then we get two different cases for L even and no real places. And I'm not going to write down all the formulas so you can find them in the paper, but just to show you the distinctions that occur and real places. And let me just give you in this particular case sort of what the table looks like because it's kind of there's a nice pattern. So this is in terms of i and r. This is in terms of I and R, so we're going to start with 1, 2, 3, 4, 8. So we get 6, 15, sorry, 10, 15, 21. And then this kind of repeats along the diagonal in those off-diagonals. And here we get 3, and then here we get 0, as expected, and so forth. So you see, it has. Excellent. So you see a nice pattern in these generalized stable splitting dimensions. Thank you for your attention. Any questions? In your step three, you said that in order to globalize, you need to use patching. Yeah. Isn't that just kind of clusters level that you can approximate? Yes, so that's basically what we're using. Something like that. So we have one extension that. We have these, we have one extension that does, we have extensions for all the FPs, so all the points. These we can find a joint extension by basically using process lemma. You have to assume that the residue field is infinite and then you have to deal with the case when it isn't, because you need some kind of primitive Pelmin theorem or something like that, which for ital algebras, which only holds if you're over something infinite. And then we do the same thing over the FU's. We do the same thing over the FUs. We have an extension that works for all the U's, coming from these extensions that were for the individual use. And the way we piece them then together is we have to make them all be the same degree. So we have to take direct sums of copies, so at some step in between, you have to work with it algebras rather than fields. But the fact that then you can globalize this to something over F, we needed to use the patching. I'm fascinated by the. I'm I'm fascinated by the the difference between even and odd primes. Yes. And my first guess is wrong. It's not ha doesn't have to do with the whether you have the eighth root unity or the square root of minus one in your ground field. Because you have C there and you still have different behavior. So maybe offline you could tell me why two is different. Well the two was different because we needed in that very first step we needed to make a class identify it. Yeah, no, of course. Yeah, no, of course. Yeah. But why was it harder to make that class unramified? I think that is because of. Wait, no, the square root of minus one, we can deal, we can produce those cases. But wait, why is that case harder? I would have to look at Grosabi's paper again. I don't want to say something wrong. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Question: How many elements are in FB? And in F2, there are not enough elements. Well that's that's similar and you say you have to have if if the ground field has a certain size then you can get away with things. Okay, thank you. Thanks David. Other questions? Oh it's David's. Other questions? Yeah. So in this definition, it's trying to process it. Do you limit the size of V? No, V. No, B is finite, and then for each B we have, no, this is for any finite B. I guess I didn't finish writing out the definition because I, so I do apparently have a little bit less of a sense of how much I can fit into a 45-minute chalk board talk than I did two years ago. So, this was going to be, you know, for all the bytes L to the D, for all. L to the D for all P over F finite and all V in H I of E finite. So independent of B. And that's why you can use it to go up to a higher degree cohomology, because paper, you don't know if you write something as a sum of symbols, how many you're going to need. I mean, there are, in fact, some of the In fact, some of some of the some of the things that motivated this were actually looking at things like the symbol length and whatever. But in general, we don't know how big the set gets, just that it's finite. Obvious, but there is such a true finite number of classes. No, I don't think that's obvious in general. Other question we're getting it in some cases for the research fields, so yes. I wanted to ask, Julie, what's the, can you explain the appearance of the stable? You know, where does that come in? Where do you need the hypothesis that you need to really go over all kind of extensions? Okay, so that's because this is very similar to what happened. This is very similar to what happened when we looked at the case of the Bar group and did the local global principle there. And we, you know, the idea is if you're over a semi-global field, you use this patching to restrict to the patches, make it integral there, then restrict to the residue field. Now, if you have a point P, I erase this, if you have a point P, then the residue field will be a finite extension of your residue field of the complete discretely valued field that you started with. So now you need to know something about classes that live over that finite extension. And similarly, if That finite extension. And similarly, if for the big patches, you might end up with something that's a it's going to be a fun one variable function field over your field, little k, where we don't assume when we say that that little k is algebraically close in there. So it could actually be a function field over a finite extension like k. So that's where that comes in. Need that flexibility to make this kind of argument. Yeah, so it's, you know, it's I when I teach algebra, I teach my students. When I teach algebra, I teach my students the concept of greedy induction. If you put more in, you get more out. Sometimes something is easier to prove when you prove a tighter statement, because you can use induction. And this is kind of what that is. Any last question? All right, let's thank Julia. So the next talk starts at uh 220. Oh really? Yeah, just uh
