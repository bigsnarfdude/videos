So, this is an area we have been very interested and been working on for quite a number of years. And one of the motivations why we wanted to look at collective cell migration is that we know that this is actually very central to developmental biology and also how multicellular organisms maintain their structure and function. We also know that collective cell migration also involves a kind of very controlled and orchestrated. Of a very controlled and orchestrated movement of cells within physical and also traumatical constraints, especially within the human body. And we know that any deviation from such processes can result in pathological outcomes such as cancer and tumor formation and so on. And we believe that such a study can also lead to very novel biological insights as well as hopefully help us to come up with better strategies for tissue regeneration, repair, and also therapy. So if you look at single So, if you look at single versus collective sound migration, really single cells, you know, when they deposit on a substrate, it can just move anywhere as long as there are space. Whereas for collective sound migration, because there are cells adhering to each other, so the whole mechanics of the physics that involves collective sound migration is very different. Of course, we know that in collective sound, whether it's single or collective sound migrations, there are Migrations, they are being influenced by two main cues. One is biochemical cues, such as soluble ligands and substrate bound ligands. But the other one, which is very interested in, is the physical cues. And this can include micro and nanotopography, physical confinement, and even substrate elasticity. For this part of the work, I'll be mainly covering more of the physical and geometrical constraints. Constraints. So, this actually, this slide is very busy, but it represents a body of work that we've been doing here at MBI in Singapore, involving not only collective sound migration within physical constraint, but also we are looking at how cells would, for example, develop apatia breach. And this has a relevance to wound healing as well as wound. To wound healing as well as wound closure, and we've also been looking at diseases such as cancer. So, over here, I will cover or give a snapshot of a number of studies we've done. One due to geometrical constraints, the other one is the epithelial bridge formation by teratinocytes, as well as how we can use active pneumatics to study, for example, tissue homeostasis. So, looking at collective migration of curved surfaces and also our carbon. Of curl surfaces, and also I will cover a little bit on the 2D sound micro 2D sound migration of cancer cells. So, the first point I'm going to cover is regard to how cells would collectively migrate arising from geometrical constraints. And the reason why we wanted to study this is when we first were looking at this problem, we understand that several of the physiological processes do exist with cells migrating in very confined patterns and space. In very confined patterns of space, and you can see that within the human body, for example, this confinement, for example, in the intestinal villi, how cells will actually migrate up villi structure and also in other organs. And so we want to understand how such confined space will significantly alter the migratory behavior of cells. So in this part of the work, we came up with a very simple experiment or metaphysical. Experiment or methodology involves micro contact printing of fibronecting patterns. So, if you look at this, we use a PMS stamp and then stamp fibronecting on the surface of a petri dish. And so, we are able to stamp strips from 20 microns to about a few hundred microns. And what we do first is that after stamping the PDMS, so after using the PDMS stamp to stamp the fibronectins on the surface. The fibronectins on the surface, we coat the rest of the outer surface with puronic acid to make sure that the cells will stay within the fibronectin patterns. So first what we do is we use a PDMS block to prevent the cells from going into fibronectin strips. We have a at the bottom where we have a PDF, where we have a fibronecting stamp pattern where we allow the cells to sit to full confluence and then we'll remove the PDF. Confluence, and then we'll remove the PDMS block, and then we'll see how the cells will migrate upwards along the fibronectin strips. So, this is a movie to show how the cells migrate upwards. So, the width varies from 20 microns to about 400 microns. And this is how the, for this case, we use MBCK cells, how they will actually migrate upwards. Of course, when we take a closer look at how the cells migrate upwards, interesting. Migrate outwards. Interestingly, we do see actually a swelling motion of the cells within the strip itself. So, this is 400 microns, and then this is 120 microns. So, as the wave of the strip gets narrower, we see less and less of the swirling motion. And for 20 microns, basically the cells move vertically upwards. So, the swirling motion has about a diameter of 150 microns, and we will see subsequently more direct. We see subsequently more directed and coordinated movements in the narrower channels. So, using PIV or particle image velocometry, we wanted to see if we can observe how actually sound moves. So, if you look at the PIV plots, indeed, we see there's this whirling motion for 500 microns and then less so for the 100 microns and 20 microns, the cells are literally just moving straight upwards. Straight upwards. So we wanted to understand what created this whirling motion, and we suspect that this has to do with actomycin contractility. So we decided to treat it with blipostatin to inhibit actomycin contractility. And interestingly, when we did that, you can see that the cell just basically move upwards where there's no swirling motion. So if you look at the again using PIV analysis, Using PIV analysis, basically, you can see that there's no more solid motion. If you look at the individual small red arrows, they're just all pointing upwards. And this is the PIV plots. So interestingly, ectomylcin contract AT actually, when it inhibited, it will prevent this swelling motion as was observed earlier on in the NDCK cells. So what is part of the work, what we observe is that the overall velocity of the collective cell. Of the collective cell migration front will be affected by vortex-like movement. And this vortex-like movement is being influenced by two factors. One is the intercellular addition, the other one is the actomousing contraction. So after that, we started to test Hackett cells, which is a kind of keratinos, it's a human epidermal carotinosis. It's also epithelial cells. So initially, when we, as I've shown earlier, As I've shown earlier on, when we plated the MBCK cells and allowed the cells to move up the scripts, you can see the cells will just move upwards. And then, because the sites are coated with pronic acids, the cells don't move to the sites. But when we started to try hacker cells, we found that actually it behaved very differently. It started to pull a cell sheet over the puronic acid surface. And we thought this is a very interesting behavior that warrants further study. Further study. And so this leads us to what we call the epithelial bridge formation. And we want to understand this epithelial bridge, how they maintain its tissue integrity during this collective cell migration. So again, the experimental method is very simple. We stamp 10 micron fibronectin strips with spacing about 120 microns apart. And then first we use. Apart and then first we use a PMS block to cover the fibronic strips, allow the cell sit the hacker cells to full confluence, and then remove the PMS block and then allow the cell to move forward. And this is where we observe that there is the cell sheet that's being formed. We should call the epideau bridge or EB. So to convince ourselves that this EB is not adhered to the surface, we created another microstructure which is Microstructure, which is a raised platform, and allowed the cell to move forward. So, as the cell started to migrate forwards along the streets, we actually freezed it and then we used scanning electron microscopy to observe this EV formation. And indeed, if we were to look sideways, we found that actually there is the epitome bridge has been formed and it's not actually. And it's not actually adhere to the bottom surface. So, this helped to convince ourselves that this epithelial bridge formation leads to, or rather this hecarotinocytes are able to form this EB, and these EB are actually suspended. They are not actually adhered to the surface of the substrate. So, we studied further this EB formation, and we were looking at also the adherent junctions and the cortical. And the cortical actins, and so on. And we found that for this EB formation, especially on the front part, there is actually this thick bundle of actin that transverse several transverse multiple cells. And this actually allows also the pulling of the whole cell sheet forward as the cells are suspended between the two fibronectin strips. Then we wanted to see. Then we wanted to see whether there's this huge tension that arises within the cell sheet. First, we treat it with one nanomolar calcium and then 20 nanomolar calcium. So one is we treat it with a very small, low amount of calcium. It doesn't really affect the cell adhesion. So when we add calicolin A, which is to increase the tension, we don't see anything happening. Anything happening to this suspended cell sheet. However, when we increase the calcium treatment, we actually kind of weaken the interceluration. And then by adding calicolin A to increase tension, this is what happened. You can see the rapid disintegration of this epithelial bridge. So once we treat it, the whole epithelial bridge just disintegrated. That shows that actually there's a huge amount of tension that exists in the E-board. Amount of tension that exists in the EB itself. We also did PIV as well to kind of characterize the tissue fluidity within the cell sheet. So one is for MD-CK cells, one is for carotinocytes. What we have observed is using PIV, we found that within the MD-CK cells, there are a lot of cell cell rearrangement happening within the cell, whereas there's less so for the carotenocytes. Less so for the carotenocytes. So, we believe that for carotenocytes, there are a lot stronger cell cell adhesion, intercellular adhesion as compared to NBCK cells, which explains why for the MBCK cell, when you flow them into the flavonecting strips, they appear like no water. It seems like very fluid. It just flows in into the respective flavonecting strips. Well, for hacker cell itself, because of the stronger intercellular exhibition, they are able to actually form this. They are able to actually form this suspended cell sheet. So, for this part of the work, we wanted to see the relevance of the keratinocytes and the formation of EB. And we know that in skin itself, keratinocytes actually constitute about 90% of the cells in the epidermis, which is actually the outer layer of the skin. And that I think can explain why, at the outer layer of the skin, there is this existence of this keratinocytes as we And the reason is because we need such strong cell adhesion between the carotenoid sites to be able to maintain its tissue integrity as it covers the outer layer of the skin. And of course, for this case, also, if you look at wound healing in particular, there are actually very sporadic existence of ECM here. And there, so when the cell starts to heal. Cell starts to heal, or when the wound starts to heal and the carotinos starts to close up, it will still be able to form these suspended cell sheets, despite the fact that there may be areas where there are ECMs or where their structure is such that it's not uniform and the cells has to still be able to close up. So, I think there is a role as to what keratinocytes can play at this outer layer of the skin. So, for this part of the work, the So, for this part of the work, the strength of interstellarization is actually a very crucial regulator of EB formation. So, as you can see, the NDCK has weaker interstellar contact, so that results in a lot of cell cell rearrangement. That means a lot of shearing, a lot of sliding, and that leads to more tissue fluidity and also energy dissipation. And that inhibits the EB formation. But also, for keratinocytes, we observe that there's actually strong reject intercellular adhesion, and that prevents this cell cell rearrangement. Cell cell rearrangement, and which then leads to the abundance of tension within the EBs. We also did some very interesting experiments where we literally created a hole as shown here and then allowed to see whether the carotenoid sets are able to close. So, if you look at this movie here, we can see that carotene sites are able to close up. For this case, we wanted to understand what is the mechanism at which the hole is able to close up. So, if you look at Able to close up. So, if you look at the stained image here, we can see there's a strong acting belt that exists around this hole over here. If you look at the side view, also, we can see there's a strong staining of the acting belt. So, it acts like a purse string, you know, where the acting belts will start to actually contract and then start to close up the hole. So, this is for 150 microns. So, you can see here the hole is represented by this red circular line here. Line here, this acting pulse string mechanism enables through this acting belt enables the wound to be able to close up. But what we observe is that beyond 150 microns, then there isn't this ability for the hole to be able to close up, as the amount of force needed was not strong enough to enable the wound to close. So, this is the part with regard to wound healing. With regard to wound healing, the next part I want to cover is actually regarding topological defects and epithelio and how that governs self-death and attrition. This is actually done by Duan Bing. So Duan Bing, I'm not sure whether he's in the meeting. Duan Bing is right now actually assistant professor at the Westlake University in Hangzhou. So this is actually, we do know that for, you know, to maintain homeostasis, statue homeostasis, there's the need to. Ditio homostasis, there's the need to clear dead cells on epithelium. And so, this cell extrusion also can act as a scouting tool for morphogenesis and also development biology. And we do know actually if there's a failure to extrude, that may actually lead to tumor formation and hence cancer. So, in this part of the work, what we're trying to do is to see if we can actually use epithelial cells or if we can see Or if we can see, we can use active lemetic agents to model epitilla cells. We do know that in liquid crystals, there is existence of two states. One is the liquid and the other is a solid state. And so a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but they may orient it in a way that is like a crystal-like, you know, in the way the cells are arranged. So for this case, So, for this case, we wanted to see if we can model epithelium as an extent cell active pneumatics, which each cell acts as an active pneumatic agent. So with that, our hypothesis is that in epithelial or in liquid crystal nematics, there's this thing called topological defects. And what we hypothesize is that topological defects in the form of cell misalignment in epithelial will govern cell death. In epithelia, will govern cell death and extrusion. So, let me show you what we mean by this. So, when we were looking at epithelium, we assume that each cell acts as like an actinematics. And when we look at the flow of the cells and through the formation of the cells, we do see that actually there's a formation of two, what we call topological defects. So, one is what we call plastic. So, one is what we call plus health defect, and second is the minus health defect. So, plus health defects appear like a comet shape, and minus heart effects are a triangular shape. And if we look at the cell cell as they move, we do observe that at different locations, they do form into this plus heart defect pattern and minus health defect pattern. So, this is a close-up to show you the plus heart defect. So, when we were looking at the movement of the We were looking at the movement of the cells, and we find that actually there is this plus half defect that's formed. And interestingly, it's at this point of the top of this plus half defect where we see cell getting extruded. We don't see that in the minus half defect. So what we have observed is that at this topological defect of blood defect, there is actually cell undergoing apotopsis and thereafter exclusion. Autopsysis and thereafter extrusion. And so we try and understand why there is extrusion. And when we use attraction force microscopy, we do observe that the blast out defect at the top do generate a very high compressive stress. And this high compressive stress actually induce apotopsis and thereafter extrusion. And so this is the result. Whereas for minus half the effect, we don't really see this compressive stress. It's more of the tensile stress that's been asserted. Stress that's been asserted. So, we also did an interesting experiment where we created this star shape and at this four protrusion features, we tried to force a plus half defect here. So, if you look at this versus a circular shape, we do see a lot more extrusion occurring at this four at the four points of the star. And the reason is because at that location, Because at that location, this is where we cause the cell to form into a plus artifact, and that's where the cell gets extruded. So, this is a movie to show what's happening. If you look at the circle, the plus artifact is everywhere, but at the star shape here, the plus artifact is mainly concentrated at the four-pointed shapes of the star, the four points of the star. So, for this part of the work, For this part of the work, what we have observed is that epidemium is not an ideal material, and we try to use liquid crystal to model it. And we do see that actually there are defects in terms of how the cell aligns themselves. And these defects can result in weak points, especially for the plastic defect, which have high compressive stress. And this then generates cell death and then extrusion. So, the next part I wanted to cover quickly is actually more. Cover quickly is actually more on the breast cancer cells. So, for this case, we were looking at MCF7, which is a non-metastatic cancer cell, and NDA MB231 cell, which is a highly invasive cell. So, MCF10 is the non-cancer breast cells. So, first, we did a collective cell migration study. And if you look at the different colors, the color denotes cells that are neighbor to each other. They are neighbor to each other, so it's a cluster of the cells. And when we look at MCF10A, the non-cancer breast cancer cells, they do actually migrate collectively as a cohort, individual cohorts. For MCF7 cells, it's very interesting. You can see that actually the cells don't migrate as far as the MCF10A, and they appear to migrate in a very torturous manner. Whereas for MDA, MB231 cells, when they started to migrate, they started to become very masculine. Migrate, they started to become very masculine, they started to become very individualistic and they started to crisscross each other. The cell started to detach from each other and start to migrate very fast forward. So, to understand what's happening here, we take a closer look at what is happening in the cell cohort. So, for MCL10A, we do see a strong intercellular adhesion and also a unidirectional amipoliar polarization. Directional amipoliopolarization. Whereas for MCF7, you can see that the cells are more weakly attached to each other as compared to MCF7, and they don't move as far forward as compared to MCF10A. Whereas MDA231, you can see the cells started to lose their intercellular adhesion. And there's this multi-directional amipolar polarization that causes cells to move in all kinds of direction. We also track and see the length. Track and see the length, the amount of distance traveled by the cells. So MCL10A and 231 cells are the ones they move the furthest, whereas for MCF7, they don't move far at all, which explains why it's actually considered as a non-metastatic cancer cells. However, if you observe what is happening for, for example, MCF7, you can see that if you plot a chemograph, MCF10A again will move. MCF 10A again will move fast, move forward with time, whilst MCF7, they hardly move forward at all with time. And for 231, they move much more faster than 10A and 7. So the distance move with time is actually much more faster. So with this, we then started to look at the Lami Port formation. And indeed, for MCR-10, there's a Uh, MCR10A, they have there's a unidirectional amypodial formation, and so this and also strong intercellular adhesion, and that causes the cells to move forward. Whereas for MCS7, it has defective laminar pods. So the cells can move up, down, left, right, and so on. So in the end, it doesn't really go anywhere. And that is because of this defective lamino formation, pulling the cell in all directions, and hence that. And hence, there is no one unidirection the cell is moving. Whereas for 2,3,1, there's this multi-directional lamp formation, and that this is due to the weak and absent intercellular emission and contact inhibition. So the cell then are able to individually actually move forward much more faster and further. So, this is the part of the cancer work. Actually, the next stage of work now we're looking at is more collective sound migration bot on curved surfaces, and this is. And this is actually necessary because actually a lot of work has been done on flat surfaces. But if you look at the human body, basically they are all comprised of curved surfaces. So one of the first work we did was looking at cells migrating in a tube, in a tunnel as shown here. We created this channel of different diameters and allowed the cell to go into and flow within the channel itself. So we created channels of diameter 25 microns to about 250 microns and we allowed the cell to flow in and this is what happens when the cell migrate inwards. So what you're seeing now are stained nucleus and these are real cells moving inside the channel itself. So in the circular channel for 24 microns we can see that the cell moves rather slowly and because this And because each cell is about maybe 15 to 20 microns in size, so they occupy almost the whole of the channel. Whereas for 75 microns and 150 microns, you can see that actually the cell move in a kind of a helical motion as it negotiates its way through the internal inside the circular channel. We also did a fair bit of tracking the cells migrating in 3D was actually quite challenging because it's Was actually quite challenging because it's curved surfaces. So, using convocal microscopy and then after image processing, we tried to convert the 3D movie into 2D so that we can kind of track and do a PIV analysis of the 3D cell migration moving forward. And what we have observed is that for this case, again, using looking at chemograph, we observed that 25 microns of cells will move much more slower. will move much more slower compared to 50 micro compared to 100 micron diameter channel and 250 micron channel. So one of the reasons because of 25 microns, as I mentioned, the cells are around about the same size, so it doesn't really move much faster than it should. But however, interestingly, if you look at the 25 microns, this is actually the cell front. You can see the cell front, the cells occupy almost the whole channel, but as it might. The whole channel, but as it migrates forward, it forms a lumen at the back. So, this lumen is enclosed by a particular cell sheet forming into microtubes, even if the diameter of the tube is almost one cell length. So, this is one very interesting phenomenon that we observe. Of course, moving forward, we're trying to also look at cells migrating on different surfaces. For example, this is one For example, this is one surface that we look at where it's waviness of positive and negative curvatures and trying to look at how cells will migrate forward on such curved surfaces. We also did some work on almost spherical surfaces and looking at how cells will migrate up such a spherical surfaces as well. And we were trying to observe also both negative and positive curvatures. And the other work actually we're very interested in is looking at Actually, we're very interested in is looking at cells moving up in the life structure like this. So, again, we are trying to see how cells will migrate upwards. And this work is quite interesting because we were also trying to understand how cells will migrate upward up the intestinal village structure. And this kind of closely also relates to some of the organ-on-chip work that we're doing. Recently, we've been developing GAA-on-CHIP and trying to also use some of the results to help us better understand how cells form such intensity. How cells form such intestinal village structure. So, with that, I just want to end by summarizing some of the work that I've presented. I think there's importance in studying collective cell migration because based on what we have studied, we not only better understand how cells orchestrate their movement, both in terms of development and also maintenance of tissue, but we also obtain quite interesting insights to how certain diseases such as cancer can affect collective. Can affect collective sound migration or disrupt cell migration. And the other one is: I think we have a better understanding of this collective sound migration that actually can help us develop better strategies for tissue engineering, regeneration, repair, and even therapy. So with that, I just want to thank my postdocs and students who are the ones doing most of the work. The work that I presented are done by the people who are highlighted in red over here.
