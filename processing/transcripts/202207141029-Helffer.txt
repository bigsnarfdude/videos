I'm not sure I can give a talk today because this is the 14th of July. This is the celebration of the French Revolution. Anyway, I will try to do my best. So I will speak about a work with Johannes Justron, which started in 2000. which starts in twenty ten, but we have recently uh uh given improvement. And then if I have time at the end I will speak a little to what we are trying to do now together with Justin and Viola, Joe Valla. Okay, so the I'm not expert in semi-group theory, so but the starting So, but the starting point is what everybody knows about semi-group theory, the elementary semi-group theory. And so this was already mentioned in the previous talk. And the question is to relate the norm of the semi-group. So it's a C0 semigroup. A sem group. The norm is from L2 to L2, like in the previous talk, and to relate this with information about the resonance. So it's quite close to what we have in the previous talk. And so the maybe the so here are the ingredients, the usual ingredient in semi-group theory. So you have this. You have this kind of general properties for the C0 semi-group. There exists M, the and this property with some M and some omega naught. You have the, in case it's well defined, you have the relation between the semi-group and the resolvent and this kind of general properties. Now the starting The starting point is the so-called Gerard, Chris, Juan, Reiner, and maybe many other names, which relate the information that you have on the spectrum, on the reservant, for some domain in the complex plane, to the decay, some decay estimate over the associated seminut. And so my point here is to here is to analyze more specifically the the the property A implies B and I will try to to analyze this property in a more precise way so the if you are in the abstract semi-group theory you can be satisfied with this kind of theorem if you want to apply this kind of This kind of failure to concrete situations like semi-classical analysis or other contexts where parameters are involved, what you want to control is the constant with respect to the parameters and with respect to the object. So it's not enough to have an abstract here and there exists a constant. So you want to have an explicit way to To determine the constants involved in your problem. And so, this involves, of course, the estimate that you have on the resonant, which should be controlled with respect to the parameters, but also the constant appearing when looking to the link between this relevant estimate and the symbol. This is the the object of the talk. So, I will not be uh I will not say more. Let me not say more, much more than that on the proof. The proof is the standard proof using this equation. We have a second term on the right. And the trick is to use this in exponentially weighted space. And then you see you can use the Laplace transform. Laplace transform, and you relate in this way the information that you will have on the spectrum of the reservant with in order to get estimates relating U and W. Okay, so the general kind of statement that we want to do, that we want to obtain is that we start from some information about the normal. Information about the norm of S of T. So the most simple information would be that M of T equals 1 in the accretive situation. And then we want to find the new M tilde measuring the decay using the information that we have on the result. The idea we had at the beginning was that, okay, we will do Beginning was that okay, we will do that, and then we start again from m tilde and try to see what we get by repeating the procedure. So if I have time, we'll see that in some sense this part fails because the result we will obtain is so optimal that if you iterate the result, you don't improve by iteration. But there are other ways to iterate the process. Ways to iterate the procedure, but so this was initially the idea. Okay, so you have different objects relative to the reservoir concerning the domain for which you know that the reservant exists. And the VASIC object is here. One uh air oh oh my god, yes, I have Oh my god, yes, I have it there. This is this quantity. And in many under rather weak assumptions, you can see that the basic thing is what you get on real part of the equal omega. Because this kind of function is asthmonic, is a subharmonic function, and so usually what is important is the estimate at the boundary point distribution. Okay and then so here is the first theorem we get 10 years ago or more than that so you start from this assumption. So I assume the general assumption of this Greiner and quote not quote founder theorem and I assume that for some of And I assume that for some omega in R, I have L of omega strictly positive. And then how do I transfer this information as this one? This is very explicit. I get S of t, so I get the decay which is expected for the semi-group, but I get here a very explicit uh control. Control. Okay, so the norm chapier real in the weighted space L2 space with the weight what is A and B model are A and B are the same number and the information is down to a T larger than the sum. So, usually we take A equals B and T larger than T. Is it omega a constant? Omega is a constant, right? What omega is a constant? Yes, omega is an element. So I have the information about the resonant in the domain. Let's see what's going on. Are you weighted space? You will see these are not this weighted space. I was mentioning in the Laplace console. I will mention. I will mention very shortly this later. Okay. Sorry, I'm going in the wrong direction. Okay. So maybe four years ago we were aware of this result by Dong Yi Dei, which giving accredit This is a very simple estimate. S of t is less or equal to exponential minus a of naught. So this is the case omega equals zero, t plus pi over two. And the proof was mentioning was it according to this author was in Was inspired by our cook. And so it was natural to see. So he's doing that. So is it, can we do the same with more generality? That is, to have the kind of theorem I just write before for having more generality. And so this sorry, yeah. Okay, I will do well. Sorry, yeah. Okay, I will work. I prefer to work on it. Okay. And so uh s so the idea here is to come back to the initial proof we gave and to try to to look at the most general approach we can have and then to try to recover all the statements from a unique estimate. And here you will meet the right The right widthed spaces that I was mentioning. So we start from general function phi, which are piecewise C1 and satisfying this condition, and psi with the same condition. And so the point is that the Laplace method gives this kind of estimate. So here you have air of omega square phi square minus phi prime squared, the negative part to the power one half and here the same quantity with psi and on the denominator you have a specific integral where you see here large and maximum. Initially we can take epsilon 1, epsilon 2, well plus or minus 1 that theta p. Well, plus or minus one, but it appears that the most clever way to do that is to choose plus and minus. Okay, so you have this estimate. You can think, so it's not very helpful to have this kind of generality, but now I I uh we look uh at which kind of phi pair phi psi we can choose in order to We can choose in order to have interesting results. And I will, for this example, I will not give the file inside. This was in a case, it was inspired by the day proof. But here is the theorem of 10, which is a little improvement of the first one. The improvement is this multiplicative. Is this multiplicative term, exponential minus L of omega T minus A minus B. And this is a real improvement in comparison with the first theorem I gave you. And it's more in the spirit of Ways theorem, because in Vayes theorem you have minus L T. Now you can ask You can ask if you recover they fear by this statement. So you take the idea of V is, at least the idea we found in V, because it was not explicitly said that, is that you optimize over A for a given T. And if you do that, we get this estimate. That's from this theorem of the previous slide, and we And we get this is okay. So we get 2A and they get exponential pi-w. So it's not completely satisfactory. That means that at this stage we don't have a recovery effectively. We have to be more clever to get value. Okay. Okay. So here is what we get by a clever choice of the capital phi and capital Psi. And here what you get is an estimate involving some u and some theta, and then you optimize over all the pair u and theta, and this gives you this. And theta, and this gives you this fair. So that means that for this quantity, you optimize over the u, which satisfies u of 0 equals 0, u of a equals 1. And at the denominator, you optimize over the theta such that theta will be equal 1, and the modulus theta prime is less than theta. Okay? And then so, for specific choice of few theta, you can get the previous statement that I wrote. But what you meet here, if you want to continue by analyzing the statement, is look at these two quantities. And so. And so it's a variational problem of you, over paper. It appears that in some sense the two problems are dual of each other. So if you understand the first one, you have a rather direct way to understand the other one. Okay? So if you try to look at the first one, if you forget the plots. Forget the plots which appear here, by making the variation in u, you get very natural, very naturally the operator k minus 1 over m square ds composed m square ds minus 1. So in the case m equal 1, this is a very simple operator. This is this is just minus ds square minus and so on. And now, when looking at the minimization procedure, what you get is Neumann at zero and at A. This is the Robin condition. That means that if you want to optimize the quantity I have written, you have to simply analyze this kind of operation. And when you do this with m equal 1, you get the quantity. m equal 1, you get the constant obtained by there. But here, I can do it in more general. Actually, the main object of interest is this A star. And this A star is the... So when with A small, the quantities, this Lambda Dirty Cleroba problem, the quantity is positive. And then it's the K. And then it's decaying when A increase, and so we are looking for the first value for which it's zero. This is the A star. And we'll see how A star appears later in this treatment. Now, another interesting point, which is very important in the detailed proof about the optimality, is that if you have the solution of the DV clay. The solution of the Dirichlet-Robam problem, the ground state, u0, if you look to u0 prime over u0, we satisfy the Riccati equation with respect to the parameter mu equal m prime over m. So when m equals 1, this is 0. But we can do this in more generality. Okay? And then here is the statement you get. And then here is the statement you get by optimization. Exponential TS has this form. And then if you choose A equals B equals A star, then you get this estimate. And in a particular case of V, this is very fair. So we have a general statement for any weight. Any weight M using the infraction. So here I have to for simplicity I have chosen omega equals zero and omega equals one, but by changing dilation and so on we can treat the generics. Okay, so in some sense we are satisfied because we have found a theorem which contains V and all the absolute. The other all the other estimates we had before. Okay, I think. Yes, I just say one word about the choice of phi in psi. You see that, and this was inspired by the construction of V. So phi appears as on zero A exponential A, U, the U which appears in the the U which appears in the laminization procedure. Then between A and T minus B we take phi of s, so the quantity phi prime square minus phi s square equals zero. And then we continue on t minus b t by taking another function with a theta as paragraph as a function. And then this is in this way that we get the estimate for any pair u and theta, and then we try to optimize over u and theta. We went beta. Okay, so more recently, because we were turning around this idea to if we iterate, can we obtain a better estimate, we have the simple question in Vay's theorem, can we improve the constant? We have exponential minus TA of zero multiplied. 0 multiply by exponential pi over 2. By improving the constant, I mean replace exponential pi over 2 by a smaller constant. Of course, in the y estimate, the estimate is interesting for t larger than larger than pi or to p because before the the information that it's The information that it's accretive gives you one. And so the idea then here was to try examples, then to show to see if in specific case where we are able to do explicit computation, what is the comparison between this explicit computation and vice-fair metal? So, this is not the first operator we tried, but in the list of the interesting operators that you find when you try to present spectral theory for a non-set agent operator, for example, in the book of Trefeten Marie, I take it also in my book as an introduction to spectral theory. To spectrum theory, you have this very simple operator, which is the differentiated operator, d over the it, but with one condition, the DDCLEC condition at one. And so what so in this specific case, we can compute everything and we can compare with the vice theory. Okay, so to So to compute r of zero, you have simply to look to a star a and to look to the so to the square root of the lowest eigenvalue of a star a. So everything is related to C and you will find this pi over two which appears exactly in the right sphere. Now so concerning so Concerning, so concerning the signals, you have an explicit formula, but in this way it's not so easy to have the optimal norm. So it's better to look at a star. Okay, and let's see. Yes, the second computation is to look at what is exponential. To look at what is exponential TA. And what you get is that for T is strictly larger than 1, exponential TA is 0. But 3 less than 1, by choosing a suitable U, you will find that the norm is 1. And so in this way, you see that you cannot improve in the general context this way is fair. This is optimal. So this means that in some sense, So this means that in some sense uh we have not lost so much in in our fair. We are very we are close to optimality. Uh two years ago we were thinking that we are close to optimality inside the metal, but with this example we see we are we are optimal with the formulation of the decay, of course. So I will finish by Okay, oh yes, I would like I want to just to mention a theorem which is also which also appears in Refetena MBRI about just this condition that exponential to A equals zero and you have this kind of theorem in the book and of course what as a remark you can you can use for example the theorem The first theorem I wrote to get easily this. It's not surprising because if you look to the proof in Trafitin Mbrid, it's used by Planchrel or other things, Lafreyman Minder. So the same ingredients are present in the proof. Okay, so it remains two minutes, zero minutes. Okay, so can we improve by iteration? As I already mentioned, As I already mentioned, if you iterate with the same information, the theorem is sufficiently optimal. You don't get any... But now, like in the previous statement, if you have information related to different L of zero or for a sequence of L of omega, you can apply the theorem for each omega, and then you can For each omega. And then you can try to. The hope is that by combining the information that you have a different omega, that you can improve. Of course, if you apply the theorem to my example, my d over dx, what do I get? I get the decay exponential minus error. It's far to be optimal because t large, identically zero. And so the reason is that we are only using from... The result is that we have only used information on the result the resolution for omega equals zero. So if we can play with different values of omega, we will. So this is the hope. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Are there any questions, comments? So this is, I understand, well, very general results. And there is a large class of cell groups which come with heat kernel. How does the heat kernel simulate fitted here? For instance, is there any hope to have LP version of the current? I think it's so it's difficult because you use f a profile. profile. It's uh really L two uh plays an important role. It's not an important role. As I say I'm not expert in all the the literature on semi-groups. But I think it's an L2 fair. Further question online online participants. Let's find the speaker again. Is it okay? So let's find the speaker again.
