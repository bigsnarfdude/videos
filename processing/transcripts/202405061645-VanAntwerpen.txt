So, just to be on the same pic on the same notation, a set theoretic solution is for me just a double XR, where AR is our map from X times X to X times X. That satisfies the break relation, which of course can be also briefly abbreviated in this picture. And maybe important, the notation I use for R x of y is lambda x of y and color y of x. Laminates of curl wire plates. There are a lot of set theoretic solutions, so we look at some important subclasses. For instance, you call them left, respectively, right, non-degenerate, if these lambda x's, so the maps on the first component are bijected, or respectively row-wise, the maps on the second component. Non-degenerate if it's both left and right-non-degenerate. And now you can talk about involitive if R squared is the identity, bijective if R is the bijective, idempotent, whatever you like. Whatever you like. Some examples include twist solutions, or solutions coming from Lubashenko. So, where you just take two maps that commute and you build them as Rx of Y is F of Y G of X. The most important player in my talk will be the Yang-Baxter monoid, sometimes also called the structure monoid of a set theoretic solution. It is defined as the monoid generated by elements in X. As the monoid generated by elements in X, such that you put the defining relations, X times Y is U times V, if the topo XY gets mapped to U, V under your set-theoretic solution. So it encodes the relations of your set-theoretic solution. Moreover, of course, oh, that was a bit fast. If you take any field, you can take a look at the semi-group algebra, which will be. Algebra, which will be then a quadratic algebra. And if you read about this, well, this should play the role of some quantum spaces. So that's the reason why they are very important. Apart from being nice rings. So first results from the Alspread structure. Well, there were two schools of thought in some sense. Some people looked at Druk, some people looked at the monoids. So we started with Elikov Shedro-Soloviev and Gateway Vandenberg. Vandenberg. If you take XR to be a finite involitive non-degenerate set theoretic solution, then your semigroup algebra Km, so that's just the semi-group algebra of MXR, is a Nutherian domain that satisfies polynomial identity. And you can also characterize the Gelfand-Kirlov dimension and the classical Krill dimension of that algebra to be exactly the size of your signature. Moreover, it is ontologically. Moreover, it is ontologically nice in the sense that it has finite global dimension. You can characterize injective dimensions, etc. Moreover, if your solution is square free, then this algebra has to be closure. So people who think about this can, well, say maybe this is a bit reminiscent of how a polynomial algebra in amount of x elements behaves. And well, in some And well, in some sense, that is due to the following proposition, also proved by those same authors. If you've got a finite evolution, non-degenerate theoretic solution, then you can construct a bijective one-co-cycle from the structured monoid to the three abelian monoid on x. So think the non-negative integers to the x. But if you want to do this, But if you want to do this in a more general setting, where you want to drop involativity, maybe go towards left non-degenerate only instead of fully non-degenerate, this free abelian monoid is far too restrictive. And this was done by Lebeden Vendramin and by Jesus Kuwait and myself to say that if you've got a finite left non-degenerate solution, then you can construct a bijective bijective one co-cycle again from MxR to another monoid Axr. Another monoid, AXR. So you have to replace that three abelian monoid by something else. What is that something else? Well, you can see that as this monoid. Here I'm hiding the real definition, which you can define through any satirated solution, but it looks very ugly. So what is it? It's generated by the elements of x, such that x plus y is equal to y plus sigma x of y. So in some sense, you're just. So in some sense you're just putting normalization or a conjugation here by sigma x, but it doesn't have to be bijective. That only happens if you started from a bijective solution. And well I denote this by plus. That is just semantics. It is not abelian at all. I don't assume that or something. And what does this monoid do? Well it actually secretly encodes the information of this wave. Secretly encodes the information of the square, of R squared. So that's also why, by with an involuntive solution, you get the identity of the square, and this relation would then just become commutation. These monoids are also structured monoids of very special solutions that are associated to racks and shelves, for people who know those structures. And then you can start thinking, okay, can I say more about the algebras related to these left-non details? The algebras related to these left non-degenerate solutions. So, if you start from a finite left-non-degenerate solution, what we wanted to prove is that Km always has to be left-neutral. That we have not done yet. So, this is a bit the way to do that. First, you can notice that Km is right-neutherion even only if some other algebra is right-neuterium. I haven't defined what this soccer is, but you can think of this as a far easier monoid. A far easier monoid where a lot less ugly things can happen. And this can be further characterized with the visibility information on your structural monolith. So which elements left are, well, how do you say that? Left divide a certain word in your monoid are very is very important. Display These play a very important role, they characterize a lot of things. Moreover, it's here written as just one sentence, but it took us four pages in a particular paper, that KA, so that is the structure, well, the algebra related to AXR, always has to be left-neutral in these cases. That's also the reason why we think that Km also has to be left neutral, because usually. To be left Ethereum, because usually that's the things we did in several other cases, you can bring the properties of AXR back to MXR by pulling this back over your bijective one co-cycle. Moreover, you can also take a look at the dimensions. So if you've got a left-only general solution, then the Galvan-Kirlov dimension of Km has to be again equal to the classical Kruhl dimension of Km. Dimension of Km, but you say, okay, these algebras, they're very hard to control. Well, you can just change the algebra to Ka, and the dimensions stay the same. Moreover, they are still bounded by the order of x, so you know they are finite in particular. And you can characterize this number, these dimensions, exactly if you take a look at the decomposability information on the derived solution. So, what is that? That is exactly those sigmas we have. That is exactly those sigmas we have in the AXR and what Ilaya explained this morning as well then other things you could be interested in, other properties you could be interested in is whether the algebra can be prime, whether you can characterize that. Well if you've got a finite left non-degenerate solution, then your algebra is very rarely prime. You can actually show that it's equivalent to say that you're an involved It's equivalent to say that you're an involved solution even only if your monoid was cancellative, and a particular set is a trivial group. I have not included the definition of this particular group because it takes a while. This is the same as asking that's a prime algebra, and this guy has to be a trivial group. And that's the same as saying that has to be a domain. Moreover, for example, if you take a look at this map, if this map has Take a look at this map. If this map is a bijective map, then omega lambda is a trivial group. Now, well, for some people, this might seem like an arbitrary map, but in seturated solutions, this comes up as a diagonal map, plays a very important role. Is bijective if, for instance, you put finite bijective left non-degenerate solution. So there are quite a lot of cases where this happens. Moreover, it's for us still an open question whether omega lambda can any Omega lambda can ever be a non-trivial group. We don't know. Finally, those dimensions also characterize involativity. So if you've got a finite left-hand degenerate solution, then being involuntar is exactly the same as saying that the alpha unknown dimension has to be the same as the order of x. And if the algebra is left and right, Nutheri, which you might have if Which you might have if this solution is bijective. Then, this is further equivalent to all of these other dimensions being equal to the size of x or having finite global dimension or other homological data. And with that, I thank you for your attention. Thank you, Arnold, for your talk and questions. It's possible to collect solutions. Is it possible to characterize solutions in which there are the monoid is an inverse monoid? Well, that will not immediately happen because you're a graded monoid. So because you're an inverse monoid, you're thinking of x, y, x has to be again y uh no x, sorry. But you're graded, so this this will some has to go. Some has to go. Yeah. Yeah, and but Yeah. Yeah, and but you have a graded monoid, so xyx is a far too long word to be in to be an inverse monoid. But is it possible to collect a solution whose taxonomy is an inverse monoid monoid? I wonder if that's well, I think that truly an inverse monoid can never happen because you always have a copy of the natural numbers. Well, the natural numbers are somehow encoded in there, but maybe you have. Encoded in there, but maybe you should have some kind of graded version of that, but I don't know. I don't know whether there is a graded security handlers. I have can you go back to the previous theorem? Yes, so I wrote the theorem, but earlier I think was Not just on general finite let non-generate, but on square, if I remember my theorem. So these things were because we don't remember everything. There was another equivalent condition to to be non-invo to be involved it was the algebra should be positive. So I gave a long chemical I gave a long characterization of many conditions each, but we want to use the Hilbert series there. Yes, that's correct. I think for the involvement, not degenerates, and then you, for Kosho, you probably also need square free. I have to do that. Yes. Because you do the key, they say. But I think, if I remember correctly, this also have the restriction. And it is not true that they are very limited. There are thousands even when we have able generated many. Adaptation on this? What was your thing about being a domain and the condition? So being a domain is exactly equivalent to your solution has to be in volume. And that immediately also tells you that it has to be left and right on legitimate. Say like uh some condition on the volume rank being equal to something in terms of solution? Question? I don't immediately know that because we did instead of saying domain like goalie rank equals D, say that, it's a good question. Sorry, I want to also add what is not relative to evolutiveness, but when they are not involved. The Gauffen cubed dimension cubed dimension is less than the order of X, then it's not necessary even to be unpacked, just to drag it out. Then the global dimension is always simple. This is a recent result in a joint paper in so this is. So, this is for any quadratic algorithm not necessarily having programmatic. Don't have time for other questions, so we can speak again.
