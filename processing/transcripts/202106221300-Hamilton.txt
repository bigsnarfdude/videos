And the triangulation will be geometric if each tetrahedron is the convex whole of four non-coplanar points in hyperbolic space. And the tetrahedra are glued together by isometries to give the complete hyperbolic structure on the manifold. So every cusp hyperbolic three manifold. Hyperbolic three-manifold admits a topological ideal triangulation, and we want to talk about when it admits a geometric ideal triangulation. The geometric triangulations are important computationally and theoretically. They're central to SNAP-P, a program which helps find hyperbolic structures on three manifolds, and Thurston's original proof of the hyperbolic. Thurston's original proof of the hyperbolic Dane surgery theorem implicitly assumed the existence of geometric triangulations, and there's been other work that assumes the existence of geometric triangulations as well. Despite its importance, this conjecture is unknown. So the first part of the conjecture is that if M is a cusped hyperbolic three-manifold, it admits at least one geometric ideal triangulation. In the 1980s, it was believed that this would follow from the work of Epstein and Penner, which I'll talk about a little bit later. And then you can make a bolder conjecture that M emits infinitely many geometric ideal triangulations. So I'll mention some results. There are some direct constructions of geometric. Constructions of geometric ideal triangulations, and they're known in some special classes of manifolds. There's a list of people that have worked in this area. There have been constructions on one-punctured torus bundles, hyperbolic tube bridge link complements, or highly twisted link complements. There are more results if you allow passing to finite covers. So, Lowe, Schleimer, and Tillman have proved that every Seimer and Tillman have proved that every cussed hyperbolic three-manifold has a finite cover with a geometric triangulation, and we build upon their work. So this is the main result. If M is a cussed hyperbolic three-manifold and A is a Hoare cusp, then there's a finite cover, M hat of M, such that A lifts to a cusp, A hat, where the cover admits infinitely many geometric ideals. Infinitely many geometric ideal triangulations. And for almost all Dane fillings on A hat, the filled manifold also admits infinitely many geometric ideal triangulations. So for every cast hyperbolic three manifold, we have a finite cover with infinitely many of these triangulations. As far as we know, there is one paper in the literature that has infinitely many ideal geometric triangulations. Ideal geometric triangulations on the same hyperbolic manifold. Dad and Duan do this for the figure eight not complement, but their construction is specific to that manifold and doesn't generalize. So the idea of the proof is, and this was sort of the sort of starting with the work from above, is to start off with the polyhedral decomposition. Polyhedral decomposition of our manifold and then lift to a cover where we can subdivide that into a tetrahedra. So let me just remind you about the Epstein-Penner polyhedral decomposition of our manifold. So, again, we're starting with a cusp hyperbolic three-manifold, and we fix a collection of horror cusps. We let F be We let F be the set of all points in the manifold that have a unique shortest path to the union of the cusps. And then we call the complement of that the cut locus. The combinatorial dual of the cut locus is, we denote that by P, and that's called the canonical polyhedral decomposition. And it's determined by the manifold M and the horocusps that you choose. So here's a picture to help you see it in dimension two. Dimension two. We'll be looking at three manifolds, but you can define this on two manifolds as well. And we're looking over the universal cover. So we have a horball packing, which is given in black. And then the cut locus is in red. And then dual to the cut locus is the canonical triangulation, which is in blue. So if I So, if I have a vertex in the cut locus, it's the center of a ball, which is drawn here. And that ball is tangent to a maximal collection of horror balls that contain the vertices of the cell in P that's dual to that vertex. Okay, so I'm going to say a little bit about the strategy of the proof this talk has. Strategy of the proof. This talk has a geometric part and an algebraic part. So we'll start with the geometric part. The idea is to start with the canonical polyhedral decomposition. And we're going to look at that on finite covers of our manifold M. And then these first two points were already known. So under certain conditions, the canonical polyhedral decomposition can be subdivided. Decomposition can be subdivided into a geometric ideal triangulation through the process of coning. And then, under sort of a different set of conditions, this polyhedral decomposition P will have one or two cells that fit together to form a submanifold, which we call a drilled ananas. And I'll say what that is in the next slide. So, this is known. We can kind of Known, we can kind of find a finite cover where both of these things happen, and then the drilled anonas admits an infinite sequence of geometric ideal triangulations. So in the next slide, I see some people smiling. Ananas is French for pineapple. So here's a picture, which I believe is due to Neil. This is a picture from the This is a picture from the paper. This first picture shows this first picture, you can take this as a definition of the drilled ananas. We have two ideal tetrahedra and we're gluing them together along this edge to form a drilled ananas. It's homeomorphic to a torus across a closed interval from zero. Closed interval from zero to infinity, except we're removing a point at the zero level, this ideal point. So if you look above a certain level, it looks like a horr cusp. And we have tori at the horizontal levels, except level zero, where we have a punctured torus. So this is a drilled anonus. And we have a triangulation of on a finite Of on a finite cover of our original manifold. And these are two cells. You can think of these two cells in our triangulation. And we're going to do the moves locally on these two cells and sort of leave the other cells alone. So we're going to do a 2-3 move. We're going to look at the edge. Sorry, we're going to look at the face where these two tetrahedra are glued together and take an edge which is. Together and take an edge which is dual to that face, and that's labeled as beta I prime in this picture. And then we're going to replace the original two tetrahedra with three tetrahedra that share this edge, beta I prime. So here's a picture after the move. So we replaced these two tetrahedra with these three tetrahedra. And then we can And then we can discard the bottom one and keep the top two, glue them together to get our next drilled ananas. And then we can kind of repeat the process. In the next stage, the face we're going to use is one that's exterior to this fundamental domain. And so by repeating this move, you can get an infinite sequence of geometric triangulations in the finite cover. So I'll go back to the sort of strategy of the proof. We needed, there's some conditions to guarantee that one and two are true. And then you have this finite cover with a nice triangulation with the drilled anonas. And then you can do the infinite sequence of moves to get different ideal triangulations that are geometric. Triangulations that are geometric. And so a lot of the proof is arranging conditions one and two. And to do that, you need some subgroup separability. So that's going to be sort of the second half of the talk. And that's sort of more of my contribution. So switch gears a little bit and talk about subgroup separability. We have a group gamma. We have a group gamma, and we say a subset X of Gamma is separable in Gamma if it's closed in the profinite topology. That's equivalent to saying for every element G outside of X, there's a homomorphism from gamma to a finite group such that the image of G remains distinct from the image of X. We say a group is residually finite if Is residually finite if the trivial subgroup is separable in gamma, and its subgroup separable if every finitely generated subgroup of gamma is separable in gamma. There are applications in group theory and geometric topology. In group theory, subgroup separability is linked to solutions to word problems. For example, if gamma is finitely presented and residually finite, And residually finite. Then there's an algorithm to decide in a finite number of steps whether a given word in the presentation is the trivial element or not. And if gamma is group separable, you can solve more generalized word problems. And in geometric topology, it's often used to solve immersion to embedding problems. You might have an immersed surface in your manifold and you want it to lift to an embedded surface in a finite cover. But often you want to construct But often you want to construct a finite covering space of your manifold where you have certain geometric conditions. And that's exactly what we need in our work. And that's where subgroup separability comes in. So we have some other notions of separability. A group gamma is double coset separable if for every pair H and K, a finitely generated subgroup. Of finitely generated subgroups. This double coset is separable in gamma. And gamma is conjugacy separable if every conjugacy class in gamma is separable in gamma. Here are some results. Free groups, service groups, compact ciphered fibered space groups, and closed hyperbolic three-manifold groups are all conjugacy separable and double conjugacy separable. So, people that these results are due to. People that these results are due to. In joint work with Wilton and Zeleski, we proved that the fundamental group of a compact orientable three-manifold is conjugacy separable. And more recently, Chagas and Zeleski have shown that hyperbolic three-manifold groups are conjugacy separable. So these are the results that we needed to guarantee the conditions in a finite The conditions in a finite cover to get our infinite sequence of geometric triangulations. In the generic case, this first result sufficed from 2012 that if M is a hyperbolic three manifold and H and K are abelian subgroups, then this double coset is separable. And in most cases, that theorem is enough. But there was one sort of difficult case. Sort of difficult case where they Dave and Neil needed a stronger separability theorem, and that's when I joined the collaboration. So, this is the stronger statement. We have a cusp hyperbolic three-manifold, and H and K are maximal parabolic subgroups of gamma corresponding to distinct cusps. Then we take an element G and gamma such that K is disjoint. Such that k is disjoint from every conjugate of this coset. And we want this to remain true in a finite quotient. So we want a group homomorphism into a finite group such that the image of K is still disjoint from every conjugate of the image of this coset. So that seems maybe a little technical. There's a geometric interpretation of this result, and this is sort of what we needed. And this is sort of what we needed in the paper. We have our two maximal parabolic subgroups, H and K, and we're looking up in the universal cover. So we can think of H as the stabilizer of this horrible B tilde. And we have our element G. And so this is G of B tilde. And we're going to let beta be this geodesic arc. You have the two parabolic. You have the two parabolic fixed points, and you would take the geodesic that connects them. And then that gives you this geodesic arc beta tilde between the two horrible. This is in the universal cover. So beta tilde is going to project to an arc in our manifold. And we needed to find a finite cover where the cusp corresponding to K lifts and where every pre-image of beta connects distinct cusps. Cusps. So we needed to control kind of every lift of beta, and the previous result allowed us to do that. So I'll say a little bit about the proof. Here's just to remind you of the setup. This is what we want to prove. M is a hyperbolic three-manifold of finite volume. Three manifold of finite volume. And we have two maximal parabolic subgroups of gamma, H and K, corresponding to distinct cusps. And we have our element G. And the goal is to find a finite quotient such that the image of K is disjoint from the image of every conjugate of the coset. And in fact, we usually think about it the other way. We want the image of the coset to be disjoint from the image of every conjugate. From the image of every conjugate of k. It's kind of an easier way to think about it. So we need to construct finite quotients of gamma. And a good way to do that is to look at the coefficient ring. So we know that we can view gamma in PSL2C, and that representation has a lift up into SL2C. For the purposes of this talk, I'm going to assume that we have a lift where every parabolic element has trace two. That's not necessarily. That's not necessarily true, and that causes a little bit of a complication in the proof. But for today, we're just going to assume we have a lift where all the parabolic elements have trace two. And after conjugating gamma, we can assume that gamma lives in SL2R, where r is a finitely generated ring in a finite field extension of the rational numbers. So, if we have a ring homomorphism from this coefficient ring into a finite ring, ring into a finite ring. That's going to induce a group homomorphism from gamma into this finite group. And that we can use results from algebraic number theory to come up with a ring homomorphism. So that gives us a rich class of finite quotients of gamma. And we're going to call one of these maps a congruence quotient of gamma. So I'm just going to show you one nice case where things work out well so you get a kind of a flavor of the idea. A flavor of the idea. After conjugating gamma, we can assume that we're going to fix on H, one of our parabolic subgroups, and we can assume that it has this nice form. Here are generators H1 and H2, and then we have our element G. And remember, we're looking at this coset, GH. So you can just write out what a typical element in the coset looks like by doing the matrix multiplication. We're assuming every matrix multiplication. We're assuming everything has trace two, so you can just ignore all these plus or minuses. So we have this coset and we want to find a finite quotient where this coset remains disjoint from every conjugate of k. K is a parabolic subgroup. So every element in that has trace two. Every conjugate of that has trace two, both in gamma or in any finite quotient. So really you just need to find a So, really, you just need to find a map into a finite group where nothing in this coset has trace two. You can't always do that, but if you can, then that's great. So that's sort of the original strategy is to try to figure out when you can kind of prevent elements in this coset from having trace two in the image. And so, you just go ahead and compute the trace. So, you can compute the trace, set it equal to two. Set it equal to 2, and then solve for m plus n omega. And that gives you this element y. And notice that y is determined just by just by g. So we have this element y, and this element in the coset has trace 2 if and only if y lives in this set. And in a finite quotient, it's going to, the image will have trace 2 if and only if the image of only if the image of y lives in the image of this set. So we would like to find a finite quotient where y does not land in here. And that will allow us to separate the coset from all conjugates of k. So there is a case where you're able to do that. This is sort of previous work. If R is a finitely generated ring in a number field, we have our element Field. We have our element omega, which was determined by our parabolic subgroup H. Then we have kind of these two sets, Z omega and Q omega, depending on whether we're looking at coefficients in Z or coefficients in Q. If Y happens to live outside this larger set, then there is a ring homomorphism into a finite ring such that the image of Y is not in the The image of y is not in the image of z omega. So that will induce a group homomorphism where the image of the trace of every element in the coset is not equal to 2, and that means it has to be disjoint from every conjugate of k. So this is a kind of a nice case where things work out well. Unfortunately, y could live in q omega. In q omega. And if it does, then for every congruence quotient of gamma, you're guaranteed to have an element in the coset that's mapped to a matrix with trace two, no matter what congruence quotient you pick. You're going to land q, like this set, q omega is going to land in z omega if you look at a ring homomorphism into a finite ring. So you can't use a constant. So, you can't use a congruence quotient of gamma, and you need a new idea. And the new idea is to work with Dane surgery, Dane surgery. So, that will give us another class of groups we can look at. So, if we do Dane surgery, then in the field manifold, we get a map from gamma to the fundamental group of the filled manifold, which I'll call gamma bar. And I can look at congruence quotients of that. That. So again, you sort of look at the details, and you have some nice cases and some cases that aren't nice. But every time that you have a case that's not nice, you get specific information. So in this bad case, I had very specific information about Y, which gave me specific information about this element G that was determining the coset. And so if you have enough specific information, you can take a product of two maps. Take a product of two maps to keep the coset distinct from k. So in the end, we look at a product of group homomorphisms. One is a congruence quotient of gamma, and one factors through Dane surgery, and then we take a congruence quotient of gamma bar. So that the image of a matrix in gamma is a tuple of matrices, and you can guarantee that at least in one of the coordinates, At least in one of the coordinates, the image of gh does not have trace 2, and that forces the coset to be distinct from every conjugate of k. So that's the idea of the separability part of the proof, and I'll stop there. Thank you. I'm still just trying to figure out how the algebra is corresponding to the triangulations. I mean, what is it really telling us, the separability properties of the groups? Vague question. I can say, yeah, I can say something about that. It comes to this sort of strategy here. Sort of strategy here. So you're trying to build a finite cover where you can subdivide the polyhedral decomposition into tetrahedra. And you can do that through the process of coning, but to do that, you need to have You want to have a like a partial order on the vertices. And so, and you want every polyhedron to have a unique minimal vertex. So to do that, we don't want to have too many polyhedra that have vertices that are identified in the manifold. And so you want to take sort of diagonals in your polyhedra. Take sort of diagonals in your polyhedral, and you want to minimize the number of them that are returning. So, the general idea is you don't want too many vertices in your polyhedral decomposition to be identified. And so, you want lifts of arcs that lift to distinct cusps. And that's sort of where this picture comes from. Picture comes from. So this picture is really the connection between the algebra and the geometry. So right now, this would be an arc which is identified in M because these two horror balls are identified by G. And see, that might correspond to two vertices which are identified. But if you can find a lift. But if you can find a lift where they correspond to distinct cusps, then they'll no longer be identified. So it allows you to sort of do this first step in the proof. Okay, any other questions? Please just unmute yourself. I can't see everyone, so I can't call on anyone. Otherwise, I need to rest my Zoom eyes. Great talks, everyone. Morning session. Morning session. The afternoon session will start in one and a half hours, but the Zoom will be open, so feel free to hang out. Like I said, I'll kind of disappear, rest my eyes, and maybe come back later. See you in 90 minutes. May I ask a question of either Richard or Mark? Hello. I'm curious about the work, you mentioned the work of Eigol Haas and Thurston. I was wondering if you could say a couple more words about that because I thought their theorem was about normal surfaces and three manifolds. So I'm just trying to connect it. So, I'm just trying to connect it. I might need to draw something. I'm just trying to think of the most easy way to explain it. Let's just look at the case of the surface. Suppose you have, let's say, you have a triangulation, say, on a On just a surface, and you've got a very complicated curve that intersects the triangulation lots and lots and lots of times. And ideally, what you want to do is, let's say you wanted to just understand the homeomorphism type of that curve. Let's just do a basic problem like that. So, one way you'd want to go about doing that is to flip the triangulation over and over again to simplify the curve down. Simplify the curve down to something very simple, and then, you know, to something where the curve now intersects the new triangulation, like at most two or four times, and then deduce what the homeomorphism type is straight away. And basically, what Egelhas and Thurston can do for you in the surface case is what they can do is if you look at how the curve intersects the triangulation, you can build some sort of like Some sort of like complex made of taking these bands that match up parallel arcs in each triangle. And you can sort of get something that looks like a train track from that. And there are places where these parallel arcs have sort of cusps, like you might have a triangle with a vertex here and two bunches of arcs. And two bunches of art's done like this, and you want to, let's say, you want to. I really need a picture. Hopefully, I don't mind. I hope people don't mind if I just share my screen. Is that okay? Can you see that? Since the curve you have is not peripheral, somewhere in your triangulation, You should have somewhere which is free, like a place where there isn't one of these types of arcs. Because if around each vertex you had an arc like this, then you'd be able to find a peripheral curve. So somewhere, there's no such arc of that type. So then you can. So then you can. What I want to do is, I want to split this train track looking thing by taking a pair of scissors and starting to cut along the train track in between two pieces of the curve. Do interrupt if I'm not making sense. So I think maybe the main thing. So I think maybe the main thing to say is that Egelhas Thurston, for their work in three manifolds, they built this tool for working with and manipulating these interval permutations. And part of the thing that they did was they showed that that way of breaking apart interval permutations was fast, thanks to this sort of split and twist kind of construction that they had. And while their tool was much more general, because they had to do the three-manifolds case, and so their interval permutations were. False case, and so their interval permutations had to be like immersions. We're doing things on a surface, so we get to do something which is much more basic. We just have to have these sort of bijections that need to be split apart to, as Richard said, you know, figure out the homeomorphism type of a curve. So really, I guess the bit that we're using really is the bounds that they had on their machinery. So it's not so much the three-manifold things that they did, it's the tools that they built to help. It's the tools that they built to help them tackle the problems. And even in our case, we don't need tools that are anywhere near as powerful as what they had. Thanks. So basically, you're doing a one-dimension down version of their efficient solution to the number of components for a normal surface problem. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think I'd say one day. I don't think I'd say one dimension down. I'd say we're doing it like with an embedding, not an immersion. These interval permutations that they have, they're too complex that they have really is a simplicial complex and it's like a branch surface. Whereas for us, it's a surface. So if you ever see some points of intersection and there's interval permutations on either side, well, there's two of them because curves come in and Of them because curves come in and they go out. Whereas for them, they have these branch surfaces, and so things have to split. They have to worry about cases where interval permutations overlap with each other and things like this. Whereas we don't have to care about any of those pieces because we really have a triangulation of a surface, not a triangulation of a two complex. Thanks. Yeah, maybe that's the right sort of way to say it. I don't know. Richard, is that a reasonable summary? Yeah, I suppose it depends on the answer Dave was looking for.
