Our research group, or let me first introduce myself. I'm a PhD student of Professor German's fluid dynamics group of the Technical University in Munich. And our research project was in cooperation with another institute at our campus. And they did the experimental part, and our group did the simulations. And overall, this whole project is very close. Is very close to industrial filtration applications, especially for filtration applications in the dairy industry. So here we can see the schematic structure of a spiral wound membrane module. So these spiral wound modules are constructed using membrane sheets that are separated by That are separated by a permeable mesh, the so-called spacer net. And these spacer nets or this region where the spacer net is located is also called the spacer channel. And there we have the actual feed flow flowing through. And these sheets are then wrapped around this permeate tube. Wrapped around this permeate tube, and this gives it this spiral wound appearance overall. And these modules are used for the desalination purification of wastewater and diluted aqueous solutions, which are usually Newtonian, but they are also used to concentrate or to clarify non-Newtonian fluids, especially in the food industry. For example, Industry, for example, in the milk powder production or in the food juice production. And next to the porous membranes, the spacer channel itself is quite important for the filtration performance of the module. And here on the right, we can see the velocity distribution at the filtration start and later on. And what we observe is that the flow distribution gets worse. Flow distribution gets worse during the filtration process because of the accumulation of retained components on the membrane surface, which block the flow and also could lead to the still, yeah, which is quite a big issue right now, the biofouling. So, the knowledge in general about the flow inside the spacer channel is quite important and. And a typical batch production cycle, here's an example to concentrate milk protein, usually consists of first a filtration where we increase the protein concentration up to our desired level. And when we are done, it is followed by the rinsing step, where we flush the membrane module before we start with the actual chemical cleaning. With the actual chemical cleaning. And my research only focuses on the rinsing step where we displace shear thinning milk protein concentrates with water. And we try to optimize this rinsing process step in order to reduce the product losses. Especially we try to decrease the mixed phase volume because we cannot sell the product. Because we cannot sell the product anymore because it's already mixed with water. And also, we try to reduce the water consumption. And if we do a proper rinsing, we will also save chemicals in the subsequent cleaning, chemical cleaning. And of course, we reduce the overall cleaning in place time. So, here on the left, you can see the CAD version of our The CAD version of our pilot plant where we conducted the rinsing experiments. So you have a pump which creates an inflow, which we are measuring here. And we're pumping everything through our SWM module. I do not show the permeate tube, but it's of course here. And we are measuring the pressure before and after the module. And we also Module, and we also keep track of the concentration with the turbidity sensor here. And the problem here in this whole setup is similar to classic porous media problem, where we have scalings ranging from millimeters inside the spacer channel to actual meters in the whole setup or the length of the SWM module. So we tried to come with a multi-scale approach, and we did, first of all, 2D and 3D simulation of the space of a channel in order to get to know the problem and do our research on that. And as a first step, I started to measure the geometry of a space on that sample under the microscope and then Microscope, and then I reconstructed a virtually version in the CD program with it. And with that, I created a mesh of a very small domain of this whole spacer channel in the module. So of one single spacer channel in the whole module. And here we have, of course, an inlet and an outlet. These sites, the boundary condition here, were chosen to be periodic, so we create So we create or we physically connect them and create a sort of an infinite width channels piece here. And the membrane walls are located here on the top and bottom. And we treated them as impermeable walls. So there's no flow through it. And of course, membranes are not impermeable during the filtration process. During the filtration process. But during the rinsing step, the transmembrane pressure is actually zero because we want to push out the product out of the spacer channel and not again inside the membranes. So this is why we treat them as actual walls here. And further during the rinsing, this spacer net is also This spacer net is also pressed into the membrane sheets itself because of the high pressures there. And so you can actually see imprints of these thickest parts of the spacer net in the membrane sheets when you open them. And here we can see these small cuts. So we try to implement that as well in our geometry. So you see here these small cuts. This is Cuts. This is basically to mimic this pushing into the membrane sheets. And the meshing was done with OpenFOAM's meshing utility SnappyHex mesh, and it had around 1.3 million cells. And next, I want to present the main parts of the mathematical framework. As you can see, we assumed the fluid to be See, we assumed the fluid to be incompressible and we neglected the gravity. Further, the flow is in the laminar flow regime. And the most important equation here is the transport equation of the volume fraction alpha. Since water and milk are miscible fluids, we have no surface tension here and the mass transfer is therefore not restricted. Square is therefore not restricted. And we have a linearly averaged the other quantities, such as the density and the total stress. So here, one minus alpha is the expression of alpha two, which is the milk concentrate or the shear thinning milk concentrate. And we use the power law model with the With the consistency index K and the fluid index N to model the shear thinning behavior of these milk concentrates. So in order to get the parameter values, milk concentrates were rheologically characterized for various protein contents. And then subsequently, the Paula model was fit through the results. Model was fit through the resulting viscosity curves. And here you can see the resulting consistency index values over the protein content. And on the right side, you can see the consistency index for or the fluid index for various consistency index. So what we can see is when the protein content increases, we also have an increase. Protein content increases, we also have an increase in the consistency index. And with an increased consistency index, we have a decreased fluid index, which means that if we increase the protein content in our milk, we increase the shear thinning character. And in our publication, we investigated first the only protein content of 4 to 9 percent weight percentage. Exactly. Exactly. Another parameter we had to determine was the diffusion or more or less the dispersion coefficient here. And for that, we took the effective turbidity measurements from our rinsing experiments. From them, we got the cumulative curve of it and then derived the distribution function from it. And with this distribution. And with this distribution function, you can fit the exponentially modified Gaussian model or EMG model through it. It's an analytical solution to that. And with that, you can get the dispersion coefficient D out of these experiments. And what we can see here on the right side is the dispersion coefficient for several rinsing experiments over the generalized Reynolds number. Reynolds generalized Reynolds number, and what we can see is that it's in the order of 10 to the power of minus 6 meters squared per second. But if we look at classical chemical literature, we see that the average molecular diffusivity of milk components in water is in order of 10 to the power of minus 10. And so we try to make Make simulations with both the dispersion and the diffusion coefficient to check which gives us better results. So first, let me show you a small video on the 3D displacement of the simulations in the spatial channel domain. So right now at time step zero, you can see that the whole domain is filled with milk. The whole domain is filled with milk. It has this white color, quite naturally, the white color. And at the inland, you can see already waiting the water, which has the alpha value of one there. We have a volumetric flow rate of 11 cubic meter per hour, and the protein content was quite high with the 9%. So let me start. So, what you can see is that it quickly pushes out the milk. Pushes out the milk, and the only thing that remains, or the milk part that remains, are behind these parts where the filament is actually pushed into the membranes. And also behind the filaments, you can also see that milk is still remaining there. But as it happens so quite fast here, let me get into one time step here. Time step here. So I divided the whole domain here in two pieces actually. Here on the top part, you can see the progress of the displacement. So as we can see here, water already pushed approximately half to half of the channel length. And on the right side, on the bottom part, you can see the velocity field which it creates. And what you can see is that here behind the filaments and especially behind these points that I already pointed out here, milk still remains and prolongs the whole rinsing step. And what you can see in the velocity field is quite interesting that we have local areas with higher velocity. Velocity. And at these local areas, with the increased velocity, we also have only pure milk, which is then caused by its shear-related viscosity, of course. Another interesting parameter in this rinsing time is the rinsing time. Rinsing time. So, how long does it take to displace the milk in the channel? And for this, we measured the average milk concentration at the outlet of our computational domain and plotted it as a function of time. Here on the left, you can see the rinsing curves for a lower volumetric flow rate, and on the right, for a higher volumetric flow rate, for a low protein, middle. A low protein, middle, and let's say high protein content. And we can see that after a short lag phase, which is pretty much the hydraulic residence time, so the amount of time the flow actually needs to reach the outlet, the concentration first drops rapidly, and then the curve kind of flattens out and slowly. And slowly converges to zero. And for both volumetric flow rates, we can see that the higher the protein content, the longer the rinsing time when we compare, of course, the constant flow rate. And what we can also see is that if we can increase the flow rate, we got a shorter rinsing process. So finally, I want to have a look at the mixed phase volume, which is the volumetric flow rate times the rinsing time without the lag phase, of course. And here we have the experimental data on the left side. We have the simulation results with the dispersion coefficient of 10 to the power of minus 6 and with the diffusivity of 10 to the power of minus 6. With the diffusivity of 10 to the power of minus 10 on the right side. And first of all, we could only achieve a qualitative agreement here with the experimental data, which is mainly because of the idealized small size geometry we were using, and we compared it to a complete or a whole pilot plan. Nevertheless, all the results. Nevertheless, all the results show an overall lower mixed phase volume at high volumetric flow rates. So here you can see the mixed phase volume over the volumetric flow rate and the protein content in all three plots. And so at high volumetric flow rates, we have a very low mixed phase volume. And what we can also see is that we have an X. Also, see, is that we have an increased mixed phase volume at higher protein concentrations, mainly because of these hardly accessible zones behind the filaments. And so it's very hard to rinse these parts in the spacer channel. And overall, we get the highest mixed phase volume at a low volumetric flow rate and a very high protein content. Content. So, this is what we can see in all three plots. But also, the EMG fitting with the experimental data suggests a very high dispersion coefficient. We found that the simulations with the diffusivity constant shows actually more reasonable results, especially in these simulations with, let's say, the middle. Let's say the middle values of the volumetric flow rates. And especially at high flow rates, here the simulation results were not that reasonable at all time. So let me get to the main conclusions and a small outlook. Simulations of a small part of a spiral membrane filtration system can definitely prove. Can definitely provide valuable spatial and temporal information, such as that the prolongation of the rinsing process because of the difficult to access zones behind the filaments. And we can also find the optimal setting of a rinsing process to achieve a low mixed phase volume, which is get a high volumetric flow rate and a low protein content, of course. Course. But still, these results can be used as a first block of a multi-scale analysis. So there's still plenty of research left in order to get more insights on the formation of this mixed phase in a total or in this complete filtration plant. And the power law model surely can describe the shear-thening character of the milk concentrates, but the milk concentrates actually show The milk concentrates actually show elasticity in the rheometric characterization. So, right now we are doing viscoelastic simulations using the white-Metzner model on that, which we intended to show actually today, but the simulations were, unfortunately, they are still running and I could not present some of the, at least some of the results of the simulation because I think they were. Because I think they were a little bit more interesting than the shear thinning simulations so far. So, finally, let me thank the research group and of course the financial support of the IAF and the FAE. And thank you very much for your attention. I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you, Nicolas. It took exactly 20 minutes. It took exactly 20 minutes. Perfect. So far, we do not have any questions in the chat, but I have a question related with your last slide about the ongoing simulations with the White-Metzner model. So you use something like 3 million cells to use in these inelastic models. When you move to the viscoelastic model, typically the results are much more. The results are much more mesh-dependent than with inelastic models. So maybe you'll need to use those 3 million or even more cells to get good accuracy. And then with these viscoelastic models, 3 million cells is not so easy in terms, especially in terms of time. How are you tackling these limitations? Great question. I actually prepared some slides for that. So we have to go one step back for that. Uh, one step back for that. You're absolutely right, it takes too much time. The computational costs are exploding on that. So, we have to go back to 2D simulations of this space-of a channel. If you want to tackle it with visco-elastic simulations, and what you can do here is you can basically make two slides through the spacer channel, and it gives you two configurations, which is one the submerged configuration where you have this. The submerge configuration where you have this alternating pattern of the filaments, and you have a submerged configuration where you have the space of filaments only in the middle part of the channel. And this is what we are actually doing right now. So the simulations are running on 2D because otherwise I think the mesh size would explode for 3D with scholastic simulations. Yes. Okay. Okay. That's good. All right. We do not have any. All right, we do not have any more questions, so I think we are going to recover a few minutes. So, thank you very much again, Nicolos, for your nice presentation. And we are going to move on to the next presenter, which will be Constantinos Zographos. Costis is easier to say. You can use Costis, okay. Costis, you're going to present numerical simulations using the closed-form adaptive length scale model and And yep, just in the arts, you can start whenever you want. Just let me know if you can see my full screen. Yeah, perfect. Is that okay? Yeah. All right. Okay, so I'll start. So, okay. So, thank you very much. I would like to thank the organizers for giving me the chance to discuss our work. And now, in the next few slides, as Manuel also said, I'm going to illustrate to you our Illustrate to you our numerical implementation for the closed form of the adaptive length scale model and some simulations when it comes to complex and more simple kind of flows when using it. So a bit on the background and our motivations. So we're mostly motivated by the fact that when it comes to contraction flows and comparing experiments and numerical simulations for viscoelastic fluids, they are both, although they are both capable of identifying the onset of elastic in some. Identifying the onset of elastic instabilities, they have big differences when it comes to performing actual measurements of the pressure drop. So, typically, the numerical simulations are not able to capture well the large enhancements in pressure drops that they are otherwise observed in the experiments. So, as it was stated by Rothstein and Mike Kinley, so probably still stands that the constitutive model should still be able to predict these large enhancements in pressure job. In Press Job. Now, more on that, based on their publication on the study of Rolston and McKinley, they illustrated that therefore their contraction expansion geometry, when they have viscoelastic fluids flowing inside for different contraction bases, they illustrated the large enhancements in pressure drop that they are occurring in comparison to the Newtonian fluids. Similar results have also been reported in the studies of binding and voltage for using. Of binding and voltage for using axisymmetric and planar contraction geometries, or in the more in the different types of contractions, such as those used by Soza et al., where the authors use this square-to-square contraction, and they also illustrated the enhancements in press stropes in terms of quite correction. Now, when it comes to numerical simulations, as we said before, typically the closed-form viscoelastic models, they are not able to capture this enhancements in pressure drop, and this was illustrated by the study of Albert. And this was illustrated by the study of Alves et al., where the authors used a commonly employed viscoastic model, such as the Ultra A B and the different forms of the PTT in a 4-to-1 contraction, and they illustrated exactly that, that the quad correction goes the other way around. Or similar findings have also been reported in the study of binding et al. in a planar contraction expansion geometry. However, we have to say that there are some studies that they are able to capture some enhancements in pressure drop, such as those such as the results that the Those such as the results that were published from Nystrom et al., where the authors used the Phineas-CR model and they illustrated enhancements in PressDrop for different values of their extensibility parameter. Or in a more recent study from Lopez Aguilar and co-authors, where they used their swim and swam models and they illustrated the enhancements in pressure for different geometries, different contractions. And in a follow-up study that they did later on in the Webster et al. publication, Seratal publication, where again, with their Schwimmen-Schwan models, they illustrated that they were able to capture the enhancements in pressure drop that they were reported by Binding and Walters. However, because still this is an ongoing research field, probably what was stated by Rothstein and McKinley in their paper still stands, that there is microstructural information missing from the closed-form models in order to capture the physics that they will give these enhancements. So, for that reason, Give these enhancements. So, for that reason, we wanted to see how the adaptive length scale model performs when it comes in these types of simulations. Now, as a model, it was originally proposed by Goss et al. and was proposed in both of its forms, both in its stochastic form, but also in the closed form. And as a model, it can be considered as a generalization of the Finney-Dumbel models. As you will see. As you will see later on, this actually means that the model considers a variable accessibility parameter and not a constant accessibility parameter as the Finney models do. Now, as the authors also reported in their paper, the adaptive length scale model and the Finney models, they perform well when it comes to small strains or when the molecule is fully stressed. Is fully stretched, but at the intermediate ones is where the Phineas actually are not able to provide good approximations, and it's where the adaptive length scale model can potentially produce better approximations and results. Now, in their model, the authors identified two regimes. One regime that was called the regime of instantaneous changes, and they suggested that for this, they suggested that the regime is the same. For this, they suggested an instantaneous dimensional polymer extensibility in the sense that at this limit, instantaneous changes to the flow they applied changes directly to the molecular parameters. However, as they also identified in their paper, this kind of instantaneous changes would lead to jumps in the polymer constitution to the stresses, which is not realistic and physical. And therefore, they also
