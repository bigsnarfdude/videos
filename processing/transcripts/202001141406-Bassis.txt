that we've had in trying to understand simulate iceberg calving. And my first thought was really what I should be saying is lack of progress. We've been kind of working at this for 40 or 50 years and I'm still not sure that we're at the point where we can actually simulate iceberg capping in models. And then the more I've been at these talks, the more I've realized that I actually know considerably less mathematics than all of the rest of you. And so my And so my perspective on this is going to have a pretty big historical overview component. And the first thing I want to do is just talk a little bit about different, like I said, different calving machines, what does ice for calving actually look like. The next thing that I want to do is think about this a little bit historically from how people have thought about how ice deforms and how it flows and breaks and touch back to some of the historical. The historical moments where we really started to think about things differently. I'll look forwards a little bit towards some of the numerical tools that people are starting to develop now and have been developing. But I think you're going to find that in terms of actually simulations, that Joe and David Pollard will talk a little bit more about the actual details. And I'm going to sketch out a little bit of some of the open problems that people have been talking a lot about recently. One of them being ice shelf rifting, types in a little bit of work. Shelf rifting, which I've done a little bit of work on, and this thing that people are talking about more that Rob DeConto and David Pollard termed called the marine ice cliff instability. And the truth is, the marine ice cliff instability is probably not that new. We used to call it a tidewater instability, but I'll get into a little bit of that at the end. And so, I just want to start with a definition of what iceberg calving is. It's a sudden detachment or breaking away of a block of ice. And so you have these calvings. And so you have these calving fronts and bits of ice break off suddenly and episodically. And one of the ways that I particularly like to think about it is that if you look at glaciers that are grounded, they don't have floating bits, then what typically happens in most of these environments is you get these ice thickness scale or smaller bits of ice that topple off sometimes in the ocean. They'll rotate out, and you can see them in seismic signatures. And you'll see crevassing. Signatures, and you'll see crevassing at the top, but you get this kind of steady stream of icebergs, and then some people will think that they can accumulate in fjords and form melange. And that's actually quite different from what we see in floating ice times and ice shelves, where most of the mass loss from iceberg calving from the big ice shelves occurs fairly episodically and is very large tabular icebergs. Large meaning the size of Midwestern The size of Midwestern states. And then we have also seen, in a couple of places, floating portions of ice shelves that completely disintegrated, where they just completely fell apart much more rapidly than anyone really thought they could. So just to give you an example of a floating regime, this is a NASA image of the Erebus Ice Tunnel. So you're looking down at it, it is jutting beautifully out into the ocean. Out into the ocean. This is sea ice flowing this way. It's got these interesting little jagged bits at the end. And about every 10 or 20 years, there's a couple kilometer berg that breaks off. We have no ability whatsoever to predict when those things happen, except that we know they happen, and we know that on average, Erebus Ice Tongue is about 10 kilometers long. Never gets much longer than 15 or 16 kilometers. Yeah. I've always been curious that these times are the sort of Christmas tree structure with the notches on the slide, right? And there is an explanation for that, I believe. Just curious, which I don't fully understand. Are you asking if I understand the explanations? You're more likely to than I am. No, I have no idea. I've seen explanations. None of them have entirely made sense to me. But if you'd like to enlighten us, or if any. Like to enlighten us, or if anybody would like to enlighten us, I would invite you to. Why is it they have the same orientation as the Pine Island sort of structures, but there's no shear. There's no shear in the ice tongue, you mean? Yeah, so is there then no relationship between that? Do you know what I'm talking about? The sort of thing you're talking about. There could be shear before it did that as a ton. Yeah, there's also spreading going on inside. Yeah, you should also keep in mind. Yeah, you should also keep in mind that Erebus Ice Tongue is in a fairly protected embayment, and so it's kind of an interesting example in which it is fairly ice, in it, which it is not interacting strongly in a two-way feedback with the ocean. But yeah, you get these weird feedback things over the size. If you look at actually a lot of ice times, you will see that you kind of get those characteristic structures. But yeah, I mean, so I invite you all to work out why that happens. And you know, you see him in Greenland as well. So this is Peter's. Greenland as well. So, this is Peterman Glacier, and this big iceberg, tabular iceberg, broke off. That was, I think, can't remember what year, about the size of Manhattan or so. So, these are pretty big things. You can see this beautiful melt channel actually down the center of it. You can see that there's other rifts and crevasses. You see there's melt ponds on the top of it. And so, these are pretty rich structures. And again, rifts developed before this thing happened. As you can see them, that particular rift, some people speculate it might have been. Some people speculate it might have been related to a surge glacier that suddenly fed into it and accelerated. I don't really know for this particular example. But again, there's a fairly characteristic decadal of spacing between these big tabular cabbing amounts. We can go and look at grounded glaciers. This is a glacier that I'm guessing a bunch of you guys have seen before. It's Russell Glacier right by Pank Luschwack. And this glacier is, I think, about 75, 80 meters. I think about 75, 80 meters tall. It's grounded. And you can see just from this photograph that you have this slopping off of stuff at the cabin front. And that stuff appeared about a day after we were there. So roughly speaking, you get these kind of big slumping events every day or two from these glaciers, and it kind of progresses across the entire caffeine to the basin. And you see the same thing for glaciers and fjords. Glaciers and fjords, you get buoyancy forces and other things like that. But again, you tend to be detaching more icebergs that are closer to the calving front and much, much more frequent. And then we have events like the Larson V Ice Shelf. Larson V. Ice Shelf, as all of you presumably know, disintegrated over about six weeks. It was preceded by fairly large amounts of surface melt. And there's speculation and probably pretty good evidence that this is. Probably pretty good evidence that this is related to hydrofracture, although the particular mechanisms of that are still being worked out by a number of people. But you have these, actually, some fairly large bergs, little teeny tiny bergs mixed in. And so that's kind of the systems that we're interested in simulating. Everything with these big episodic tabular bergs all the way to these slumping cavern fronts. And then occasionally you might get disintegration events. Just so you know, this is what Twaits Glacier looks like. Quaits Glacier looks like. Doesn't quite fit any of the categories that I've described. You will notice this is a satellite image. You'll notice all these little chunky bits. Quait's glacier looks like completely broken up, a bunch of boulders of ice glued together. You have all of these icebergs out here. And so understanding how these ice shelves, these floating portions, will evolve in response to changes in the forcings, mechanical and climate, is the question. It is the question that we're interested in. And just to kind of pull back a second, what we really want to know: what are the first that control the flow and fracture of ice? Nevertheless, it disappeared. And the hydrofracturing is probably not. Is probably not a living mechanism for its disintegration, but nevertheless, it's another kind of animal to your zoo in terms of possible disintegrations. I mean, there's very little surface belt for thwaits as well. Actually, if you go out and look at throughout the Canadian and Russian Arctic, there's an awful lot of floating appendages of ice. Some of them aren't what I would consider ice shelves. They're really thick bits of sea ice. But there's still a number of actual real ice shelves that are fed by meteoric ice ice. Ice shelves that are fed by Midiork ice upstream. And it's interesting to see where they form. They're almost all in very cold water, cold ocean water conditions. But I don't know that we have a really good map of where there actually is floating ice outside of the big ice sheets. Do you have an idea percentage of how the different scenario matters in terms of the amount of uh of uh practical ice? Three different scenarios. How much is what's the importance of each of them in terms of the discharge of the discharge? So I would say that for the most part for Greenland, what you're really seeing is mostly grounded glaciers. And so the contribution of the cabin flux, the total mass loss, is, I'm not sure what exactly, you guys probably know better than I do the lattice numbers. It sort of usually fluctuates around half is dynamic discharge versus surface mass balance. I think surface mass balance has actually increased a bit more recently. Increased a bit more recently. But then between these three, what's the most common or the most important? Or if there is. Well, I think it depends on the reason. So for Greenland, then it's mostly this small cabbing event. For Antarctica, the large ice shelves are primarily losing mass through these episodic tabular bergs. But Thwaites, Pine Island, all of these places are increasingly losing mass through smaller caving events. Does that answer your question again? Does that answer your question? Yep. And I don't think just because that's a snapshot of what it is now, that that is what it's going to be like in the future. And if you asked us, you know, back in the 80s, how much disintegration would contribute, it would be zero. And the estimate of how much iceberg capping versus other processes contributed to discharge would have been 90%. So those are numbers that we're getting better because of better measurements, but also are evolving. So, I guess to a certain extent, the thing that I have been mostly interested in is understanding the processes that control how ice flows and fractures, because it does both. It does both simultaneously. It's one of the reasons why it's actually quite difficult to understand it, is because it's not either or, it is both and often at the same time. I think if you look at those pictures, these are questions that I've kind of talked to Steve and other people about: if you're thinking that your goal If you're thinking that your goal is to simulate iceberg calving and its effect on sea level rise, then we know that we have these episodic calving events, these very episodic large rifting events and tabular bursts attached. Do we want to or can we represent that as a quasi-continuous process that you can incorporate into a model, which maybe you're only capping off smaller bergs? Or do you really want to try and think about incorporating in terms of which we are actually resolving individual cavings? Actually, resolving individual counting events, probably not at the right time, but hopefully statistical distributions that might match reality. And if we're going to do that, a somewhat related problem, is that we want to think about how we can represent it both at the process scale, but also at the large-scale ice sheet model scale. That there's limits in what we can ask poor Steve to do in the DOE sweep of models or what Matthew can do in IXA. Of models, or what Matthew can do in ISSM. And so we'd like to have something that's actually tractable to be incorporated in a large-scale model that can actually be used over more than a few weeks or even a decade or two, but possibly centuries or more. And to come back to one of your earlier points, is that it's not entirely clear, given the fact that ice breaks, that we can use the traditional viscous flow models that we've often relied on. That we've often relied on to simulate those range of processes. And so you can kind of think of this as asking the question of: do we want to parametrize iceberg calving in these models, or do we want iceberg calving to emerge as a process, as a part of the dynamics of the models? So that's your homework and And to set the stage a little bit further, I want to kind of step back a little bit because I've been very interested in education, in particular geoscience education. And one of the things that people have figured out is that the places that students get stuck on problems are the historical places where the community struggle in those same problems. So when you're trying to teach your students about calculus and limits, don't be surprised that they're struggling with it. It was a huge deal when mathematicians finally figured it out. Finally, figured it out. And the starting place of this is a little bit somewhat historical for many of you, but there's a real debate that raged more than a century ago, which is really, is ice a solid or a fluid? I've actually had conversations with many of you about whether ice is a solid or a fluid. It's a question that I frequently ask when I give seminars, when I teach classes, if I were to ask you, is ice? If I were to ask you, is ice a solid or a fluid? What would your answer be? Yes. Yes. All of the above. Could you be more precise? It depends on the time scales. It depends on the spatial scale. It might depend on the question you're interested in in posing. And it might depend on what particular model you're interested in using, because sometimes we're somewhat limited in the tools that we have. But there's an interesting debate because there's a question. There's an interesting debate because there's a question of whether glaciers are essentially mountains and they deform by the generation of fissures and fractures, or whether they are imperfect fluids was the terminology that was used. Essentially highly viscous fluids like tar. And there's an interesting experiment that was done by T.C. Chamberlain. He was a geologist at the University of Chicago. And he developed this little apparatus, he called a shear-ometer. And he went and he stuck. Meter. And he went and he stuck it on a glacier. And he has, as far as I can tell, the very first measurement in I think it was 1875 of stick-slip motion of a glacier. And he actually probably totally, incorrectly, was able to resolve stick-slip motion of the bed. I don't actually think that's what he saw. I think it's actually what he saw as thermal effects. But nonetheless, that was an interesting question they had because they thought that there was a big fault along the bottom of the glacier. The next kind of big leap in terms of investment and research, in terms of ICE and its mechanics, particularly its failure process, was really World War II. And in a lot of history of glaciology, we can't really separate glaciological research from the military tradition. And there was a number of interesting problems. How many of you guys have heard of the Habakkuk project? I see a few of you guys. I see a few of you guys. So, World War II, a number of things happened. The first thing was the Allies were especially interested in landing planes on sea ice. Actually, we're still interested in landing planes on sea ice. Now, it turns out if you land a plane on sea ice, the velocity of the plane is actually pretty close to the flexural wave speed within sea ice, and so the sea ice would break. And so the sea ice would break. And so some of the first measurements we have, systematic measurements of sea ice strength, come from the question of people trying to work out how thick the sea ice needs to be to avoid their planes crashing and sinking into the ocean, which you can imagine was a little bit annoying for them. Yes. Since we're doing historical trivia, I think Doug McHale had a computer called Habakkuk at some point. It would not surprise me that he didn't have Habakkuk. Now, Habakkuk is this fascinating historical project, and it turns out that during World War II, people were very interested in figuring out how you can launch an attack on mainland Europe. With a shortage of steel, they didn't have enough aircraft carriers. So, the proposed solution is: let's tow icebergs into the Atlantic and launch aircraft from Launch aircraft from icebergs. Can any of you foresee any problems with this? Your aircraft carrier melts? Your ice craft carrier may eventually melt, that's right. They were thinking about pretty big icebergs. What's going to fall apart, too? So ice is incredibly brittle, which is what they immediately found out, is that if you shoot a torpedo at an iceberg, it will brittlely fail and explode, which is not a great thing for your... A great thing for your aircraft carrier. But they are really clever, and what they figured out is that if you mixed ice with wood pulp, it's extraordinarily strong. And this is actually a common thing that they do in material science to this day, is to make stronger mixtures. And so the idea was to create artificial icebergs with this mixture of wood pulp. The very first experiment in which they tried this was not far from here. It was in Jasper, actually. It was in Jasper, actually. And so, a major part of the research for this project happened in Canada, fairly far away from the arena. And also, it turns out, as many of you have realized, it's not that hard to make ice here. And one of the things that people realized in terms of how they thought about it is that one way of thinking about fracture that tends to be true for most materials is that it's mixed moat loading. And so that if you pull something apart really hard in one direction and squeeze it in the other, it's easier to break it. In the other, it's easier to break it than if you just pull it in one direction. And so that was largely the prism in which they were interpreting the strength of ice. Now, this particular project did not come to fruition, and there's a really profound reason for that. Does anybody remember what that was? The war ended before. Was that? The war ended before. Well, the Allies won the Battle of the Atlantic and they no longer needed icebergs. They no longer needed icebergs, is really what it came down to. They invested in this project right until the end, until they no longer needed it. But this is amongst our very first really systematic studies of the fracture properties of ice. Now, in 1951, again, we're still starting to think about properties of ice. We started to become a little bit more sophisticated. Now we're not really quite. Start become a little bit more sophisticated. Now we're not really quite thinking: is it a solid or is it a fluid? John Nye has this beautiful paper that you should all go back and read because it's all kinds of insights. And he applied some of the first principles of this idea of plasticity, that something is rigid up until it yield strength, to deduce what the shape of an ice sheet would be. And essentially, the idea is that it behaves like a rigid body until it reaches yield strength. And he has all kinds of beautiful and interesting observations. And interesting observations about the slip-line field in a perfect plastic material, and thinking about that in terms of faults. So, it's one of our first, perhaps, approximations in which we're trying to merge dynamics of the ice, trying to understand the surface profile of the ice, and also recognizing the consequence of that surface profile and the stresses is going to be faults and failure. Just because I know a lot of you're interested in computation, this is what a computer looked like, circa 1951. People were also worried about greenhouses, but a different Worried about greenhouses, but a different type of greenhouse gas. So, Operation Greenhouse, a nuclear explosion, was also launched right around 1951. Now, I particularly like the perfect plastic approximation. There's a ton of insight. You should talk to Liz a little bit. She's extended this so you can actually think about the yield surface going all the way from the bottom and extending out through the calving surface, at which point you can start thinking about simulating calving cliffs. Simulating cabin cliffs. And then coming up to the 1970s, Workland had this beautiful paper talking about the marine ice sheet in spot, which we've been talking about ever since, as far as I can tell. And his insight was that as the thickness increased back here, you would increase stress and strain rate, and that could potentially produce an instability in which things would retreat all the way back through the over-deepening bed. Through the over-deepening bed. What's also really interesting about his study is that he also considered the perfect plastic limit of ice as an interesting insight. And he noticed that in the perfect plastic limit, there was absolutely no steady state, and the entire thing was going to completely disintegrate or advance all the way to its edge, which is kind of similar to a lot of the ideas, or at least I think he was anticipating a lot of the ideas we're talking about today in terms of marine ice cliff instability. In terms of marine ice cleft instability. Computers had started to look a little bit more modern at this point. So, what a computer would look like circa 1974. And, you know, history does tend to repeat. Some of you who are American history buffs will notice that there's also an impeachment trial of a U.S. president in 1974 that did end with a U.S. president resigning and getting on a helicopter. Resigning and getting on a helicopter and stopping being president. So, to come back to this idea of this marine-based cliff instability that people have been talking about, again, I'm not sure that's all that different from tidewater glacier instabilities that people talk about for a long time. But essentially, the idea is that if you have some ice of some thickness, then as that thickness increases, Then, as that thickness increases, you increase the stress. Sorry, the merging ice sheet instability is you increase the stress, you increase the strain rate, and so you can snap back further and further and further as the grounding line retreats into an over-deepening bed. The ring ice cliff instability is somewhat similar in that you have some ice with some thickness. It may not have a floating ice shelf in front of it. And I believe David Pollard talked to you a little bit more. And I believe David Pollard talked to you a little bit more about this later. You increase the stress. If you increase the stress enough, you can potentially break the ice. And if the ice then retreats into an over-deepening bed, the ice gets thicker, the stress increases, and then you potentially continue to fail. What's interesting enough about this is that renice cliff instability is in theory stabilized by viscous flow. So if you flow fast enough, your cliff gets smaller and you're no longer going to fail. Jeremy, one quick question. Why can't or what the time scale for forming the floating tongue versus breaking an ice and going into that instability mode? Was the time scale to flow form a floating ice tongue? Is that your question? Oh, what is the relationship between those two? Well, I don't think that we know the time scale of failure of ice through the marine ice cliff instability. So, to a certain extent, if I could answer your question, we would have this. Answer your question, we would have this solved, right? And I don't know that we actually understand how it breaks and the positive and negative feedbacks well enough to characterize those rates. Sorry, what about the eye shell formation? Can we say anything about that? Yes, but I will not. And I will not because I'm not fully sure that we actually understand how ice shells form. There are some people who tell you that actually ice shells form as only during. As only during retreat, that the actual during an advance, you're actually going to advance all the way up to the continental shelf, and it's only as it kind of pullback that you're going to form an ice shelf. Models are actually pretty good at forming ice shelves, and so if you try and simulate it, most of your models are going to try and form an ice shelf irrespective. But I want to point out is that the marine ice cliff visibility isn't really marine. It depends on the ice thickness. And if the ice thickness increases upstream, Ice thickness increases upstream, even for a prograde bed, you still have the same instability that if you retreat into thicker ice, you have thicker ice, the stress is larger. So there's nothing really uniquely marine about it as I understand it, and I would be interested in hearing other clarifications from other people who have thought about this. But I don't see it as being particularly limited to slope, except for the fact that the places where you're going to expose really thick, deep ice is going to be when you have a rectangle. Is going to be when you have a retrograde slope. So, maybe if you only get to that limit, if you ever do get to that limit, is going to be regions where you have a retrograde slope where you can expose a very deep grounding line. Again, coming back to Brussels Glacier, I'm also not really convinced that there's any ice cliffs that aren't actually unstable. Every time you go out there and look at one of these things, it seems like it's about to break off. But There's clearly rates and interesting things that are going on. So, the idea is that we want to simulate some of these processes, perhaps the detachment of large tagular birds, perhaps marine ice cliff instability. We need some Earies to do it. And one of the earliest attempts is really to use this thing called linear elastic fraction mechanics. And the idea is that we treat the ice as an elastic material, ignore viscous strength. Ignore viscous stresses completely, and assume that you have some kind of sharp starter crack that can initialize fractures from. And if you're looking at brittle fracture mechanics, then roughly speaking, the width of a crack to its length is going to roughly scale like the force opening trying to pull it open divided by the shear modulus. And so you tend to find that brittle failure of ice for typical stresses of hundreds of. Stresses of hundreds of kilopascals up to maybe a megapascal are going to have very narrow crevasses. When you look at bitter crevasses, you should be seeing things that are on the order of millimeters, perhaps centimeters, wide. That is very different from things that we're seeing in all kinds of ice shelves, all kinds of other places, other crosses, where the width is meters or tens of meters. In this case, it's actually closer to the ice stick, was at 400 meters. These are not brittle fractures. There might be a brittle fracture at the top. There might be a brittle fracture at the top of this thing. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me in the least. But this is either initiated as a brittle fracture and has widened over many decades, or it initiated through a process that is totally unrelated to brittle failure, or some combination. It perhaps was excavated by ocean water, something like that. And so when you look at things like this, I don't see this as beating up a real crevasse. I don't see this as being a brittle crevasse. I'm not entirely sure I know what that is. It possibly was a brittle crevasse, but it might also be something different. We need to think a little bit about what we describe as a crevasse. How do we know the thing you're looking at is actually a crevasse? How do we know it's actually a fracture? I think Joe is going to talk a little bit more about that, so I'm only going to hint at this. But I think one of the big advances over the past decade or so. Over the past decade or so, has been this idea that you can glue particles of ice together and treat it as a granular material, and then you can use these discrete element models essentially to break those bonds. And you can learn all kinds of interesting things about the fracture process using that type of approach. These models are actually pretty old. They go back to at least the 1970s. They've been in common use in geology since the 1980s. They can be really They can be really numerically difficult to implement and get converge results with. That you might need very, very high resolution before you actually converge, if you converge at all. So they can be quite challenging. I think that simulations that Joe and other people do are often of the order of minutes for the simulation time. Very difficult to scale that up to century scales. Damage mechanics is another numerical technique that is very popular with. That is very popular with finite element modelers. And theoretical mechanics is kind of, it's a little bit empty, but powerful at the same time. The idea is that you have some volume, some represented volume element, and it's got some fractures or voids in it. And so you can represent damage as the ratio of the actual intact area to the total area and introduce this new variable called damage. And there's a number of assumptions that go with it. Number of assumptions that go with it. The one thing that I kind of want to emphasize is you can simulate curvosis using damage mechanics. This is work by my colleague Bravindra. But it's a numerical method. What you need to combine damage mechanics with is some damage production formulation. And that damage production formulation is hard to ferret out. You can actually simulate linear elastic fracture mechanics using damage mechanics. I'd also like to point out that it's not that damage is fundamental. It's not that damage is fundamentally three-dimensional. And there's a lot of interest in inverting for things called damage, the effect of fractures on the rheology. And it's really not clear how to do that, how to distangle damage from temperature. So we can start to put damage mechanics into ice sheet models. I'm going to try and show you a simulation which we're trying to look at what would happen at a fairly thick cliff and the icebergs that would detach. You'll notice that we're getting That would detach. You'll notice that we're getting this slumping off here. That's because that's where the actual stress is largest. And you get these episodic birds that are breaking off. There's actually in this particular model, there's really not a strong distinction between, always a strong distinction between what the calving front is and where the iceberg begins. But we're getting this buoyant calving. Turns out, if you decide to starve your glacier of mass, then Mass, then it will retreat faster through cavity, which will retreat into deeper ice, and you'll end up with this catastrophic retreat. This is actually one of the dirty secrets of models that try and put fractures in. They often evolve to a state which the entire thing wants to disintegrate. Or they evolve to a state in which the ice never wants to fracture. It's actually quite tricky to get it into a state in which it is cycling between fracture and intact ice. And intact ice. But the difference between the two? The only difference between the two is the mass flux from upstream. And so if you feed it with enough mass, you kind of push it downstream. And if you don't, then it retreats faster into deeper ice. Yeah. This is really interesting because what it suggests to me at least is that there's other carving laws that people have cut that have been cut. That people have cooked, that have been cooked up, that are possibly simple. And it seems to matter as if, so if you have carving as a runaway process where the thicker the carving front gets, the more you're going to carve, then the situation you just described is exactly that. It's very difficult to get into a situation where you carve and then rebuild versus runaway. And then there are other models like Pfizer-Nick's model that would have you understand that carving happens when you get to a Carving happens when you get to a certain critical thickness, but not above, and that seems to be the primary distinction if you view it on a very coarse scale. Does carving happen when you become too thin, or when you get to a certain thickness, and then above that, it just gets faster and faster? Yeah, this is a long question. I am skeptical of models that add melt water into crevasses. I think that there's a number, actually, I think you might have written a paper that. I mentioned it somewhere. You can't just superimpose water pressure into a crevasse. You actually have to figure out the effect that that water pressure has on the stress field. It has actually a huge effect on the stress field. It makes it far more difficult for those crevases to propagate. There are ways that we can do it in terms of trying to simulate that, but I'm a little bit skeptical. I wasn't trying to advocate a particular carving model, draw the distinction between, you know, the sort of zeroth order thing you can look at is does this particular model promote carving at small scales? Model promote carving at small surfaces or at large surfaces? Yeah, so I mean, that is an excellent question, which I will postpone to discussion. I hope. Yeah, I don't have a great answer to that. It's hard to create a physically based model that's based on stress in which you calibrate ice thickness. And that would be my answer to your question. We can also start to look at three-dimensional effects. And it turns out that this kind of idea of a critical thickness really works for flow-like slices. In reality, you have transverse stresses. In reality, you have transverse stresses, and that's affecting things as well. We started to try and play around with that a little bit with a freely floating ice shelf. And you can see that we can start to get rifts that are developing across it, but this is still fairly early on. So just to come back, I don't know that we still understand the process of the control flow of fracture. One of the things I have not talked about at all is submarine mouth and the fact that that has the thickness profile near the terminus. I think that's probably likely to be quite important. We're starting to be able to represent. We're starting to be able to represent individual likes for cabbing events in a way that could potentially be realistic with a little bit more work. And unfortunately, a lot of the ways that we do it are not necessarily using traditional large-scale A-Sheet models. We're at these process-scale model level right now. And translating that into a large-scale A-Sheet model has been quite challenging and something that I think needs more focus. So I think I'm going to end here. So I think I'm going to end here. Do I am I? Yep. I'm not getting yelled at, so that's good. So just so that we can have discussion lubricated by coffee, I'm going to suggest that Joe from the sets up while we have one or two very quick questions. Yep? Yes, okay. This is a quick one. Have you thought at all about icebergs? About icebergs going into Earth system models. I mean, I know that there are other people who have, but do you have any thoughts on sort of how to get into it? You're thinking about the fractions. So part of it, yes, is a question of should they be treated stochastically or as a continuous field? Do you have thoughts on that? I have absolutely no thought on that question. They may be represented in a number of different ways. Yeah. Steve, are you going to heckle me on that? No, no. Are you going to pull me up? No, no, no, this different question. So, you mentioned that there's this little uncertainty about whether viscous creek crosses can alleviate the ice cliff instability or... Well, they can. Sure, sure. It seems like we have a lot of pretty complex models that we could use to better understand what the conditions are where the ice might actually have. The ice might actually have the cliff collapse, or you might have these viscous effects getting rid of the cliff, basically. I mean, why aren't we doing those model experiments? Or should we be? It's not something we're going to be able to look at in a natural laboratory, it doesn't seem like. We'll talk about that after the break. Okay. I just want to expone that question. Okay, I just postponed that question. I wanted to romanize our thoughts. I and I'm sure many others have tons of questions, but if we don't keep going, we won't get coffee, which at least for me is kind of crucial. So with that, Joe Todd from
