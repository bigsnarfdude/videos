Okay, thank you. So yesterday uh I explained the following like uh to motivate the discussion and as an example I motivate that if you study like quantum mech quantum mechanical models try to compute correlation functions on the circle and let them run. Basically uh you want to integrate all you want to integrate over over the configuration space. And in this way, you will find you find that this correlation map intertwines the classical actual quantum version of Paushaw Costum Rosenberg and related to somehow index. I didn't explain in detail how this is related to index but uh somehow ik if you compute it you'll find uh a version of algebraic index in this. A version of algebraic index in this model. So as I promised, I'm gonna explain uh uh how to compute a non-semi-simple example of quantum B model. Uh so today I'm gonna prepare for uh like discussion tomorrow on that particular example. And so to motivate, we're gonna we're gonna focus on a 2D example today. So we're gonna focus on a Taurus. And of course the discussion generalized to some other like uh Riemann surface and uh I also mentioned uh along the way some generalizations to higher dimensional cases. But anyway this is my torus and I write it in such a way that basically you have to identify You have to identify this point. Z is identified with Z plus 1, which Z plus Tau. So tau is an element in the upper half plane, which is the moduli of this torus, the curve. So again, we're going to discuss a parallel discussion story. a parallel discussion uh story of this guy. So you're gonna I w I will I will discuss correlation functions on the on the torus and let them run. And uh it will it will also intertwine a chain complex which is called a chiral chain complex. And at the end of the day you will also discover an index which we call a chiro algebraic index. So but we cannot focus on a specific model for simplicity. Like we can certain we cannot focus on uh just for chiro We're gonna focus on uh just for chirobos. Um this model uh it is rather simple. It's like the action functional is uh given by this. I guess most people are familiar with this example. Um And its integration is against a normalized volume form. I gonna use the following notion. We're gonna write this volume form as like I dz d d bar over Or twice image part of tau. This is normalized in the way that if you integrate one, you get one. And this is also has a nice modular property. And uh we're gonna interest it in uh the structure for like uh local correlations and their integration. For example, For example, first one is local correlation of the following form. If you compute some local correlating functions for such an uh observable, let me just write polymorphic derivative some powers. on this torus. And as well, as I mentioned, like some some some standard notions of non-commutative geometry appears. For example, this h this Horshall chain complex appears when you let them run on the circle. It's gonna have something similar. So we're gonna run let let the points run on the torus. So I want to integrate them. So and their integration. Integration integration on on the on the Taurus or on actually on on the product of Taurus. You let me run on the Taurus. I would see like if you do this uh uh process you will find something interesting. Okay and uh as we know from like uh standard coercion quantum field theory like this model, if you want to compute such a core field. Model, if you want to compute such a correlation function, you can write down, like, uh, express everything here as a vertex and write down the propagator from this uh action functional, and then you can use find my rules and so on. So for example, our vertex here looks like K1, you have K1 address and so on, Kn. And then the dynamics gonna be encoded in this propagation. Encode it in this propagator. So let me write down the propagator and then see what's happening. So the propagator is a two-point function. In this case, I'm going to compute the propagator of the following. We compute the two-point function of this of this insertion on the torus. And uh this can be written down actually explicitly in this example. We basically this is a rather uh simple model. So for example let me write it down. It's given by uh expressed in terms of Green's function or more particularly by like West transp functions and so on. by like worse transp functions and so on. So so I choose a flat metr standard flat metric. You can write down the Laplacian and the La Pacian in the in the uh in this uh coordinate is given by this this is the actually this is standard Laplacian if you write in real coordinates. And if you write down the corresponding Green's function, which is the kernel of the inverse of this Laplacian. Now yesterday we we just inverted uh looked at the screen function for the time derivative. Now this time in two decades uh we have In 2D case, we have this Grand function and the corresponding propagator for this guy is given by if you look at the expression, it's given by basically two times derivative of the grains function. Because you're computing the correlation function for the derivative, so if you look at what's what's what's the what's the what What's kind of the operator you invert here? You find like this basically if you have two derivatives, holomorphic derivatives, then it's it's it behaves like a dz over dz bar and that's the propagator. And you can write it down actually rather explicitly. This propagator is given by um I just give you the answer. I mean this can be computed explicitly, it's given by the following expression. The following expression. The first one, if you compute it, you find the following. Like, first let me write it down. So it has two components. The first one uh is uh is basically WestRasp function. So so here Here, when I say z tau, it's the it's the Verstross P function. So, here's this is a lattice. And there's a second term, E2 star. And E2 star is the corrected instance series given by the following, E2 star. So let me first write it down. So let me first write it down. Minus 3 over pi, 1 over image part of tau. So this guy is the second ison stat series. Uh we know like uh i for this SS tensor, E4, E6 and so on, they're they're modular, but E2 is not. They are modular, but E2 is not. E2 is called a quasi-moduli. But it can complete this E2 to be a modular object by this correction. So this is like one over image part of tau. Sometimes people write that in this people sometimes write this this notion limit. I will also explain this limit later. It has actually a very geometric meaning. Basically in this limit, this is written as like one over power minus tau. as like one over tau minus tau bar in this limit people just write the limit as the e to tau which is the second Einstein series. So this limit intertwines the um which is called almost holomorphic mod object to this uh quasi modular form. Okay, so this is uh I just laid down all the information to compute for example this correlation function on the on the EPT curve. Um so So in principle, you just insert this family rules, this propagator, to this vertex, and you can compute this core local correlations. And then I want to explain how to compute their integral. And this integral is going to be playing an important role because the way you let them run on the torus is will create some homological property. Okay. Okay. Uh any any questions so far? This is a very specific model. The reason I explained this model is because uh tomorrow I will explain that uh actually this example uh if you look study a version of chiro deformation of this example you you basically study uh like uh like a quantum BCU theory on the epic curve. And you can actually use this technique that I This technique that I'm gonna explain today to compute explicitly the quantum invariance on the HB curves and to show it's identical to the mirror Gromo-Witting invariance. So this is actually a semi-simple example. So this is the goal for tomorrow, but I need to do some preparation today. Now let me explain how to do integration. Let me explain how to do integration. That's actually one of the key points here. So let's first uh uh implement the standard technique in corner field theory and then see what kind of trouble we have and then ch see how to solve it. Suppose I have a like uh like a graph like oriented graph. Graph suppose without self-loops. Say, suppose my graph, my element can build something like that. It could be complicated, but anyway, suppose this is one of my examples, my graph. Z1, Z2. Two, let's say, like that, like that. This orientation at this moment is not important, but uh in some other cases it will be. And so let's let this one denote the set of edges for this graph and let B denote the set of vertex. I can just denote this words like index them by 1, 2, 3 essential. So in the here in here, for simplicity. It's the simplest way to index. Then I can associate, for example, from this Simon rule, a versions of integral. So we can assign the integrand, let's call it one phi gamma, as the log. As the local part of the information of local correlation by basically assigning this Feynman rules to this graph that this is a propagator can act in any two vertexes. So this this two means like tail and he the head of the of the edge. And that's that's how you write down these Feynman rules. It's the integrand or this local correlation. And for example it for this particular gamma here, this phi gamma looks like a Like a so you have three propagators connecting one and two, and one two connecting two and three. So you find like a p hat z1, z2, this example cubed, and uh propagator z2, z3 squared. Okay, that's uh how you write down this uh ethression. Now, as I mentioned, like As I mentioned, like I want I want the point run on the Taurus and then do the integration. And uh let me call this one uh i hat gamma. I want to define this integration as the as the following guy. Like Like I from one to n take a volume and by gamma. And that's the standard way of writ writing stone. Um this will contribute a particular particular element if you integrate such a thing and this is a integrate such a thing and this is uh but one contribution from the graph. And if you look at this one you immediately see uh the trouble. One of the trouble here is like um this one is very singular, could be very very singular when two points collides. Because for example, this one has voice raspy function, so it has order two poles. So it has order two pole from here. And if you multiply many of them, like this pole order can be very big. And depends on how complicated your graph is. The pole could be like when one point approach the other. It could be like, yes? This is just a f f femin graph. And then you just you integrate on each Yeah, you just uh you integrate on e each each in each uh manifold. It's just a Famine graph. Yes? Oh but but is it like it's just a propagator of the theory? So it's it's a particular Feynman diagram. It's not the embedded graph on the on the on the on the space. You can do the other models like uh when when this r when this remains surface appear in a different way. But this this is just a Feynman diagram. This is just a Simon diagram for this model. No, this tour is the is the my underlying space. So i if you con consider quantum field theory or any space, you have an action functional, you can write down Feynman rules and that's it. That's what I mean by by this one. So I'm basically look looking at Kyle Boson on the on the Taurus. This is where you build up this uh quantum field theory and then you write down This uh quantum field theory, and then you write down the corresponding Feynman rules. You have propagators. The propagator is related to the geometry of the of the torus of and then the vertex that or that you or the local observables is the one you put you insert here and then you compute it using Feynman rules. It's not the embedded curve in the in the in the geometry. Uh but somehow um But anyway, you don't see this problem yesterday because yesterday we looked at the mapping space from the circle to the phase space. And in a one-dimensional case, the corresponding propagator is actually bounded. It's a bounded function. So yesterday, if you just do integration, it's actually convergent. But in this case, in general, this is also true. In topological field theory, there's a way to compactify. There is a way to compactify the configuration space such that such integration extends to the compactified space, which is a manifold with corner. But for the holomorphic theory, there's no way of doing this actually. At the end of the day, I tell you another way to compactify the configuration space, which is called a Schringer compactification, which allows such arguments. But at this moment, just let us just look at this expression. Just let let us just look at this expression. So this pole could be like uh this integration. The the pole could be like one over z to the power of like 2024, which is a disaster. So but how to integrate? Uh there are a bunch of ways you can integrate such a thing. Um in physics like people you usually use these point splitting regularization things. Or if you want to do some more intrinsic object uh you can you can work on some versions of like principal values and things like that. Values and things like that. So I'm gonna explain the homological way of doing this. So this is my naive thing. Uh this is um this object I want to in I want to uh explain. But uh to be more precisely defined, I will define a regularized integral to implement this integration. And it turns out uh if you do this regularized integral, intertrends all of the expected operators, you intertrend Operators. You will interturn a chiro analog of the Hausher-Train complex and so on. So let me try to explain how to recognize such an integral like geometrically. Basically, this is a version of Cauchy principle value. But let me actually there's a version of building this integral in the geometry. This integral in a geometric way. This is a method that I designed with my colleague Jejo. So let me try to explain this. To illustrate what's happening, let's start with one integration, like just focus on integration on the Riemann surface. Suppose omega is a twoform on Riemann surface. And this Riemann surface could have boundary. So let me write in such a way. This is the boundary of the Riemann surface. And suppose I have some points inside, which is going to be the poles. And this is a two-form on the Riemann surface. And this is a two-form on the Riemann surface with possibly uh poles along these uh points, interior points, with a Meromorphic pole. Uh could be poles of arbitrary order. It's not meromorphic, it's a smooth to form. It's not meromorphic, it's a smooth two form with meromorphic pole. It's two form. It's smooth form with meromorphic pole. What this means is the following. Like, means like locally, so suppose a near point, this means locally. So locally uh locally near uh uh the pole, it it looks like a uh the pole. It it looks like um can be written as like a smooth sin dz by H D D bar over some Meromorphic pole and Z to some n. So f is a smooth function. This is not a Meromorphic function form, it's a it's a smooth form with possibly Meromorphic pole. And uh and actually And actually, this one is much uh i will have uh such a structure. I mean if you if you look at uh every single variable, if you look at say Z1, so you look at how to integrate Z1, this is the integration on the whole Riemann surface, uh, on the on the surface. Then C1 will see poles at Z2 in central, but let's we can just do integration one by one. Uh I'm gonna leave this one. Um then there's uh Then there's a geometric way of doing this integration like this. It's equivalent to the Cauchy principal value, but this formulation turns out to be very useful for many other purposes. Let me try to explain. Lemma. It's a very simple thing. So it has pole. So naively you cannot integrate such a thing. For example, at pole could be like 2024. But you can do a reduction pole. And to turn this one into the following, we can always Oh, by the way, in many this community, people study A cycle or B cycle integrals of this kind of thing to avoid the pole. I will explain the relation with A cycle things, this stuff later. But for me, I want to integrate over the whole surface. And you can always decompose this two-form in the following, like alpha plus del beta. It's a holomorphic way of doing integration. So alpha is alpha is a two-form with only log pole. So so local is like a local. You locally look like uh like F D Z batch D V bar at most with pole of order one F smooth. So beta is something uh is a zero one form with up triple it's a zero one form with up triple Along D. And this this del is the holomorphic Duram. So the lemma is like starting from any object here, you can always decompose this one into the sum of two. One is at most lock pole. The other one is zero one form. Like it could be very sing singular, but it doesn't matter. Singular, but it doesn't matter. And such decomposition always exists and it's not unique. You can always construct such a thing locally by reduction poles, and then you can use a partition of unity to glue them and write down such an expression. And as I mentioned, this decomposition is not unique. But anyway, but this is something you can you can build up. And so this is a very simple And so this is a very simple lemma. So but let me just state here. So this is not unique, decomposition not unique. Then we can define the following. Let's c l let's l let me call this one Reich Rice integral on on the on the Riemann surface by First, you see, this is like a lock pole. Lock pole is always absolute convergence. You can just integrate. Uh there's a beta here. Uh the beta beta has poles along uh this point, but beta is actually smooth on the boundary. So you can integrate beta on the boundary. And this is a well-defined integration. And this is a well-defined integration. This is d uh absolute absolutely well-defined integration. The first one is absolute convergent, and this is also smooth here. And uh one remain remarkable thing is like this one is independent of the choice of the decomposition, actually it's unique, uniquely determined. Doesn't depend on the decomposition, the choice of alpha beta. The choice of alpha beta. And this allows me to define an integration on the Riemann surface for objects with poles like that. And this actually can be viewed as a geometric way of doing racialization on the Riemann surface. And it's basically a Cauchy principle value. And the reason I designed it in such a way is to show the following. So we know like in standard calculus. So we know like in standard calculus we have uh one of the main tools is is the Stokes theorem. Stokes theorem intertwines the DROM with the boundary. But in the complex world you have two differential. One of them is like D bar and the other one is D. And you may ask like whether there's some versions of integration interturning these two differential. But actually it is true for this particular example. Actually there's some higher dimensional version as well. You can show like As well. You can show like this integration intertwines, for example, the holomorphic Durham with the boundary, that's the holomorphic Stokes theorem, and intertwines the other operator, like del bar, with the rest 2, basically. So actually, if you impose this, if you start with something satisfying this kind of thing, you can use the same thing. Satisfying this condition. It turns out these two conditions, these two homological conditions, uniquely determine this map, such a map. And I just gave you an explicit formula. But this is one of the key points. So with this integration, now I can let my points run on the torus and define my required integral for this local correlation. Recruit integral for these local correlations. Then, for f for this graph integral, I just define my graph integral to be, now it's my definition. Uh I just do it one by one, recognized integral one by one. MI integrant, this local correlation. As you know, like, it starts from every single point. Uh if you try to integrate, for example, Zn, Zn will see poles along Zn minus 1, Zn minus 3, et cetera, like that. But as I mentioned, you can define such integration. And then you can show after you integrate, it still remains the same form. You can keep doing it again. The same form. You can keep doing it again and so on. And eventually you just do it. It's such iterated regularized integral. And then this is a well-defined mathematical object. It's actually, you can show also that it's a little bit tricky, but you can show this doesn't depend on the choice of the order. That's m that's a little bit more difficult. This is the residue is for smooth one zero form. It actually can show the usual residue for the meromorphic thing. Extension to the smooth case by saying that uh suppose you have a smooth form. Recl residue at RMP. Because it's smooth one f uh let's say uh some gamma. This is like zero one zero form. Because it's smooth, so if you try to put a put a cycle here, it depends on the cycle. It depends on the cycle, we shrink it. But the limit exists. You can show this limit exists. Limit. If some goes to zero, this limit exists. So this arrest you Meromorphic. It's gonna be Meromorphic for is all the poles gonna be Meromorphic. So this is like a one-zero form with Meromorphic Pole. Then you can show for such form, the limit exists. So it the limit exists. So it it is because it's it's smooth, it's not uh Meromorphic. So the usual like if you if you deform the cycle the value will change. But it can show that if you shrink the shrink the circle to zero, the limit exists. That's the re that's the residue. And in the case this is like a Meromorphic one form. This is constant, so the limit is the same. But in a smooth case, the limit exists, which is the residue. So the Here integration is actually the sum of all the rascals around the points on the Riemann circuit. the rustles around the points on the remote surface. Yes, if you if in my case it's torus without boundary, then you just look at alpha. Yes. There's no beta. Yes. Yeah, this works for like uh gamma is like f smooth dz over z to the n and you integrate gamma epsilon or like say z equal if ipsrum and then let if go to zero. So this limit exists for any smooth function. Yeah, you can you can show this like any smooth function, like z bar m. Smooth something like Z bar M, but it's gonna be zero. Because if you see, look at the angle, you see, like this. If you do this, integral all along the angle, it's gonna be vanishing. It can be any smooth function. Just in the case of this meromorphic, then this is a constant. But in general, it will change the value when you sh when you deform the cycle. But if you choose your holomorphic coordinate, and then in any holomorphic coordinate, you write down this unique circle and show, you shrink the radius, the limit. Show, you shrink the radius, the limit exists, and doesn't depend on the choice of the holomorphic coordinate as well. This is uh uh actually intrinsic. This is uh also this is a w uh 1D version. Actually, there's also a higher dimensional version, but yes. Uh uh like if I I think in physics like people use this point splitting way. Just like you use way. Just like if you you sh if you let if you let the points uh you ch choose a cutoff. Don't allow points to be very close. And first integrate and take the limit. You can show it exists. The point here is like this formulation is intrinsic. There's a lot of issues when you try to see like oh for example the point splitting method if you're trying to coordinate how things change and and so on. Um but uh but but somehow this formulation is intrinsic. It's geometric. Yes. Well, just some expressions of I mean for specifically there's some propagators. Yeah, it's some some something like that I mentioned, like just that just one of the examples. It could be some combinations of this uh this uh this uh just uh this brace trust p function. Yeah, yeah. Just just like that. Yeah, yeah. Just just like that. I mean yeah. It could be something just just just like complicated combinations of this uh this propagator. Yeah, yeah. But just because it's a wise trash p function has pole, you know like the brain's function anyway. Yes. So it doesn't very function. Consider something like uh copies of beta gamma. Something like a copy of beta gamma BC system, which can be viewed as a mapping space from Taurus to some complex space. And it turns out that model can have very similar, basically a parallel construction of what I did yesterday about the equal mechanical case. Okay, so now I just explained, like, this is a geometrically, intrinsically defined object. It doesn't, also, this is for mini-type series. And uh also this for mini type theorem works, like if you if you change the order, which is the important uh which is uh which is doesn't doesn't depend on the price of the uh order. And this is gonna be very important for calculations. So let me just state a theorem. Uh I can state it here. You can look at this construction in my paper with Jedi in the in this uh same paper for any graph for example it's actually the statement is more general but but let me just state uh in in in our case for any uh graph um if you use the reclass integral as I defined here Use the recalized integral as I defined here to integrate such an object. You get a number. And this number actually depends on top. This is my compact structure. And you can show this is well defined and eventually you get the result of a so-called almost holomorphic modular form. So this guy as a function of tau If an almost holomorphic modular form in the sense of cannacles are gear and in particular, I mean, this is a very important thing. And in particular, I mean, this is like can be written as an element of the ring generated by E two star and E4 E6. And the modular weight is uh is twice the number of edge. It can be more general, you can put decorations on the g on the graph, you can put derivatives and and things like that. It's uh it's a little bit more generalization of this statement. But uh Of this statement. But the rough idea is the same. So if you do this integration, you get a well-defined number. This number has a modular property. It's not holomorphic, but it's almost holomorphic. It has a mild anti-holomorphic dependence involving this E2 star here. And let me give you one example. Actually you can compute this one uh efficiently. Uh it's actually uh fun thing to do when you start. But it it quickly gets into complicated. But it it quickly gets into complicated. But uh for example, if you let me let me look at a triangle, let's say this diagram, one, two, three. And uh the corresponding integrand is like if you have three edge, so you have three propagator. So you this is the corresponding functions like z1, z2. This is a propagator z2, z3. Z2, Z3 and the propagator Z3, Z1. And then the Raglized integral that I want to do is basically you have three vertex, so you you do three copies of this uh curve uh for to do this integrand. And you can show using this property, basically using this uh homologous. Basically, using this homological property that you can show. It's a little bit tedious calculation, but it can be done easily. It's related to an old work of inophysics about Michael Douglas and his calculations on the A cycle, but this is an integration of the but this is a this is a integration of the remass in the whole curve. You're gonna for Michael Douglas when he was doing this point slow speed calculation on basically calculated the same like cubic interaction on on the on the on the torus. And then later I think uh that's a long time ago I guess. I don't know wh whether it's the first one but it's uh early paper it's like 1980 something I guess. Probably there be some other ones you please let let please let me know. But it's a Please let me let please let me know. The f the first time I ra I read the calculation, it's not for this integration, it's for A cycle integral. Uh as I saw this calculation by Michael Douglas. I haven't studied. That's a good question. Yes? Six. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry, yeah, yes, yes, yes, sir. Sorry, sorry, yes, yes. This is a square uh yes, this is this is a way six, yes. Thank you. Yeah. Uh but l now let me uh I want to explain. Uh there actually there's actually uh um people started People study what what people study b uh more is the is so called acycle integral. This is actually related to this one by by the following. But let me let me before we explain that, let me just remark that uh recent uh recently there's work by Chou Xiaoyang who actually showed that uh there's an algorithm to compute any such graph integral, they get an explicit answer. Answer. You can compute such a thing in general. This kind of integrations. It's a rather explicit algorithm. So you can implement into the computer and then and to to s to get the get expression. But this is a just you can do it. But this is uh just you can do it by hand. Now one of the key points here is uh that I want to connect this uh result with some other previous result is the following. Um and the theorem as a theorem is the in the st in the same paper, you can you can find it, but I want to state it. Uh But I wanna state it uh this is actually the key one of the key property as well. So you see like this function has poles, meromorphic poles when one point approach the other. So what u usually people do is the following, like if you on the torus you pick n district representative of the A cycle. That's what usu people usually do. That's what usu people usually do. Like AI, AI plus one. And um and then you can somehow integrate uh like Meromorphic one forms over these A cycles. Um for example you can you can this is like because uh this meromorphic pole. So if you if the point This memory proposal. So if you if the points is they're destroyed, then this integration is well defined. But you will see something interesting, like if you just pick an arbitrary choice, this is uh neither like uh it's not it's neat it's not uh uh even um quotient modular. But there's some interesting combination which make the integration quasi-modular. This is actually studied a lot in the in the in the literature. But actually we find the reason for this. The reason is is the following. This. The reason is the following. Like, it's like actually there's a physics reason behind this. But precisely, we can show the limit of this rag-last integral. By the way, when I say limit, in this process, this limit means topic goes to infinite limit. This limit just There's a limit just means sending E2 star to E2, E4 to E4, E6, and E2. It just means like E2 star goes to E2, E4 goes to E4, E6 goes to E6. This is what I mean by this limit. But I can some other uh explanation, but in this particular example, I just mean like if you do it this integration, you find it lies in this ring. It lies in this ring. And you shrink, you let this variable to be infinity, means like you kill this term. And so you end up with something which is holomorphic in tau. Now you can show the limit equals one over n factorial and sum over the permutation and integrate uh this A cycles. Basically you choose A cycles and choose variables and you average your choice. It's like a And you average the your choice. It's like a wire ordering. So so basically you do this Meromorphic integral. This is this is uh also mathematical well mathematically well defined. This is like uh will only pause when points collide. will only pose when points collide. But when they're disjoint, we can integrate. Because it's meromorphic, you can move the cycle a little bit. The value is is locally constant. But things can be complicated when one of the choice, the A cycle, like across the other. You will introduce introduce some restios and so on. But now you average all the possible ordering and uh the answer equals the limit. That's one of the statements. And this is a statement which actually we connect to what we call chiro index because you see like if you do a s if you understand if you view things as acycle integral, what you really discovered is quantum mechanical interpretation. Basically what you do is like you push forward to the circle. Now all the information from Now, all the information from A cycle with some local operators on the circle. And you do some wire ordering. And then for this quantum mechanical system, you can compute the trace in the sense that I explained yesterday. You get an index and so on. And that's a that's how you get an uh get a index which is depends on this tau holomorphically. And that's what we call chiro index. But I will do I will do it tomorrow. But I will do it tomorrow. Another thing I want to mention is that uh uh you get a precise holomorphic normal equation in this case and you got this holomorphic normal equation which captured this anti-holomorphic dependence precisely. I I don't mean the that partic specific holomo holomorphic normal equation from just uh uh the the the classical BCO paper, but uh this is a holomorphic normal equation equation means me uh I mean this one has a tau bar dependence. You can write down this tau bar dependence precisely by the following uh result. So let me just try to write it down. So let y denote some gamma. No, each particular gamma, each gamma, yes. No, each particular gamma, each gamma, yes. Yes. Um so now y equals suppose y equals minus pi pi over image part of tau. Let's introduce this variable. Then in this expression, you see like this is the leading term of this of this expression. So if you see like this poly it has a polynomial dependence in one of e in magic part of tau. And this is the leading term. And this is the leading term. The next result allows you to compute all terms by the following. So if you compute basically you compute the dependence on one over image part of tau. one over image part of tau because this object is polynomial dependence on one over image part of tau. I just organize in such a way. The answer is given by equals and the in the the integrand also has uh has a as a as a dependence on imag one image part of tau because of this uh this expression, this propagate propagator. So the answer is like if you switch the derivative. Yeah, the difference is given by uh a sum of resilience and take any two points. Now um you delete one of the points, let's call this one A. Let's call this one A, and just take a residue of Z A, the value of the residue of V A at Z B, and the residue is calculated for the second order. So and basically this part is rather explicit because the the the integrand is built up by the by this uh built up by uh by this uh this by this propagator. So each one has a h's explicit dependence here. But this this one is not explicit. And this one is something you want to compute. And it's given by recursively uh to some some vertex with with with graph with lower vertex. You look at the rustials when one point approach the other, you t take the rustial with this particular order. And this equation is This equation allows you to compute all the the flow expression basically. And this is in the this this term is in the paper next to this one. So it's our work the second paper paper in this series. You can find this result. And finally, I just mentioned, but probably I won't have time to discuss, just to connect to what we So, what we discussed yesterday, just a quick remark. Just a remark. Yesterday, we studied the geometry of a circle. You let them run, and you've got Hosho. And you can show, you do the same thing on the Taurus. On the torus and let them run. And then this one intertwines this Benins and dream field elliptic colour homometer. And this is in my work with Tem Tingui. You can find this construction, which is Which is a elliptic Bayesian dream field elliptic trace map on Chiar algebras. So you can find uh this explanation in this paper. Um this trace map is This trace map is similar to the trace map on the circle where you discover this index. And if you compute trace, for example, like a beta gamma system, things like that, you discover like the Witten general and so on. But it's analog to what you obtained from this Irof genres from the from the circle upstairs. And finally, I just uh I wanna mention there's higher dimensional version of such such a chiro theory. Of such a chiro theory for this particular integration. And this is recognized in a different way. This is recognized by a version of Schwinger campaign. So just let me mention his work, Ming Hao Wang. It's higher-dimensional chiro theory. And basically Basically, uh it turns out if you go to higher dimensional cases, this gets more complicated. And also, as I mentioned, in the topological theory, like three-seme theory and things like that, if you try to look study this graph integral, you can always find the compatibility of the configuration space such that the integrand extends and is very defined. But for the chirop theory, there's no way of doing that. But as uh remarkably, there's a different way of doing this, uh Remarkably, there's a different way of doing this uh config configuration space, compatibility, using this Schringer parameter. And this is done. Like say C on CN and you have this D bar complex. You invert this D bar as a propagator and try to integrate. You can show this is still finite, it will be finite and using a different compatification. I can I can explain this one to you in person. Yes. So So what are the data? The data? This one? Oh, it's uh it's uh uh this year. So January this year, I think. Actually he explained this his work in the in in in Shanghai last month, ICBS conference. So so but uh but anyway. Yeah. And he explained m uh not only uh holomorphic theory but also uh mixing between uh topological holomorphic. It also works. Topological, holomorphic. It also works. And so it's a combination of the story that I mentioned. It's a, yeah, that's just, I mean him. Yes. Jungpin, yeah, Jungpin now, yeah, he's joining Simis. So so yeah, it's great to have him there. Okay, so that's uh one of the techniques that I uh also kind of framework I explained today. So tomorrow I will explain So tomorrow I will explain yes. I want to solve my problem. I want to solve the the mirror symmetry conjecture on the curve. That's a very particular problem I want to solve. But but of course you can, for example, you may ask like, oh let's try to study uh such an integration on the on the Riemann surface. Try to study for example single module form, all these kind of k interesting module forms. Of interesting motor forms? I think it's a very good question. I have never spent any time studying them. But yeah. One of the reasons I studied this one particular is just because I want to solve the particular conjecture. And that I will explain tomorrow. So it's a particular conjecture about this EP curve, this mirror symmetry on EP curve. It's a it's a very difficult in the sense that uh it's non-semi-simple. So this is this uh this reconstr all this kind of reconstruction theorem. So all these kind of reconstruction theorems for uh for semi-simple s s semi-simple things doesn't work. But uh you can you can still do quantization using this uh this method. So I will explain how to obtain uh such example tomorrow using this method. So but let me uh I I think my time is up. Let me stop here.
