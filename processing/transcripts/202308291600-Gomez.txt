Okay, so hello everybody. I can see only five persons there. I want to thank the organizers for inviting me and I want to say that I'm really sorry not being able to accompany you there in Oaxaca to have fun. So in this occasion, I'm going to talk about Occasion: I'm going to talk about Grobner fans and embedded resolutions of ideas on Tauric varieties. This is from a joint work with Francanta Roca in Jusé Murtada that was published in, I think it was last December, so it's quite recent. Okay, so I'm going to start the presentation and see. Oh no, I can open up in the presentation here. Do you know what's the to see the presentation? Do you know if the F5 is not working? Do you know where to find it? Oh no, sorry, I don't know how to put it as a presentation. So I'm going to show just the dia positives in order. Okay, so first I'm going to talk about toric resolutions of Newton and the general ideas in On the general ideas in for ideas inside the ring of polynomials in S variables. And so now I'm going to talk about the motivation of this work. So the existence of resolution of singularities when working over fields of characteristic zero was proved by Hironaka in the 60s. And this resolution of singularity remains still open for characteristic P. open for characteristic P. A huge amount of work has been done to simplify Hironaka's work in characteristic zero and and for now we've been able to make some small improvements to the singularity by a sequence of blowing ups in smooth centers. So the motivation of this work comes from the fact that given a subvariety of a normal toric variety eczema, we are going to define this later on. Are going to define this later on. In general, there exists no toric embedded resolution. Sorry, you have a question? No. Okay, sorry, there was a comment. Yeah, I cannot see the full screen. Oh, it's okay. So this can be already noticed in for curves embedded in the plane in the plane, and we have some. And we have some works that have been done on that subject. So, there is an important conjecture of Bernard Jussier stating that atoric resolutions exist after embedding or sub-variety Y in a higher dimensional affine space in any characteristic. And our work, you know, our work we focus on the existing historic resolution of singularities, which satisfy the Which satisfy the relevant property of the singularizing in only one step, regardless of the characteristic. We insist here that in the context of this work, the embedding is fixed and we extend the notion of Newton non-degeneracy to the sub-variety Y that we are trying to designularize to guarantee the existence of such storage embedded resolution. Okay, so the notion of So the notion of Newton non-degeneracy was introduced first for hypersurfaces in affine spaces. They were introduced in the 70s by Kovansky, Koshnirenko and Varchenko, and it guaranteed the existence of toric resolution of singularities. Recently, this was generalized in higher co-dimension using some equivalent notions to this Newton non-degeneracy, which had been Have been the source of certain nouns, as shown varieties, and Newton non-degenerate ideas. So, we are going to work with Newton non-degenerate ideas. And this definition was introduced in the work with Fuen Santa Roca in 2013. And this definition that we gave generalized the Newton non-degeneracy property for hypersort. generic property for hypersurfaces and for any i think it was given the definition was also given for intersection complete varieties and um so this definition says the following given an ideal we can take a vector in the first ordant and we can define the initial ideal of this of i by taking the ideal by taking the idea generated by the initial sparse of any polynomial in I and then seeing the idea that it generates. Okay, so this initial part of polynomials in F is defined in terms of evaluation. And for example, for a polynomial F, which has its expansion as a sum of monomials, we so we have a polynomial in So we have a polynomial and we know that this sum is a finite sum of monomials where only a certain exponent have coefficients different from zero. So this set of exponents is called the support of f. And we define the initial part of a polynomial f with respect to a vector omega as the sum of only the monomials where the inner product Where the inner product with our vector omega minimizes over all the exponents alpha in the support of our polynomial f. So we call this minimum value of the inner product in the support as the omega order of f. And the initial ideal of i is taken by seeing what's the ideal generated by the initial parts of any polynomial in f. So we say that an ideal in the ring of That an ideal in the ring of polynomials is called Newton non-degenerate if, for every omega in the first ordant, the variety defined by this initial ideal does not have singularities outside the coordinate hyperplanes. Okay? The variety defined by an Newton non-degenerate idea is then called Newton non-degenerate. Newton non-degenerate. And in the work with Fensanta Roca and Kuram in 2013, we showed that it is possible to find a resolution of singularity for Newton and the generic variety inside an affine space. So for this, we define a fun called the Grogner fun of the ideal eye and for fan of the ideal I and for this we define equivalence relations in the vectors in R S, if we are or ideals is in S variables, where we say that two vectors are equivalent if the initial ideals that they define with respect to I are equal. So when we take the closure of this equivalence class, we Equivalence class, we obtain a polyhedral fan. And inside the interior of each of these fans, we have that the initial ideal of i remains invariant. Okay? So when we take the intersection of this fun with the first ordant in all the subfaces of the first ordant, we obtain a subdivision of the first ordin, which that is. Ordin, which that is what we call the Grobner Phi of the ideal I. And if we consider a regular subdivision of this Grobner fun of I, that means another fun that in which in each con we have the initial ideal of I remains invariant. And with the fun satisfying that each support, I mean the union of each cone is. Support, I mean, the union of its cone is again the first ordant, we can obtain a toric modification associated to sigma that gives a toric resolution of the variety defined by the DRI. So this toric modification goes from a toric variety that is obtained by the gluing of charts, which are associated to the maximum. To the maximal cones in orphan sigma. So they are glued in some way. And in each of these charts, we can see the morphism phi as a rational morphism, which is defined as the following. So in the chart associated to a cone sigma, which is generated by the columns of a unimodular. Of a unimodular matrix P. So we take the generators, we form the matrix P, we consider the transpose of the matrix P, and then we define for each of the columns of this transpose, that means the columns and lines. What are the elements of a matrix? So we have the columns and the Las filas como eden en inglés? Interpros. Okay, so in this chart, we are defining originally we take the generators of the cone sigma, we put them in columns, so we transpose, and then the columns of this transpose matrix define a monomial, sorry, a rational morphism where in each component we in each component we take the we use the multi-index notation to say that a vector in Cs is sent in the first component to the to the row of the first matrix the first row of the matrix P or the first column of the transpose matrix of P. In the second, we have U to the second column of P transpose and etc. So this morph is And etc. So, this morphism goes from Cs to Cs and it has some properties. So, the origin of this map is called the toric variety associated to sigma. As I said, it is constructed by gluing affine toric varieties associated to each of the maximal cones in sigma. This is a house of variety. This morphism that we defined previously is proper and birational. Previously, it is proper and birational, and is in fact biregular in the complement of the coordinate hyperplanes, and is called the toric modification associated to sigma. Okay, so remember we constructed sigma by giving a subdivision of the Grovener fine of the ideal i that we want to designularize. Okay, so in the affine chart associated to a maximal con, we Maximal con, we can identify orbits where we can see, and in these orbits, we can see how are the irreducible components of the total transform of the variety defined by the idea that we want to singularize. And for example, if we want to see the behavior of To see the behavior of, for example, the strict transform of our variety, we can see what is the behavior inside of each orbit, what is the intersection, and see properties of this irreducible component by focuses or working in these orbits. Okay? So, do you have any questions so far? No, everything is okay. No, everything is okay. Okay, so the result that we proved in, I think it was 2013, sorry, is that if we start by a Newton non-degenerate variety Bi, which is containing Cs without singularity in the origin, we prove that the toric modification associated to a regular refinement of the Grobner phi of I satisfies that it is a, well, Well, if we consider the variety defined by I, so the strict transform has its irreducible components. So these irreducible components are all smooth. In particular, one of the irreducible components is the strict and form of the variety defined by I, which is the closure of the pre-image of the variety defined by I by removing the point outside the coordinate hyperplanes. The coordinate hyperplanes. We prove that this strict transform is non-singular, and we prove that the intersection of the strict transform of VI with the remaining irreducible components, which come from the image of the origin, that is the how do you call this set? The intersectional locus? The intersectional. The intersectional is transversal, and we can identify which are the orbits in which we can analyze the behavior of the strict transform. Okay, so I'm not going to focus on this part. So, what we are obtaining with the Turing modification associated to a regular defining of the Grobner file of a mutant non-degenerate ideal is precisely as At the singularization of the origin inside the variety I. So we're going to use this result to construct to work on, to extend the notion of mutant degeneracy to ideas J defining varieties embedded in the toric in a toric normal variety X sigma, which is associated to a cone in Rn. This is what we're going to see later on. This is what we're going to see later on, and prove that we can, that is associated variety admits a toric embedded resolution of singularity, generalizing the result that we just showed. So now to work with resolution of embedded Newton non-generic ideas, we need to explain the elements we are working on. The elements we are working on. So we start with an idea inside the tollic variety associated to a cone. We're going to construct this variety and see how this is constructed. Okay, so we start with N, a free abelian group of rank N, which is isomorphic to Z to the N, with dual lattice M, which is also isomorphic to Z to the N. also isomorphic to set to the n. Given a strongly convex rational polyhedral con sigma inside Rn of dimension n, we can obtain a normal toric affine variety associated to sigma by taking the spec of a ring of functions where the support of this functions here are contained in the intersection of the dual cone to sigma and the lattice m. And the lattice M. Okay, here sigma dual consists of all the homomorphisms that while being evaluated in elements of sigma give non-negative values. Okay? So since we normally we take the isomorphism with set N with N and M, this homomorphism corresponds to the inner product. inner product. So the inner product of elements in sigma dual with elements in sigma is non-negative always. Okay, and that is the definition of the dual con or are all the elements with which the inner product which with vectors in sigma is non-negative. So since our con sigma and its dual are they are both extremely convex, the expression Extremely convex, the expression of any polynomial in this ring of functions can be expressed as this finite sum of monomials with support in the intersection of the lattice with sigma dual. We can define an associated valuation to any vector in omega again by taking the minimal of the inner product of our vector b in omega with all the elements. In omega with all the elements in the support of f, which we know that are elements in sigma dual, and therefore these elements b dot alpha are non-negative. We can find the minimal value, which we call the b order of our monomial f, and then define the initial part of any non-zero polynomial with respect to b in sigma as the sum of the monomials. Of the monomials where the inner product minimizes to the order. Since the expression of every element in the ring of functions associated to with support in sigma dual in intersection the lattice is unique. We can also say that the order of f with respect to any b in sigma and that the initial Sigma and that the initial part of every function with respect to b in sigma are well defined. And also we can use this definition of the initial part of elements in the ring of monomials in sigma dual intersection the lattice to define also an initial ideal with respect to vectors in sigma. So for example for if we So for example, if we take an ideal inside the ring of functions associated to sigma, for being sigma, we define the initial ideal of this ideal j as before. So the idea generator for the initial part of every element in our idea j. We can then induce an equivalence relation on the con sigma because by saying that two By saying that two vectors in sigma are equivalent if the initial idea that they defined with J remain the same. Again, we can prove that if we take the closure of these equivalence classes that are containing sigma, we define a polyhedral fan, which is also a subdivision of sigma. And we call this fan the Grobner fan of J. The Grubner fan of J. So again, as a property in the Grubner fan of J, we have that in the interior of each of the cones in this Grubner fan, the initial ideal of J remains invariant. So this generalizes the concept of Grubner fight, that fan that we gave previously, and we prove that this is a polyhedral fan. We can also check the details. We can also check the details and the procedure that follows Fukuda and all in 2007 to prove this assertion. So now we're going to see what's the context that we have. So in this context, we are working with an idea. An ideal which is contained in the ring of functions with support in sigma dual inside the lattice defining a variety inside the normal toric of fine variety associated to sigma. Okay, so we started with this. With this, a variety inside a normal toric variety associated to a cone in Rn. So this is an inclusion, sorry. This variety is defined by an ideal J and we are going to embed this variety X sigma in an affine space in order to obtain a Obtain a toric modification of this idea here. So, we're going to obtain a resolution of singularity that defines an isomorphism outside the singularities of this variety. Okay, so for this, we're going to embed or toric affine variety X sigma in a subspace R. A subspace R to the S. And this embedding is coming from the following procedure. So we are going to choose a set of generators of the lattice intersection sigma dual as a semi-group. So when we take these generators and we put non-negative coefficients, integral coefficients to these generators, we're going to find this. We're going to find this intersection. And we're going to define a K-I-hybromorphisms from the ring of polynomials in S variables to the ring of polynomials, which support in sigma-dual intersection the lattice by taking precisely these s generators. So we define this morphism, this came algebra morphism, by taking each of the variables yi to x to the alpha i. So remember, Alpha i. So remember, our elements are alpha i. Each of the alpha i's have integer coordinates, n integer coordinates. So when we take a point x with n coordinates, we use the multi-index notation to say that this morphism. say that this morphism that we're going to call phi takes each monomial yi sorry each variable yi to x to the alpha i mean that we take the first component of x to the first component of the alpha i multiply by the second component of x Second component of x to the second component of the alpha i and so on until we um so it's just following the multi-index notation. So this is alpha i sub n okay so this k algebra morphism is surjective why is it surjective because we started with generators We started with generators of the intersection of sigma dual with the lattice. So, this K-I-G-Amorphism is objective and defines an embedding in the spec of these rings. So, we have an embedding. So, it so how do you say it is? So, this rejective maps surjective k algebra more. Surjective k-algebra morphism between the rings of functions defines an embedding of a variety sigma, which is the spec of T set to the spec of this wrinkle function, which is CS. So these rejective maps originates, in fact, the morphism taking A point T and sending it again to T to the alpha one, T to the alpha two comma T to the alpha S. I'm sorry, this is with superior. With superior index. Okay, so this since this map is rejective, we have here an embedding defined in terms of psych like this, so we can. This. So we can, for example, this corresponds between morphisms of varieties and between the rings of functions on these varieties can be seen, for example, in the book by Miles Reed, Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry, if I'm not wrong. Okay. So in general, what this morphism side does is that any monomial y to the gamma is then sent to another monomial where the support is changed by multiplying by a matrix, which is precisely the matrix, which has as columns, these S generators in set N. And if we take, I don't know, any polynomial in S variable. Any polynomial in s variables under this morphism, we obtain a new polynomial where it may happen that some of the monomials disappear by multiplying by this matrix M. Okay, so the number of monomias might decrease or it might remain the same. Why? Because the multiplication by this matrix M is not injective. Injective. All right. So since we have that this K-I-Georamorphism is surjective, if we consider the kernel, then we can define the embedding where our variety x sigma corresponds precisely to the quotient of this ring in S variables, quotient with the ideal defined by the kernel of this morphism psi. Okay, so we have a surjective map that we're going to use later on, which is called phi, inducing an embedding from X sigma to Cs. Okay, so in order to find the totemorphism that we want, we need to We need to apply the procedure that we saw before to the ring of two ideas in the rings of functions in a certain number of variables. So, for example, we are going to work now with the pre-image of the idea we started with, which is the italic J, I'm going to say. So, we are going to consider the pre-image on their side. On their side of this italic J. Okay, so this idea which we're going to call normal J defines an idea in the ring of pre-numbers in S variables. And what we are going to do now is we're going to compare the initialized initial ideas of j and in of italic j to try to construct try to use the result that we have for the ideal j in order to give a resolution of singularity to the variety defined by italic j okay and for this we're going to use the morphism side that we just defined okay sorry i'm going to erase this part Okay, so in order to compare the initial ideas of J and italic J, we are going to see or core of n-dimensional comm sigma defining n-dimensional cone sigma defining the the toric variety x sigma and we're going to see this cone inside a fan in the first or tant for this we're going to consider this embedding which takes any vector on rn and multiplies by the the matrix m transpose you remember m was the matrix which Because you remember M was the matrix which the generators of the lattice intersection sigma duals well the generators as they generate as a semi-group the lattice intersection sigma dual. So this since the alpha i are in sigma dual, we know that when we apply, we consider the image of elements v in in the con sigma, each of these components Sigma, each of these components is going to be non-negative. So this injective map gives a way to see our cone sigma inside a space of higher dimension. Okay, this morphism is injective and in fact embeds our cone sigma inside the first or tant of the space R2DS. Okay. Okay, so some results that we have proved are the following. So suppose that we start with a vector V in sigma. Then the image of this vector on the previous morphism phi gives an element of the first ordant in Rs. Then one important result, well, basically the result we are going to use is the following. So if we consider So, if we consider the initial ideal of J, normal J, with respect to omega, which is the image under phi of a vector B and sigma, we know that, so let me check this here.  Okay, sorry. Let me refound this text. Can't distribute Okay. So, okay, so we started with our ideal J, Italic J. We consider its pre-image on this surjective morphism. This surjective morphism then gives an isomorphism between so this surjective morphism between the rings of Surjective morphism between the rings of functions on x sigma and of cs defines as we previously saw an isomorphism sorry between um x sigma inside cs so this embedding came from considering sigma sigma sigma sub sigma as the variety defined by the kernel of this morphism psi so these two ideas inside their respective varieties then define two sub varieties of these ambient spaces for example the variety B of A was Was in X sigma. And the variety defined by the normal J, which was the J, but was the pre-image of Italy J on the morphism 5. This was inside Cs. And because of this correspondence, we have an isomorphism of these two sobarities in this. Sub-varieties in these respective ambient spaces. Okay, so the following result is going to relate how to relate the initial ideas of J with certain initial ideas of the italic J. So the initial ideas of J icons are considered with respect to vectors in sigma. The initial ideals of J, of normal J are considered with vectors in Considered with vectors in the first of R to the S. All right? So one of the results that we prove is that if we consider the ideal italic J and we consider its initial idea with respect to a vector B in sigma. Then under phi, well, Then under phi, well, it corresponds to the image of the initial ideal of the normal j, which is an ideal in S variable. But here we're considering the initial ideal with respect to a vector in the first order. This vector in the first order is precisely the image under the injective morphism phi. Apply to the vector V. All right. So these so under five we have equality of these ideas. So when we consider the varieties that they define in their respective ambient spaces, for example, here we have the variety defined by the initial ideal of B of J tilde. We obtain an We obtain an isomorphism between this space and the variety defined by the initial ideal of phi of P, which is in the first ordant of R to the S okay, if and which define a variety inside C to the S. Okay, so these K algebra morphisms and the morphisms. Algebra morphisms and the morphism φ, which embeds or con in the big space R to D S, give precisely isomorphism between the varieties defined by J and its pre-image under phi, and also gives an isomorphism between the varieties defined by initial ideas of J and of J tilde. Okay. So this is the result that we proved. And now we are going to define the condition for an ideal, for ideal italic J to be Newton non-degenerate in order to generalize the result or to To conclude the result that we want. Okay, so we start with our ideal J. We assume that the close orbit corresponding to the maximal con sigma, remember the orbits that we mentioned at the beginning, belonging to the variety inside X sub sigma, associated to J. We say that the ideal is Newton and degenerate at this orbit if, for every vector in sigma, we have In sigma, we have that the singular locus of the sub-variety inside x sigma defined by the ideal, by the initial ideal of j. So we satisfy that this singular locus doesn't intersect the torus inside the toric variety associated to sigma. Okay, this notion turns out is going to be analogous or what we require in order to apply the result that we have for Newton non-degenerate ideals in CS to find resolution of singularities. Okay? So if we have an ideal which is Newton non-degenerate, then one of the properties that we have from One of the properties that we have from these previous calculations is that, as a consequence or ideal j, which is in S variables whose variety can be seen in Cs, is Newton non-degenerate as an ideal of the ring of polynomial in S variables, with the notion that we introduced in 2013 with Fuen Santa Roca. Okay, so the fact that, so if we add the condition that J to be a Newton non- Condition that J to be a Newton non-degenerate idea, we know that the singular locus of this variety remain outside the torus of X sub sigma. Okay, so that's the definition of having J, Italic J, a Newton on the generic idea. So we don't have. Generated idea. So we don't have singularities in the space in the torus. And therefore, we have the isomorphism with the variety defined by initial ideal of J, where J is a vector in R2DS. We can say that the singularities of this variety are contained in the coordinate hyperplane. So the definition that we get. So, the definition that we gave for an idea in the ring of polynomials was precisely that when we considered the initial ideals and we consider the singularities of this variety, the Newton degeneracy meant that the singularities of this variety were contained in the coordinate hyperplanes. Since we have the embedding of x sigma given by this function, we know that any We know that any point that is outside the coordinate hyperplanes comes from a point outside the coordinate hyperplanes or outside the torus in X sigma. Therefore, if we don't have singularities outside the torus with this variety, singularity of this variety outside the torus of X sigma, then we cannot have singularities outside this variety outside Outside the coordinate hyperplanes of C to DS. So, one of the consequences in these varieties are isomorphic is that if we start with an idea J in the ring of functions of A sub sigma, which is Newton non-degenerate, then as a consequence, we have that its pre-image on their side is also a Newton non-degenerate ideal, as seen as an ideal of the ring of polynomials in S variable. Of the ring of polynomials in S variables. Okay, so we have the isomorphism between the varieties defined by J and its pre-image under phi. And also we have this isomorphism of sub-varieties between the initial ideas defined by or starting italic J and its spray image on the psi. Since we have this isomorphism and we know that the And we know that the singularities of this, if the singularities of this set are outside the torus, then it guarantees that the singularities of this are outside the coordinate hyperplane of Cs. The fact that J is Newton non-degenerate implies that the ideal, the variety defined by J is Newton non-degenerate. Okay? So as a consequence of this, we have that if J is Newton. Is Newton non-degenerate with the definition that we gave? This implies that the ideal J inside the ring in S variables is Newton non-degenerate with the definitions for ideas in the ring of polynomials. Okay. So at this part, we have this diagram over here. Okay, so the objective is to construct a morphism of a toric variety. Of a toric variety that gives an embedded resolution of the variety defined by the italic J. Okay? So now we need to, we're going to relate the Grobner Phi, the Grobner phone of the ideal Italic J and the Grobner Phi of the usual. Of the usual normal j, which I are containing different ambience. So, for example, we have that if we consider two vectors in sigma, then, well, this assertion says the following. If we consider n sigma and two vectors where the initial part of the italic j remains invariant, then this corresponds. then this corresponds to two vectors in the first ordant where the initial ideal corresponding to J remains invariant. Or in other words, if we consider the Grobner phi, the Grobner phan of J that we defined previously that gives a subdivision of sigma, then its image on the morphism phi that we define Fission file that we defined previously, and that embeds this fan inside the bigger space R to DS, then this embedding gives cons in which the initial ideas of the normal J remain invariant. So we have a correspondence between the Between the cones in the Grubner phi of the ideal J tilde and the Grubner-Fan of the normal ideal J. So if we consider the equivalence classes of the relation defining sigma, we can take the group near phi of the J, which is inside the polynomial of in S variables, and intersect this with the image of our original fun sigma. Original fan sigma. The theorem that we prove is the following. If we start with an idea in the ring of polynomials we support in sigma dual intersected with the lattice, and we ask for this idea to be Newton non-degenerate and consider the variety defined for this ideal inside the toric variety A sigma, we can consider a regular subdivision of sigma, which is compatible with the growth. Sigma, which is compatible with the Grubner fun of J and then associate to this a toric morphism. This morphism comes from the variety associated to this subdivision of small sigma. And we can prove that this is a proper birational morphism taking irreducible components of the total transform of the of y, meaning the image under this. Under this morphism of y are smooth. In particular, the strict transform of y, which is the variety defined by our starting ideal, is smooth, and which satisfies that all the irreducible components intersect transversally. The proof of these results uses the following. So we started with our concept. We started with Orcon Sigma. In this theorem, we consider a bigger fun called big sigma, which refines not only sigma, but also the Grupner fan of the ideal J tilde. This defines a toric morphism between these two toric varieties. Okay, so our assertion is. Okay, so our assertion is that this morphism is the resolution that we want for the variety defined by our DR italic J. Okay? So demorphy. So let me see what I'm seeing. When we embed the cone sigma, a small sigma with the morphic. sigma with the morphic there is an embedding of a cone sigma inside a in a okay we take our cone sigma a small sigma and at the beginning we embedded this in the bigger space r to the s so because we have this embedding which is in fact it was an injection from the consigma to the first ortant we obtain an embedding between The refining of sigma and the variety defined by the image of this big sigma under the morphism phi. So this embedding takes this S sub sigma as a sub-variety inside the Tauric variety associated to a sigma tilde, which refines the Grogner fact fun of J. A fan of J. Okay? So, how do we prove that this is a proper by rational map that singularizes the variety defined by VG, by the ideal Italic J? So we had in the beginning that this variety was Newton non-degenerate. This corresponded for what we saw to has as a consequence that the variety defined Cs by by Defined Cs by the pre-image of this Italic J is also a Newton degenerate variety. By the theorem that we proved in 2013 with Fuensanta, we saw that if we took any subdivision of the Grubner-Fan associ of J, in particular, if we consider sigma Tilda, the image of the fun sigma, which was also regular, we obtained that this torig morphism satisfies certain properties. What are the properties that this satisfies? So one of the properties was that the irreducible components Of the total transform of this variety, sorry, this is pi sigma hat minus one of BJ are all smooth. In particular, The strict transform on the dysmorphism π sub sigma tilde of PJ, which is contained here and is one of the reusable components, is smooth. Okay, since we have this isomorphism here. We can also see that the irreducible components of the strict transform of this variety inside this embedding are also in correspondence or are isomorphic to the irreducible components of this variety. Therefore, if we have that these are smooth, then the irreducible components of the total transform of P dj, then as a consequence, Then, as a consequence, the irreducible components of the per-image of the total transform of B sub J under this morphism. They are smooth as well. This morphism here was proper and birational. And because we have these embeddings, we also have that this morphism here is proper and bar rational. Okay? And the other property that we have. Other and the other property that we have is if we have in this case, we have transversality between the intersection of the reducible components in this strict transform. So under, if we consider the intersection of the irreducible components as seen inside this toric variety, which is a sub-variety of this total, the intersection are also going to be transverse because with Because since this is an embedding, we cannot lose the transversality. Therefore, we have proved the assertion and the only thing that we needed was to extend the notion of Newton non-degeneracy to varieties defined inside a toric normal affine variety so that each spray image on their demorphism defined by choosing a set. Defined by choosing a set of generators of the console sigma dual with the lattice is generated by S vectors. Okay, and this is the results that I wanted to share with you. Sorry, this is the first time that I speak about this. So the ideas are kind of So the ideas are kind of mixed and not in order. Thank you, Yumirna. Is there any questions, any comments? So I have some questions. But first, very nice results you presented. You presented. It's a very natural generalization of your previous work with Vincenta. So, the first question is: just to be sure, because sometimes in your presentation, you wrote the complex numbers, sometimes an arbitrary field. So, I suppose this is free of characteristic, right? Yes. So, I think the in most of the article, I don't know if probably the only thing asked from the K is to be perfect so that we don't. To be perfect, so that we don't, the characteristic doesn't affect the result. So that the result is invariant of the characteristic. Sorry. Okay. Okay. And the other question is, so you are embedding this Newton node degenerate variety in a toric affine variety. Have you considered embedding varieties in projective toric varieties? And maybe it's just a Is this and maybe it's just a gluing problem? So, have you considered this other situation? So, not yet. I mean, this part was just motivated by the question that Bernard is here. Well, the how do you say? Yeah, the idea that he has. And so far, this was the result. And this was quite recent, so we haven't thought in any way of generalize this to projective to regularities. Projective to regularities, okay. Okay, okay, thank you, thank you. Is there another question in the chat? No, okay, if not, thank you, Mirna, for your talk. Thank you, and we continue.
