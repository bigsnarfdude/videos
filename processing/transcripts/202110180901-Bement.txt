  I designate these by kind of putting my name at the bottom of the acknowledgement list. We'll see a little bit of work from Zach Swider and Song, but the other thing I'd like to point out is that even though we won't be talking about any results from either Daw or Jen or Ann Miller or Andrew Gorich or Mark Chen Data, this work is not occurring in an intellectual or conceptual background. Intellectual or conceptual background. We're getting a lot of input from all of these people. And we're, of course, grateful to the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation and my tenure department for their support. Okay, some background first. In animal cells, cytokinesis is powered by the so-called cytokinetic apparatus, which comprises a cortical equator, and the idea is supercepl, which just wraps around the equator of the cell. That just wraps around the equator of the cell and pinches inward, dividing the mother cell into two daughters. The formation of the structure is critically dependent on signals that arise from the mitotic spindle, although exactly how this works is still debated. The idea is any manipulation that kills the spindle before the cytokinetic apparatus forms means that the cytokinetic apparatus will not form. And we'll have a tiny bit to say about what's going on here. We do know the following. The coupling between the information coming from the spindle and the cortex to the cytokinetic apparatus works by way of a small G protein called Rho, which I imagine most of you are familiar with. And here's a couple of examples of that. Sea rich embryo on the left and frog embryo on the right. Well, my left and right anyway. And the idea is simply that as anaphase begins, Simply that as anaphase begins, the stripe of rhythm activity appears at the equator in both cases here. And then the rhythm has a number of downstream targets that it activates, and those in turn are going to target and activate the participants of the cytoskeleton, the myosin, and the actin. Traditionally, the signaling from the spindle to the cortex during cytokinesis has been thought to be largely linear, and the idea is that the spindle will concentrate a complex called central spindlin. Called central spindlin, approximately near the equatorial cortex. This step somehow recruits Act2 to the same region, whereupon it activates Rho, and then the rest is thought to follow Lickety split. The Rho will turn on its targets, which, as we've already said, will lead to the construction of the cytokinetic apparatus. And then after the apparatus is closed, the idea has been that the row inactivators or gaps are going to come along, scrub out the active row. Scrub out the active row such that the cytokinetic apparatus disassembles. A few years back, however, it became apparent, largely as a consequence of improved imaging techniques, that this process is not, in fact, linear. And the first clue came from simply imaging actinerodynamics of the cortex. So here we're looking at a close-up of a Xenopus embryoblasomere. So this is one cell down here, but the rest of this is all But the rest of this is all part of one cell. And it's been labeled with two different actinthilamin binding proteins: one called LIFAC, which binds to afactin with fast kinetics, and one called eutrophin, which binds somewhat more slowly. And the idea is that if what we're looking at here are waves of active assembly and disassembly, we ought to see the fast binder concentrated near the leading edge of the waves and the slow binder more concentrated at the trailing edge. In contrast, were it to be the case In contrast, were it to be the case that these patches of actin are just getting shoved around by, say, myosins, there shouldn't really be any predicted difference in the distribution of these. So if you can just fix your eyes on one of these waves and follow it, you'll see that, yes, indeed, the fast binder does tend to be more concentrated at the front of the wave than the slow binder at the back of the wave. There are underlying ways of real activity. These are hard to visualize. If you've got good eyes, you can kind of see them here, but we're going to use a trick whereby we drop out Use a trick whereby we drop out all of the everything except the newly activated row. It's basically making a difference movie. And then this makes the waves pop out rather nicely. We've got a corresponding still in chymograph over here. And the raw data are here and the different smoothie data here. And you can see that we're not actually creating these waves. They're just normally somewhat masked by stable blobs of row activity associated with the cortex or a probe that's just With a cortex or a probe that's just bouncing around in a side of soul. Yeah. So were you just doing the difference? You're doing some sort of a finite difference thing on half a movie? Is that what's happening on the other half? Yeah, just showing the normal part. Yeah, exactly. Here we very modestly overexpressed EC2, and again, that's the row activator that's critical for cytokinesis. And this amplifies a wave such that you really don't need the The waves such that you really don't need the difference movie trick to see the waves. We're going to do it anyway, just for the sake of consistency, and in the same part of the movie, the upper right portion. And here's the corresponding chimerograph. If you inactivate rho, as shown here on FOSS view and down here in the corresponding chimerograph, again, you've got the raw and the different smoothie displayed, you don't want the blade active assembly complete. You don't ablate actin assembly completely, but you do strongly suppress the waves. So there's this little bright guy here in the middle is a comet. It's not a wave. And you can do something similar. It's a little more complicated. We've injected one cell with RNA encoding, a dominant negative version of Ect2, and its neighbor serves as a control. And you can see, again, there's some actin here, but it's not forming waves, whereas in the control neighbor, the waves form just fine. And here's the kind of graph that corresponds to this movie. Corresponds to this movie. No waves, waves. Another feature of the waves that's not necessarily evident unless you have an optimal movie is that when they collide with each other, they auto-annihilate. And if you just watch this part of the movie here, you can see waves coming into contact with each other, they disappear. So this movie is intended to just sort of summarize the relationship between the waves and cytokinesis itself. So the movie starts shortly after chromosome. The movie starts shortly after chromosome separation and anaphase. And the movies are initially everywhere, but already you'll see that they're starting to become focused at the equator and amplified at the equator. At some point after the focusing and amplification, cytokinesis ensues. I'm not going to show you, but I can tell you that this process is critically dependent on the mitotic spindle. So both experiments and So both experiments and modeling indicate that these traveling waves are consistent with the excitable dynamics. And another way to think about this is the cell cortex is behaving as an excitable medium. And in many cases, excitability and excitable media are based on fast positive feedback and delayed negative feedback. The representation here is pretty simple. So you've got an active species that can transition to an inactive species. To an inactive species. And the positive feedback, which occurs more quickly, will give you more of the active species. And the negative feedback, which is coming off the exact same pool, at least presumably, of the active stuff, will counteract the positive feedback. But because it's delayed, it won't cancel it out entirely. The classic example in biology is a neuron. These are one-dimensional waves, but as probably all of you. But as probably all of you know, our active versus inactive here would be a depolarized versus polarized membrane. The depolarization results in opening of sodium channels, which results in more depolarization. But that's followed by a delayed opening in potassium channels, which will counteract the opening of the potassium, the sodium channels by polarizing the membrane. Okay, all pretty much classic biology. The way I like to think about it. The way I like to think about this is, because we're looking at waves in two dimensions, is as follows. If you think about the waves as they move forward, the positive feedback is going to be operative at the front, the leading edge of the wave, driving them forward, and then the negative feedback will be predominantly operative at the trailing edge, and it prevents, in this case, the cells from filling up with the stuff active row. So, what we're looking at for starters is a scheme something like this. Rows are This rows are the thing we're thinking of in terms of having an active and an inactive form. The positive feedback goes through ECT2. We're trying to figure out what's in this question mark, but I'm not going to talk about that. And then the delayed negative feedback is going to eventually lead to the inactivation of the row. And that's what we'll spend the majority of the rest of this talk discussing. So, in the initial paper where we characterize this behavior, Paper where we characterize this behavior, we became interested in the possibility that act in itself is an agent of negative feedback. And that's because of movies like this. This is from a starfish. It's a little washed out, but I think maybe you can still see that the active row, which is in green, seems to be confined to the regions that are between the waves of actin. And it's very evident in the chimograph derived from this movie. So space across this, time in this dimension. I'm sorry I wasn't consistent about labeling the. I'm sorry I wasn't consistent about labeling these, but they're all laid out the same way. And the pattern is black, green, red, black, green, red, black, green, red, black, green, red. So nothing rho actin, nothing rho actin. That's with Xtra X2, so that's an experimental situation. Here we're looking at a cell that, other than having the probes for active rho and actin filaments, has not otherwise been manipulated. But recall that the EC2 is naturally concentrated at the equator by the state. At the equator by the spindle. And what we see in this natural cell, the natural division, are complementary waves of actin and rho. They're hard to glimpse, and the problem here is that the flow is diving out of the reach of the objective, so there's really only a couple of cycles you can catch. And even that's hard to do if you've got to have the optimal samples. To make it a little easier for you to see, here's a still frame from that last movie, and we're going to have our cut. Still afraid from that last movie, and we're going to have our kind of graph drawn parallel to the long axis of the equator. And we'll see black, green, red, black, green, red, black, green, red. And then down here, the furrow has dived out of the reach of the objective. That's for starfish. Similar experiment here for frog, two cells, one, two, corresponding chymographs, one and two. Same sort of thing. Black, green, red, black, green, red for a couple of cycles. Black, green, red, black. Yeah. Bills just had a question about the imaging. Are we only seeing the cortex? Is this like a max projection or a single? Is this like a max projection or a single slice or what? Yeah, sorry, I should explain that. These are all projections of somewhere between six and twelve optical planes. That six is usually enough to capture just the cortex and go all the way through it. The times when we need to use more are when it's a smaller cell and we want to catch more of the surface of its curved. Are you guys pushing things at all in the trap? This guy, these guys are not really flattened, except insofar as you need to to trap them so they don't. That you need to trap them so they don't move around while you're imaging. These are a little bit more flattened. Okay, so consistently, actin is going up at the same time rho is going down, implying that perhaps the actin is antagonizing the rho. You can test this idea with the following trick. You take litrunculin, which we'll hear more of. This is a drug that deplymerizes actin, and you mix it with low-melt agarose. And while it's still molten, you suck it up into a micro- suck it up into a microneedle and then you position the microneedle near but not actually touching the cell here. So this little flashlight thing is supposed to represent a little bit trunculin diffusing out of this needle and the ovulus is there simply to slow the diffusion. So this is where the cell is closest to this little cloud of diffusing latrunculin and what you'll see once the movie starts is that at the side where you're getting less Is that at the side where you're getting less actin as a consequence of low trunculin, you're getting higher amplitude, larger scale row waves, which are green here? The actin's in red. These propagate across the cell. The cell is not happy. It turns out actin's pretty important. But nonetheless, we're filming this for 30 minutes and it makes it through. And it'll actually go through multiple cycles like this. It's a little ugly because the middle here is stuck to the cover slip and that's changing the dynamics somewhat. And that's changing the dynamic somewhat. So it's the idea that you change the weight percent of the augerose to kind of control how fast the we initially started with just latrunculin and these things, and by the time we got the needle anywhere near the cell, the whole cortex was just shattered. It was cool. If you catch it in time, you can actually see the whole thing light up with row activity, but then it grinds to a halt and nothing interesting happens. And then you have to throw that dish away because, yeah. Dish away because, yeah. So, is the agarose like in this needle thing, or is it like outside? It's inside. I should have been more clear. So, what you do is you melt the low-melt agarose, so you can maintain it in a liquid form at 37 degrees, which doesn't have any untoward effects on the latrunculin. Then you add the latrunculin, mix the whole thing up, and then you suck it up into the needle, and then you let the needle cool. The agarose solidifies. You can make it slower by jacking up the concentration of the agarose. Of the agarose or the diffusion or faster by lowering. Okay, so we're looking at something like this at this point. Our negative feedback seems to involve F-actin. Okay, so we want to know what's upstream of it, but especially what's downstream of it, because actin by itself is not known to directly inhibit Rho, at least in vitro. So very end of the published material. Of the published material, and what follows is what we've been working on since. We became interested in this fellow, variously known as RGA34, RGAP11, or MP-GAP. It's a gap that's widely expressed and very poorly conserved. So the reason there's nothing drawn outside the GAAP domain in our simple bar diagram of the primary structure is that there's literally no conserved regions if you do alignments with multiple of these from different species. The gap. Different species. The gap domain itself, though, is pretty well conserved. The reason we became interested in this initially was because of a couple of papers that identified it as being involved in negative regulation of contraction during cytokinesis. But what really drew our eyes to it was a paper from Edmund Wells' lab where they were studying pulse contractions and cortical flow in C. elegants' embryos. So, strictly speaking, Embryos. So, strictly speaking, not cytokinesis, but nonetheless, a contract auto phenomenon. And what they found was that RDA behaves as an actin-dependent inhibitor of Rho. Okay, and I should have said this up front. The purified protein is specific for Rho. That is, it turns off Rho, but not RAC and CDC42. Okay, sorry. But the important point of all this was these papers made this a reasonable candidate. Okay. So we're going to just go through a series of So we're going to just go through a series of predictions. So one of the simplest is that if this protein is involved in a cytokinetic circuit that regulates excitability, we might anticipate that it would concentrate at the equator during and before cytokinesis. And indeed it does. So we'll start with frog. Here we're looking at the wild-type version of this protein fused with three XGFPs. And it's somewhat later in development, so we're looking at an Later in development, so we're looking at an epithelial layer. And it's the protein's nuclear interphase, but you can see that very shortly after nuclear envelope breakdown, it's as if it's getting sprayed onto the cortex. So it's very avidly recruited to the cortex. And then hopefully, if you keep watching, you can see that it concentrates at the equator prior to furrowing. It stays with the furrow as it ingresses. This stuff is nice. Unfortunately, it's also very toxic. So if you go just a hair. Toxic. So, if you go just a hair too high, the cells fail to cytokines, and that makes sense. It turns Rho off, no Rho, no cytokinesis. So, if we want to look at earlier stages, we have to use a mutant version that's gap dead, R96E, also fused to 3GFPs here. And this lets us look at bigger cells. And that, in turn, allows us to see that it's concentrated at the forum, but also in the waves that are evident in the cortex prefurrowing. It also concentrates at the equator prior to and during cytokinesis in starfish. Just a couple of examples. Early blastomeres and slightly later blastomeres. Here, you cannot use their wild type at all. There's two problems. You can ask me about them if you care. But you can use the gap-dent version, and it labels the furrows, I think, quite convincingly. Okay, so that takes care of the first prediction. The second prediction. So that takes care of the first prediction. The second prediction is that if this is truly a participant and then they get feedback, you ought to see it chase or follow the row waves, and you ought to see it diminish them under the right conditions, thin them out or make them weaker. So here we're in a starfish cell expressing some extra Act2, so it has these nice high-amplitude row waves shown in red, and we're looking at the gap-dead version, and indeed it chases the active row, as you can see here, and in the chimerograph. So active row. climate graph, so active row followed by the gap. And overexpression of the wild type untagged version does indeed thin out, diminish, or otherwise squelch the row waves. Here's no extra RGA, here's a little bit of extra, here's a little bit more, and these are the corresponding chimerographs. I think it's pretty evident that the rho waves are getting thinner and then weaker. And if you really overdo it with a And if you really overdo it with this stuff, they'll go away entirely. Okay, that takes care of the second prediction. Third prediction, we would expect some kind of association with F-actin. And I'll tell you up front, we've not been able to purify the protein, so we haven't been able to do the classic sort of biochemistry to see if it truly binds directly to actin. We're leaning toward the idea that it does not, for reasons that will be evident later. Nonetheless, it co-localizes. It co-localizes with actin. This is a mistake. This is actually the gap-dead version. It's not the wild type. So, waves pre-furrowing, and then in the furrow here, here's the double overlay here. These are just kind of grass, if that's not obvious. That's a frog. Here, the cell that's overexpressing at two, so we get nice big fat F-actin waves. They're more or less right on top of each other. It may be a little bit easier to see in our chymograph here. So, RgA on the top, actin on the bottom. RgA on the top, actin on the bottom, and the overlay in the middle. And here's an inset grown up. And while it's true that there's F-actin in places where there isn't the RGA, that's of course because there's always actin in the cortex. But within the waves, they're pretty much right on top of each other. And as an experimental test of the idea that they're associated, one would like to change the distribution of the F-act and its. The distribution of the effect and see a corresponding change in the distribution of the gap. So we're using our framework again, but the experiments differ. It's a lower concentration, and they're vague. And this concentration is selected to not simply get rid of the F-actin, because then there's nothing to see but to thin it out. And you can see up here is a kind of a graph before we've applied the F-actin. That black line is where the latroculin, the black line is where the latroculin goes in. You can see that pretty quickly the row. In. You can see that pretty quickly the rho waves fatten up and brighten up. But hopefully, you can also see that the actin waves get thinner. Okay, that's what the latrunculin does under these conditions. Now, here we're comparing the active Rho to the RgA in the same experimental regime, pre-latrunculin, post-latrunculin. And again, it's easiest to just look at the insets, which are enlargements. Compare this to this. The rho is brighter and fatter down here than it is up here, and our RGA is packed into a small. And our RGA is packed into a smaller space. And then to relate this to cytokinesis, we have another needle experiment. So the problem, if you just look at rho and RGA, or pretty much, or sorry, actin and RGA in the furrows is there's a lot of actin in the furrows normally. So if something else is in the furrow, they tend to appear as if they're co-localized. This trick, these cells have not been injected with anything other than the probes for the RGA and actin. The RGA and actin, and you bring the needle in near to cleaving cells. And what it does, as we've learned previously, is it causes the cytokinetic apparatus to fracture. So this gives you a greater dynamic range, I guess for want of a better term, within the furrow region, because you have spaces where there's no acting, where the ring is fractured. And then it tries to fix itself and it contracts and then new fractures form. So we'll first just look at the movie. Oh, sorry, green will be the RGA. And again, this is the gap. RGA, and again, this is the GAP dead mutant. F-actins in red. The cell way over here serves as a control. It's protected actually by this cell from the diffusing latriculin. And I think the effects of this stuff are pretty obvious, I think. The cells desperately want to divide, but they just can't because the cytokinetic apparatus keeps breaking. If you look though, and I think it's easy to see in this one because it's not in quite such bad shape. This one, because it's not in quite such bad shape as this guy. There's a considerable amount of yellow that's sliding back and forth rapidly at the equator. And yellow tells you there's both red and green, which tells you that there's both RGA and the F-act in there. The overlap isn't perfect. Again, this is a point we'll return to. But if you make a chimograph from that, this is a still from that last movie of the cell all the way on the left. And here's a double label, and here's the individual channel. Label, and here's the individual channels. Generally speaking, where you have lots of the RGA, you also have lots of the F acta. Okay? You will note, however, there are regions where it's more red than green and more green than red. Okay, so that takes care of the third prediction. The fourth is the longest shot, but it turns out it works. So you might imagine that if F2 is a key part of the That if you, if EC2 is a key part of the positive feedback and this gap is a key part of the negative feedback, were you to co-express them in cells that don't normally express them or have them at very low levels and which are not normally excitable, you might be able to induce excitability. So we need a little bit of biology here. Most of the experiments I've shown you take place in activated eggs or embryos. That's the time where cytokinesis naturally occurs. The immature oocyte is two developmental steps removed from the Steps removed from that state. So it's naturally arrested in meiotic interphase. It's got an intact nucleus. And it turns out that the various proteins that regulate cytokinesis, like RgA, Ect2, things like inelin, are expressed at very low levels. And they're nuclear. They all have nuclear localization signals, so they don't have access to the cortex. Later in development, as the oocyte turns into an egg, the arrest is relieved. The cells start to express more of these things. Start to express more of these things, but the arrest actually prevents them from being excitable. And then finally, when they're fertilized or activated, that's when the excitability is normally unleashed, and that also corresponds to when you have the highest amount of these cytokinetic regulators expressed. So what Ani did was simply micro-inject EC2 or RGA or both. The EC2 is modified so that it won't be imported into the nucleus, into these immature oocytes. So this is an immature oocyte control. This is an immature oocyte control, and we're looking at Rho activity. It's very boring because there's no excitability. There's really very little going on with Rho, presumably some background level. This is the corresponding chymograph. These dark streaks are just these pigment granules you can see in the on-FOS view. Low levels of a non-importable EC2 produce waves only in a subset of oocytes, and as it turns out, only usually in a very small part of the oocyte. There are little patches of waves. Little patches of waves. Roughly, I'd say 30%. Well, we'll come to the actual quantification. We'll have these things. They're also not very long-lived, only an hour or so, so you have to catch them at the right time after injection. Here's the corresponding chymograph. It's corrugated because these are very, very contractile, and we assume that's the case because there's no or very limited gap activity to restrain the row. Here's what you get if you co-express this non-importable EC2 with the gap. So this occurs in a very, very high level. So, this occurs in a very, very high percentage of the cells. It goes on for hours, like 10, 12 hours, and it covers the entire cortex. And moreover, it's frequently, depending on the conditions of the experiment, overtly spiral. Okay, so very high level excitability. You cannot miss it. It's also something that's very fun to watch. Here's some quantifications. Control is just RGBD. These all have RGBD. This is the gap alone. Oh, sorry, I should have explained. Alone. Oh, sorry, I should explain what we're measuring. This is not wavelength in the usual sense. This is each wave is measured from one end all the way to the other end. Okay, so it's a sort of measure of how long a wave is, not anything related to the separation of waves from each other. So control, nothing, RGA alone, nothing. Here's our at two alone. You get, as I said, in a subset of cells, short, choppy waves, usually isolated. Usually isolated, and this is what you get with the combination of the two. And this is a plot of the cells with waves. And it tends to overestimate what you actually see with the EC2 alone because you would score a cell as having waves even if you can only find them in one tiny patch, whereas the combination covers the whole cortex. There's some specificity to this. At two alone here, at two with the RGA, this is the gap-dead mutant. It does not produce waves. Not produce waves. And this is a different rho gap, P190 rho gap. It does also not produce waves in combination with EC2. Okay, so just a couple more movies so you know I'm not cherry-picking. This is Rho alone. That's Rho and F. Actin. So we believe that the data that we've just seen provide fairly compelling evidence that RGA participates in this negative feedback loop somehow in concert with Actin. So far, so good. So far, so good. We're getting close to the end, I promise. Okay, so one other point I would like to make: there's one very cool feature of this immature OSIT system. It's experimentally very, very powerful, and there's not that many things out there for studying two-dimensional excitable dynamics. There's a BZ reaction, which we'll see in a second, but that's pretty much it. The neurobiologists are getting to where they can do some pretty fancy imaging. Do some pretty fancy imaging of ensembles of neurons, but even those are much harder to work with than this. We're talking about two RNAs that get injected into the cells and plus the probes, and you're good to go. So you have the potential to manipulate anything you want, at least still on paper. Okay, so you might reasonably argue: okay, those spirals are cool and all, and the waves are cool, but good God, they're totally unphysiological. Why would you waste your time with this? Time with this. Well, you might if you were like me, a child of the 60s. But aside from that, I would like to make the following point. So when we're looking at the cytokinetic apparatus, it's essentially a two-dimensional structure, and the waves are forced into this two-dimensional arrangement by the spindle. What we think we're doing with the immature OSI is turning the entire cortex in. Turning the entire cortex into what would normally be confined to the equator of the cell by virtue of just pumping the cell full of these two key regulators. And to make this point clearer, we've got a little BZ reaction here. Four chemicals that went and poured into a two minutes for total? Any questions? Okay, go down close. So, four chemicals, you mix them up. If you pour them in a thin layer, they're excitable. And what I've done here is basically cut a What I've done here is basically cut a piece of nitrocellulose such that it has roughly one half and a big, largely two-dimensional arrangement, and then these things projecting off of it of various widths, which are supposed to represent something that's more one-dimensional. And then we just wait for the reaction to go for a bit. And out here where the reaction has a free expanse of two-dimensional space to explore, it does pretty much what the Oocites do. Pretty much what the oocytes do, or you should probably say the oocytes do what this does. Lots of nice spiral waves, other more complicated things where wave fronts collide. But then when you look at where it's confined to these much skinnier regions, the waves look far more normal, right? They're pretty much moving just along the long axis of these little strips. Point being that the dimensionality matters for your perception of what the waves are doing. Okay. Doing. Okay, great. Alright, so further evidence in support of this claim. We think this is a reasonable mimic of cytokinesis because an older paper from Ann Miller's lab has shown that of the three dias which are formins that are expressed in the xenopus embryos, only dia3 seems to participate in cytokinesis, even though they're all responsive to active Rho. This shows dia-3 concentrating in a furrow with little or no two and one, respectively. 2 and 1, respectively. Knockouts bear out this result. When we do a similar experiment in the immature oocytes, DIA 1 and 2 are pretty crappy when it comes to being able to follow the rho waves, but Dia 3 does it beautifully. So then what did we want to do with this? Well, one of the things we wanted to do was see what happens when we vary the concentration of our RgA while holding the F2 concentration constant. And what you can produce. And what you can produce is quantitative differences in excitable dynamics. Each of these little patches represents a snapshot from a different oocyte subject to the condition. So these all have the same amount of the RGA as do these, as do these. And while there's some variation, presumably due to differences in RNA expression, at the lowest levels of our RGA, we get flickers or pulses of rho and actin. As we start to ramp up, you get things that are now distinctly wave-like. Things that are now distinctly wave-like, but the waves are short and choppy, or in some cases, they're labyrinthin, you know, like a maze. And then, as you go farther and farther, then you start to get predominantly or entirely spirals. Okay, skip that. Lastly, this is jumping back to the starfish system, so this will have the native RGA in there and a little extract too. But why is it that these proteins produce waves instead of? Produce waves in starfish, but pulsed contractions in sea elegans. And hopefully, you're familiar enough with sea elegans for this to be familiar. Ed Monroe very kindly provided this movie. I don't really have an immediate answer, but I do have the results of an experiment that are kind of intriguing. So Zach treated the starfish eggs jacked up with EC2 with a very, very low concentration of litrunculin. It hasn't been applied yet, so they're just waving. I'll tell you when the litrunculin goes on. I'll tell you when the litraculin goes on. There. They're going through cell cycles, so the waves quiet down. But now note the wave behavior. They're somewhere between waves and pulses, and the longer they sit, the less wave-like they're going to be, and the more pulse-like they're going to be. Okay. I we'll just go to the questions. Go to the questions. Sorry for going too long. Alright, so why don't we take any questions from the room to begin with? And if anybody is listening, if you could transition over so that the virtual participants could ask questions, that would be great. Questions from the room, real quick? So you mentioned that you didn't think You didn't think that RJ34 was associated with epactin. So, why do you think that's the case? And do you have any idea of what the alternative would be? Yeah, so this, due to my long-windedness, I was not able to show you this. So, we've gotten faster and faster at the imaging. And it's slower imaging, that is longer time intervals. The two, the Actin and the RGA, really look like they're right on top of each other. Look like they're right on top of each other. But if you go just as fast as you can, four or six-second intervals, consistently, there's just a tiny delay between the RGA and the ACAN. That's what's shown in this plot here. And you get the same thing out of a cross-correlation analysis. But could that be because the RGA has to get recruited onto the F actins? It's the other way around. The RGA is leading the F Actin. Oh, okay. We thought initially this might reflect this. We thought initially this might reflect the slowness of the latruncular or the eutrophin binding the actin, because there is some delay. It's an actin-binding protein. But we did it with LIFACT, which actually binds to G-actin, and we still got the delay. So that's very hard to explain if the RGA is simply sticking to bulk F-actin. What would the rho peak be relative to? The rho is in front of both of these. It leads the RGA. These. It leads the RGA by a decent amount in the act and by more. So a bit more of a gap? Yeah. Between the RGA and the row? Yeah. Oh, sorry, no, the other way around. So it's, I think, a 20-second difference between the peak of the row and the RGA, and something more like 33 or 34 between the peak of the row and the peak of the actin. Okay. So, do you have an idea for a mechanism? What is the F-actin doing? Yeah, so we have. Yeah, so we have a scaffold, or if it's not. So we have to reconcile this with the fact that every other thing we've done, and actually the stuff from Ed's lab seems to indicate pretty clearly this stuff needs F-active to stay around. So one idea would be that it's maybe engaging with something like DIA3. And in fact, if you compare its distribution to Dia3, they're right on top of each other. And then it gets handed off to the F-actin, or it just hangs around because the formant itself hangs around. Hangs around because the formin itself hangs around with the F-actin, something like that. A related possibility would be that it's targeting maybe specifically the formin-nucleated F-actin, which is probably less abundant in these waves than the R2,3. So the peak of the F-actin in that scenario would actually reflect Arc23. So that would give you an apparent delay. But in reality, this stuff is actually on the F-actin from the get-go. This is based on work from Yeast. All right. I'm going to cut the I'm going to cut the in-room questions for a second and give virtual folks a chance. Orion, why don't you go ahead and try and ask your question and we'll see if we can hear. No, but I can hear you, Orion, so please just ask and I'll refer it for. That's like using the bathroom. Hold on one second, all right. Can y can you hear that? No, it's something very faint. It sounds like it's coming from outside, I but I cannot. Would it help if you if you um tip the microphone closer to your laptop? The microphone closer to your laptop? Or could you just on if one of you had your laptop put the audio out in the room? Could we hear it? Yeah, because it sounds like it's coming from the media room there. Yeah, we're not hearing it. Are you hearing questions from? Barely hear it. Might get feedback, though. I think it's just one of you that I just told them to be okay. No, we do hear those waves are fantastic. Yeah. Are they real or did you take them in the case? You paint them in two ways. All right, can you try again? Yeah, can you hear me now? Yeah, yes. Very good. Go ahead. Great topic. So I'll also add a question of what the actin might be contributing to the negative feedback. Wonder if you actually had a sense of whether it's the actin polymer itself, the force of polymerization. So at least in our system, it's ongoing polymerization you need, not just the accumulated polymer, and/or whether the polymerization. Or whether the polymerization could be changing the local curvature, say sort of the shape of the membrane, and that's what the GAPIS response is. And have a sense of what feature of the AFIS assembly may be contributing. Yeah, I don't think we can distinguish between any of those possibilities, but I could add one more. I alluded to the fact that there's no obvious conservation outside the gap domain of these proteins, but what there is is a boatload of unstructured region. Of unstructured region. And in some of the experiments, it seems like this stuff, if you deprive it of F-actin, it balls up. So, at the risk of barking my shins by jumping onto a bandwagon, it's possible the actin is serving as a template that sort of nucleates a liquid-liquid phase transition. I so ashamed that I said that. Hi, um, thanks a lot. This was a really nice talk. And I'm intrigued as to why you cannot use the wild-tide gap for the localization. And I wonder if the gap in the wild-tide form is present in these waves in really low concentrations, which is critical for its ability. Which is critical for its ability to then form these waves. Yeah, that's a great idea. So you can use the wild type, but only at vanishingly small concentrations. And the phenotype that follows if you use too much is cytokinesis failure, and the rosone just simply fails to form. If you use the gap dead, you can go higher, but to your point, if you go really high with the gap dead, you actually end up getting a You actually end up getting a cytokinetic failure as well as if you're displacing the endogenous stuff. So, Ed Monroe does have a quick comment. We'll let him go ahead and make a comment. You can unplug while Andres gets set up. Go ahead, Ed. Okay. First of all, awesome, Bill. What a beautiful talk. I just wanted to comment just from our experience in Seattle again, looking at RJ3 and its interactions with AFT. Interactions with actin. I mean, we don't have any other direct evidence that it's binding to F-actin, but in C. algorithms at high resolution, we can really see that it's decorating individual elements of the polymer network, really one-to-one. And also, with single molecule imaging, when we look at individual molecules of RJA34, they are coming on and off of the cortex and at the cortex have a mobility signature that's identical to what we measure for actin. Identical to what we measure for actin. So we think it's really associating directly with actin, either directly or through some indirect intermediate. And also, I like your idea, Bill, that it could be that the timing difference you see has to do with the presence of a lot of R23 assembled actin. We don't, you know, in C aliens, there's very little at the zygote cortex during this pulse contraction. During these pulse contractions, and it may be a fundamental difference. Thanks, Ed. That's good to know. Because we do intend to try and purify this stuff if we can, and it would be nice to know down the road it won't be a waste of time if we do get.
