Oh no, it is back. Good uh oh it's an out video is not behaving. Well, I think we should probably just uh go ahead and start. There we go. Yes. Good. We're happy to have Ryan and Buddy give a recorded talk and a film talk. And a film talk, A Proof of a Conjecture of Tom Carroll. So, this is Johnny Board with David. Yeah. Yeah, thanks for having me. I'd like to thank the organizers for putting on such a nice conference with almost no technical glitches. David and I don't exactly fit the conference theme, but we're sort of neighboring the theme, I guess. And this talk is kind of a report on some of the things we've been doing since the We've been doing since the last time we were here. So let me give you some context. So this project with David, I think it's fair to say his initial motivation was more the smooth strong please problem and the force here. And my initial motivation is a little different. But back when I was a postdoc, I wrote a paper and it's I wrote a paper and its ambition was to link the study of the homotopy type of diffeomorphism groups of manifolds to the homotopy type of spaces of embeddings of one manifold and another. And I think my paper was titled Family of Embedding Spaces. That aspect of what I was trying to accomplish failed in that paper. But the reason why it failed is we didn't have, I didn't have. failed is we didn't have i didn't have um enough interesting diffeomorphisms to study and in a sense this this work with david is we've we've found the diffeomorphisms we need now uh so uh how did i get started on this so some context so uh thatcher wagner nineteen seventy three 1973, when I was born. So there's this theorem which says that the mapping class group of a circle across a disk, in my talk, when I talk about diffeomorphism groups, they're always going to restrict to the identity on the boundary. So isotopy classes of diffeomorphisms of this manifold restrict the identity on the boundary. So their theorem is that, well, they roughly computed this. It's isomorphic to the mapping class group of an n-ball cross mapping class group of an n minus one ball cross a direct sum of infinitely many copies of z2. So let me give you a sense for what So, let me give you a sense for what this is about. So, this is an n-dimensional manifold. So, you can embed an n-dimensional ball in it, and there's diffeomorphisms of that. So, if they're the identity on the boundary, you can extend them to the whole manifold. And so that's how this group sits in there. This, given a diffimorphism of dn minus one, you can cross it with the identity. You can cross it with the identity on the circle, and that's how that factor sits in there. And then this thing, well, when I saw this, I was wondering, well, what is that? There's a simple theorem that tells you what that is. It's a pretty elementary theorem, but as far as I know, David and I might be the first people to write it up, but the diffeomorphism. But the diffeomorphism group of S1 cross D n minus 1, it has the homotopy type of the space of embeddings of D n minus 1 in S1 cross D N minus 1 with diff dm. So this is this means embeddings of the N minus one disk in S. In S1 cross the M minus one disk, which are the standard linear inclusion on the boundary. And so that this is their parametrizations and that's their images, their isotopic classes of their images. So one thing that we also argued in this is that the isotopy classes of embeddings. The isotopy classes of embeddings. And this is why I think maybe it's new. So these are a monoid naturally. You can take one of these and another one and stack them on top of each other, like disk to disc. Right, like that, maintaining the circle direction. You can stack them on top of each other. That turns this into a monoid. And we proved that the monoid structure. The monoid structure is a group for all n greater than or equal to two. And so it's a consequence of Hatcher-Wagner that it's a group for this was our n greater than or equal to six over here. And in low dimensions, it's a group for sort of elementary reasons. But in dimensions four and five, as far as I know, this is a new result. Result. And so that's why maybe I think this maybe is obvious to Al, but he just never wrote it up. But this was a new observation at the time, I think. So these are these embedded images of disks. Okay, so now let me tell you what the Farrell conjecture is. Tell you what the Farrell conjecture is. So, around 1970, Tom Farrell proved a fantastic theorem about when a high-dimensional manifold fibers over the circle. And he says that he was wondering about the uniqueness of, you know, so there's a theorem about when manifolds fiber over the circle, and he was curious about the question of. And he was curious about the question of how could he prove the uniqueness of the fibering, or under what conditions could he prove the uniqueness of the fibering. And he came up with this example in 1970. As far as I know, Alan Hatcher is the only person to record this, so Farrell, as recorded by Atcher. And this appears in his 19 Appears in his 1978 concordance survey. Truck sent germath volume 32. So what he did is, so he takes S1 cross BN minus one and And you take a standard point cross dn minus one. And then you attach an embedded eye handle to one side, a trivial, like just a trivial eye handle. Like just a trivial eye handle. Like no, just like a linearly embedded handle. And so you do an embedded surgery. So you drill out this part of the boundary and you replace it with this part of the boundary of the eye handle. And then what you do is, so that changes the homotopy type of this embedded disk to something that's not a disk anymore. So what you do is you're going to Do is you're going to convert it back to a disk by doing a canceling handle attachment. So you take an embedded I plus one handle that cancels. So that's the attaching sphere for a canceling I plus one handle. But instead of embedding the handle in like the linear Euclidean way, you start getting sneaky. So you put a little tube into the face of that handle and you run it around. And you run it around to the other side. You come back. And now I am going to take another color. So this is an eye handle. So there's an embedded SI here. And what I'm going to do is that provided we're in sufficiently high dimensions and the The dimension of the normal fibers is sufficiently large. What I'm going to do is, I'm going to embed a copy of the, I guess this will be the, what is this going to be, the I minus two fold suspension of the hop vibration. I'm going to embed a copy of the I plus one sphere in the tubular. Sphere in the tubular neighborhood of this I sphere so that the normal bundle fiber projection is the suspension of the hop vibration. And that sphere is what goes through here. So here's this SI plus one that I've tubed to the face over there. Uh, the face over there. So, uh, I hope that makes sense. I think to do this, we need that, let's see, to do this, we need that the normal directions. I think we need this, this sort of bound. So I think the we need the normal direction needs to be, so we need Needs to be so we need the normal directions to be at least i plus two dimensional. So so the the minimum dimension where you can do this is n at least six. Well, at least there's a there's an issue of maybe you can do it in dimension five. I don't know how to do it in dimension five, but I have a math overflow question asking if you can do this in dimension five. And yeah, so that's his embedding. And he was wondering: is that isotopically non-trivial? And trivial and uh there is a uh there is a cutesy argument that it's trivial in it it's it's in the boundary of the pseudoisotopy fiber sequence that it's it's a null concordant you would say uh but uh uh is it trivial and and so that was his conjecture and so what we have uh we have an argument that it's not trivial and uh i hope to give you a sense for that maybe a slightly broader That is maybe a slightly broader context for how to argue these things. So, where do we fit in? I stared at that. I've stared at this problem for years and years and years. I was fascinated by it as a grad student. I spent hours talking to Hatcher about this problem. I've tried to attack it many, many times over my career and failed. Uh, failed, and uh, it was very happy to see that David and I pushed machinery far enough that we could attack it. And uh, and I have a I have another way of looking at this that I find more preferable than Farrell's original way. It's very similar, but it's a little bit different. So, where we fit in? So, there's something that we call barbell manifolds. Barbell manifolds, so uh bij n uh so this is what we call a barbell manifold and and really barbell manifold uh for us it's largely a synonym for uh small manifolds where we know that there's interesting families of diffeomorphisms. We uh we keep on changing the meaning of Barbell manifold as we find more and more interesting diffeomorphisms. So uh So, what is it? It is a trivial disk bundle over a sphere. Boundary connects another trivial disk bundle over a sphere. And right, so like B one, one, two is a twice punctured disc, and so on, B one. B one, two, three is it's a uh solid torus with a disc drilled out of it, and so on. Yeah, so well, one there is that i, let's see, i plus j minus n of the diffeomorphism. And of the diffeomorphism group of the Bardell manifold contains a subgroup isomorphic to the integers. And this is what we use to get interesting diffeomorphisms of four manifolds and so on. And maybe what I'm going to do, oh, provide it. I plus J is greater than or equal to n. So when I plus J is equal to N, it's giving you elements in mapping less groups. And so in our first paper, we did the case where I and J were equal and equal to n minus 2. That's the family we looked at in our first paper. And what we'll see is the feral embedding comes from the I plus J equal to N case. Plus j equals to n case, which is a little different than what we did in our first paper. So rather than like drag you through all the bundle stuff to see what these diffeomorphisms are in general, I think my strategy will be to just show you case by case what these diffeomorphisms are. And they're defined sort of inductively. So knowing what they are in sort of a base case is the most important. The barbell diffeomorphism in the B112 case is the diffeomorphism you get by taking this disk. And I'm going to take a one-parameter family of embeddings of that disk that just drags that disk all the way around. And it leaves the orientation of the disk fixed. So if you think through, if you like the theory of mapping class groups of surfaces, what that is, is it's a Dane twist. It's a positive Dane twist about the outer boundary curve composed of a negative Dane twist. Curve composed of the negative name twists about the inner boundary curves. That's what the diffeomorphism is. And one thing I would like to emphasize, because this is a statement that is a version of it that's true in every dimension. If you think about what does the barbell diffeomorphism do to the disk that separates it into a boundary connect sum, well, Connect some. Well, what does it do? You go one full day twist around that way, and then you undo it that way. All right, that's what it does, right? So another way of thinking about that is as a transformation, you're taking the arc that separates it into a boundary connect sum, and then there is a And then there is a surgery corresponding to this one handle, and a surgery corresponding to this one handle. And we're replacing that arc by these two arcs, replacing that arc by these two arcs, well, these two arcs by those two arcs, and so on. So you're doing an embedded surgery on a two-component link. Two component link right this is a two component link it's a linked copies of the zerosphere and that's what the diffeomorphism does it does embedded surgery by attaching handles the standard handles on the linked copy of the zerosphere in this in this uh what we call the mid-ball right so B one two three One, two, three. This is a three-dimensional thing, and we've got a one handle here and a drilled-out ball. And the diffeomorphism comes from dragging this ball around like that. And I encourage you to think through the isotopy extension. The diffeomorphism, what it does, is it There is an embedded surgery where you do a one-handle attachment along this embedded zero sphere and a two-handle attachment along that embedded circle. And they're a standard linked pair again. I encourage you to think about it. This is the essential. The essential inductive step in understanding what is happening in all dimensions. Let me jump to dimension four, where it gets interesting, because here you're just doing sort of a single isotopy extension. In dimension four, you kind of have to do two. So in dimension four, B224, all right, so this is S2 cross D2. S2 cross D2, boundary connect zone S2 cross D2. So although this is not a proper smooth category statement, if you talk about manifolds with corners and straightening corners, this is also S2 cross D1, boundary connect sum, S2 cross D1 cross an interval. And so what the barbell diffeomorphism of this manifold. Of this manifold, it is going to be a diffeomorphism of this product which preserves this coordinate. So it's a fiber-preserving diffeomorphism or a horizontal diffeomorphism. So we're going to look at pi one diff of, I guess that's the B113 manifold. Three manifold. Oh, sorry, sorry, V223 manifold. Okay, well, so now this, think of it as a twice-punctured three-ball. And so I've got if B two two three. two two three well there is div uh s two cross i here and then in in that s2 cross i i take a three ball a fixed three ball and i just restrict that diffeomorphism to that embedded three ball so that gives me an embedding of b3 in s2 cross i uh the so that this is a locally trivial fiber bundle the This is a locally trivial fiber bundle. The fiber is this diffeomorphism group. This map is null homotopic. And this is sort of where the theory of diffeomorphism groups starts playing. This is a locally trivial fiber bundle that happens to be null homotopic. You don't see those very often. In diffeomorphism groups, you see them quite a lot. What's going on? This diffeomorphism is the identity on the outer sphere and on the inner sphere. So I can do a deformation retraction of that whole diffeomorphism group and just Lifeomorphism group and just conjugate it by an affine linear map and shrink the support down to a thin layer. So it's identity on more and more and more. It's like not the identity on this tiny little thin layer, but once you've shrunken it down enough, that wall is outside the diffeomorphism group support. So that's the null homotopy. So this is sort of how diffimorphism groups become, this is sort of the kind of fun arguments to see in diffeomorphism groups of mannables. Yeah, so that means. So that means you've got an essential map from loop embeddings B3 into S2 cross I mapping into this diffeomorphism group and this space this space has a homotopy type by you know sort of the spaces of tubular neighborhoods this is an ODE's result this has the homotopy type of S2 cross SO3 provided these embeddings are O3, provided these embeddings are orientation-preserving, and O3 if you allow something more general. So, that loop of S2 is what we take mapping into here. So that's our loop of S2 into here. And this diffeomorphism group, well, this is pi zero of loop of that. And we're looking at the fiber preserving diffeomorphisms. So we've got a map from A map from pi to loop of S2 to here. So pi, maybe I should say pi zero double loop S2, right? The fiber preserving diffeomorphisms. So we have that extra loop parameter from the looking at fiber preserving diffeomorphisms, and this is the integers. So the So, the Barbel diffeomorphism is the when you go layer to layer in this product decomposition, you have all these various different loops of this ball going around that ball and the induced diffeomorphism. So, yeah, so the essential insight to these barbell diffeomorphisms is that now here I'm drawing Here I'm drawing B224, but this is an S2 cross D2 boundary connect sum, an S2 cross D2. The D2 above a point in this S2, draw some color, we've got the D2 over here, and you ask, well, what in my mid-ball, which points are mapped to these co-chores? And you get, this is a three. And you get, this is a three-dimensional ball here. You get a hoplink. And the argument for this is you just go layer by layer and you do exactly this argument here. But the issue is that now this is going to be a two-sphere over here. So that loop, in one picture, you'll be doing exactly this. You'll have the linking circle with a zero sphere. Circle with a zero sphere. But then, as you as this sort of is no longer going around the equator of the two-sphere over here, the length you get here will have the zero sphere going down and the two-sphere going up, and they close off. And if you do it the other way, they go the other way. And so you get this sort of inductive process of writing a standard two-component linking pair as an iterated suspension of lower dimension. Suspension of lower-dimensional two-component linking pairs. And that's sort of the essential geometry that goes on with these diffeomorphisms. Yeah, so there we go. All right. So the So the theorem that got us into this was the like the version that we that's in the paper now, the first paper, the first draft had a big mistake in it. So here is my S1 cross D3, and I'm going to embed, I'm going to embed the barbell manifold. To embed the barbell manifold. The barbell manifold is like a little neighborhood of a wedge of two two-spheres. So the wedge point I've turned into an interval. And what do we have? We go like this. And you come in another thing down here, which goes under this, goes around, under. and or over around oops something like that and so these these points we count one two down to k minus one and this connects to one two down to k minus one so the the this this is an embedding of uh of uh two two spheres uh connected by an interval in a little regular neighborhood An interval and a little regular neighborhood of that is the barbell manifold. So you extend the barbell diffeomorphism by the identity map on the exterior of that regular neighborhood, and you get the diffeomorphism that we call delta k. And the theorem is that delta k for k greater than or equal to 4, they are linearly independent over the integers in zero. in I zero if S1 cross be true. Yeah, and so by that other interpretation, we know that they necessarily give interesting embeddings of the three ball and S1 cross a three ball. Yeah, so Maybe I should mention, so more generally, so there's a map loop n minus j of the i sphere to diff B I J N. And this is for all I and J greater than or equal to one and for any n. And this map is essential. This is a, this is actually this map, this subspace is a retract. So there is, and there's a retract. So all the homotopy groups of this live in the homotopy groups of this diffeomorphism group. Groups of this diffeomorphism group. And the rough idea is: I can tell you what the map back is. So your barbell manifold is right, so you've got the SI cross DN minus I here. So this is the Si D n minus I. And you've got the S J cross D N minus J. So given a diffeomorphism of Given the diffeomorphism of this barbell manifold, what you do is you look at what it does to this co-coerger, this dn minus j, and for a suitable projection map to this core I-sphere, that's your n minus j fold loop in SI. So that's how you go from here to here. And the way you see that there's a map from here to there is you look at the fiber-preserving diffeomorphisms. The fiber-preserving diffeomorphisms of this barbell manifold and just inductively climb up the ladder where you're at the lowest dimensional case. I guess this also requires i less than or equal to j. If j was less than or equal to i, you would just reverse the roles of i and j. Right, so you just inductively get down to the case where The case where you can't split off eye dimension, you can't split off intervals when looking at fiber-preserving diffeomorphisms. And then you have the, you know, this ball can orbit around the other sphere. Okay, so how does this relate to Paul Ferrell's work? So, um, so a picture so for uh B I J N with I plus J equal to N. So we've got this map from loop I S I to diff E I J N and uh And so the pi zero of this is the integers. And so the claim is that that injects into pi zero diff. And I just want to give you a picture explanation of how you can make that argument. And it sort of follows with the pictures that we were seeing earlier. So you've got So you've got you've got the SI here and the SJ here. And the complementary co-chore is going to be a DJ here and a by use of this crumbly chalk DI here. And then we look at the And then we look at the mid-ball, and you ask which points of this mid-ball are sent to these two co-chores, and you get a copy of SJ minus one and s i minus one And remember, i minus one plus j minus one, that's that's a one. That's i plus j minus two, which is n minus two. This is n minus one dimensional. So these are exactly the right dimensions to have a linking number, and the linking number is one. Not only that, they're standard, they're standardly embedded, like these are linearly embedded, standard linking pairs. This is all sort of classical surgery constructions. There's no non-linearity in the way these are embedded. They're genuinely linearly embedded spheres. They're unknotted. All right, so that's this is if you if you this this requires a lot of patience. It took us months to see this. So I hope to work on presenting this so that you can visualize the whole thing in one hour presentation. thing in one one one hour presentation but i i don't have anything slick i just want to present you the inductive chain of reasoning you really the the way we think about it is really just inducting up and looking at this slice by slice from that fiber preserving perspective and uh i i don't know a way of doing it other than that right now okay so back to tom farrell stuff so uh what do we do um What do we do? So, I'm going to look inside S1 across a disk, and it's probably going to be pretty high-dimensional eventually. And now, what I want to do is And now, what I want to do is, okay, yeah. So I want to embed this barbell manifold in here and extend. And so what I'm going to do is that we can do it. So here's my barbell manifold. So what's going on is I have a use some more colors. Say I have a linearly embedded Si minus one. S i minus one and I have a linearly embedded SJ. And provided we're in high enough dimensions and I is not too close to dimension N, I am going to embed a copy of the I-sphere in a little tubular neighborhood of that I. So this is a standard linking pair. I'm so this is a standard linking pair Si minus one and Sj, standard linear linking pair, and I'm going to embed a copy of Si in that tubular neighborhood of the linearly embedded Si minus one, such that the tube neighborhood projection from the Si to the Si minus one is the I minus threefold suspension of the pop vibration. Of the pop vibration. And you can do that provided, I guess, provided J is like, I think I plus one or larger. So that, so that is, so I do that embedding. So this I sphere is sort of non-linearly embedded, but the J sphere is linearly embedded. And that's how I embed. I embed the barbell manifold B I J N. And then you extend the Barbell diffeomorphism via the identity. And the claim is that that diffeomorphism is an extension of feral symbetic. Yeah, so this restricts on point cross B n minus one to. P n minus one to ferrells and uh and the the the key insight to that is really this picture um so uh what what so so for example seeing what it does when you when you restrict it to this disk is maybe complicated but it's a little easier over here because But it's a little easier over here because the disk is just passing through the bar here, and we have said what it does. Well, we've said a lot of what it does on the bar here. So what's going on is when you restrict this diffeomorphism to the bar, well, you are doing an eye handle attachment, like an eye handle embedded surgery that runs through this. That runs through this I-sphere and a J-handle embedded surgery that runs through that J-sphere. And that's not, that wasn't what the feral embedding was. It was an I-handle attachment followed by a canceling I-handle attachment. So, what's going on here is that I don't know if you've read the topological picture book, but George Francis has this wonderful, wonderful picture. Texas has this wonderful, wonderful picture in it where he describes: if you drill a one handle out of a three ball, that's equivalent to attaching a one handle to the other side. So that's like the very special case where I plus J is one less than the ambient dimension three. So here you can view this as we've done a drilling of a, so we've the diffeomorphic. So the diffeomorphism, the result on point cross Dn minus one, it's a drilling on the, it's a J handle drilling, drilling on the left side. And I handle embedded surgery on the left. Surgery on the right side. This one is non-linear, but that one is a linear one. So the drilling of the J handle, what you do is you put your hand in that hole and you pull it through. And that J handle drilling turns into an I minus one handle attachment. This is an I minus one handle attachment on the right side. And the fact that these were linked is exactly the from the point of like view of like you know the kind of things you do in the H cobortism theorem that says this I minus one handle followed by the I handle attachment that those are a canceling pair. This is Farrell's construction on the nose, but just turned halfway inside out, which is, I think that's. Is I think that's really nice. Yeah, so that's why this is Ferrell's embedding in sort of a sketch. Okay, so why is Ferrell's embedding non-trivial? I'm going to need that picture. So non-triviality. Okay, so what we do, this is sort of like almost the same kind of argument in the first paper with David, but it's a little simpler. In the first paper with David, we're using a type 2 Vesiliov invariant to separate embedded disks. Embedded disks. This uses a type 1 bacilliable invariant, which in three dimensions there are Teddy, but in high dimensions, when your manifold is not simply connected, there are. So what do we do? So an embedded dn minus one, we think of it as an n minus two parameter family of intervals. Of intervals. And so given an embedding of dn minus one in S1 cross d n minus one, we produce an n minus twofold loop worth of embedded intervals in s1 cross d n minus one. And so pi to zero, pi to zero, and using embedding calculus, you can. And using embedding calculus, you can, this is like well within the range of what embedding calculus can do. This group is isomorphic to Z mod 2, the Laurent polynomials modulo T0. I guess, I mean, technically, sorry, T zero. Technically, whether or not I mod out by this T0 doesn't change the group's isomorphism structure. So it sort of comes from the form. So let me let me. So let me tell you what this is. So you've got a map from Sn minus 2 to this embedding space. And this is really very classical stuff that goes back to even before Basilia. This is like Hafliger, Hatcher, double point methods. So you've got a map from the n minus 2 through to this embedding space. I am going to convert it to a map. I am going to convert it to a map from Sn minus two across the configuration space of two points in the interval to the configuration space of two points in S1 cross D n minus one. And so on on that interval, I just, I go up T1 less than or equal to T2, and I just ask where do they go to? Where do those pair of points go to? And this phase is, it has the homotopy type of S1. type of S1 cross S1 wedge Sn minus one. Okay, so what else can we do? I can embed this space in SN in sort of a standard way. What do I mean? Well, what I mean is in terms of time, I'm I'm not in a huge rush, am I? Oh, okay. So, the key idea here is: so, this map is what you would call the evaluation map in embedded calculus, in that you're for every point in the sphere, you're considering all pairs of points on this interval and where they map to. So, this would be called the second stage of the Taylor Tower. It's a rather cute theorem that the map to the The map to the first stage, it's often null homotopic. And it's not always null homotopic in this generality. If your interval actually winds a non-trivial time around the S1 factor, it's not going to be null. But as long as your interval doesn't wind, like the situation we're in, this map on the first stage is null homotopic. So on the boundary of this map, right, the boundary of configurations of two. This map, right? The boundary of configurations of two points, you either have one point at the end of the interval, two points colliding, or you know, the other point at the end point. So, on the boundary of this mapping space, on this domain, you're essentially in the first stage of the Taylor Tower, and those maps are canonically null. There's a canonical null homotopy. And this canonical null homotopia, I think Tom Goodwilly first observed it. I learned of it from Dev Sinha. It's in, David and I have it. Almost every embedding calculus paper has a version of it hidden somewhere. It probably deserves a special write-up of its own somewhere. So when you restrict to the boundary, you get a null homotopic map. You get a null homotopic map, but it's not just null homotopic, it's a canonical null homotopy. And it just, and the form of the null homotopy basically just comes down to, or the, on the boundary, that's when two points collide. So this map is essentially the derivative of the embedding itself from a, you know, from a single variable, from a calculus perspective. And the way that all homotopy is defined is just coming from things. Is just coming from thinking about that limit that defines the derivative of a function from a little bit more of a homotopy theoretic perspective. And when you think about it that way and add some straight line homotopies to the definition, you get this canonical null homotopy. It's a very beautiful argument. And yeah, so we get this map from the n-sphere to here. Well, those S1 factors are not very relevant. You've got an N-sphere mapping to an N minus. You've got a n-sphere mapping to an n-1 sphere, and you know, we're in the this is a stable homotopy group, so this is a Z mod 2's worth of maps now, and uh, that's how you get the Laurent polynomial array. You just look at the pi n of this is a direct sum of infinitely many copies of pi n S n minus one, and you look at all those projections and you count. So, what what how does that happen? Well, now Now, when I restrict this diffeomorphism to this disk, and I go by intervals, I'm looking at pairs of points and I'm asking where they get mapped to. And then, well, if I wanted to compute this homotopy group in the frame cobordism way, you would take a point in this sphere that's not the wedge point, take its pre-image, that is a framed one-dimensional submanifold. The one-dimensional sub-manifold and its self-framing number would be the Z mod 2. Right, uh, so what do I do? So, I've got these pairs of points on these vertical intervals here, and I so one, two, and I'm going to ask, they're going to be back somewhere by the diffeomorphism. So, I'm going to ask, say, when is their order reversed and when are they pointing in the vertical direction again? And I'm going to count those, and that'll be my frame submanifold. Submanifold. So, yeah, so that's the setup for the computation. It's this. So, what's going on? Well, in this mid-ball, there's points in here that get sent to this co-core, points of here that get sent to this co-chore. Core points of here that get sent to this co-core. But it's basically the only time where got this sort of hoplink in here. The only time where the order gets reversed is where your pair of points are going through a crossing of this hoplink. And so you're going to get a circle where the where the Where the, because you're using the Hop vibration, the suspension of the Hop vibration in here, you're going to get a genuine non-trivially framed circle of points decorated by a monomial T, and you're going to get another circle, a disjoint circle corresponding to the other double point decorated by the monomial T inverse coming from the different wedge summats here. But another way of thinking about it is they are the pair of points are. The pair of points are vertically separated in this manifold, but in the universal cover of the manifold, they're separated by a covering transformation. So you've got a circle, a frame circle worth of points decorated with a T, and a frame circle worth of points decorated with a T inverse. And so this invariant of counting when Counting when vertically separated points are sent to vertically separated points in the opposite order, that is an invariant of n minus one. You pay careful attention to this invariant. It's a well-defined invariant taking values in this Lorentz. Taking values in this Laurent polynomial array mod t0. If they're decorated by t to the zero, the points can collide and sort of slide off the boundary. So that monomials decorated by the trivial covering transformation, they can vanish. But if they're non-trivially framed and decorated by non-trivial monomials, they're framed for orderism class. Their frame formatism class is well defined. That's the sketch of why Tom Farrell's embedding is not true. And so I'm very, what I really like about it is you get this really concrete form, not just for the embedding, but the diffeomorphism that gives you the embedding. When Tom did this, he knew in principle that there was a diffeomorphism that. Principle that there was a diffeomorphism that gave the embedding. I guess, as far as I know, his argument was just the H-cohortism theorem. It had to exist. But this is a very constructive description. I can tell you where all the points go if you have enough patience. You could even write software down that you, we could even write software that will numerically approximate the diffeomorphism. Numerically approximate the diffimorphism because the flows are so concrete. All right. So that's, I think that's most of what I had to say. Maybe I should add, here's an extension of this that I zero if If S1 cross B3, so we had a homomorphism onto an infinite direct sum of integers. The one question people ask us is, does that homomorphism factor through the group of homeomorphisms, the topological mapping class group? And we've been able to verify that. And we've been able to verify that, yes, all of our diffeomorphisms here are non-trivial as topological homeomorphisms. This coincides with the Hatcher-Wagner work that their diffeomorphisms, those that infinite direct sum of Z2s, they're also non-trivial in the group of homeomorphisms. And actually, our argument, roughly speaking, our argument is that we Our invariant was taking values in pi 2 of embeddings of an interval in S1 cross D3. There's a slight variant of that where you take embedded, I guess you would call them topologically tame intervals. So embeddings are really two to the neighborhoods of them. So this, what we've done is we can show that there's a sort of a partially there's a partially defined map from this embedding space back to that topological hope. So a partially defined map this way from from topological from topological embeddings to smooth embeddings. I don't know of a canonical way of smoothing tame topological embeddings, but I can there is an almost canonical way of smoothing tame topological embeddings for compact families of tame topological embeddings. If you're given a compact family of tame topological embeddings, I can construct a Embeddings, I can construct a smooth approximation to it. And this does require everything to be one-dimensional here. I don't know how to do it for embedded surfaces or anything like that. So we can argue that compact families of tame topological tubular neighborhoods of embedded intervals, they have canonical smoothings. Moving. So that's the first one that we resolved. All right. Thank you organizers. Thank you for putting this together. Yes, so maybe there are questions for Ryan. Any questions out there in video, Lan? Any questions in here? Why do you get a topological embedding implication for say they're they're one-dimensional and you one-dimensional objects? I think you'd have to be pretty fussy about uh with graphs. With graphs, like what happened, yeah, how what do you want to call a smoothly embedded graph? I guess there's going to be some fussy details there. I'm not sure what you would really want. One natural thing would be to have like, you know, when three edges come together, do you want some linearity there? Or are you allowing the handle? I should rephrase that handle. Oh, yeah. This kind of argument, even then, when you talk about a handle body, you've got the sort of the issue of what the one skeleton is. And the sense in which there is a map here, the only sense in which Really, the only sense in which the smooth embedding that you produce is an approximation to the topological embedding is when you restrict the interval across a point. This process does create a, it actually does create a smooth embedding of interval across T2, but in that two for the neighborhood, it's going to wildly differ from the topological embedding. You kind of, you know, your topological embedding can do all kinds of crazy things. vending can do all kinds of crazy things and this this uh uh this the smooth approximation is just uh it's just going to be a it's going to be a nice smooth embedding that's a C0 approximation, but all the local zigzaggy craziness is going to be forgotten. And if your tuber of the neighborhood had any kind of crazy zigzagginess, the approximation is going to be an extremely beautiful. Beautiful, uh, smooth thing from like a differential geometric perspective. So, the two billion neighborhoods are going to have almost nothing, one's going to be contained in the other. That's about the only thing I can say. I have a question. Yeah. Very nice talk, Ryan, but could you explain a little more the monoid structure on the embeddings of DN minus one and DN minus one? Uh, dn minus one and dn minus one, and why it's a group for certain dimensions, right? Right. So, it's uh, the idea is if you've got two circle cross disks, you stack them on top of each other so that the circle parameter is fixed, uh, is preserved, right? So, you're basically just stacking one disk on top of another. Of another in that fashion. And our proof that it's a group involves relating it to another space. It's a fiber sequence that I always admired, but I didn't know it had a purpose. Sarah, I think it was a very important thing. Serif pioneered it, and I think we just rediscovered it. So, what Serif does is he's looking at the space of embeddings of, I call them half disks, an i-dimensional half disk. So if it's a like just take an I-dimensional disk and cut it by a hyperplane. So H D I into D M. Into DN. So you're going to take embeddings of the half disk into a genuine disk, and the embeddings are going to be required to be the standard linear inclusion on the round boundary. But on the rest of it, it's free to do any kind of crazy stuff you like. So there's embeddings of half disks into disks, and now you can restrict to the flat face of the half. To the flat face of the half disk. So that gives you an embedding of an I minus one disk into an N disk. And then the fiber, so this is a locally trivial fiber bundle. The fiber is not terribly nice, but it is. We can't see the blackboard. I don't know if the camera is on you or the camera went off. Yeah. Oh, it is on. It is on. Oh, it is. Okay. I can see it. Oh, I can see the audio. I can see the audience, but oh, there, okay. Okay, yeah. So, we've got the eye-dimensional half-disc embedding in the regular disk, and we demand that the round part goes to the round part in a standard fashion. The flat part can be any embedding. So we've got a restriction fibration to the flat boundary, the flat part of the boundary. And then the fiber of this is it's going to be embeddings of Embeddings of, well, it's embeddings of a half disk in a disk where all the boundary is prescribed, right? And so that almost gets us there. So what we need What we need is to when we consider this embedding, this sort of a the disk has an outward pointing vector, so you can differentiate the embedding in that outward pointing direction, and that gives us embedded disks with a one-dimensional vector field on them. And then if you enhance the If you enhance the base space of the fiber bundle that way, the fiber now becomes the same, but the boundary is fixed, but also the velocity vectors on the boundary is fixed. And so now this is embeddings of D i into into S what is it? S N What is it? S n uh what is it? I S N minus I cross D I. Right, so you sort of just drill out, you drill out a little, you make that embedding fixed on the in a little, you make you make it a linear embedding in a tube of the neighborhood of the flat face, and we can identify that. Face and we can identify that whole embedding space with embeddings of di in sphere across di and the embeddings that are standard on the boundary. And now, so when n minus i is one, so we've got the space that we were interested in, and so we wanted to know about pi zero of this. Okay, well, this space here is contractible, right? Because these space of embedded half-disks, you can sort of shrink it down to ones that are approximated by linear embeddings on the fixed space. So that space is contractible. So pi one of this space maps onto pi zero of here. And this mapping is compatible with the stacking operation. So the stacking operation as a monoid is a group. That's the argument. As a group, that's the argument. Thank you, Ryan. Yeah, as far as I know, this argument, I don't think this argument was known in this generality. I think maybe some people knew it in some cases, but everyone I've talked to that I would hope maybe knows this, they've been a little bit surprised. They've been a little bit surprised, but I'm yeah, so I'm not sure. Maybe someone knew this, maybe Serf knows this, but I haven't talked to him. Any other questions for Ryan? With that, let's thank Ryan one more time. And this concludes the meeting for everyone here. For everyone here, I wish you a good trip home. And everyone online, I have a happy time at home or wherever you are. All right, until the next time we meet. Bye-bye. Thanks for having us. Bye-bye. Thank you. Thank you.
