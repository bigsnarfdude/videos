The theories for the dynamics of liquid crystals always start with a perfectly ordered system, right? And then they talk about, and then you have this mode and that mode, right? As if you could have a perfectly ordered system. But then, you know, experimentalists don't show you perfectly ordered systems. They show you things like this. And the thing that's really important about this is you can identify the phase just by looking at the picture. And here, this is kind of a weird one. This is a cholesteric phase made of DNA. That's why you get different colors. Different colors, right? Here's a cholesterol. I always like to tell this to my graduate students, right? See, there's a first-order transition between this phase and this phase, because you have a sharp line between them. So it's isotropic and cholesteric. And so just for the pictures, you can see lots of things without doing calorimetry experiments or any of that. You can already talk about the phase behavior. Here's more, right? Here's the blue phase, which Blue phase, right, which you know is already interesting. This is a smectic. Most experimentalists, if you show them this picture, smectic, right? But how that's a smectic, how you go from nanometer scale molecules to this thing, which is hundreds of microns across, you know, that's a big step. Although it was all figured out by the ancients back in 1905, right? And so I just want to say what my focus is I just want to say what my focus is on and what my focus has been on. I'm always interested in the topology because, as you know, right, topology is about two things being continuously related to each other. And all those differential equations preserve topology, right? Isn't that the whole point? You have initial conditions and then it evolves, but the final evolved condition is a smooth deformation from the initial condition. So here you look at this and you say, Here you look at this and you say, well, this is a complicated picture, which everyone would say is a nomadic. And you see these places where you have these crossings in fours and in twos. And just to remind, this is like bringing smectics to, someday they'll say it's like bringing smectics to bands. Right? So, so you have a backlight, you have a polarizer and an analyzer, and you have molecules in between, and because they're birefringent. Molecules in between, and because they're birefringent, if the molecules aren't perfectly aligned with the polarizer or the analyzer, some light gets through. Right? Because the polarized light breaks into the two components and they go across at different velocities and then they recombine out of phase. And thus you get something. And so where you see black, black is because the molecules happen to be along the polarizer or along the analytic. So you see, immediately, you take this two-dimensional data set. You take this two-dimensional data set and you reduce it to a one-dimensional data set. Right? All the black lines. Because that tells you everything. And you know that in between the black lines, they're not pointing along the polarizer at the end of polarizer. And then there's a zero-dimensional set where the one-dimensional things degenerate. And so you focus on those, and you get four because when you have a defect, a place where you don't know the orientation, you have to go around by 2 pi plus or minus to keep the thing. Or minus to keep the thing single value. And so, since you get black whenever it's along the polarizer and the analyzer, you get four brushes. This has to go polarizer, analyzer, polarizer, analyzer. And then, you know, the cool thing is, see, from pure thought, you can look at these. How can you have just two brushes? Right? When you have two brushes, it must mean that it just goes through the polarizer once and the analyzer once. Which means that the molecules, or at least the phase, must have this up-down. or at least the phase must have this up-down symmetry. Right? And so again, this is, you know, this is the, sorry, I was going to say 30,000 foot. This is the 933 meter, 9,330 meter view of the liquid crystal. You know, you're looking at something that's very disordered, but you can still glean information from it. You can still glean information from it by topological things: the sharpness of interfaces, the defects that it has. And, you know, so here, Lisa made me this movie a long time ago. You know, this would be a cool thing to simulate. And I know people can simulate this, right? But, you know, Lisa took this movie. I think I sped it up. I think it took much longer. Yeah. I sped it up. But if we played it in real time, could you? But if we played it in real time, could you tell me what the liquid crystal elastic constants are? Presumably you should be able to, there's so much data here. Presumably you should be able to tell me everything. We should be able to backfit the three elastic constants, the five viscosities. I mean, there's eight parameters, but there was lots of frames there. We had everything. Okay, so I just want to say that. I had some extra things that when I. Extra things that you know, when I think about layered systems, layered systems are everywhere. So here, I was flying exactly, exactly, right? And here's the cool thing. You see, here it decides that it likes homeotropic anchoring, right? But for some reason out here, it doesn't like homeotropic anchoring, right? And there's a quick switch. This is like your system in Manuel, where it goes from this to this, right? And probably that's because the farmer did it, right? The farmer did it, right? But I just want to, I zoom in. Look at this one. See, the farmer did this too, right? And so the farmer is figuring out how to get around this defect, right? You can see, I showed you at lunch, at dinner last night, the fact that there are ripples here without even knowing anything, since you know that the farm implements only make equally spaced rows, right? You know that the ripples are telling you that the surface isn't flat. So you can deduce all sorts of things by looking at things on scale. Of things by looking at things on scales that are, you know, so I look out, that's what I see, right, when I look out the airplane window. Here, I, do you know where this is? Why would I ask you? Huh? No, no, why would I ask you? Guess the country. I mean, either the UK? No, it's Norway. It's Norway, right? It's Norway, right? It's photo. It's at a fjord entrance, right? And here you see this nice cement deck, right? These are the rocks. And then, you know, I always compare it. Like, here's a picture of some lipid bilayer system that also makes layers, right? You do freeze fracture. And here's another one, right, which has grass on the top. And here, I think you took this picture. Okay. Okay, a purity. Okay, purity. But you're a co-author on this picture, right? So here's the grass on top, here are the layers. Okay, the top nanoparticles affect the anchoring, right? Here's another one. This is of course the grand challenge when you do electron microscopy, is that sometimes you don't cut in a nice plane, and you get a funny cut, and then you see this thing, and that's what happened here, and you can do the same thing here, and you can make these funny cuts. But you can interpret it properly, you can see the layers. Okay. See the layers. Okay. That was all I wanted to say about layers. But now I want to. Oh, should I not turn the monitor off? The monitor will help you figure out where you want it. Can I just switch? Okay, can we get a screen off? I got the screen. Okay. Oh, okay, good. So I had already checked ahead of time that there had to be That there had to be a chalkboard. I knew there would be. But I didn't know they would have so much chalk. So I brought my own chalk. I brought my own eraser a little bit. So I just want to tell you about things that I know and have thought about, about the topology of smectids. And when I talk about the topology of smectids, it's really important because all the simulations had better respect that, right? Respect that. And all the experiments have to also respect it. So, you know, by not doing any calculus and not doing any geometry or not doing any specific models, no parameters, right? By having no parameters, now I'm in a situation where I should be able to alert here. Yellow is important. Where I have to I have to, what was I saying? It's important that when we do any of these things, any of the modeling, that the topology is preserved. We have to get that all right. And lots of people are going to talk about defects, right? And those are the things that are easy to see, probably because they're at a much larger length scale. And of course, we don't have any molecular dynamics people here today. Electrodynamics people here today. But if we did, we'd say your systems are too small. We'll never see topological defects in a thousand by a thousand system. If we see them, we won't see them reliably. It'll be hard to believe. So we need to be able to bridge this region from 100 molecules or 1,000 molecules to the continuum. So I'll start by reminding you how I think of liquid crystals. How I think of liquid crystals. Of course, if you've never met me before, it's all new. And so, what you think about is you think about a sample, and it could be a pneumatic, or it could be a symectic, or it could be a real crystal, it could be a cholesterol, you know, it could be any of these phases. And the sample. And the sample is some region that somebody's looking at in a microscope. And you look at the sample, and you see places where possibly there are defects. Defects are places where I don't know which way the pneumatic director points, or I don't know where the smectic layers are, I don't know where the crystal sites are. Now, how do I tell you the pneumatic, semectic, and crystal layers? Over here, I have the ground state. Have the ground state manifold. In a pneumatic, so in a 2D pneumatic, 2D pneumatic, right, what's the ground state manifold? It's RP1. It's the circle with the antitodes identified. If it were the XY model or a magnetic system, it would just be the circle. A 3D pneumatic. Okay, a 3D pneumatic, 3D pneumatic. In this case, you have a sphere, all the directions that the director can point, except again, you identify antibodies. Like so. Okay? In the smectic, it becomes more complicated what the Ground State manifold is. And then the whole trick of these defects, and the reason that they're stable. And the reason that they're stable is because when you take a path around a defect here, do some measurement, you get a path on the ground state manifold. Maybe it goes like this. This would be a charge half defect, where the angle goes from this angle to that angle plus pi. And this path and this path, this is a non-contractible path, this is a non-contractible path. And so you have something that's stable. So you have something that's stable. As long as everything is changing continuously, then everything is good. And so that can't go away. And what's nice about it is here, I don't even have to measure things at the defect. I'm measuring the things everywhere else. So if you like, in this region here, in this region here, I actually have a map. The map goes from the sample. map goes from the sample, right? And I can use this subtracting the defects. It's a map from the sample minus the defects to the ground state manifold. And it's completely well defined. The only place where I have a problem is at the course. But then I say, all right, my sample minus the defects. That's the thing I'm interested in. That's the thing I'm interested in. You can then, I'll just say, I'll throw this in for fun. That means that when you see defects coalesce, like in Lisa's movie, the sample's actually changing. Because really, this is the sample. The sample is the sample minus the defects. If the number of holes changes, you actually have a different system. So there's a place where you have something discontinuous happening and something exciting can happen on. Okay. And so. And so, what about smectics? And smectics are harder because smectics, what about the smectic ground state manifold? Right? Well, the smectic ground state manifold is a little more complicated. So, let me just think about 2D. So, I have a bunch of layers, like so. And here are the layers. And how am I going to tell you where the layers are? How am I going to tell you where the layers are? And the way I'm going to do it is I want to make some kind of Eulerian variable phi, phi of xy. And I say when phi of xy is an integer, that's where the layers are. So I give you a two-dimensional field phi, and I look at the level sets of phi when phi is 0, when phi is 1, when it's 2, when it's 3. Okay, and that tells me where the layers are. So perfectly great way to do it, and as long as phi is... Perfectly great way to do it. And as long as phi is a nice function, the layers never cross. As long as phi is well behaved, the layers will cross. And the thing, though, is that this system has two symmetries. One symmetry is that you can shift it by one. If I take all the layers, if I took phi and five plus one, that's exactly the same system. The other thing is, because it lives in It's inherited from a pneumatic, and layers don't have an orientation. You never know which way the normal is pointing. It means I could take this and I could rotate it. So that would look like this. 0, 1, 2. I can rotate it by pi. And I get back exactly the same system also, which means that phi can go to minus phi with the phi and the phi plus 1. So there's two symmetries that the phi takes on. The phi takes on. You could say that this is the symectic symmetry, this is the Mach symmetry. You can capture this all by saying, like Scott said, well, we get a density wave. The density wave, there's some background density, which is the liquid part. And then there's some delta rho times cosine 2 pi phi. Okay, and see how cool this is? When delta rho is zero, it's uniform. When delta rho is 0. It's uniform. When delta rho isn't zero, you get a wave, and phi is telling you where the level sets sit. Okay, and so and this has these symmetries: phi goes to phi plus one, and phi goes to minus one. But this is the order for error. But it's kind of weird because this set of symmetries doesn't really Set of symmetries doesn't really make a manifold. It makes something that's a little weird. It's an orbifold, right? These things here make a structure. These two things here make a funny structure because it tells me, phi goes to phi plus one, tells me that phi lives on a circle. A circle of radius one over two pi. Right? So there's phi. But phi and minus phi being equivalent, that's not RP1. That's not saying this point and this point are the same. That's saying this point and this point are the same, and this point and this point are the same. Right? So this is the action of phi goes to minus phi. Which means that sometimes the action acts on these funny points here, which are actually fixed points. Here, which are actually fixed points. These fixed points are special. What are these fixed points? This is phi equals zero, and this is phi equals pi. Like so. So these two fixed points, what are they? They're the minima and the maxima of these layers. Right? And it's very important, at least I think it's important, at least I can't understand things without doing it, to say that there are the layers, and here's this. And here's this small topological fact. Between the two maxima, there's a minimum, and I can always draw the minimum. And the minima are also well defined. If you ask me, tell me where the density is, where cosine is 0.9, that has two solutions. So I know where the cosine is 1 and I know where it's minus 1, and those give me places, and then everywhere else, I don't get a single-valued function. Function. I get two sets of layers. So these are special. These hold special significance, the white and the yellow layers. So the white ones, these are the maxima, and these are the minimum. Any other questions? You have a question? You have something on your hand? You got you're ink. Okay. All right. So. So, this is already an interesting thing that the ground state manifold is complicated. And I'm going to say it's complicated in a way where I don't know how to do calculus on it. Okay, because I don't know, how do you do calculus where phi is either phi and minus phi are equivalent? Where I can do it up here, I can do the calculus, but near the critical, near these fixed points, I can't do it. So, I already find that hard. I know, topologically, I have no problem. Know, topologically, I have no problem with this. I could always make a cover, a double cover, a triple, whatever. I can do some topological thing and not have a problem with this. But I don't know how to do calculus at both points, which is why I said you guys do calculus, right? I don't know how to do that at these points. But these points are everything. They control the whole system. And so this is one fact. Here's another fact due to Ponaru. Wait, hold on. I wrote down something. Wait, hold on. I wrote down something important about Conar. Oh, I didn't write it down. There's an accent somewhere, but I don't know where it is. Do you know where it is? It's Romanian. It's not French, so I don't know. There's an accent somewhere. There's either an accent gra or an accent gir. I don't know what it is. It's over one of these letters. Probably one of the fellows. Okay? And he did this work back in the, I guess back in 1981. I guess back in 1981. And he showed this other interesting fact about smectics, which is not this fact. It's a different fact about smectics, which is smectics do not form all distinctions. This is very important. This is very important. These two things together are going to be important. So, what does that mean? In a pneumatic, let's say I had a 2D pneumatic. In a 2D pneumatic, we know how to do everything, right? Because the circle, RP1 and the circle are basically the same. That doesn't matter. What really matters in a 2D pneumatic is that if you have a charge of charge Q1 and another of charge Q2, if you do a measuring circuit. If you do a measuring circuit around here, so you will find that inside there's a charge Q1 plus Q2. Very abelian. Pneumatics in 2D are the only examples of this, where this works. In 3D, it's not true. 3D pneumatics, because you have disclination lines and point defects, the disclination lines can act on the point defect. So it doesn't just add simply. So it doesn't just add simply, right? But this is always the example that everybody puts in their book, okay? And this is the example, but then makes you think, oh, and not only that, have you read it in the book? They interact like charges in two dimensions. How exciting, right? I can map this electrostatics. But it's only in this case where everything is linear and a Boolean world. But anyhow, pneumatics are really happy this way. And it also means that if you have any two charges, you can make a new. Have any two charges, you can make a new defect with another charge. You would have to do some kind of surgery, right? You'd have to do some sort of surgery. So, up here, you have a system that has one defect. Down here, you have a system that has two defects, like so. So, this is Q1 and Q2, and this is Q1 plus Q2, and then you And then you fill in. This is a two-dimensional sample. Here's another two-dimensional sample. You fill in the three dimensions in between. You could call it time, whatever you want to call it. You fill in this direction, and you, at some point, this thing becomes like a pair of pants. These two things come together, and there's something that happens, but everywhere else, away from this pair of pants, you have a map to the ground state manifold. Map to the ground state manifold, and so you just fill it in. And there's no obstruction doing that. But it turns out, Onara showed that's not true in a smacked. And let me show you. His proof was really hard. His proof was a math proof. It was in a math journal. It was one of those proofs where, well, many of you are mathematicians. So it was one of the things. So, it was proof where we could read every sentence and we could figure out how one sentence followed from the next sentence, but we couldn't connect the first sentence to the last sentence. It was like, yeah, yeah, we could understand each step. Each step, after a great amount of work, we could understand, but then we couldn't really understand the whole thing. It's like when you talk to, you know, senior faculty. Jonathan, I know, is. Jonathan, I know, is not listening. So, so, right? So, okay. Let me prove to you that in a spectrum there are no disclinations with charge greater than. Greater than 0. That's the theorem, right? It turns out this is a really easy theorem to prove if you just do some. It's not an easy theorem to prove, because we wouldn't even have known it was true. But once you know it, it's also true. So imagine that I have a defect in a smectic. What do defects in smectics look like? Well, there's this one here. This is a bullseye. There's this one. There's this one where you have this half disclination. Here's the one where you have no disclination. Here's one where you have charge minus a half and so forth. Those are the layers. Now I look at the layers, I'm fine, but the layers are not what I'm worried about. I'm worried about how the normal or how The normal, or how the layer normal rotates around. And it could be a two-headed example. This one rotates by 2π, this one goes around by pi, this one, nothing happens, this one goes around by minus pi, minus 2. These are all motion in the grand state manifold. It's the rotational motion in the grand state manifold. I go from here to here, it's a path in the grand state manifold. All defects, topological defects, are paths. Topological defects are paths in the ground state manifold. That's the whole point. You're supposed to be going along the flat directions of some potential as you move around. And so the ground state manifold controls the structure of the defects. But then there's this extra bit that on our machine. Let me calculate for you the charge of a defect. Where's the defect? The defects are right here. Right here, at these places where the layers come together. Suppose I have a system or a defect where I have a bunch of layers coming together. They're n layers coming out. Now let me look at the winding of the director or the vector of the layer director. Or the vector of the layer normal. Let me look at the winding as I go from here to here. So it goes like this, like this, like this, this. Because remember, there's a layer that is like so, just above it. So it goes around like this. So what happens? If this is the angle alpha i, then how much does the director rotate? It rotates by plus alpha i latest pi. Minus p of this twist. Does that make sense? Be clear, these are the layers. These are the layers coming out of the defect. So in a minus one-half disclination, there are three layers coming out of one point. This is going to be the negative defect. That's right, although this one's positive. So, this one's positive. If you have one layer coming in, that's positive. But there, you figured out the whole theorem. Right? There you go. So, watch this. Let me add these all up as I go all the way around. So, I add them up. I sum. I goes from 1 to n of this thing. That gives me the total change in the angle. But what do I get? The sum of all the alphas is 2 pi. And each wedge gives me a pi. Which gives me a pi. And so I can see that the charge is 1 minus n over 2. This is Q, or the defect. But n can't be negative, right? That's what you just said. It can't have negative layers coming out. So that means the most of anything to 1 is 2 pi. That's going to equal 0. That's going to equal zero. And then every time you add another week, the charge goes down by that. So this is really weird. It's weird because now let's do that pair of pants that I erased. It means if you take two charge one defects and you try to bring them together. You try to bring them together, you can't make a charge 2 defect up top. There's some obstruction to doing that. But here's the weird thing: you can take two minus one defects and bring them together and get a minus two defect. A minus two defect just has, you know, what has six layers coming in or something. Right? So that's weird because, remember all that abelian stuff I was talking about? Well, this isn't even a group. Forget about it. In a group. Forget about abelian. Nine in a group, because if you take two plus one defects, you can't add them together. There's no addition rule for two elements of that, but there's an addition rule for the negative ones. Whenever you try to do the addition, it always works, but sometimes you can't do the addition. So, whatever is characterizing this is not a brutal. Usually, when people talk about topological defects, they say, uh-huh, Aha, right, a topological defect, usually. So, Ponaru's theorem is actually a giant blow to the way that we always think about classifying defects. Because everyone would tell you that the way you classify a defect is you have a sample and you have the ground state manifold. And you have pi 1 of the sample, closed loops in the sample. Sample, closed loops in the sample. The sample is the sample minus the defects, right, whatever it is. And then you have closed loops in the ground state manifold. And maps from here to here are exactly what characterize defects. This map is induced by this map. So this map induces this map. So there's the map from the sample minus the defect. Map from the sample minus the defects to the ground state manifold, and then this induces this map. And this map is the map that you care about. This is what you care about, and you want this to be a good map so that when you add cert paths here, you get the corresponding addition of paths here. And that's, of course, not true for the semective. But if you look at any, you know, if you look at, if you look at, what's that called? If you look at review articles on topological defects or sections on books on topological defects. Sections on books on topological defects. It's always about this. It's always about the homotopy theory of topological defects. And then you can generalize it to point defects in three dimensions where these are point twos and so forth. But the problem is that smectids don't even enjoy this. You can't even use this to study smectics. So that's the problem. Okay. So it turns out, so this is work I did with So this is work I did with Ichan Ho and Hila Aharoni and Tom Mishon. And that was in 20 something. And then in 20 something else, I whipped it with, what's his name? Brian Chen and Gareth Alexander. So this is a long, long history. There's some extra rules for semectics. And you can actually study semectics if you throw away. Smectics, if you throw away the whole notion of dislocations, right? And I'm going to talk about that on Thursday, I think. So when you look at a smectic, you have the layers and you have the half layers. And they're always n and these are always well defined. And how do you understand the ground state manifold and all that and the structures? You say, well, how do you bring defects together? For instance, in a semiconductor. For instance, in a smectic, I told you that you can't bring two plus one defects together. How do you bring them together? Because it's supposed to happen. If you waited long enough, it might be more than four years, but if you waited long enough, they should eventually coalesce. Just like in a dneadic, that's one of our questions. What's that time scale? What's that time scale? Let me compare that to the question of suppose I have two plus a half defects. I have a question. Yes. I thought they only attract if they have opposite. Yeah. That's right, but I could still bring... That's. You're talking about energy. I haven't written down all that, that free energy. No, I'm just saying, could you coalesce them? Right? In pneumatics, you could bring two plus one, right? You could take two, two. You could take two, two, right? I'm just saying, how do you do it topologically? Because anything we do better satisfy this. You're right. I could solve the problem by saying this never happens. It never happens that two plus ones like two. But in fact, what I'm going to tell you applies to a plus one annihilating a minus one. If you have two plus a half defects, there's no problem. You just bring them together on the line. No problem. You just bring them together on the line that connects them. If you have two minus one defects, no line connects them. So what do you do? Well, you realize that there are these other layers. So let me draw the simplest one. Here are two plus one defects. And now let me draw the minimum as well. So there's a minimum in between these. Okay? And what happens? And what happens? You can do a move. It's a bad move. It's a singular move. You can take this and you can make a singular move. And the singular move can take you to, wait, don't tell me. Something like this. You still have these yellow layers like so. Hold on. Yeah, that's it. And now you have to break this yellow layer into two pieces. And if you try to coalesce these, right, so you see, what do you see here? Here's minus one half, plus one half, minus one half, plus one half. So you haven't changed the charge, the disclination charge. You still have these two. But you've now split. But you've now split the disclination charge across the minimum and the maximum. And smectics have to do this. Right? Smectics have to have a situation where the disclinations, sometimes they sit on maximum and sometimes they sit on minimum. And if you don't do that, you can't get them. These would be a sterile liquid crystal, sterile spectrum. The defects would never be allowed to combine. And it would be true for plus one and minus one as well, because. If you had a plus one and a minus one, you still have to destroy these layers. You still have to, right? There's still some yellow layer in here, which when you coalesce this with the white layer, it has to pinch and disappear. And so there's always this problem, right? Plus one defects are difficult. You can't combine them. You can't combine them with anything unless you're prepared to do this and prepared to have this new transition, which conserves disclination charge, but is definitely something that has to happen if you want the defects to combine. This is what happens in an oily street. When an oily street, if you look at an oily street texture that looks like this, you say, oh, there's two plus one, there's two, there are two plus one. There are two plus one half defects here and here. Right? Well, there's also two minus one half defects here and here. It has no net charge. Far away, right, far away in one streak has nothing. There's nothing there. And how do you get it? It has to have no disclination charge, and there's obviously no dislocation charge, and there's also no disclination charge. And so no layers need to be destroyed if you combine negative? No, no, it depends. So that's an excellent question. Lisa says, when you combine the negative ones, you have to destroy layers. And here, here's the thing that semicolves have that's funny. If this is the same layer, I can combine it. Right? Agreed? So this chart. Agreed? So this charge, this is charge, this is charge minus a half, and this is charge minus a half. And now I combine them, and I get a defect like this, which is charge minus one. It's perfect. Charge absolutely. Okay? Well, let me now do a counterexample today. And again, you can tell me if this never happens. And it's probably true that it's energy. And it's probably true that it's energetically unhappy. But this is a minus one-half, also. It's crazy when it's a half. But you agree it's a minus a half? And here's another minus a half. See them? All right, so this is minus a half, and this is minus a half. If I combine them without thinking, right, what happens? You get something which has six legs coming out. Lens coming out. So this has charge minus 2. Okay? But this only had charge minus 1. But that's not true. There was a yellow layer in here. The only way that I could bring these two things together is to cut the yellow layer. Leaving behind two plus a half defects. So two plus a halves. So now it's, so everything's fine. Right? But you have to be able to have the defects. But you have to be able to have the defects sit on the different layers. Right? On the minimum and the maximum. If you don't do that, all the charge counting is wrong. Okay? So how do you start characterizing things? In two dimensions, I just characterize them for you. This is how you do it. You look at these things and you remember that they're yellow surfaces as well. It's not one set of surfaces. There's a second set of surfaces which can also have disclinations on them. Which can also have disclinations on them. In order to combine defects, you have to cut those surfaces. Or here it's a line. It's interesting, it's amusing if you're a mathematician type. It's amusing that if you start, you could have started with smectics that only had oriented defects, integer charge defects. You would discover to have them combined, you still need to have half-charge defects. So in order to have a whole dynamical theory, you actually need to have charge defects. You actually need to have charge of these or it's like three dimensions it's um well it's harder, okay? In three dimensions, there are point defects and line defects. But let's just think about the point defects, which is what I was always thinking about in 2D. So how do you study a point defect in in in in 3D? In 3D. In 3D, a point defect is, for instance, a pinch. This used to be three layers. Used to look like this. And I took them and I went, I took this point. I took this point and this point, and I pinched them all together, and they all meet now at this one point. There's a surface with two columns coming out. Okay, so this is a point defect. Of course, to do this, I had to cut holes in the yellow half layers that were in between these layers. I made disclination loops. I had to cut holes. See, now I have to have line defects. In order to have point defects, add, I have to have line defects. They're force. Okay? Okay, so you bring them together and you start calculating the charge. And you can calculate the charge by a similar method. You draw a sphere around the measuring sphere. And you look at the measuring sphere. Here it is. And it has intersections with this one surface. And it'll have three intersections. Like that. Right? Three intersections. So you get three circles. And what you do is you say, oh, well, here's a region. There are three regions. I draw the regions like so. I draw a region. There's a dot. This tells me that I have one region. I have another dot. I have another dot, like so. Let's see. One, two, three, four dots. Like so. Like so. The dots are the regions on the components of the sphere, the RFB only. And then I connect them together with their boundaries. And if you work at it, you can figure out that you can use the Gauss Bone-Hay theorem or whatever theorem you like to calculate the total winding of the director this way. The director this way. And the most important thing is that the director field on the inside of the cone points in, and out here it points out. Sorry, it also points in. So that means you can tell me how the director field rotates around the layers. Right? Comes down like this, and so forth. Out of here. And from that, you can calculate the total. And from that, you can calculate the total two-dimensional length on the sphere. And it turns out every time you cross a boundary, you go from having positive charge to a positive contribution to a negative contribution. And so, believe it or not, all you do is you alternate the charges and you add the charges up. And this has charge zero. A single cone without that extra layer. So, this is taking two layers and bringing them together. That. That would be described by this. Plus, minus, plus. So I would have charge one. Or minus, plus, minus, because you know it's an o-matic. I don't know what informal. Okay? And you can, we wrote some paper in communications and mathematical physics. I don't know, seven year. I wrote this. 2019. See, I've gone to enough math conferences. Math and mathicians always this is how they do citations, right? This is how they do citations, right? Just write something down. Okay? You can talk about how you combine defects. But it's very similar, Lisa, to the question you asked. Because you can combine defects that actually share a surface. I could have had one like this, where there's a defect, like two defects. And I can bring them together because they share a surface. But I can also try to combine defects that don't. But I can also try to combine defects that don't share surfaces. And if I do that, like so, there's a yellow surface somewhere in there. There's some big yellow plane that has to be cut in order for me to join them. When I cut it, I have to poke a hole in it, which gives me a disclination loop, which has a point charge also. Disclination loops have point charges, in addition to having a mine charge. So, are there any questions? Yes? I'll just point out, there was a comment made online just before you started the 3D drawing. You can imagine two positive defects combining if you just reverse time. I don't understand the quiet, not a question. You can imagine two positive defects combining if you just reverse time. Just for first time. How would you even start with like a plus two defect? Yeah, you can't start. There aren't plus two defects to begin with. Anigel, do you want to... There are no plus two defects to begin with. That's for 2D. And someone said they couldn't imagine that the defects moving together. It's true, there were no plus two. But you could get them quite close, and then you imagine. Quite close, and then you imagine them just separating apart. Ah, but that's the whole point. But that's the problem, Nigel. The problem is you can get them arbitrarily close, but that minimum is always in between them. Right? And you can't get rid of that minimum without doing something discontinuous. But, like your two minus that half there, if you're stood next to you, you can imagine that process. Yeah, exactly. You can imagine that process. That will happen. You can imagine that process. That will happen. You can imagine that process how we come together just by thinking about that as the first time. Sure. But you still have to have these minimum layers do something. Yeah. Now, in 3D, you're going to ask me, what about Ponaro's theorem? Can you have a plus 2 defect in 3D? And if you were paying attention here, you'd say, sure, because, you know, when you have cones and stuff intersecting a sphere, Intersecting a sphere, they don't have to always be in a line. So, this is a possible structure. This would just mean that there's another region in here somewhere. Just another region in here somewhere, corresponding to this point. Okay, so that's minus 2. And I can also get plus 2. So, let me end by telling you how you do Ponara's theorem again. I'm going to do Ponara's theorem one last time. I'm going to do Ponaro's theorem one last time in a way that I can generalize it to 3D. So Ponara's theorem. Has anybody looked up the accent? I couldn't find one. Okay, I did actually look it up, and I found it's a Guinness. Okay. Alright, he's a nice guy. Alright, so I want to get the X on him. So. Let me draw the defects in 2D. So, this is first two dimensions. So, you have a defect that looks like that. And you have a defect that looks like this. Let me forget for the moment the half charges. Now, you're going to say to me, wait, you just drew that defect. I know you think that, right? But I didn't draw the defect. This defect is a defect where all the Is a defect where all the arrows are pointing out. See, these are all orientable. Right? So these are all orientable. So this is the out defect. And this is the in defect. Okay? And this is the defect where it's two out and two in. Okay? This is the perfect place to talk about this. We couldn't do this. About this. We couldn't do this in Illinois or the Netherlands, right? But here we can do it. You see, this is the top of a mountain on a topographical map. See it? And the yellow is telling you which way is down. And this is the bottom of a lake on a topographical map. And this is the saddle point. But here's the weird thing: there's a theorem. Between any two things that look like this, Any two things that look like this, there's something that looks like this. You can't bring two mountains together. If you put a mountain on top of a mountain, it's just taller. If you try to bring a mountain together with a lake, you have to put in a saddle to get them to come together. And so, you see, let me calculate the charge. The charge of this is plus one. The charge of this is also plus one. If it were an hematic, you know there's no difference between pointy and. It, you know, there's no difference between pointing in and pointing out. You can't go from here to here in a smect there, but that's different. And this is charge minus one. That's the charge. But let me calculate a different number for you. Let me calculate the Morse index. The Morse index is the number of down directions. Okay? This defect has two down directions, and this one has one down direction, this has zero down directions. And Moist theory. Right? And Moore's theory, what is this? What's it called direction? This point here, all the directions, there's a two-dimensional manifold of down. You can go down the x direction or the y direction. Yeah, here, you can only go, you can't go down in any direction. Here, you can, right? You take the surface, the mountain range, you find the critical points. Find the critical points. At the critical points, you write down the Hessian, you diagonalize it, and you count how many positive or negative eigenvalues it is. And if it has a zero eigenvalue, that's a degenerate critical point, and you tilt the mountain just a little bit and fix it. It's Morse's level. You can always fix that point. Okay. Now, what's interesting about the Morse index of something? So, a So imagine that I have a curve like this. This is in one dimension. So I have a maximum and a minimum. I can eliminate a maximum and a minimum. This, this, what's its Morse index? The Morse index of this is one. And the Morse index of this is zero. And I can just pull the thing tight like this. I can destroy the two. Things with adjacent Morse indices can always be annihilated with each other. With each other. And if I took this, and instead of drawing a one-dimensional curve, I decorated it so I made it into a mountain ridge, like so. So here's a little peak, here's a saddle. Nothing changes. The direction that's coming out of the board and into the board doesn't change anything. And I can still annihilate the two by the same argument. So things with consecutive Morse indices can annihilate. Oh, it works perfectly. Oh, it works perfectly. 2 can annihilate. 1, plus 1, and minus 1 cancel. Right? Minus 1, plus 1, these annihilate. So why can't you have any positive defect you like in Ponar's theorem? Because you can't add these. These are already as big as you got. You can't put a mountain on top of a mountain. But you can put as many saddles together as you like. Right? You can have a situation, it's not common, and by tilting. It's not common. And by tilting, you could fix it. But you can have a situation where you have one mountain pass that goes into seven valleys. Right? It's not common. I know there's one near Aspen called Electric Pass that goes into three valleys. It's almost. But it's not generic, but it can happen. And Morse theory people hate that because it's degenerate, and you tilt it and you break it up in the Moroccan. But that's not my problem. You can add as many of the negative. You can add as many of the negative ones together as you like, but you can't add the positive ones together. That's why that's another way of proving Panarda's theory. But now that we've proven it in 2D, we can do it in 3D. So in 3D, it's harder to draw the pictures. So this is a bunch of concentric spheres in a smectic. And these concentric spheres, all the normals are pointing out. The normals are pointing out. So this has, we already know the charge. The charge is plus one, right? You know, it's a hedgehog, right? It's an outward-pointing hedgehog. And the Morse index is three. This is a mountaintop in four dimensions, right? This is a mountaintop, four-dimensional, you have three-dimensional plane, and you have a Plane, and you have a height function above it, and at the top of it, every direction is down. And I also know that there's another one where all the things point in. This is the bottom of a lake in three dimensions, or in four dimensions, right? And the charge of this Is minus one. This is an inward-pointing hedgehog, right? From pneumatics. I'm just looking at the matic charge, right? And the Morse index is zero. Okay. Well, what's in between? Minus one? Yeah. Plus one. Plus one. What? The charge. Minus one. They're pointing in. But they really need to see this one, this one, this one. See, this one covers the unit sphere. If I look at this surface, this normal covers the unit sphere in the same orientation as the unit sphere. This one, when they're all pointing in, covers the unit sphere in the opposite orientation. Sorry. Because in 2D, oh don't be sorry. In 2D, in 2D, I can take this long. I can take this molecule, I can take every molecule and rotate them by pi around this axis. And that's topological, that's just a smooth, that's a homotopy, so it doesn't change the charge. Right? It's the same reason that in 2D, this is also plus 1.8. It goes around like this. But in 3D, it's not like that. All point out and all point in can't be homotoped to each other. Right? And if you remember, the charge. And if you remember, the charge is 1 on 4π, the integral over the surface of n dot dxn cross dyn. In order to calculate the charge, you actually have to give me a vector field, which is okay because the sphere is simply connected because of the table. But what's in between? Anybody? We've already mentioned them today. Cones. Huh? Cones? Cones. But we know these cones. But we know these cones. What's in between? What's in between is a structure like this where you have layers going around. It's a focal conic domain, right? Focal conic domains actually have topological charts. Domains actually have topological charge. Because you see, if I look at the director field, I look at the director field, here it's pointing out and here it's pointing in. So, in 3D, there's two indirections and two, there's sorry, one indirection along the z-axis and two out directions. That's because I oriented it that way. There's also the one partner. Partner where there's one out and two ins. Right? So there's one out and two ins, or two ins, and one in and two outs, or one out and two ins. They're both the center of a focal conic domain. Well, let's just fill in the, let's fill it all in. In here, we have our focal conic domain, like so, or it rotates around like so. We have one with a Morse index of two, two out, one in, and then we have one with a Morse index of one. I just drew for you. But the Morse index three and the Morse index two must be able to cancel each other. Must be able to cancel each other. That's the whole Morse thing. So it must mean that this thing has charge minus one. I have no options. I can remove this from the layers, and that means I can remove the charge. And then two and one must be able to combine. So this charge is plus one. I must be able to annihilate these. So, what do you discover in 3D, you also have these charges. You also have these charges, but you have saddles that have both charges. And you can add the saddles together willy-nilly as you like. Uh-oh. Is that the end? Probably. I think you get 10 minutes though. Okay. He says, what's next? Lunch. Yeah. Okay. So let me just finish. So in 3D, what you discover is there's two kinds of saddles, and you can add them together willy-nilly. You can add them together willy-nilly. You add them together the way Lisa asked. You add them together along surfaces that they share. Spears never share surfaces with anybody. Right? But the saddles do. The saddles have layers coming up that you can join with other layers. And when I showed you that way of representing the charges by looking at these diagrams that look like this, it turns out this is kind of fun. This is kind of fun. You can draw any tree diagram, and these are different regions on the sphere where the cones intersect. It turns out that you can have two things with the same charge, but have different homotopy classes. Sorry, no. They have the same pneumatic homotopy class, but they're actually different structures and they're not equivalent. So when you glue together the saddles, you can glue them together in different orders, in different ways. Different orders in different ways. You can get different structures that have the same total charge, right? Plus, minus, plus, minus, plus, minus, let's see. Three pluses, three, oh, no, no, no, no plus, minus, plus, four pluses, no, minus, sorry, three minuses, three pluses. This has charge zero. But this is not the same as nothing. Right? The layers are put together in some way that I can. Together in some way that I can't undo without making a bunch of moves, right? Which would require me cutting holes in the yellow surfaces. And so this is where we are. I don't know what that is. I don't know what you call it. It's some algebra of how these things combine. But it's not simple group theory because there's some extra structure. So in 2D, the defects are limited. In 3D, you can get any charge you like, but then the same charge can have. But then the same charts can have different, different, inequivalent topological structures. And so I guess it's a good place to end. The thing about everything I said is that everything we do has to respect dollars. And so when we look at simulations, we must be able to see places where we have these horrible bifurcations or jumps where a defect goes from a minimum layer to a maximum layer. Or if it never happens, Or, if it never happens, then our smectic is going to be quite sterile. Not very many things are going to happen. So, when we're studying, it's not even dynamics. As we're equilibrating, right, if we try to do, you know, some relaxation method to solve a differential equation, we go through these paths, right? Some fake time, but time is time, right? That's a time that exists. You can say that's the transformation. And everything has to respect all the topologies. Has to respect all the topology as I do it. So this is why I couldn't write the chapter because there were too many things that I didn't understand just about how the defects added. And, you know, so we've made very slow progress and we understand some things. And on Thursday, I'll tell you something new that this kind of framework is surprised, but something new. Surprise, but something new that this framework reveals, which may be long, but all right, thank you. Ask if there are any questions for a moment here, minutes before we interrupt. Want to just put a continuum formula out there? When you say you're on the sphere, but when you say DXY. Those are just the coordinates. D theta, d5, or whatever. Right? And so that's the problem. And in 3D, if you just had point defects and you didn't have line defects also, there'd be no problem. You could globally orient the director field. Right? Because the spheres are simply connected. There's never a problem. But if you now have a sample. But if you now have a sample, if your sample has line defects in it, then you can have places where you close loops where n changes sign as you go around. So you can't make a global assignment. And so that's why it's not abelian. If you just tell me I have two defects with the lines all pointing out, this one and this one, which look identical, they look identical if it's a pneumatic. You can't tell the difference. But they're not really identical. But they're not really identical. One of them, you know, you have to tell me how they glue together somewhere else. And when you try to glue them together somewhere else, this one could be the opposite of this one or be the same. And that's part of the problem. When you look at point defects in 3D dynamics, you can't tell the charge just by looking at them. Even if you could see, even if you could get down to the molecules, you can't tell the charge. You need to actually do an experiment where you bring them together. Together to decide if they're opposite charge or the same charge. It was the same with Lisa's movie, right? You had these two defects that looked identical. They had four brushes coming out, and then they annihilated. So apparently one was winding like this way, and the other one was winding the opposite way, and they canceled. But you don't know that until you bring them together. If I just showed you a picture of one, you couldn't tell. Or if I showed you a picture of both of them, you couldn't tell me this one and this one are opposite terms. They look the same. So, what impact does this all have for gradient flow type numerics? We're trying to solve for the equilibrium, it sounds like, right? Because you need to be pretending to be extremely careful in the selection of the mission conditions. Yeah, but at the same time, it should model the numerics right. Model in the numerics is still running. It should kind of be automatic, right? If you're doing an OC frame and you have defects observed, right? You know, up to the sum of the charge. But I mean, the whole point of the election is that something's really a lot harder to interpret it. Well, that's true, but... Because if you pick some initial condition, then this will sort of strictly constrain the kinds of equilibria you can get to with some sort of brain flow if you're doing this institution. If you're doing this in stream, and there will be these singular transformations where disclosation charge jumps from minima to maximum. In a pneumatic, the maximum and minima can be the same place. It doesn't mean anything to have maximum and minima. So the defects can actually touch. But now in a smectic, they can't, unless you melt the smectic. But that means that you always have to have the possibility of melting the smectic. Whatever energy, whatever model you have, has to. Energy, whatever model you have, has to have the possibility of having a region where it melts but retains the pneumatic order. You have to be able to include that. Or you'll get a sterosmectic, but it'd be cool even to see a sterosmectic, right? It would be cool to do a simulation and show that, in fact, you don't get the disclinic. Certain disclinations don't add. They never come together. They never coalesce, even though they'd like to. Because you haven't taken into account the you haven't taken into account these discontinuous jumps or these discontinuous processes. It makes me pessimistic about gradient flow on its dysmetics. So you would need to be able to do isotropic to symptomic basic transition to do this melting, right? But but that's pneumatic to symechic. It's not as hard. You have to keep the director. It's not as hard. You have to keep the director. Yeah. But will that ever be academically favorable? I mean, maybe that's what you need to do topologically. Yeah, well, that's back to his question. Maybe it's never happened. But for instance, you could ask, look, you could take a plus half and a minus half, right? And you can have a plus half. Here, I'll give you a perfect example. Plus one half, minus one half. Here are the layers. That is so-called punks mas, the pinch. Okay? No problem, Lisa. You can combine these because these two defects are in the same way. Right? Now, let me draw it another way. Now, let me draw it another way. Here's the plus a half, here's the minus a half. But I'm going to draw the minus a half on the minimum layers instead. So let's see. Let's see if we can do this. This goes like this. That's at this location. Right? And here's the minus a half, and here's the plus one half, and they sit on A half, and here's the plus one half, and they sit on different layers, or they sit on minimum and maximum. And you can't bring them together without doing something singular. Which is good, because we think of dislocation as being topologically stable. So we think of dislocations as being something that is stable. This pair of disinclinations
