For example, regulatory sequences enhanced the elements, and then eventually they lead to the polymerization, the RV polymerase activation and startup transcription. So transcription factors can also relay information about the extracellular environment to then better regulate gene expression, which I will talk about a little bit more. How do these factors interact with the DNA organized in Interact with the DNA organized in the chromatin? That's sort of one of the questions. So a lot of studies in the past have looked at gene expression using a number of sort of population level genomic analysis. And some of these techniques looking at accessibility with ADAC-seq, the RNA sequencing, ChIP-seq, et cetera, sort of large-scale, sort of static, they give us a snapshot of what's going on at the population level. But this doesn't really give us a very good idea about the interactions between transcription factors and chromatin. A number of years ago, it is shown that the interactions of the transcription factors with the genomic primitive is dynamic. And if you do FRAP, you can see that it takes within seconds or tens of seconds there's recovery. And this work, among many others, was also done. This was also done by my collaborator Gordon Hager's lab, with whom we've been working on this. So, in order to look at the nucleus in more detail, there's been a number of recent studies, and one can again look at it at different scales. So, here is an example that shows tracking of a single locus. So, for example, a telomere. And this gives us sort of localized specific information of what. Localize specific information of what's happening at that peak spot. One can also look at just track the histones in the chromatin and look at sort of single molecule imaging and get mean square displacements to get a better idea of what's happening at these length scales. And these experiments were done at very short, sort of fast time scales. And then there's also been some amount of work looking at sort of the Looking at sort of the global dynamics, bulk dynamics of histones. And what you see over here, optical flow analysis that shows sort of these long coherent motions. This is actually an example movie that shows, gives you an example of what the dynamics of the chromatin inside the nucleus looks like. So we started sort of surrenderously collaboration with Dr. Hayes. Collaboration with Dr. Hager's lab at a meeting at an NCI UND symposium, and this was a partnership that initiates collaborations with scientists at the NCI and physics and math departments at UND. So, this turned out to be a really interesting and fruitful collaboration led by two former graduate students, David and Kostab. And the questions we wanted to find out are: what are the signatures of Are what are the signatures of chromatin over transcriptionally relevant time scales, seconds, tens of seconds? And how do these factors interact with chromatin? How is it related to gene expression? And then finally, we want to answer how properties of the extracellular environment affect THINK dynamics and gene expression. So, for that, we are using a model system of steroid hormone receptors that Gordon's lab. Hormone receptors that Gordon's lab has been working on, and the technique we use is single-molecule tracking of these dynamics. So, the protein of interest has a halo tag, and then it's labeled with a halo tab labeled. In our case, we use the JF dyes, Chenelia floor. There are a number of different wavelengths. So, you can control the amount of this dye and get sort of highly fluorescent nuclei or label. Fluorescent nuclei or label at the single molecule level. And so basically, you introduce the tap protein, incubate with the fluorophore, wash away, and then you do, we use this technique called highly inclined and laminated optical sheet microscopy, which is basically a slight variation of turf, where you have a slightly lower angle for the turf, and so you're able to look through the nucleus and observe the dynamics of single molecules. The dynamics of single molecules within the nucleus. And then we can track these dynamics and get some quantitative information. So here I'm going to show you first imaging and tracking of histone H2B, which is a core histone, it forms part of the nucleosome, it's incorporated into the chromatin. And we were interested in establishing imaging conditions looking Imaging conditions looking at somewhat slower time scale movements, what we think would be associated with transcriptional time scales. So, this is what a movie might look like, and then the single particle tracking of histones within the nucleus, and this is what a set of tracks that you get might look like. As you can see, there's this sort of large distribution of track lengths as well as track diffusion. As well as track diffusion coefficients, mobilities, and so we get sort of this plethora of diffusing moving molecules at various different speeds. Pita, can you do slices or is this one plane? So it's one plane and it is an inclined plane. So it's take picking up molecules wherever that light sheet is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yes. Is this is is the motion diffusive or is it I mean you said speed is it is a I'll I'll I'll get to that more. Yeah yeah. But let's call it just diffusion and different different mobilities basically. Yeah, but I'll get to that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Only these companies to be labeled or is your terms? Only some of them. So it's a very yeah because and that's because of this technique where we put a very high Of this technique where we put a very low quantity of the fluorophore, a very low fraction, like a picomolar, and then wash it out. So, what you have labeled are very small. Yeah, but you can titrate that now. So, what do we do with all of these molecular trajectories that are potentially moving at different mobilities, diffusibilities? So, we used a technique called. Used a technique called perturbation expectation maximization that was developed by Simon Mokri at Yale. And we've used this in the past to classify moving B cell receptors into different diffusive states in the past. So we use sort of the same technique over here. And the underlying idea is that even if you see particles with large sort of broad distribution of diffusivities, there There are sub-populations that exhibit more specific diffusivities. And the idea is that biochemical interactions or other interactions within the local microenvironment might lead to different diffusive behaviors. So it's basically an algorithm that fits Gaussians to the step, the jump distributions of these particles and uses a maximum likelihood. A maximum likelihood type of analysis to obtain diffusive states with specific sort of diffusion coefficients. So we don't have to specify a priori the number of states or what we're expecting and this allows us to get a better understanding of what these different molecular mobilities might be like. So, yeah. So you are assuming that they are. We're assuming that they're diffusion, but it does allow for anomalous behavior. But what I'll tell you later is in order to do this, we actually chop our tracks into subtracts. So we are looking at small, very small. So in our case, seven frames, subtracts. And what it does is creates a set of posterior probabilities for Of probabilities for a certain track to belong to a certain state. And then we are saying, whichever, so we'll assign the track to a state depending on what the maximum posterior probability is. So it's sort of a sub-track level analysis. You can't really determine if it's like subadhesive or super adhesive or anything like that. So in in in this case not, be uh i um uh because we're really looking at short tracks. We're really looking at short tracks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So kind of the local properties. Couldn't you start with a more realistic assumption? Because it's a polymer, like DNA and the histos are sitting on the polymer, so you don't expect at all. It wouldn't make any sense. Right, but we're looking at very short tracks. So we won't be able to really ascertain the and but I'll tell you later when we look at the track level, we are able to. When we look at the track level, we are able to get to the subject users. Is there a hope that you go back on the notion at least onto the notion of the polymer? What was your question? Is there a hope that you could go back to the notion of the polymer? I think it's kind of related to discussion. Yeah, that would be really, really good to be able to go from the small scale. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, we are looking at the motion of the polymer, but then if we look at a sort of a different length scale and time scale, how do we then relate these motions to those? That's something that we're not. Yes? Does this analysis somehow account for experimental uncertainty? So you would imagine that. Yeah, it announced, yeah, motion blur, localization, precision, etc. Well, yeah, and that's I'm just wondering, you'd imagine more like a particle that you have. From like a particle that you have that's dimmer, maybe you can't track it as well, therefore its motion looks more around. So it does account for localization precision. And then we do a lot of filters to pick up particles that are above a certain threshold of signal to noise, for example. Is there no reason to believe there's some directed transport as well? Some of your paths look like maybe they had a little kind of I don't know if there's a biological reason why that. If there's a biological reason why that we haven't quite caught that, but we've had some of those sort of questions looking at some of those. Because there are columns of these kind of algorithms that include diffusivity and velocity in the state, if you ever believe that that's the case. Yeah, I think at these time scales and length scales, probably not. Probably not. Yeah, yeah. So when we do this analysis, So when we do this analysis for the histones, we find that it exhibits two low mobility states. And there is an unbound fraction. These are transient transfections of histone, so there is sort of a more highly diffusive population. But we wanted to focus on these sort of two low mobility states. One of them, which we call state one, and you can see, and the other one is state two, you can see the differences. State 2, you can see the differences in their overall sort of exploration radii. And they're about roughly equally distributed between these two low mobility states. As we then went back, so as you remember, these are subtracts, but if you go back, take the subtract, the subtracts, and then stitch them back together into the original tracks and see where these states lie within those original tracks. So, interestingly, it seems that we It seems that within the same sort of longer track, the same longer track can switch between the two mobility states, so sort of state one and state two. So this is just an example of a single track showing that. And this shows if we wanted to represent a long track, we would say that it's going from state two to state one, stays there for three frames, and then goes back to state two again. So this was surprising to us. So, this is surprising to us and intriguing, and you know, I love discussions about how this might happen. But we just characterized it a little bit more. And this is showing some of the longest trajectories, and you can see there's sort of this pattern of red, blue, red, blue, red, blue. So, there's this sort of switching between these mobility states. And if we look at the transition probability, we find that these molecules switch between the states but prefer to remain in the state. Prefer to remain in the state, same state that they are in. We then went back and did sort of a track-level analysis. So, we obtained again from the Van Hoff correlation function a diffusivity distribution at a given sort of time scale to get information about the entire track. And so, this is the diffusivity distribution now at the entire track level. And what we see sort of is these two. And what we see is these two populations: sort of lower overall mobility tracks and slightly higher overall mobility tracks, and then there's a small fraction of sort of more diffusive tracks. So these are the whole tracks. These are the whole tracks now. And what we then went back and looked at these pull tracks, and on the left are the lower mobility tracks, and we see that they tend to stay in this sub- In this subtrack state, one, whereas the ones that are higher mobility in terms of the overall track switch back and forth more. So tracks with these, so overall lower mobility tracks show less frequent switching. And then if we go and characterize the mean square displacement, as I was mentioning from this track level analysis, we find that both of these. Find that both of these, the state one and state two, in this case, sorry, the colour coordination is not ideal, they show this sort of subdiffusive exponent of 0.3. And the higher mobility ones, which I haven't really talked about much, show a slope of 0.5. And this one, over a number of years, a lot of polymer models that show that the Rouse model shows sort of. The Rouse model shows sort of a square root dependence of time in terms of the MST. So, does this suggest some long-range interaction with Macromatin, which quite much must be there? And very quickly, I'll mention that there's several groups that are working on thinking about the chromatin as a polymer and understanding the dynamics of this. So, this is work by Dave Tirumlai's lab, with whom we've started talking recently. Started talking recently. So, they model the chromatin as a self-avoiding polymer, presenting different compartments and then cohesion-induced loops. And then they also base their interaction potentials on high C data contact frequencies. And again, for an ideal chain, you get a 0.5 exponent, but for Trump's face-filling chains, that might come about due to long-range interaction. That might come about due to long-range interactions, you get a lower exponent at 0.4. But what we find is actually even lower than that, 0.3. So that's something to consider. To clarify, I do you mean like just a fumulajorda chain or just a warm-life chain? I think it's a warm night chain. Yeah. Usually we mean a self-crossing chain, but it's taller, self-shiny self-containing. So recently they modified their model to include a forced dipose between active loci. So they separated into what they call our active loci and inactive loci and introduced forced dipose to try and model transcription initiated forces. Transcription-initiated forces. What they find is that the mean square displacement of the loci that have forces on them are lower than the loci. Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry. Have you looked at the random distributions for the short traps? Because I'm thinking like what you're seeing is switching back and forth seems a lot like caging and hopping. And you know, the caged ones stay in the cage longer and they're stuck. Cage longer and their stuff, and caging hopping phenomenon, if they're in the hopping space, they form quickly. So, like, but now usually in the Van Hook distribution, you get like exponential tails and it's not Gaussian. I don't know if you look at that. So, we definitely started looking at that, but we have to go back and look at the one separately more carefully. But I think there is something we're trying to understand the physical you know, the physical model or mechanism that might lead to this switching, and definitely I think it's related to I think it's related to, maybe it'll become a little more clear, but I think it could be related to caging or confinement and then somehow switching into more freely moving from a dead. Yeah, that should show up. Yeah, let's talk later. Yeah, we had a little bit of trouble interpreting those for the short drafts. And so these were. And so these were roughly consistent with an earlier work by Mishima et al., where they inhibited transcription and again saw similar, I think these are the simulations, these are the experiments, when they inhibited transcription, they saw an increase in chromatin mobility. So this sort of leads to the idea that chromatin is exhibiting different types of mobilities and Of mobilities and the transcription forces are somehow pinning down certain regions. So, all yeah. And so, in this model or in this kind of physical picture, the idea is that there's basically there's very little like cross-linking between the DNA strands, it's just a first approximation, really just like a model, at least. Yeah. Is there some give any sense that that's a reality? So, I definitely think that there's much more to be introduced. There's much more to be introduced in terms of cross-linking or longer-range interaction, for example, which haven't been introduced in the models. Histone follows the DNA, or can we slide along the DNA? So histone follows, we think, as far as it's known, histone follows the DNA. But there is, you know, histone itself can decide. History itself can to some extent bind and unbind, but over very long time scales. We do see some unbound sort of diffusing motion. We still don't know. Like most labs measured about 20 to 30 percent. Some of it could be due to the wave you're imaging it because it's transient transfection, so it may not be all of it involved. About one dimensional diffusion or not here. I don't know if that's known. And yeah, it's sort of one deep diffusion has been on our mind in the context of transcription files. Mind in the context of transcription factors, which I'll show you. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so now that we have looked at history, we wanted to look at transcription factors to find out what kind of mobility states do they exhibit and what are the time scales of these, and are these somehow related to transcriptional activity? So, we worked with steroid hormone receptors that Gordon Hager's lab works with, has been working with. Works with, has been working with for a very long time. These are inducible, so you can add a hormone. And in many of these cases, so the GR, ER, AR, and so GR, AR, and PR, they are cytoplasmic. And then upon adding hormone, they translocate to the nucleus and basically they're activated. ER is primarily a nuclear. So and then they form these heterodimers and heterotymes. Heterodimers and heterotetromers on binding the response elements. And again, we use the same type of imaging technique. Just wanted to tell you these are the different domains. There's an unstructured enthromus domain, there's a DBD DNA binding domain, a ligand binding domain, and the hormones that are used to activate it are dex and forth. So we then used similar techniques to study the intranuclear. Just study the intranucleodynamics and think about how these different domains of GR mediate binding and mobilities and how these interactions between the GR and chromatin will determine its dynamics. So again, the movie looks the same, very similar. So after working with the cytoskeleton all these years, unfortunately the single molecule nucleus movies are not as interesting. As interesting. They look the same all the time. But they're there. They're there and there's tracks. And again, we label with a low concentration of the JFI. What we find is the GR also shows two low mobility states. And these states are very similar to the H2B low mobility states. I didn't put the legend here, but the dotted lines are for the H2B and the For the H to B and the solid lines are for the GR. And this is sort of a, you always sort of see a higher mobility state that shows up. And GR2, we see if you look at a single track, they switch, these states switch within a track. And you can again see here the description sort of of the switching of state one and state two in these longer tracks. So then we wanted to get a better idea of what these states might mean and can we do some pervasive. States might mean, and can we do some perturbation that changes the propensity to go to these states? So, if we look at untreated GR, there's a small fraction in the nucleus that we can still track. We see that there's a significant decrease in the lowest mobility state, state one. We still see some fraction, some reasonable amount of state two tracks. And this just shows again the tracks for the untreated, which The tracks for the untreated, which tend to be very short, that they're mostly in state two. Um, yeah, it's ten minutes into the hard stop. Oh, okay, I've been going slow. Um, okay, I'll try and go over this quickly. We see multiple uh steroid receptors, ER, AR, PR. They all show these two states, low mobility states, and then switching between these two states. And again, ligand activation results in a significant increase in the population. A significant increase in the population fraction of the lowest mobility state. So it's so we get an idea that the state one is correlated with the active form of the receptor, basically the form that gets activated upon ligand activation. And many other core regulators that we looked at, transcription factors, but other transcription factors relay. GRIP1 MEC26, Cork 2. MET26, CORCA4, CTCS, which is an architectural protein. A lot of these show the same sort of two low mobility states. So it seems to be some sort of a universal feature that we're finding within the nucleus. So to get a better idea of the biological origin of these two states and are certain regions of the TF needed, we mutated the DNA binding domain. The DNA binding domain of GR. And what you can see here is chip-seq that's showing binding of GR to DNA in the wild type case in the presence of hormone deaths. And then with this mutation, basically it leads to loss of GR binding at the genome level. And then looking at the mobilities, we see that this mutation leads to loss of the lowest mobility state. Lowest mobility state. And it doesn't bind to chromatin, which is not surprising, but it tells us that this DNA binding domain and active binding to specific DNA sequences might be the most important factor for state one. When we wash out the hormone, we also see that we lose the state one. We then looked at another nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor. Activated receptor, P par gamma2. It's also modular, it has activation domains, DNA binding domain, as well as the RXR, the retinoid acid receptor, heterodimerization domain. And it binds to chromatin as a heterodimer with the retinoid acid receptor. We again find that the wild type P par gamma shows two distinct mobility states that switch as before and with a number of analysis we And with the number of analysis, we see so overexpression of CBD alpha, which facilitates power gamma binding, increases the lowest mobility states. But then when we do mutations of either the DBD domain or the RxR domain, we see decrease in the fraction of this lowest mobility state. And then we do a double mutant, which mutates both these domains. Then we see almost a complete ablation of the lowest mobility state. Mobility state. So, this suggests that the low mobility states corresponds to chromatin binding in a number of transcription factors that we've looked at. What might lead to the second low mobility state? Interactions between TAFs, and we suspected potentially IDR-mediated interactions. So, GR has an IDR, it contrains this N-terminous intrinsic disordered region, and it also has been shown to form condensates at higher. To form condensates at higher concentration and which show liquid-like fusion. And so deleting this domain completely actually led to a loss of the state 2, suggesting that perhaps the state 2 is mediated by IDR. We are looking into this further. This was a very strong deletion of IDR. So currently in Gordon's lab, they are working on doing more specific mutations along the IDR to look, get a better understanding. To look, get a better understanding of which aspects might be responsible for the state two. So, finally, in summary, we find that both histones and transcription factors show appear to be in two sort of low mobility states. And we are thinking about these as expiration regions, where you have a smaller expiration region at about one second, which is state one, state two is larger, and they somehow. Is larger and they somehow switch back and forth between these. The state one corresponds to specific interactions, and state two appears to dominate when receptors are not activated, suggesting that these may be nonspecific interactions with the DNA before finding a specific cognate sequence, mediated by IDR, IDR, TF interactions, or also interactions with other transcriptional machinery. With other transcriptional machinery, because there's a lot of other things that are going on and sort of this transcriptional spot. But you were mentioning about the searching. So there's sort of this, you know, speculating is the state 2 somehow related to the searching of the TF along the DNA before it finds its specific sequence? And we're looking into other techniques such as min flux techniques, which is a very high temporal resolution and we High temporal resolution, and we can get long trajectories. So, what we are limited by, if we do fast imaging, then we can get short trajectories and get the diffusion. If we do this intermediate, then we can get sort of these kind of, but we can't get the longer because we are dominated by whole rechain. So in the last one minute, I will talk about an older work. Sorry, and this work that I talked about was just recently published, one or two months ago. And so it was. And so it was good to complete that work. But with these particle trajectories, in addition to mobilities, one can also look at binding times. And I'll just go over this really quickly, just to point out that we can get information about the space as well as the time. And how long a transcription factor binds to its DNA is related to transcriptional output. And the general idea is the longer it binds, it's more transcriptional. It's more transcriptional output. So, what can obtain dwell times or residence times of these single molecules using the length of tracks of looking now at the bound molecules and how long they stay at particular spot and then getting the length of all these trajectories and calculating a survival distribution. And in this paper a few years ago, we found to our surprise that these survival distributions appear to fit a power law. Theoretical power law, as opposed to a biexponential model, which had been used in the past to distinguish between specific and non-specific binding. And that was sort of the idea. But what we found is that it's power law, and again for GR as well as ER and number of FOXA1 and a number of other transcription factors and co-regulators. And the slope of this power law then will tell us about how, you know, typically how. About how, you know, typically how long it's binding, and we see different factors for different slopes. We also found that I think I'm going to skip over this in the interest of time, but I can tell you more about this if you're interested. But in general, there's a connection between the parallel distributed well times and the sort of the broadness of the binding affinity. If you have a diversity and range of binding sequences, we get a power law. In mutations, Power law in mutations where you have narrower binding sequences, the pi-exponential fit again appears. And so we think about this as potentially the nucleus having a rough energy landscape that may be either due to nuclear heterogeneity and both and also sequence heterogeneity. So it's a complex environment. So in that sense, it's not surprising. And then my final slide. So we're interested in understanding the origin of these states, how are they spatially organized in the new How are they spatially organized in the nucleus? How do these mobilities relate to binding times? And how are they related to transcriptional output? And this just shows a movie from Gordon's lab showing live imaging of transcription. And we'd like to relate all of these with advanced imaging techniques, which is challenging. And finally, we're starting to work on how do these how do physical and mechanical cues regulate the dynamics of transcription factors in chromatogenic phase? Pathways and programming. With that, I'd like to thank my group: my current graduate students, undergraduate students, former members, Kosta Ben Dabi, whose work I showed, Gordon and his lab, other collaborators and finding sources. Thanks for your attention. I'm not sure, maybe you don't say that, but if the transcription factor is binding its cognate side, there are only two places where it can be. There are only two places where it can be defined like that, right? So then that would be hard to detect. Is it not what you were saying? So if the transcription factor... Well, if it regulates one particular gene, it has two places to bind the nucleus. And the other places are not specific. Right. So do you think you can pick those out? I mean, do you actually find those places? So that's going to be challenging because right now you're right. Whatever we are looking at, it could be anywhere. Looking at it, could be anywhere, right? So potentially, one could look at actively transcribing locus and then look at the transcription factor in the vicinity of that locus. And there's been some studies in our lab and others that are getting to that. It'll be challenging though, but it may be possible. So this parallel This power law dependence on the dwellings makes me think like whether or not you have a power law distribution of dwellings in your mean square in your particles, in like the particle trajectories. Have you looked at if your motion is ergodic or not? Because if you see the signatures of non-ergodicity, then that could tell you something about the type of motion. It could be a time random block or like right, yeah, yeah. We haven't done We haven't done exactly those analysis, but it'll be good to talk about it. Well, thanks again. I'll remember to read the system. Okay. All right, so our next speaker. Okay. All right, so our next speaker is Stephanie Porte from the University of Minnesota.
