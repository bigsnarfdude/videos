So, our second speaker for this talk in the second part is Veronica Pendix, and she's going to talk about bosonicos, rational being. I'm going to start a colour, okay, Marca. Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, thank you, Gail. Uh, thank you. Gail, thank you. Big thank you to the organizers, both online and in person. This is a wonderful conference. I'm so glad it survived the pandemic and everything. And hopefully next time I'll also be in person. Currently, I have two small kids. So I almost came, but it was still just a little bit too difficult because of the jet lag. Okay, so my title today is Arpazona Ghost. Is our personic ghosts, rational beings? So, this is joint work with Katrina, Clari, Flor, and Gail. So, let's start so you don't have to wonder what are these ghosts and are they irrational? So, actually, my talk is not as interesting, maybe, as the title suggests. It's about representation theory. So, what we Theory. So, what we want to do is we want to find out how certain module categories look like for certain VOAs. So, Floor gave an amazing talk about VOAs. So I won't go any further into detail. You get an idea what this is. She also mentioned what are the rational vertex algebras and then also what are irrational vertex algebra. So let me just recap a little bit. Just recap a little bit. So, rational vertex algebras have semi-simple representation theory, so everything is nice. And irrational vertex algebras have some indecomposable models, so models which are not simple and yet not irreducible. Okay, and another important notion for us is conformal flow. So, vertex algebras have certain elements we call conformal elements, and they Elements and they can influence the structure of vertex algebras in a very deep way. I say they can because sometimes they do and sometimes they don't. And also some vertex algebras allow for these deformations. So for some vertex algebra, we have like an infinite C, so a continuous amount of Amount of conformal elements in different structures, whereas for some others, we have much less. So, an example of this rich structured vertex algebra is the Weyl vertex algebra, also known as the Bosan ghost. So, this is the Bosan ghost from my title. And for the most part of the talk, I'll concentrate on the Weil vertex algebra and see how these conformal deformations affect its representation theory. Representation theory. Okay, so here's also a picture which isn't always true for vertex algebra. So it's not always as nice, but sometimes these the rationality of a vertex algebra can help understanding fusion rules. And fusion rules can be something describing particle collisions. So if we understand vertex algebras as Understand vertex algebras as some analog to the conformal field theory. We can say that what the physicists do in particle collisions is what we do when calculating fusion rules. And then if you have a rational vertex algebra, then everything is so much more simple and you can say a lot about what would happen in these collisions. Okay, but this is just a digression to emphasize that rationality. Emphasize that rationality really is important and it's interesting. Okay, so here's a little bit of history to explain how we got to our idea of changing conformal elements and what we got with this. So first, Matsu and Nagatoma classified all possible conformal structures associated with the Heisenberg-Hergus algebra. So this is solved. And then Solved. And then Adamoch and Milas took some of these and studied triplet algebras, which is also an important example of C2COM finite but irrational vertex algebras. And then Dongley and Mason developed the theory for Q-graded vertex algebras. So they studied this type of predation. And then later, long-Mason and also Labor further expanded this theory to the seagraded working cell group. Theory to the sea-graded working cell phase. And actually, this Labor-Mason paper is the most relevant for our work. So it inspired us also to try to analyze and understand what these gradings look like for the while vertex algebra in particular. So, what we did, so Katrina, Kari, Flore, me and Gail, is with a refinement of Uh, it's really the refinement of many of these concepts that Labor and Mason did, and we also applied this through our while works algebra, and we got really interesting results. Just to emphasize, so not every algebra changes a lot with changing the conformal flow, but the vile vertex algebra actually does change a lot. And we actually explore this into detail. Okay, so here's just some notions. Some notions which will be useful, actually necessary to understand what we did. So, what is a vacuum space? So, not completely formally said, but these are the vectors in V, which are zero if they're acted on by any mode of V that lowers the real part of the weight. So these are just some vectors which cannot be so they're zero if we want. If we want to lower the weights, but I hope it does give you some intuition. But what's important is that the name can be a bit misleading. So the vacuum vector itself is not necessarily in the vacuum space. We actually have an example of this in our paper. So we can take the while vertices algebra. If we find a nice enough mu, we'll simply get that the vacuum vector will not belong to this omega v. Omega v. Okay, but it is what it is. It's called the vacuum space. It's usually called this way in literature, so we call it this way. Okay, so also two other two important definitions would be the omega-generated C-graded vertex algebra and omega-generated C real greater than zero-graded vertex algebra, which we'll just call the nice vertex algebra for the rest of the talk. So the first one is a C graded. So the first one is a seagraded vertex algebra such that we have this nice basis. So every V is a finite sum of elements which are made of vectors in V and a vector in the vacuum space. And the other one is the previous one, so omega generated C graded vertex algebra. But also we have this nice notion of degree. So the vacuum space has zero degree vectors. Degree vectors and for the others, we calculate with the following formula. So the sum. And for non-basis elements, we just extend by linearity. So these would be the nice vertex algebras that we are mostly interested in throughout the talk. Okay, so now I mentioned a lot of these different things with long names. So here's just a short recap so we can get an idea what's going on. So, we can get an idea what's going on. So, we have something that's called vertex algebras, then we have some of them which are C-graded vertex algebras, and then we have some that are omega-generated. And then in the end, some of these are also C real greater than zero graded or nice vertex operator algebras. Okay, and also we have this decomposition. So, if we have a nice vertex algebra, we have nice definitions of degrees. Definitions of degrees, we can define v lambda to be the space of everyone who is of the degree lambda, and then we have that v is v0 plus these v lambdas or omega v plus v lambdas because in omega v we have all these vectors of degree zero. Okay, so this is the introduction. And now a bit more introduction about Introduction about the vial vertex algebra. So, why are we vertex algebra so important? Well, they're actually one of the four free fields, four fundamental free field theories. So, these would be the free bosons, free fermions, beta-gamma ghost system, or bosonic ghost system, or while vertex algebra, and BC Ghost system, or fermionica system. So, the one we're interested in is the beta-gamma-ghost system. System. And what's interesting about it is that it has gradings other than Z grating. So we'll see it has C grating, so complex gradings. And it depends on the choice of conformal vector. And this choice affects the representation theory a great deal. Okay, so for instance, if we take conformal vector with c equals two, We get a Z grading, but it has infinite-dimensional weight spaces. So I chose the C equals 2 because it's very popular in the literature. You find many papers concentrating on the while vertex algebra with C equals 2. Why? Because it has a nice representation theory. Lately, we have some papers by Alan and Wood who have found interesting modular categories for this algebra. So it's very interesting. Algebra, so it's very interesting, but it has infinite dimensional weight spaces, so we can't have graded traces in some usual sense. So we focus on the general case. We look at the sig ratings, possible sig ratings, and we change the conformal element and we inspect what we have gotten this way. So, what we have as a result is that these These resulting families of conformal beta gamma systems, which we denote by μm. So, μ is the complex parameter we change to change the conformal vectors. So, these have very different resulting ratings. They have different Jew algebra, they have different representation theory. For instance, if we change conformal measures of Heisenberg vertex algebra, we don't get as interesting results. We have some minor changes, but it's not. We have some minor changes, but it's not such a great deal when it comes to representation theory. Okay, so what we did is we defined and analyzed several different types of C-grade VAs for general results for these nice VOAs. And what we get is that these types of VAs are C2 co-finite if the weights are non-integer. If also we get that the simple modules are ordinary, then in particular. Are ordinary, then in particular, we get that these VAs are rational. So this will be our main theorem. Okay, now we talked about the origins and importance of the while vertex algebra, but what it is actually. So here is a nice construction of a while vertex algebra of rank one. We take an infinite dimensional Lie algebra, it has generators k, a, It has generators K, AM, and A n. So, K is the central element, and we have commutation relations. All of them are trivial, except when you take A M and A star minus M. And then we take the universal enveloping algebra of this and quotient it by this ideal k minus one. So we kind of fix the central element to be one. And what we get is an associative algebra with generators and relations. With generators and relations. And then over this associative algebra, we construct a vertex algebra. So we take a unique, so we take a module, a simple module M for this associative algebra, and then we endow it with this further vertex operator structure by defining this operator, a vertex operator map in the following way. So we have y of these sort of Sort of most important fields A minus one and one and A star zero one elements to be the fields AZ and A star Z. So actually what we do is we define a nice vertex operator and then we endow this structure with a vertex algebra structure. So here's just a quick reminder why there are so many names for the wild vertex algebra. are so many names for the wild vertex algebra. So these fields Az and A star Z are usually denoted by beta Z and gamma Z in physics literature. So this explains why this vertex algebra is sometimes called the beta gamma vertex algebra or beta gamma system or beta gamma ghosts as you wish. Okay, so this is what a wild vertex algebra looks like. Okay and then Okay, and then the this very important and interesting uh property of the while vertex algebra is that it admits a whole family of first or vectors. So we actually have an explicit formula for omega mu, so depending on this one parameter, mu, a complex parameter. And these omega mu' generate central charges C mu. So and the corresponding Versora field is this L mu Z. Is this L Z? Okay, in short, we now have a C grating on M. So we denote it by mu m y 1 omega if we want to describe the whole vertex structure. But in short, we'll just denote it by mu m. Okay, so this will be this family of Weyl vertex algebra, so parameterized by this mu, which means we're changing the conformal elements of these. The conformal elements of these real vertex algebra. Okay. So we have this nice C grading. Mu M is actually this sum of these mu m lambdas, where lambda is the sort of degree of V. And there are also such mu m modules. Also, we have w is the sum of w lambda. Lambda and L mu x on w as multiplication with the lambda. So these are the seed gradings on both the vial vertex algebra and on its modules. So now what is important for us is the following definition. So we'll say that a nice positive energy grading will be the C grading of mu M and its modules if it has these three important properties. If it has these three important properties, so it should be truncated from below. Um, the imaginary part of lambda should be absolute value more than the real part for finitely many lambdas, and the dimension of W lambdas should be finite. Okay, so if we have these certain conditions, we get something that looks nice. We'll see in my next slides, actually, what I mean. My next slides, actually, what I mean by this. So, here is our main result. We take the vial vertex algebra M and we try to understand how these changes in conformal weight, in conformal vectors, change the structure of new M. And what we get is this nice picture with certain different areas which behave in a very different way. Different way. So if we take μ to be in the orange-shaped diamond-shaped region, then our resulting wild vertex algebra will have a nice positive energy grading. So it will be rational and moreover, it will only have one simple admissible module, and this will be actually M itself. So we don't get any pseudo-traces. Pseudotraces for this one. So this is the case where mu is in this orange-shaped region, orange diamond-shaped region. Then we have these blue regions. The blue regions left from the zero and right from the one. What happens in these regions is that we lose truncation. So we now have that these new m lambdas are non-trivial. mu and lambdas are non-trivial for an infinite arbitrary lambda real part greater than zero and less than zero. So it makes things much more complicated. So in the blue areas we lose truncation. What happens in the white region is that we have that the imaginary part of lambda is an absolute value more than real part of lambda. So again, it's a complication for an infinite number of Application for an infinite number of lambdas. Okay, and then we have these distinguished points where μ is actually exactly zero or exactly one, and which are actually very popular in the literature. So there's many papers on while Red Excel goes with exactly these conformal vectors. So these will be like conformal weights, I think minus two and two. Two and two and minus one. So, what we have here is it's almost perfect, but what we have is that we lose the part where the dimensions are finite. So it's kind of nicely graded and everything almost works, but the dimensions are not finite. However, since we have this nice grading and This is nice and grading, and it's irrational. We could have meaningful graded pseudo-traces, but we would have to alter these grading operators. So it has a nice potential for the research. Okay, and then we also have these two lines. So the lines corresponding to the real part of lambda equals to zero or one, where the imaginary part is not zero, so not the points, zero and one. zero, so not the points zero and one. Here we again have that the imaginary part of lambda is more than real part of lambda for an infinite number of lambdas. So again, it's more complicated. Okay, so this is our main theorem in pictures. And here is our main theorem in words. So the two main theorems. The first one is we just take a general nice VOA V, which is finitely generated by these dashes. Generated by these dashes V1 through Vk. And also we have these nice conditions. So these degrees of Vj are non-integer and V0 can decompose in this nice way and every simple module is ordinary. Then what we get is that this vertex algebra is rational and it actually has only one simple nice V module. Okay, so this is in general for a In general, for a nice VOA, and then we also have the theorem for the while vertex algebra. So as we have seen in the picture, if mu is a complex number such that the mu is in the orange diamond shaped region, so the real part is between zero and one-half, and the imaginary part is at most equal to the real part, etc. Etc. So basically, mu is in the orange region. Then this corresponding vial vertex algebra is a rational nice VOA, and it actually has only one nice module. And in fact, this nice module is mu m itself. So this is a very nice result. It explains how the vile vertex algebra can have very wild. We can have very wild representation theory depending on what you choose for this mu. And as for the proof, well, I didn't write much, but what we have definitely used a lot is the JU theory and the JU algebra A V, which we had to appropriately define in the setting, and a filtration of A V and its relation to this Poisson algebra. This Poisson algebra, and also another theorem involving the structure of certain dual algebra implications for the rationality of certain VA's. So this is just a short sketch of what we have used in the proof and what we plan to expand in the future to study more examples of VAs with interesting representation theories and interesting conformal vectors. Lectures. Okay, so this is all for my thought. Thank you very much.
