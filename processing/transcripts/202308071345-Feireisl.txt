Okay, thank you very much. Thank you very much for the introduction. First, I would like to thank the organizers for having the opportunity to speak at this workshop. And I also apologize to some organizers. At least two people in the audience already saw this talk. But I think the rest, at least, there will be something new for them. And so, okay, so this is a joint work with Elizabeth Chiodaroli. Join the work with Elisabetta Chiodaroli from Pisa, but there will be more results than just the density of the wild data. Since I somehow anticipated the length of the talk to be 40 minutes, now it's 60 minutes. So I try to tell you a little bit more. Okay, so let's go ahead. This is the system I would like to speak about. We have seen the system in the morning in Kichan Cheng talk. It's a little bit different because there is one more variable and also one more equation, the system. The system, and the equation represents some kind of effect of the heat or changes of the temperature. So, that's the Euler system, that's the true Euler system of gas dynamics. And I think in this weather, there is no need to convince you that temperature plays some role in gas dynamics, especially if it changes. So, I think we already know the meaning of the equation. The first one is the equation of continuity. I will somehow chaotically change in my notation from m, which is the momentum, to u, which is the momentum. From M, which is the momentum, to U, which is the velocity. I will try to be consistent, but sometimes it's not the same. There's a momentum equation when there is a pressure. So that's the system we have seen this morning. However, now the pressure depends not only on rho, but also on theta. Actually, the isentropic or barotropic system we have seen this morning is a special case of this one, as soon as the solutions are smooth. And I will also speak a little bit about the barotropic system. And so, since we have one more variable, we have to add one equation, which is the Have to add one equation, which is the equation which represents the energy balance, or if you want the first law of thermodynamics, where the energy is given by this formula. So there is a new quantity which is called internal energy, and there is a kinetic energy, which actually to be consistent with my notation should be written as m square overall. And so to close the system, we need some constitutive relations. So the most popular one is just to take the pressure to be the pressure of the perfect gas, which is given by the Boylmari operation. Is boil given by the Boyl-Marriott law. So it's rho times theta, theta is the temperature of the fluid, and the internal energy is just proportional to the temperature, and there is a positive constant which is called specific heated constant volume. And so I will say, so my talk will be about the multi-de-Euler. I will strictly restrict myself to the case when the dimension is at least two. And most of the results I'll speak about hold only in this case and not in the 1D case. At least in the 1D case, it is not long if they hold. And I strongly. It is not long if they hold, and I strongly doubt it. And so, I should choose some boundary conditions. I choose the periodic boundary conditions, so I'm on the two-dimensional torus. It will play some role that I am really on the torus, and I'm not on a bounded domain in general. I can do something for the bounded domain I will mention at the end of the talk. I could also do, I'm convinced I can show you all these results will hold also in the 3D case. However, there is one result I'm using which was. There is one result I'm using which was proved by the authors only in the 2D case. That's why I stick to the 2D case. However, it's pretty clear that everything can be extended to the 3D case. So the fact that the problem is multi-D plays a crucial role because the main tool which is being somehow implicitly used in the proof of theorems is the technique of the so-called convex integration, which means you basically construct solutions by imposing more and more oscillatory waves on a given day, on a given on a given object. On a given object, which is usually called a sub-solution. Okay, so this is my problem. So there is a quantity which is called entropy. We have also seen entropy in the morning stop. Here I take the physical entropy in the multi-t case. The physical entropy is just given. I mean, with my choice of the constitutive equation, this is just the physical entropy. And there is a bad entropy when I speak about. Entropy, when I speak about admissible solutions or admissibility criterion, I always mean that this inequality is satisfied in the sense of distribution. Of course, this is relevant only for the weak solutions, because if you have a strong solution of the problem, you can easily check that this equation actually follows from the third equation, from the three equations we had seen on the first slide. So, this condition will be only relevant for the weak solutions. However, it plays a crucial role in the analysis. For instance, this condition. For instance, this condition implies the so-called big strong uniqueness property, which means that if the problem has a strong solution for given data and there is a big solution which in addition satisfies the entropy inequality, then they must be the same. And so it means in particular, because I speak about wild data, that are data that give rise to infinitely many solutions, it means that actually smooth data cannot give rise to, cannot be wild. This is one of the. this is my uh this is one of my of my statements okay so this we will see later now okay so i uh this is a well-known result about local existence let me remind you if you choose the initial data that are sufficiently smooth in the sobolef sense again i am on the torus but this can be proved also on a sim on a on a bounded domain uh while you and in several other cases even if you take a domain which is bounded in Rd now the Bounded in Rd. Now the dimension doesn't play any role, and you can impose, for instance, the so-called complete slip impermeability conditions, which means that the velocity, normal component of the velocity vanishes on the boundary, then you can have such a result. So I take the initial data, which are regular, and I also assume that somehow the temperature and density are strictly positive initially, and they are regular in the Sobolev sense, where k is sufficiently big with respect to the dimension. Big with respect to the dimension. And then what you can show is that there is a T mux, which is a positive number such that we have regular solution of the Euler system. And of course, now it is well known that the local result cannot be improved in the sense that it is known that there are explicit examples of initial data. In particular, you can show that the system Guichang was talking about, the isentropic system, corresponds to the full system when you suppose that the entropy is constant. You suppose that the entropy is constant at the beginning. Since the entropy, if the solution is classical, the entropy satisfies the transport equation. If you start with constant, you will get always constant. And so the entropy will be constant as long as the solution is smooth. And so the isentropic system from this point of view is a special case of the full system. However, as soon as I switch to the weak solution, it's no longer the case because the admissibility conditions will be different actually. For the isentropic case, you are somehow artificially assuming that the entropy is constant. Assuming that the entropy is constant, but actually, the right condition is that the entropy is being produced, at least in gas dynamics. So, we know that there is a local solution, that's quite well known. And so finally, the last previous slide is that I remind you that there is also a weak solution, of course, because the strong solution exists only locally. I mean, there is, we have seen also examples of blow-up for isentropics, so the same can be produced for the full system. And so the weak solutions are defined in the standard way. Are defined in the standard way, and there is also entropy inequality here, which is this is a correct sign because it's satisfies in the sense of distributions. And in particular, this formulation also includes the condition that the if you only assume that the entropy is increasing, it could be that actually for the it's increasing in the sense of distribution. So it's a non-decreasing function in the sense of distribution, which does not exclude the possibility that actually there are some jumps. The possibility that actually there are some jumps singular in at the certain times, in particular, the initial entropy could jump down. But this formulation already includes the fact that the initial entropy cannot jump down. It must jump up if it jumps. So this is really a physical condition. So each time when I speak about admissible weak solutions, I speak about solutions satisfying this system of equations. And for a long time, there was some kind of common belief that, well, these solutions can be kind of the problem. Can be kind of the problem, can be kind of well posed in this class. Okay, so that's the beginning. Now, let me, so I will start with the simpler case, which is the isentropic system. That's exactly that one we have seen this morning. So you can think about it, at least in the context of big solutions, as the original one, when you just assume that the entropy is constant and then you end up with the pressure in this form, which is A rho to the power gamma. However, I can consider, I mean, the result. I can consider. I mean, the results I will speak about are true for any choice of the pressure P of rho. I mean, I basically don't need too many assumptions about the pressure for the results I will show you. And I assume that there is impermeable boundary, but I can also assume that there are three periodic boundary conditions. This is illegal. So let me start with this. And so we have all these problems. Of course, we have the full system. We also have done for the isentropic system. And we have seen this morning there are singularities and so on. So we have to work. And so on. So we have to work with the weak solutions. Now, there is a very simple question which is probably nice to ask to students. What is the continuing in time of the weak solutions of the OLA system? I'm talking about isentropic, but you can ask the same question for the full system, of course. So let's take the vector u, which is rho, and n, n is the momentum. Momentum is a good quantity since it is a conservative quantity. Actually, for the momentum, we get some continuity. So, the weak solutions of the Euler system, they are weak, they are continuous in the weak sense, which in particular enables you to define in a correct way the initial conditions. Continuity in the weak sense is that you take your solution u, which is a vector, you take a scale product with some test function phi, which depends only on the x variable. So the resulting object is a function of time only, and the decontinuity means that this is. And the weak continuity means that this is continuous for any test function, roughly speaking. That's the weak continuity. Well, strong continuity means that it's actually your solution is continuous with respect to the LP norm, which is it's easy to show that actually this is much strong. I mean, this is stronger than this. I mean, everything what is strong is also weakly continuous, but weak does not mean does not imply strong. And I would say all explicitly known solutions of the Euler system, in particular, Of the Euler system, in particular the shock waves and other discontinuous solutions, they are always strongly continuous. At least it's not so easy to see an example of a solution that would not be strongly continuous. Strongly continuous with respect to Lt, not with respect to L infinity. And so the question is, can we have solutions that are only weakly continuous? I think it's already like a nice exercise for students to ask them to produce a function which you give. A function which you give me a time t, and you would like to see a function which is weakly continuous but not strongly continuous. So you have to come up with something which is oscillating very fast if you approach this time. Otherwise, you will not get the weak continuity and violate strong continuity. Now you can ask a more complex problem. You take the interval zero, capital T and you fix a dense set of times inside. And you, okay, and you would like to see if there is a function that Like to see if there is a function which is weakly continuous but not strongly continuous at each of these points. And this can be a dense set. Can you construct such a function? Well, the answer is apparently yes, but it takes a little bit more effort. But here we will see that actually these functions not only they do exist, but there are also solutions of the Euler system that have this property. So this is the first result I would like to share with you. Let's go back to I realized that at some conferences people like to see pictures, so I will show you also some pictures, not only Euler, but maybe also some collaborators. So, this is the result. So, I would like to comment on that result. That's the result for the isentropic Euler or for the barotropic Euler. Actually, I will explain that it's not so easy to repeat for. Explain that it's not so easy to repeat for the full system. I will explain why. Again, we must be in the dimension d equal to 2 or 3. And I denote by R the set of bounded Riemann integrable functions. It looks a little bit mysterious why I need Riemann integrability. Actually, what I need and which is equivalent to Riemann integrability is that these functions are continuous with respect to a zero measure set. These are exactly Riemann integrable functions. Exactly, Riemann integrable functions. And I assume that my initial density, I mean, there is a typo here, actually, this rho bar should be strictly bigger than zero, but it's actually not really essential for the result. I mean, I think we could come up with the result which when the density also vanishes. And I assume that I have the initial data rho, zero, which is Riemann integrable, and also the momentum is Riemann integrable, and divergence of the momentum should be also Riemann integrable initially. And in particular, since this is a In particular, since this is a bounded function, I mean, it makes sense to speak about the normal trace and we assume that it's compatible with the boundary conditions I prescribed. And you give me a set of times which is arbitrary, preferable, countable, dense set of times in the time interval 0 t. And then my claim is that the problem, the Euler system, and I should emphasize it's a barotropic Euler system, and it's infinitely many weak solutions on the Infinitely many gig solutions on the given time interval. This is strictly energy decreasing energy profile. I should a little bit, I should explain that. So the energy that, so there are several energies. So here I take the total energy, which is a function of time, which is just the sum of the kinetic energy plus P of rho, where P of rho is the so-called pressure potential. So it is related to the pressure in this formula. It's capital P. So it's P prime of rho times rho minus P prime of rho should be. P prime of rho should be small p of rho, right? So, in particular, for the isentropic case, this p of rho is just a over gamma minus one small rho to the power gamma, right? And so that's the energy. So, I can construct solutions with a decreasing energy profile, which means that this function is decreased, is non-increasing or decreased. I can actually construct any profile, but physically, it's, I mean, from the physical. Physically, it's, I mean, from the physical point of view, it's good to have a decreasing energy. So, this is a decreasing function or non-increasing function. But is non-increasing everywhere equal to something which is non-increasing. So, there could be points where this function has jumps down typically. Okay, so this is my energy. And now I speak about admissible solutions. So, there could be at this level, you can think about three levels. You can think about three levels of admissibility. The first one, which is the weakest one, let me call it A admissibility, is that you just assume that the energy at the time t is less or equal to the energy at the time zero for almost any t. Replace this by n, which is probably more relevant, then you find out that this is a weakl of a semi-continuous function, so actually you can skip this almost any. This is almost any now. You can you may you may define admissibility plus for the isentropic system, which tells you that not only so this means a plus the property that actually the derivative of d by dt of dt in the sense of distributions is less or equal than zero. It's a non-increasing function or non-increasing function. You can define a plus plus. I mean, this alone does not imply that, right? This is an extra property, but the two, it's. Extra property, but the two, it's more. So this is A plus, A plus plus, the best administrative you can imagine is that you postulate the energy. So this is A plus, or if you want A, it's enough. But there is a property that actually the energy satisfies the corresponding energy equation. So if I denote what is inside by E, so if E is one half of M squared over rho plus P of rho, then the energy satisfies the equation. So this is like E plus divergence. E plus divergence of E plus P times U is equal to zero, right? Or if you want energy inequality, so it's like that. So this is the strongest condition you can think about in the context of barotropic Euler system. And so now the claim on the slide was like The Riemann class and given set of times we can construct infinitely many solutions with a strictly decreasing energy profile. This function here satisfies this with strict inequality, right? And these solutions in particular, so they are infinitely many, so we have like imposed nest. We have like ill poseness. In addition, they are weakly continuous, of course. This is by definition, but they are not strongly continuous at any of these sides. So, this is the first result. And so, there is something fishy about this result if you think about it. Let me explain it. So, for instance, this class, of course, includes solutions. I mean, the data, I mean, I have no restriction on the data except that they are Riemann integrable and divergence of M should be Riemann integrable. Divergence of M should be Riemann integrable. In particular, I can take any smooth data, right? And this results tells you that for any smooth data, there are infinitely many solutions of Euler. I mean, big solutions, of course. And they have this funny property, and the energy profile is decreasing. So now you may ask how this is compatible with the big strong uniqueness. Because what I said before was that if I take smooth data, then at least on a short-time interval, there is a smooth solution. A smooth solution. And the smooth solution apparently is unique if the solution satisfies the property A. If the energy is actually, this is enough. If the energy is decreasing, you can show the weak strong uniqueness principle for the compressible Euler equation. And so in that case, so it looks like there is a kind of contradiction. So which means that in our case, what we constructed are solutions that actually violate this in general, but do satisfy this. So in particular, the energy. So, in particular, the energy, the energy, okay, I should continue there, but then I will not. So, the energy can experience some initial jump, right? So, you start with the energy, which is here, then the solution, the energy jumps up, and then you have a profile which is decreasing. And the physical solution. So, in particular, it violates A, which is like the weakest assumption you would like to have. And so, you would say, okay, that's not really a nice solution, but of course, you will not. Really nice solution, but of course, you will not expect to get this result for any data since, as we know, for smooth data, at least locally in the time you have a unique smooth solution if you if the energy is decreasing. But what we can do, we can a little bit modify this result in the sense that, well, you realize that there is an uh there is a special, I mean, there is an initial jump of the energy of the solution, but once you are on this curve, you can find a lot of points where the energy is already decreasing. And so you can basically construct also solutions. Of course, now the statement is not. Of course, now the statement is not for any data, but you can get a statement there exists initial data where you don't know about anything about the regularity. They are certainly not regular because if they were regular, we would have against the term uniqueness. But there is a class of initial data, and we can show the infinitely many that give rise to now solution which satisfies basically A and A plus, and they are and they are weak solutions of OLF. So and they are discontinuous, strongly discontinuous at any of these points. Discontinuous at any of these points. And so, my final remark is how this is being proved. So, I said it's proved by the method of convex integration, which was originally developed in the work by Laszlo. Well, okay, I would say it was adapted in the context of fluid mechanics, but Laso Seccheridi and Camilo Daleris. And it was basically developed for the incompressible Euler because the final goal was to prove the so-called Onsaguer's conjecture. So-called ONSAGAS conjecture. However, then as a byproduct, you can get a lot of results also for the compressive Euler system, and that's what we did. So, the point is that in the theory of complex integration, everything is based on the so-called oscillatory lemma, where you construct, you start with a basic object which is called subsolution, and then you construct little oscillation oscillatory waves that somehow are added to this. And at the end of the day, you will get a weak solution of Euler. Day, you will get a weak solution of Euler. In particular, you can construct solutions with a given energy profile. However, in the original theory, the energy profile and all the background solutions, like sub-solutions, were supposed to be smooth or at least continuous. So you could construct solutions with continuous energy profile. Contribution was that we realized that everything can be redone. The whole theory developed by Secreti and Theory developed by Sekalidi and Deleis can be redone in the context of Riemann integrable solutions instead of continuous solutions. Because, roughly speaking, there is only small set where the solutions are not continuous. And so we just, if you redo it, in particular, we realize that in particular, you can construct solutions where the energy is only Riemann integrable. In particular, it may not be continuous everywhere. And then there is again an example for students to construct. For students to construct an energy profile which is strictly decreasing and discontinuous at any of these points, two ice, right? And then you construct a solution with this energy profile, and you can prove by contradiction that at these points, the solutions cannot be strongly continuous, because if they were, the energy would be continuous as well. So, this is somehow, this is somehow the argument of the proof. And let me finish this long monologue concerning this slide by saying. Concerning this slide, by saying that for the complete system, which is actually the main object of my talk, this construction cannot be obviously repeated since the energy for the Euler system, for the complete Euler system, must satisfy the energy equality, actually, automatically. It's a part of the definition. In particular, I don't know how to construct solutions for given initial data. In particular, here we obtain existence for any initial data if you don't insist on energy inequality. On energy inequality, I mean, but for the complete Euler system, I don't know how it has to repeat this argument. So, Euler system is a little bit different, complete Euler system is a little bit different in the sense that the energy equality is already included. And so, that was, I was having some hope that maybe for the full Euler system, we can get rid of this, say, I shouldn't say pathological, wild solution, but I don't like to say wild solutions. I will show you that what is wild is not a solution, it's actually the data. Not solution, it's actually the data, right? But unfortunately, it is not the case. Okay, so let's go back to the slides.  Euler system. First, let me start with some results for the UFO Euler system. How about the ill-posedness or well-poseness for the UFO Euler system? So, actually, for a while, we were thinking that maybe it's not so easy to repeat these arguments. Actually, you cannot repeat these arguments in the sense that I have presented. However, you can still get something like ill. You can still get something like ill, local ill-posedness for the full Euler system. But it's a result which is a little bit less satisfactory, but still, it tells you that there exist initial data for which the full ELS system has infinitely many solutions, and they are admissible solutions, which means they satisfy the entropy. Actually, these solutions do satisfy the entropy equality, even not even inequality, entropy equality. And so the construction is done like piecewise. And so you take. So, you take your domain, many times, many parts, as many as you wish. So, you take a piecewise division of your domain omega, and on each of these pieces, you take a constant temperature and constant density. Currently, you can do it for a dense set of data in some LP space, for instance. So the claim is there exists a velocity field U0 which is in L infinity. Actually, there are infinitely many. So as you see, it's not like that it holds for any, which is basically impossible, but there exists infinitely many velocity fields such that the Euler system admits infinitely many global in time, each solution to full Euler with the temperature. These solution to full oil with the temperature. And in addition, they are admissible. They satisfy, even in our case, they satisfy entropy equality. And the entropy is so, in particular, you start with constant entropy, you can get constant like isentropic solution. But here, I mean, Simon Markhard was able to construct also this example for isentropic, but here, of course, they are piecewise constant, so they cannot be isentropic, I mean, unless you choose them in a clever way. unless you choose them in a in a clever way. So the result is there is a lot of data for which you still have the problem is ill pose. And the trick is that you basically work on each of these cells as a solution and you construct solution with constant density and constant temperature and constant energy. And it turns out that the method of convex integration is so flexible that you can paste these pieces together. And at the end of the day, you end up with a global solution of the full ELA. So we know that there are So we know that there are global solutions of the full Euler. Now, the question is: do we have many of them, or it's like exceptional? Can we do it only in this case? And you know, the statement is there exists U0, we don't know anything about the U0. So what would be the regularity class where we can find them? I mean, what is the best U0 you hope for to find solutions? Okay, so this is somehow related to the question of density of these bad data. Data. And so this bad data, so I like to speak about wild data, not wild solutions, but wild data. What are wild data? So this is our definition. What we mean by wild data is actually the initial state, which is again for the full system. We say it is wild. If there exists a positive time. So it's kind of a local definition in contrast with. Definition in contrast with some other people who assume some global definition. I say the data is white if there is a time t which is positive, if there exists such that the Euler system for this particular data has infinitely many solutions, which are admissible in the sense that do satisfy the entropy inequality in the differential sense on any sub-interval zero tau. This is my definition of while data. So apparently the While data. So apparently, the problem is ill-posed, at least on the short-long interval, and it's ill-posed in the class of admissible solutions that do satisfy, I mean, the strongest possible admissible condition, which means the entropy inequality is satisfied in the differential set. What is known about the existence of wild data and density of the wild data? Well, the first result is about incompressible Euler system. Compressible Euler system. There is a first result, I think, is due to Lasso, Sek LED, and MLD demand, where they show the density of the wild data in the LLP normal. And actually, they do it in the L2 norm. For the incompressible ELR system, the wild data are dense in the L2 norm. In addition, actually, the solutions they obtain in this work are global in time. So you don't have locally, like the solutions here are defined globally in time, like on any time interval 0, t, you prescribe 0, k. Interval 0 t, you prescribe 0 capital T and you get an infinitely many solutions. Later, Sara Daneri and Las Vo Sekelidi somehow generalize this result in the sense that they prove that the wild data can be actually, I would say, nice in the sense that they can be held there integrable. I mean, they are still not so nice to generate smooth solutions, but they can be held integrable for the incompressible Euler system. Now, how about the isentropic Euler system? The isentropic Euler system is the system when there is no temperature. Is the system when there is no temperature? The density is only, I mean, the pressure is only the function of the density. So, isentropic means that actually the pressure is just rho to the power gamma, exactly the system we have seen in the morning. So, there is a result by Ming, cluster, and u, right? Okay, so sorry about that. So, sorry for that. Okay. So, what they prove, however, what is important is what they prove. So, they take the isentropic Euler, so there's no temperature, and they prove actually a result which is global in time. So, you give me time zero, capital T, and on this time interval, they construct dense, I mean, the claim is there is infinite, I mean, there is a density of all data which give rise to solutions which satisfy condition A, which means that the energy at the time t is less than the energy at the time. at the time t is less than the energy at the time zero. This is the condition that still gives you that still gives you like weak strong uniqueness property. So these data cannot be strong. However, this does not exclude a very and actually if you go through the proof I would say it's not clear that you can exclude the case when the energy is really smaller than the initial energy, but may not be decreasing. May not be decreasing. And of course, that's not really like physically looking solution. So actually, I would say globally in time, the solutions probably evaluate conditions. Okay, I cannot prove it, but at least I don't see how to prove it, right? Globally in time. So with Elizabetha, we also thought about this system. So I would not say we improved this result, but we somehow extended it in a different direction. So we take the local definition. Take the probability, we take the local definition, but we construct solutions that are admissible. They are local in time, so we don't know if they are defined globally, but we prove that there is a dense set of world data in this sense where the solutions satisfy the energy inequality in this sense. So they are A admissible solutions for the compressible Euler. Proceed for the full system because there is still this sketch of playing with the energy inequality. Actually, for the barotropic Euler, it's enough to construct solutions which satisfy inequality, and you really don't have to do too much. I mean, this inequality, so apparently there is some kind of defect measure sitting on the right-hand side, but it can be whatever. So, you have certain flexibility in the choice of this defect, and this makes it possible to construct this solution. This makes it possible to construct this solution. So, for the full system, it's not so obvious. So, at the beginning, we were kind of convinced that it would not work. And so, we started studying this problem with actually Simon Markfelder and his supervisor, Christian Klingenberg. And we tried to produce a counterexample. We produced a counterexample, even the referee was saying, Oh, this is a strong indication that the result doesn't hold. But actually, as I will show you at the end of my talk. I will show you at the end of my talk, which is minus surprises that actually there is a host about the density of validity. So we define the data space, which is the space of data where, okay, so we work in the data which are now given. There is a slight change because the data are now rho, m and the total energy. However, it's completely equivalent to speak about temperature, if you wish. And I take the space L1, which are the data for. Is the which are the data for which the entropy is bounded from below by some constant, which again is not so restrictive. I just consider this class of data. And then I define, so the somehow misleading idea in this construction was that if you want to show density of the wild data, you should produce a sequence of bad data, wild data that produce infinitely many solutions that would converge to a given point. Converge to a given point to an arbitrary object in your phase space. And so the idea was to take this sequence as being solutions constructed by some method of convex integration and to show that these objects are dense. And so we defined something what we call W convergence. So we say that the data converge in the sense W to the limit if the following is true. So the density is strictly positive. The entropy is bounded below by the same constant. The entropy is bounded below by the same constant. The data converge in L1. And this initial data that approach gives rise to a sequence of admissible weak solutions, rho n, m, and en, which satisfies this funny condition, which is like this is a traceless part of the n cross n over rho tensor of the convective term, if you want. And so, like, it's like a two-derivative of this thing is go to zero in the week. Think is go to zero in the weak set. That's in the sense of distributions. This condition looks a little bit mysterious. However, if you inspect all at that time known constructions of wild solutions, this condition is always satisfied by any construction procedure, not in any, but in known construction procedures. So somehow we saw that this is somehow this product is characteristic for validate. That is characteristic for validata. So that's the last remark here. And then finally, we proved, and it was not extremely difficult to show, that actually we define a reachable set, which means the data are reachable if you can approach them by this W convergence, right? So if there exists a sequence of solutions constructed by the standard, so to speak, convex integration, Integration which would approach the limit. And we show that, well, this data that are reachable cannot be dense, actually. What we show is that their complement is open denser in LL. So in particular, if these were only wild solutions available, this would mean that there is no wild data for the wild data are not dense for the full system. And so this was somehow what we, and the result was proved only recently, but then we realized. But then we realized with Elizabeth that actually this is not the way how to think about this while data. And of course, there is also, it is also important that we are after only local in-prime results. So we realized that actually what is much better to construct wild solutions or wild data is to take smooth data. Actually, the idea, which was also proposed by Alexis Lafer and his And his team in the paper on isentropic Euler, which means the idea is to take actually smooth data, since we are after local results, right? So smooth data give rise to a local solution in time, so we are happy. Of course, it does not give rise to infinitely many smooth data in not knowing, but smooth data are dense in L2, if you wish, or in any other space. And so the idea was to take smooth data and to perturb them a little bit to create, to perturb them in some. To create to pet them in such a way that you don't patter them too much in the L2 norm in such a way that the perturbed data will give rise to infinitely many solutions. And how you do it, I mean, the simplest possible way is to perturb them by Riemann data. That somehow, I would say, explains the mysterious name of my talk, Glimpse method. Because my humble understanding on Glimpse method, now we go exactly in the opposite direction of Glimm, because I think he wanted to be positive. Because I think he wanted to be positive. He wanted to construct good solutions. We construct basically bad solutions, which means that we just somehow divide our set. We take some finitely many points. I will show you a picture that looks better. And in the neighborhood of each of these points, we replace my smooth solution by something which looks like Riemann data. So it's a piecewise constant data, which are different on the left and on the right. And the idea is now to construct, so the solution will be pasted by the Riemann solution and by the solution which starts from the smooth data. And the point is that actually the Riemann problem, as was also explained this morning, actually, if you consider it in the 2D setting, gives rise to infinitely many solutions by convex integration. So in this way, you can really construct like while data. So let me make it a little bit more precise. More precise. And now we know that it's OLS system is local. So we choose endpoints and we solve Riemann problem locally, use convex integration and price solution together. So that's basically the strategy. Let me go, let me explain it in more details. So, okay, so it's like a 1D picture. However, you can, so you can see that I can extend everything save by. Extend everything safe by, I mean, at least the Riemann data can be extended by constant in the second dimension. So, actually, the yellow part is like the arbitrary smooth solution, right? Now, I choose a finite number of points. Around this finite number of points, I modify the smooth solution by Riemann beta, right? So, it's a solution which is piecewise constant, and then I paste it to the yellow solution in some way. It's not necessarily done in the linear way as on the picture. I mean, I'm not very strong in drawing pictures. Very strong in drawing features in LaTeX, so this is why it is so it's basically that well, this Riemann data will give rise to infinitely many solutions because of convex integration result I will show you on the next slide. The smooth data will give rise to a smooth solution, and since the time is short, we can somehow pay them together and to get the and since these okay, we have finitely many points, but these neighborhoods where I modify. But these neighborhoods where I modify my smooth solution can be made very small. And since we are in 2Ds, everything should be like two-dimensional. This is just X1. Since we are in 2Ds, if the neighborhood is very small, the Lebesgue measure is very small also in the 2D sense. And so this is why this object will be actually there. Okay, so what we know apparently, and what is actually crucial for this result, is the existence of bad solutions, or if you want, wild solutions for the Riemann data. It's a big group because now people in practice work in big groups. And that's the following result. So I take the Riemann data, but in the 2D setting, right? So the Riemann data are defined for X1, X2, but they are like 1D data. So they are piecewise constant with respect to 1D. And then constantly in the second direction. I have periodic boundary conditions, so this is perfectly okay. Of course, it's not okay in this direction, then I have to make a cutoff and paste them into the smooth solution. The result is, well, actually, the result is much better than what I stated here, because they were also after the fun classification of possible Riemann data that give rise to infinitely many solutions. However, what you can do is, for me, it's enough to have one Riemann data. Enough to have one Riemann data that would have this property because, actually, in this construction, it's not really essential what I take here. And so, the statement is there exists Riemann data such that the Riemann problem is in the 2D setting, admits infinitely many solutions. They are admissible, so they do satisfy the entropy inequality. And in particular, all of them have the finite speed of propagation. So, actually, they will be localized at least on a small time interval to a small. On a small time interval to a small neighborhood of these points. This is what I need. So that's the result that was proved by this team. And using this result is basically everything what you need. So the point is that if you consider this data, of course, the problem has a natural solution, which is a solution which is constant with respect to the X2 variable, which will be like 1D solution. But convex integration also gives rise to solutions where the second component, the velocity, becomes non-constant. And these solutions are not. And these solutions are not trivial and there are infinitely many. So, having this result, which is actually crucial, then the rest is more or less easy. So, let me show you the statement. And then finally, I will show you two pictures. I will be done very soon. Smooth initial data was use in the solvolate sense as in my statement about the age system. As in my statement about the existence, and the statement is that there exists positive for any epsilon, I can find the data which are the following property. They are actually the data, my data are not very wild. I mean, if people speak about wild data, they think about some very bizarre L infinity function which oscillates. No, my data is actually nice because they are just solutions. I mean, the data are just Riemann data. Just Riemann data plus something which is smooth, right? So, so actually, they are smooth out of finitely many curves. It's in particular, they are BV, so it's not a bad data. And they are close in LQ norm for any Q you choose to my original data. And there exists T such that the Euler system now admits infinitely many solutions. In particular, they have the property that they are different on any ball of the radius epsilon, so they are. Of the radius epsilon, so they are not different only on some small set, but almost everywhere. And the solutions are also smooth out of the set of measure epsilon in T2. So your Q is actually for a wider data, not for a good solution. But this is given, and then I then the statement is there. Then I then the statement is this: this is the theory, right? So, in particular, this implies that the wild data are dense in our local definition. Let me finally, okay, repeat the construction. So, I don't know if these pictures are kind of better than what I showed you before. So, there is a background data, which is the smooth data, which is just the yellow data here. Then, there is a Riemann data, which is the red data, and then I paste them with some what I call regularized data. Some what I call regularized data, right? Which is the white part. So it's exactly what was on the picture. Now you have to realize that, okay, so we have, so the Riemann solution actually gives rise to convex integration solutions that are defined on a very small strip. And since all of them have a finite speed of percurbation, they remain constant on this strip out of the so you start with Riemann data like that, but the solution will be still constant a little bit. Will be still constant a little bit if you are far away from the middle point. And finally, you have the smooth solutions. Make a remark about the general domains. So, in general domains by general Domains by general domain, I mean a domain which is that the boundary conditions are not exactly periodic, but so you have to impose some boundary conditions. So I would say reasonable boundary conditions is u dot n on the boundary is equal to zero. You can repeat this construction with the exception that you can take many. Exception that you can take many points, but it actually turns out that in order to get density of wild data, it's enough to have just one point. So, if the domain happens to be of this shape, so if you can find a strip and repeat the same construction as before. Of course, it's not clear what happens if it's for Is not clear what happens if it's, for instance, a circle or a ball. I said everything can be done also in 3D. The only result which is not proved, but I would say can be proved, and I think the others even did, they just didn't bother to prove it in 3D case, is the result about the existence of Riemann data in 3D that gives rise to infinitely many social, but I think this is a kind of obvious and it is to say this. And it is to say this. However, if the domain doesn't have a flat boundary, then this construction doesn't work. But I somehow believe that it's only a technical restriction. I mean, I would say that it's not, this result has nothing to do with the boundary condition. It is more or less local. Okay, so I think I spoke only 47 minutes. So we have a lot of time for discussion. Thank you for your attention.
