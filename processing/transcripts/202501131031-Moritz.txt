Other half-star organizers as well for organizing this wonderful workshop. I mean, it's amazing. I put in this picture before arriving here. I kind of didn't believe it. And well, I didn't. And okay, so I'm going to talk about accidents and string theory. So this is more of a top-down kind of talk. So I'm going to try to complement JÃ¶rg's nice talk from earlier. And I will talk about some. And I will talk about some works of mine and other people, but I'm actually not going to talk about anything ongoing right now, because I'm not currently working on an Excel project, but yeah, so I'm kind of looking for a good target to arise. And of course, this is a perfect opportunity to be here and see what should we do. Okay, so I'll talk a little bit about just this. Okay. About the relation between axions and low-energy effective field theories as they arise in string theory, and specifically their geometric realizations in Clavier compactifications. Of course, an important component will be the strong CP problem, but also measuring axions when they're couplings to photons. Okay, here's so this talk is going to be a little bit of everything, maybe, not quite everything, but it's going to be a lot of different things. But I still want to give you a little bit of an upshot, or at least the aim of this talk. So I don't have to sell to you the idea that axions are very well motivated candidates for physics beyond the standard models, and especially from the bottom up, for instance, to solve the strong CP. For instance, to solve the strong CP problem, or it's what matters, candidates. So, one focus of this talk will be that I want to highlight or review how all of this pans out in concrete string theory realizations of axion physics. And highlight in particular how stringy, by which I basically mean extra-dimensional axions, are very appealing. And in some ways, I would say they're more appealing than the traditional quote-unquote. The traditional quote-unquote field theory axioms. This has also been emphasized by athletes recently. And here are two concrete points. I want to highlight the sort of automatic high quality of the patch point symmetry that you get from stringy axions. High means not perturbatively good, but and one also has to check if it's good enough to solve sol to solve the strong CPU problem. To solve the strong CB problem. So, this is what we did in this paper here. And then, also, another nice feature is that it turns out that decay constants often fall in a phenomenologically acceptable range. In particular, extant photon couplings often turn out in a range where they could be detected by future observation. So, this can easily happen, and this is something that And this is something that I would say in the models that we study is a sort of new result. Well, at least, yeah. And so, if you look at the classic papers by Svetrak Witten, there was usually assumed that we work with simple models where the k-constants turn out to be like that scale or something like that. And in the models that we studied, they can often be much more. Okay. Key point: axiom. Key point: axions, or I'm going to often just say axions, by which I mean ELPS. They are ubiquitous in at least weakly coupled string theory solutions. And it could well turn out to be true that they are important for understanding of quantum gravity itself. This is a point that I think everybody who works on Sphinx Pino somewhat appreciates and believes to be true, but we don't really understand this much. And another important point is sort of called the string axiverse, namely, there might be a very large number of axioms. And so, studying how basically the number of axioms comes into the structure of couplings and matter abundance is an important issue. Of course, this was highlighted long ago by the famous string expert page. Okay, so. Okay, so one of the most important motivations here from the theoretical side is that, well, axions are an exciting window into the physics of the deep ultraviolet, as was also emphasized by Jurick earlier, but here, ultraviolet will often mean something that goes beyond the four-dimensional vector piece theory. They seem to be, for some reason, unavoidable in weakly coupled UV complete models on string theory. Yes. The continuous continuous remote and so there was uh there are cases where um uh um like for instance when you when you consider Clavier compatibilities on rigid Clavierus where you can get um you can get um ff tilde terms that just have a discrete theta angle that's just like zero pi or something like that. So this can happen as well. But as far as I know, And but as far as I know, whenever you have some coupling that you can tune, you get sort of an accompaniment that receives potential from competitive terms. It could be monogramy as well. But yeah, so this is my understanding. I don't really know. Well, accents don't always have to be light, but they often are. Okay, so So, okay, so as you all know, the Petri-Quinn mechanism could solve the strong CP problem. If we assume that the theta angle is dynamical, then at least the potential induced by the low energy, the normalizable QCD just fixes it exactly at zero, and so the neutron EMF will vanish. There's, of course, also the experimental observational point of view, which we've heard a lot about earlier. This is, for instance, Earlier. For instance, they could be dark matter, they have this wonderful natural mechanism for being produced in the early universe, we have a misalignment mechanism. And finally, and this is of course very exciting, their search for extremely intensive. So we've already heard a lot about this stuff, so I'm not going to go into any detail. You don't have to remember all these shaded regions here. But the key point for me here is that there's a lot that's happening right now. There's a lot of improvements that are going to happen. There's a lot of improvements that are going to happen in the future. So, potentially, we could see an accident detection in our lifetimes. So, that's pretty exciting. Okay, so this, I call this part of the talk introduction, but this is really just sort of an assembly of things that I think are true and interesting from the top down. So, do that. So, first of all, I want to draw a little bit of a contrast between the classic. Contrast between the classic field theoretic axiom and the high dimensional one. So, what is a field theoretic axion, for instance, as in the PSBZ or the FSZ model? It's just the phase of some complex field. So, we have some modulus, and we have a phase that I'm going to call A over F, where F is the decay constant, and the X and A is the pseudo-number Goldstone broads and some approximate spontaneous broken catching brain u1 symmetry. Okay, so we have some symmetry based. Okay, so we have some symmetry breaking potential as usual, given by some UV scale path. And we will normally assume that there are some explicit symmetry breaking operators as well that goes like some kind of combinations of phi and phi bar. Okay, so this is as far as the symmetry breaking part is concerned. Of course, now one wants to find some kind of nice model in which the phase of this convex field naturally The phase of this convex field naturally just couples to a GG term. Yes? So I always write the explicit symmetry writing term as just linear in the real part of the field, because that's what gives you power sign. But that's not a power of phi phi bar. Why phi phi bar? Why not phi plus phi r? Why not phi plus 5 bar? Well, you can just expand it out. This is. So the coefficient. So this is just the most powerful. Oh, right, you take care of 5 plus 5 bars. Just the most five bar if you put k. Yeah, so what equals what? I should have put plus commice conjugate here, but so in general, you're going to get a bunch of, if you write it in terms of the phase, you're going to get a bunch of cosines, you can absorb whatever phase is here into the phase that appears to be the cosine. So this is just the most general unsettled thing. Okay. And so here, for instance, in the KSVZ model, the way that the axiom becomes Way that the axiom naturally couples to GG tilde is you do something like this. You assume that there is a pair of wealth variants Q and Q tilde in the three in the bar of GCD. And you assume that there is some Yukava interaction with our complex field phi. So this is, and this then turns out to induce naturally the A GG solder coupling in the IR. The way you can see that it works is that after what you That it works is that after spontaneous symmetry breaking, you put in the VED for the modulus here, so you have F, started your colour coupling, you have your phase here, and you see that Q and Q tilde are just a massive draw fermion. And before you integrate it out, so you just set it to zero, you should absorb this phase, this field dependent phase, and the redefinition of your fermions. So, for instance, you have to do some chiral rotation, and because of the ABJ anomaly, Because of the ABJ anomaly, once you do that, you introduce your coupling between Gg tilde and A over. So this is just one way how to get from a nice renormalizable model in the UV the required coupling in order to solve this function. Okay, so this is the field theoretic axion, and it comes with some features. And it comes with some features. For instance, the petri quant symmetry typically gets restored at high enough temperatures. And therefore, we talked about that a little bit earlier, cosmological models with axioms fall into two categories, namely. One, the one with the edge equation symmetry is, as Pat James broke before inflation. So H inflation is much less than F. You can basically safely integrate out of the radial mode. And the light axion A gets some random homogeneous birth during inflation. Starts rolling later because you could potentially need from there. The post-inflation symmetry breaking is a little different. You can get phi, the expectation value is essentially zero during inflation, and you get a spontaneous symmetry breaking only after inflation. So, this famously leads via the Kibble mechanism to strings and domain walls, and that's an interesting. And that's an interesting phenomenology to explore. So this is a distinction to be made for the filtered axion. And in comparison, it'll turn out that for the exfodimental axioms, this entire category will not apply to it. Okay, so general expectation that we have in the mid theory of quantum gravity, so this is one of the maybe the original Swampland conjecture, is that global symmetries are completely broken at or below the Planck city. So we should assume for our symmetry breaking potential here that the Cp breaking Wilson coefficients here, so assuming they have quarter one phases in DUV, come with Come with at a strength that is at least as large as the suppression weight of Hungski. And this should hold for almost all of them. You can maybe tune a finite number of them, but not all of them. Is it really broken anyway? By your coupling of five to Q2? Um yes, but then yes, yes. That's true. Okay, fine. Maybe it's broken by this one term, but you have no reason to assume that the other term is there as well. If these C as all zero, then you have a perfect axial. But you still have no global symmetry. But I agree, of course, that But I agree, of course, that I just think it's not a small grant, but I think it's more an EFT genericity argument. Okay, fine, yeah. No, I didn't get behind that. Yeah, the general, I mean, this. Maybe on the same line, you're assuming them to be of the order of one or one flower to some power. But if I think in C-theory of all arguments in string theory, I would expect that if something is symmetry protected, That if something is symmetry protected, it's not guaranteed, but it's likely that explicit symmetry breaking comes via some anomalous term, which is an e to the minus some insult on action. Yeah, so this will be the case for the external image axiom, very naturally so. I just don't really know a good argument for why that should be the case for the field. So if you just assume there's some complex field phi and it receives some potential, then Potential, then getting rid of all these terms seems like the excuse. But in field theory, I could simply say I have a symmetry. Yeah, you could, you could, for sure. And then... Yeah, in field theory, that would be fine. Yeah, but you could also say I just have CP is just a good symmetry of QCT. It doesn't feel like a similar controls. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I realize that, but if you're feeling you could, but only couple that. So, in a sense, my question is: what is your thoughts on the status that the quantum gravity effects come as a power-like object and not some exponential suppression? Yeah, so if I were to realize an axial model that makes a field-belief axiomat, so where there's some grain configuration where I have some light-scale field, then I would. Light-scale field, then I would expect that these operators have coefficients of most of them spill at once. This, I think, would happen. It does not happen for the experimental ones. So, for the rest of this talk, I'm mostly going to talk about the experimental ones, and so I'm going to make the reverse statements. I think Jorg has made a very good point, because I'm also, I mean, many times in my life, I've said what he said basically in the opposite way. It's totally unclear to me whether there is a clean argument about these coefficients being financial or not exponential. I still find a confusing. I saw in the literature that there are two different things. There are these calculations, but explicitly with Warmholes, I think you also had one basically with Warmholes gives us e to the minus. And then I think there was also a paper that said, ah, but if we include Papers that say, ah, but if we include all the kind of further corrections, it's actually restoring the power. Is that a resumation of the warm hole effect, something like that? But to me, I don't remember that. I I forgot. I can dig it up. It must be one of the references. It's it's after yours and the the other bur bombhole paper. They were arguing it's kind of power-like again. I was confused by that because in field theory it's all the anomaly affects the QCD kind of exponential. That's why to me in field theory it's completely natural. If it's an anomaly, it's exponential in some sense. I think the great thing is that you can write down all the operators and naively in EFT logic you give it powerlights impression. Logic to give a parallelized impression. But I don't think you have a field-theoretic argument for creating these operators out of nothing if they were not there. So it's like a non-normalization story. I mean, you do not have an argument why they should be there, which is hard. But you can write them down. And the naive thing to write down is a power of the cutter of the field theory. Yes, in the high-dimensional models, there is a symmetry. There is a symmetry in the high-dimensional theory, which is a higher-form symmetry, which is a global symmetry of that theory, and that symmetry will get broken by extended objects. So that's why in the stringy models, or basically in the extra dimensional models, you will find this central non-perturbative uh uh s scale uh appearing in symmetry between only the extended objects wrapped around compact cycles can give you anything generated potential. Generated potential. I don't really see how you could get a power. But this would be a power-up behavior in my mind, the one that you have here. Yes, yes. This is for the future galaxy. The ones that I'm going to talk about are the high-dimensional ones, which I think are distinctively different. Maybe the argument is once you know the field-theoretic symmetry proposition is not there. Symmetry competitive operators is not there, then you don't have a reason not to write down these operators. You're saying I have a global symmetry, I don't write down as operators, that's fine. But now once I take away the symmetry because it's broken somewhere, for example by the QCD is a piece of egg or by something else, and you don't have an argument not to write all the operations. Is it possible to think about open string axions in string theory to answer this question? Then you have D terms and this. And then you have D terms and this problem. I mean, it's not like in string theory, even for the axions that look like this, you expect just an exponential separation. Yeah, for axioms like this, I would not expect an exponential suppression. I'm not saying that axions in string theory always never have this feature. I'm just saying that the ones that arise from high-dimensional P-form gauge field, as I've thought I will come to in a second, those will not feature such. I think there are LBS-based papers by UK collaborators where they look at them and they probably get these kind of corrections. I can't swear to that, but I might have to look there. And from that perspective, it doesn't seem so natural to say that even for these guys, you should only have exponentially suppressed corrections. Yeah, I think you don't. I think you should get these for quote-unquote open streams. Okay. Okay. The point that's probably clear is that this is in sharp conflict with the Petecoin solution with Strong CP drawing. If you get all these terms here, even if they're suppressed by the Planck scale, you still have to forbid many operators. So if you, for instance, put f 10 to the cake of 10 to the 10 gb. Of 10 to the 10 GB, just as one model, then you'd have to either tune the Cp breaking phases that come in these coefficients here, or further suppress the overall scale of the Wilson coefficient up to dimension around 11 or so to avoid neutral EDM above the current expansion point. Yes? But it would shift a Vero Car. Yes, exactly. Yeah, you get multiple contributions to the scalar potential. You get the one that comes from low energy QCD, and then you can. That comes from low-energy QCD, and then you get all this other stuff, and you have no reason to assume that the CP phases or the other terms are not there, so you have a balancing two potentials. And so they pull away the axiom from the theta angle away from its CP restoring that. That's what's called a quality problem. Yeah. So, of course, one idea of Of course, one idea for how to do this, to forbid these operators, would be, well, what if there is a gauged discrete symmetry that just forbids these kinds of operators? There was a paper recently about this prospect. However, the main point of this paper is that there is a tension between achieving this with discrete symmetries and avoiding long-lived domain walls, which would cause phenotypes. Basically, the strings that you Basically, the strings that you get from the Kibble mechanism are not the ones of smallest charge, and that even the smallest domain wall has no obvious string that it can end up. Okay, so this is one reason why there are some problems with field-theytic axions, and this is at least one reason why one could look at different versions, different kinds of axions. And so now I want to come to stringy axions. So now I want to come to stringy axions and draw this contrast here. I remember that there are papers, and particular recently, I just forgot the authors unfortunately, which teaches by a set of gauge symmetries. So you can make, you can create an accidental symmetry somehow for bidding the lowest of the operators. I think you can write down a model? Yeah, like discrete gauge symmetries? No, just normal gauge symmetries. You have a set of fields and very Of fields, and you are assigning gauge charges in various ways. You can create a set of fields where the lowest power of this type you can write out is very high. And you don't run into this problem? I don't run into this problem. I think it's a... If you give me time, I will find the papers, but I think there are many papers in literature, and people have played this game. Just create a. It's a little bit like the framework for news type of flame modeling. Uh flame modeling game. You know, you have a set of fields, you uh assign them uh several gauged uh groups, you assign them charges, the charges are uh somehow uh yeah, yeah, there are no exactly. There are some uh high rational charges. Am I audible over Zoom? Yes. Hi, this is Matt Reesel over Zoom. Um so Arthur, um So, Arthur, in this paper, we actually looked at some examples that had continuous gauge symmetries that make PQ a good exponental symmetry. Every example that we looked at had some sort of cosmological problem. I'm not saying it's a no-go theorem. I don't know a general argument, but I also don't know examples like that that completely avoid these problems. There may be examples. There may be papers in the literature that we didn't look at, but we looked at several, and they all either had long-lived. And they all either had long domain walls or they had some sort of fractionally charged remnants or something that was a problem. Okay, okay. I didn't look carefully. I just remember recently seeing a set of papers playing this game. All I'm going to say is I don't know a reason why this game could in principle not be played successfully. I mean it's unfortunate. Yeah, I agree with that. I don't know a general argument. But if you look at examples, it's surprisingly hard. But if you look at examples, it's surprisingly hard. That that's all I agree. I totally agree. And I I think this this is anyway somehow ugly in in some subjective way because you are replacing a simple fine-tuning problem of a theater problem by a hard model building problem. And you know it's not clear how much you gain. Alright, let's move on to the stringy excellence path. Okay, so the Okay, so the phenomenology of stringy ex-dimensional axions turns out to be quite different. And to get a little bit of a sense for what they are, let's start with the simplest possible toy model, which is we consider an Nelian gauge theory in five dimensions and dimensionally reduce it on a circle of something like this model. So we start with a standard kinetic term in five dimensions and dimensionally reduce this. So what we get here to all orders in perturbation theory is an exactly massive x. So even if we have higher order corrections, Even if we have higher order corrections in powers of f here, there will still be an axiom that you can that appears in an unsults for the high-dimensional gauge field, a times d phi, where phi is the circle direction of the internal circle. Of course, you get also high-cooled decline modes, which do not have an associated shift symmetry. And so, what's that, where does that symmetry come from? So, somehow, this, the, So somehow there's this shift symmetry that appears in the low energy effect of theory that is very, very well protected. And so one thing to think about is where does that actually come from in the high electrical theory? So it is already, the symmetry is already present in five dimensions, but in somewhat more modern jargon, it's an approximate one-form global symmetry. So here, the symmetry is A goes to A plus some one-form, where the one-form. Plus some one form where the one form is closed, and the whole thing is done, this modulate ZAC forms because there's the gauge symmetry of the beaming gauge. Now, the charge operators of a one-form gauge symmetry, of a one-form global symmetry, are line operators, in this case the Wilson line, to the I integral of A. So these are extended operators. And so in the high-dimensional theory, there are no local operators that could contribute to the Lagrangian that would break the symmetry. That would break the symmetry, but these extended operators exist. Now, if you go, if you dimension reduce and look at the Lorentz energy theory, then, okay, first of all, there's a current for this, a conserved current, which is star of F, F being the two-form field strength and high dimensions. And electrically charged particles break the symmetry because d star of F, so the D of that current, is equal to. D of that current is equal to the electrical current, and this is in general non-zero if you have dynamical charge particles. Okay, so in high dimensions, you see how the symmetry is not an exact symmetry. So it's fine with the absence of global symmetries that we expect in the theory of quantum gravity, but it does not create local operators in the hydrogen. So what do we actually get in the fundamental action? We reduce the kinetic term. We reduce the kinetic term and we get our axion A with a decay constant that in this case scales like 1 over g times 1 over the square root of the radius. So there's an important property here. If we make the radius very large, the x-axis constant comes down. So this will be something that's worth remembering because it will be an important model. Also, and this is kind of nice, the potential for this axiom. The potential for this axiom is now generated only non-productively, namely by the electrically charged particles running around the circle in Euclidean signature. What you get, roughly speaking, is you start a Euclidean signature with just the leading terms for the world line, action for a particle. So it's the mass, it's the charge coupling to the engagement field. And this leads to an exponential suppression. So this leads to an effective potential in four dimensions, unless it's for. Dimensions, unless it's forbidden by symmetry or other reasons. And you get cosine potentials proportional where the argument is proportional to the charge and binding number, k here. And the inserton action here is large when the radius is large in units of the mass of the charged particle. And so this you see here is something that has naturally, so the actual quality that you get in the That you get in the four dimensions, so the degree to which the shift symmetry is preserved, is naturally exponentially high. So, not using the modern jargon, but equivalently, this is a well-known thing that goes back to Witten 84. Very well-known. And if you assume that in five dimensions there's a turn-simens action, like this, for instance, here, then you'd actually get in four dimensions. instance here, then you naturally get in four dimensions a coupling between, just by negative dimension of reducing this, you get a coupling in four dimensions, that's the AFF tilde term that you want. So you see from high dimensions, you naturally get all the required ingredients that you would like to solve the strong CP problem in semi-realistic models here. And of course, in the end, we want FF tilde to be GG tilde. F of tilde to be gg tilde, but this is just a simple algorithm. Another feature is that you don't get spontaneous symmetry breaking in a four-dimensional effective field. The x and decay constants tend to be extremely large in units of the cutoff of the four-dimensional effective field theory. So for instance, in our five-dimensional example, f was one over g, where g has a dimension of square root of length, and one over square root of radius. So if there are charged particles, If there are charged particles around, then 1 over g is the square root of the strong coupling scale in the UV of my five-dimensional gauge theory. 1 over the square root of r is the square root of the Kula Klein scale. So you see that the scale, the symmetry-breaking scale, is extremely high. It's certainly higher than the cutoff of Holy Metro. And so this is kind of exciting, I think. The physics that you find that is associated to these. That is associated to these kinds of axions is dramatically different, and I would say much more exciting than in the case of a field reaction. Of course, detecting or finding evidence for some set of new fermions and charge scalar is also exciting, but measuring something that has to do with the scale of cone of gravity, for instance, in high dimensions is maybe arguably more exciting. I might just be measuring this the wrong way around. Just be remembering this the wrong way around. But I thought in the examples that we studied, you demanded that all the F's are below the KK scale. But you've said F is large in units of the cutoff. So if the cutoff is the KK scale, I thought the F's have to be smaller than the KK scale. And here it's probably as well. I think F's have to be below the K. The masses have to be. Oh, the mass? Yeah, no. So the reason why the Fs are high, and we're demanding that the masses are below the Coulson-Klan scale because we're using a four-dimensional effect of the. Scale because we're using a four-dimensional effective theory of the axions to study axion phenomena. And I've written that here because, like, I want to rearrange, oh, so it's an M, it's an F as a number times MQK. So, FDQ. Is that because how do I see that this is larger than the KQ scale? Well, so this is the strong coupling scale in the, so lambda here, so 1 over g is the square. Here, so 1 over g, so is the square root of the strong coupling scale of the five-dimensional theory. So, if you, so this should be a scale that is in, so in five-dimensional, the gauge interaction is irrelevant, right? So, it has a strong coupling scale in the QB. So, if you want to compactify this on a circle in a controlled way, you should make sure that the composer client scale is lower than that strong coupling scale. Otherwise, you're already starting with some type of strong Kappa. MKK is smaller than lambda. Yes. Yes, and this is just. Yes, yes, and then this is just yeah, exactly. Okay, so in concrete models, now that your KK scale is smaller than that, still say that the affected potential that I cover, like when accent, is still okay to field values of f because the potential is much smaller than the case. Yes, exactly. Than the KK scale itself. So, I wouldn't see any KK corrections to the potential. As far as the four-dimensional effective theory is concerned, that's totally fine. I think what one finds in explicit constructions in string theory is something that I'm not pointing out on this slide yet, which is that x-ray kernels are not just large and units of 40 quantities, but they're also small units of Planck scale. Scale. So you get potentials with decay constants that are, as far as we know, always less than decay constants less than M Planck. But M Planck is typically much, much above the closed client scales you have. You have the closed client states, you have string states, and then quantum graphics and is the same reason as in large utilizing. Per se putting five big other than Planck is not the problem, the problem is the energy potential. You can have a symmetry that's good enough to protect them. It could be small compared to a Planck to the fourth, then you're okay, if not, then you're screwed. Because that's why the mass is small. So when we find something like a spare root of mass of psi, sometimes f should be smaller than mkk maybe there is something like that yeah. Something like that, you know. So there are fields that are not axions, but things we call saxions, like something like volume moduli, they can have an infinite field, for instance. Just what happens in concrete models is that you always find once they vary over fields that's much bigger, parametrically bigger than the Planck scale, then you find that the colour of parametric theoretically just starts to come down very, very rapidly. But in principle, you shouldn't even be like ten times as fun, or yeah, depending on what the scales are in the problem, you can still get big few breaks. All right. Okay, so in particular, there is no post-inflationary spontaneous symmetry breaking to consider. So domain walls are naturally absent here, so the phenomenology in that regard is, I think, much cleaner. If inflation is affordable, If inflation is a for the effective field theory. Yeah, but it kind of should be because we see for large extended dimensions and nothing else so far. Yeah, maybe there is something cool to do where with inflation first happening in five dimensions, then some spontaneous compactification. This could also happen. This is something interesting to consider. This is a very nice question. So does that mean that you cannot have cosmic strains? That you cannot have cosmic strings? There are cosmic strings still. So basically, whenever you have stringy axions, the spectrum is complete. So you find there will always be cosmic strings, but their tensions is extremely high, and in four-dimensional models of inflation, they will not be focused. Absolutely, you don't expect to make the minerators to come off. Yes, exactly. Yeah, as far as I know, that that that load does not occur. That does not occur. Yeah, maybe for brain-anti-brain inflation or something like that, it could occur. I don't know, maybe about that. I'm not sure that there would be this special time in the script. All right. So, how much time do we have left? So, now, so we've talked about extra-dimensional axions, and I've called We've talked about extra-dimensional axions and I've called it stringy axioms already, but let's. I want to say a few more words about what are the actual kinds of axions of fine and what p-form symmetries they come from in high dimensions. So in string compactifications, they come from not just one-form gauge fields in five dimensions, but from P-form gauge fields that I'm going to call CP in 10 or 11 dimensions. So these P forms, you can just think of them as totally anti-symmetric tensors with P indices. Symmetric tensors with P indices, and they have an associated agent variance. Cp goes to d of some plus d of the p minus one form. And well, there's an associated global symmetry again, a higher form symmetry that protects the shift symmetry of the corresponding axis in four dimensions. And in M theory, you get all t is equal to three, or if you consider electromagnetic dual, six. In type IIA, you find one, two, three, five, six, seven. 5, 6, 7. In type 2B, you find 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. So there's a huge spectrum of these kinds of p-forms. And then you can, for all of these, if they survive specimenity breaking, then it's interesting to study what is the accident genome associated to these genes. So in any case, if you consider a compactification of the 10 or 11 dimensional spacetime to be like, let's say, R4 or some FRW universe times the internal manifold X. times the internal manifold x, call the yaw manifold or something like that. Then you'll find axion zero modes where you can expand your higher form p form gauge field as some axions times some p forms omega that form a basis of the whole monitor, so they're closed forms on the internal space, defined modular exact forms. And for example in type 2B, you get four from gauge field C4. Four from gauge C4, and the axions are naturally coupled to four-dimensional Young-Mills theories that are realized from wrapped T7 brains. So, wrapping T7 brains around four cycles in Claude Yaus is a very natural way to get effective theories that have some like a standard model. So, this is a very appealing framework, and you naturally get the the the a theta angle that is some uh some some linear combination of of these of these axioms that appear in your uh four long detail in ten dimensions. Four from each ten dimensions. Now, something that I mentioned earlier in response to a question is: typically, but not always, for instance, this paper by Jacob and Buffer, Young's realizations in string theory come with these dynamical fittings. And this is perhaps rooted in the noble symmetries assertion that we make in theories of some gravity. In this case, so there's another paper by Lonika Seolikas. Loni Gosio and the Gasa this research and Suzuki about exploring the idea that this might have to be there to avoid what's called a minus one form global symmetry. Roughly speaking, you can view trace G wash G as a current again. And coupling it to a dynamical axiom like this means gauging the symmetry. So in a sense, by introducing a dynamical axion, you're taking something that would be global symmetry and you're gauging it. This is a little bit speculative. This is a little bit speculative, but maybe there's something to this. Okay, so what are the eximpotentials? Well, as before, you will get some sum over instantons. So the Euclidean signature corresponding, some kind of D-brains wrapped up four cycles. So in this case, Euclidean D3 brains wrapped up four cycles. They give you their volumes, give you the incident action. So at large volume, the control setup, these incident actions can be very large. To be very large. And you get your coset potential, which picks out certain linear combinations of these axes in their arguments. Now, in order to assess the strong CP problem in string theory, one can do something as quote-unquote simple as that. Just compute these stringy incident corrections. So among these terms, there's the contribution from QCD itself, but then there are all these other Euclidean-3-band incidents here in principle you can compute. But they are. I should say that in general, there should also be additive bases here, but I have not written that it's supposed to be, otherwise, it's kind of trivial. Okay, so for symmetry, it turns out that for SUSY-Broken-Builder-Close-Kein scale, the leading instantons come from holomorphic four cycles. And in supersymmetric complexifications like Carbier manifolds in type III string theory, these turn out to be the easiest to compute. Be easiest to compute. And so using algebraic geometry, toroid geometry, we can compute these, and we therefore have a pretty good handle on stringy hacks and potentials. Yes, Mario? Is there any way to compute these phases that we would have on Hammond? Yeah, good. Maybe. I don't know how. In principle, you just assume they have random order much minus. Yeah, so in everything I'm going to talk about, I'm just going to assume they're random order one numbers. It could be that they are actually just It could be that they are actually just told zero or aligned in some kind of way. I don't know. Maybe they're related to some kind of eta invariant on some space. In principle, you could just, if you know that QD and such amplitudes well enough, you can just compute it and see what it is. But that's, we're going to do something simpler. We're going to not compute the phase and the coefficient exactly. We're going to estimate it and assume that the phase is order one. So this sort of. So this sort of making a natural worst case scenario, and then see if that's still maybe good. Does that actually have a related place to basis? Dependent on some field, which is potentially light, or is it... Well, if they are, then if you have enough. So I mean, as usual, when you have a bunch of CP vacuum cases, for each dynamical field that's in the tenant, you can have a small one of the Dynamical field that's independent, you can absorb one of the spaces as the redefinition. So I would say that, yeah, I'd say they're not. So for instance, what happens in Calvio manifolds is that you find some set of axions, let's say there are n axions, and then there are typically more than n distinct enzymes. And their phases depend just on these n-axons. So after you've taken So after you take ten linearly independent exitons, you absorb the phases, whatever else is left just has some order one phases in them. Those phases might happen to be zero for some magical reason that I don't understand, but we're going to assume it's not. But what senses these phases in this symmetry structure? I don't know. They could be related to discrete choices you make in your. But I yeah, I really don't know. Are they completely shocked dependent? I think they could be. And they're non-trivially fixed by the whole discrete room of the complex structure. By the line of the structure, right? Yes, yeah. Although there are lots of four cycles in Clavios that don't see the complex structure of the Clavier. Of the Clavio. So maybe it's simpler than that. Maybe in some cases for rigid divisors, it's just really a topological number. But even then, the phase that you would get and the cosine would depend on the flux route. Yes, that's true. Yeah, yeah. But that's an overall one. And even for the rigid ones, if you had a mobile D3, the position of that D3 would show up in these scaling phases. So to your point, you could, in principle, envision a scenario where we could be dependent on. A scenario where there could be dependence on a white field. It's just that I think no one has yet been able to calculate these spaces in any such case, which is why we have to say beyond us right now. I wonder maybe you relate to the question, technical question. If you calculate calculation, as a pre-factor of incidents are basically, you calculate this by 0 potential lessons because there are actually string calculations. But is there actually a string calculation calculating this directly, just in field theory? I mean, is it something that string theory can provide us without using supersymmetry? Just calculate the prefect of a string in something? Yeah, I mean, so Mankey Kim has done a lot of work on pushing Mankey Kim, on pushing this computation using string theory. So yeah, I think in there are some yeah, because you have collective Zero modes, it's a little bit hard to to just use direct world check computations. Hard to just use direct world sheet computations, but using string field theory, I think you can, in principle, do this. They have derived formulas for at least the magnitude of this. I'm not sure about the phase. Because to my modest understanding, it seems to be a very natural problem because you have to compare an amplitude without a string or without a brain rep to amplitude with a brain rep. And then you run into this exactly zero-mode problem. Yes. There's a notionable difference from determinants, the specific. From determinants. Exactly, exactly. And I have not figured out whether at all this is a UV problem. Yes, it is. But I think they fixed this ambiguity in using StringGuard. I don't understand the details of that complication, but. Don't they need to read Monkey's Stream Street CD paper? That is not encouraging me. I'm very sorry, but that's what I'm talking about. But I mean, for this particular, for the kind of result I thought. Particular for the kind of result I was going to describe, it isn't maybe a critical thing because there's a polynomial dependence on whatever enters the refactors, and he's going to give an exponential solution to the polynomial to this setting. My question was a more general question. Yes. For this. There's an easier way to say that. And computing these prefactors exactly, of course, is not just cool for making these strong CP problem computations more precise. Strong CP problem computations more precise, but also for modular socialization and to make all these models really stand on an extremely well distributed footing. So yeah, I agree with you. It would be great to do that. It's hard. I was asking are you considering direct product compactifications or what like um so what yeah so then these topological quantities or whatever you were saying is Or, whatever you were saying, is it computed with including the warping, like in the C4? Yeah, so in the results that I'm going to show you, we're really detecting warping, but the general solution will have warping. So, you could imagine there being a big difference. Once certain cycles are completely sitting in strongly broken throats, that has caused us a lot of headaches in other projects. So this is this this this is yeah here we're maybe I'm assuming we're a large complex structure where there's no I want to focus on what I'm going to call the C4 axiverse. So in type 2B there's four form potential C4 and that results in a very interesting lich exiverse by itself already. So as we said earlier there are typically many such many axions There are typically many such axions, and for this particular p-form in 10 dimensions, the number of axions is given by the second Betty number of the compactification. So that's some topological invariant of your compactification space. It turns out that at least in the set of Calabiels, for instance, that we have a good handle on, called the Kreutz-Skorke database here, these typically have values of order of 100 going all the way. Values of order of 100 going all the way up to 491. So you see that, at least naively, we expect the typical models to have a lot of these axioms. So this is a very rich axiverse here. And we have a concrete incarnation of the string axiverse idea in general. And crucially, explicit computations of axiom potentials and decay constants can actually be carried out explicitly. So this is why this is such a wonderful playground for us. Playground for us, and basically, all the results I'm going to show you will be in that subsector of the axioms. Okay, so one more thing about, maybe you should skip this. We already talked about this a little bit. I want to show you some results at least. First of all, let's talk a little bit about and concretely about testing the strong or assessing the strong CP problem in type 2 research. Assessing the strong CP problem in type 2 research. So we want to figure out what is the vet of the QCD theta angle, which induces, which can, in principle, induce neutron EPR. And so in this paper here, what we did, we computed these CP breaking effects from stringy hydrons, enumerating all the possible incidents, assuming order one CP breaking phases, estimating the overall coefficients, and use that to assess the petrograde quality problem in an Assess the patching green quality problem in a concrete and large ensemble of comprehensive emissions. And okay, here are the results of a scan over more than 100,000 models. So let me impact this a little bit here. What you're seeing here on the vertical axis is the depth of the theta angle. And each dot here is a model. So 100,000 models. And there's different shaded regions here. The region between The region between here and there is the one that's excluded by neutral PM experiments. And so you want to, so successful models, those that solve the strong CB problem using the catch-quint mechanism, should fall below here. And there's also something slightly below here, which is if it's below, if the overall neutral EDM falls below this line here, falls in this region here. Falls in this region here, then it turns out to be dominated by Cp breaking effects in the weak interactions. And so it's not the stringy instant terms that we're computing here that give the leading effect. But this one has been estimated by George Ed Randall. It amounts to theta or 10 to the minus 19. So there's an principle interesting window between 10 to the minus 10 and 10 to the minus 19 in which new physics could show up and it wouldn't be related to the weak interaction. And on the x-axis here, you see the number of elves. And so you see an interesting trend here. And when the number of elves is very small, so the Delhi number is of 401, sometimes you solve the strong CP problem, and sometimes you don't. So it depends on the model. But there's a very strong trend towards larger N, namely, as the number of accidents increases, as the complexity of the models increases, basically, the stringing corrections to the Basically, the stringy corrections to the neutron VM start to become extremely, extremely numerous. Here's our attempt to explain why this happens. We find that in geometrically complex models, where n is much bigger than 1, you have many, many cycles, actually much many more than n cycles. And if you want to be in a greek coupling, for each cycle, you have to ensure that its volume is bigger than funky size. And so if you oppose And so, if you oppose all these constraints, you find that most internet actions are actually very large. So, you oppose more than n conditions, and you find that most couplings are extremely small, the corresponding internet actions are extremely large, and most incidents are completely neutraligible here. That's because the cycles grow very fast? Yes, yeah. So you impose that two cycles are at least bigger than the strength scale, and you find that there is a few, four cycles that are of order. Four cycles that are of order one in the string unit, and everything else just drops off very, very, very quickly. So you get a distribution of the values of four cycle sizes, and those are the instant actions. So, what the decay constants in these constant lines? Yeah, let me, if I have time, I'll go to yeah. Okay, let me wrap this up. Stringy corrections to the QCD theta angle turn out to be extremely sub-leading. The leading effect in these models basically. Extremely self-leading, the leading effect in these models basically always comes from small gauges in terms of the QCD. Yes? So in this picture, you have like maybe three or four heavy axions, including the QCD axion, and everything else is well below the Hubble scale today? Well, there's definitely a lot of accent that'll be a bit below Hubble, yeah. So there's a huge range that the mass is fine. Hi, yeah. Is it a correct way to understand? Hi yeah. Is it a correct way to understand this? So if you have you have these n axions and scales, these um n sorry, n n instantons. The scales of these instantons are exponentially sensitive. So by the time you get to the nth one, you've lifted all the masses away. The n plus first guy is just some super small exponentially, and it doesn't shift a minimum away from this. Yeah, exactly, exactly. It could happen that you, that, that, the, uh, that the non-trivial CP break. That the non-trivial CP breaking phase already enters much earlier because you can find, let's say, the simplest case would be: you have two instantons, the one has one charge direction, the other, and the QCD already is in the span of that. If the QCD charge is already in the span of that, then in principle you can get, then the leading perturbation comes already for relatively small cycles. This doesn't. Why doesn't this effect stop? Why doesn't this affect it stop? I mean, why does it stop? Why does the line set out? I would expect it, what you describe, that this region continues to drop as you go to a higher and higher end. Do you see a definite tone? I'm not sure. I'm not sure I would. You can't really trust the statistics that far out. So you can trust the statistics really well until like here. And this is a double origin. I think I think it's a it's I think there's an interesting effect to be a third yeah. 10 to the minus 10 to the 10. It's a ten to the minus ten to the ten. I think it's an interestingly low plugin. I'm not asking about the geometry. I think it might be a red hair. Because at n that large, you don't have that many columns. Large, don't have that many polytopes to sample from, and it's extremely hard to get like meaningfully distinct collabials and to make sure that you have a fair sample. So, what I might expect is that a lot of the models at that high H11 are morally similar. That might be causing that class fit. So, the best fit model, didn't we do a serious fit, but if you draw like an e to the minus number times n to the fourth, you get Number times n to the fourth in the exponent, that's that kind of fits well here. So I wouldn't say a plateau can be it can be meaningful there's a meaningful distinction at this at this level between a plateau and that bit. But it could be a plateau, I don't know. The y-axis are a logical scale. Yeah, so down down here you have 10 to the minus 10 to the 10. The antidotes is the y-axis on a log scale and the x-axis on a bigger scale. Double logger. Double F, double logger. Oh, yeah, it's a double log. So it could just be the fact that it's a double logger here at the plot. That's what's showing it doesn't like to. Oh, I see. So you're saying it's not to be. It's not a linear. It's not a linear, linear plot. But it could still have continuous plot. It could still happen in order to really say that it's a plateau. So the thing is that just exponential further drop would almost show us up as a prapeau in a double in a double logo. Yeah, you're just killing. If your follow-up is exponential overall, it would look almost like a poppy in a double log problem. The problem is too fast. But I'm hesitant to assign that too much meaning. Yeah, yeah, but you're welcome to disagree and find a reason why it should be projected. Okay, yes? Are you aware of a smaller number in a physics paper? No, this is the record. There are volumable factors in inflation papers. It's like my annual. But then the question is: how rigorous these papers are? But then the question is how rigorous these papers are. I think there's more rigorous work here than behind this. Okay, one more comment about this. What we find here, so I said before that the leading contribution of neutron EVM comes from small gauging sites. And this has interesting sensitivity on the SUSY-Brick scale. So what we find is that for a low SUSY-Bringing scale, let's say below 200 TeV, the neutron EVM falls above here. It does not come from the Stingium, the Stingian symptoms, but from the Nation symptoms. While for large physiography scale above around 200 TV, the neutral EDM is dominated by the static. So you wouldn't see new physics just from a detection of low 10 minus 10 TM. I know you're running out on my super fast question. So is this telling you that QCT is an anomalously small cycle compared to anything like this every tick in QCT? Yeah, it has to be one of the small cycles. It doesn't have to be the small cycle. It doesn't have to be, this small cycle doesn't have to fall outside of the distribution of cycle volumes, but it's certainly at the small end. I don't understand why there are no intermediate size cycles filling this gap. There are intermediate scale cycles. But you also get new axions. So the only thing that appears in the neutron EAM is the irreducible phases. So you're using a freedom to absorb phases in field redefinitions. And you have to, the first time something shows up, And you have to, the first time something shows up is when you get something that's already linearly dependent on the stuff you've already encountered. So that's why it's quite rare. Of course, so everything is like normalized and saying, maybe you can have higher cube if you're not grabbing it. That's possible. Yeah, but it's sort of close to it. It's scaled up to make QCD have the right gauge coupling in the era. But then it's close to it. But connecting to your question, I mean, if you were to go to a particular scenario of kilometer simulation, say LBS on Swiss cheese style Kala BLs, where only like two or three moduli are really big, all the other ones are really small blow-ups. Again, you might have hundreds of kilo moduli. I mean, but then the the statistics of large and small cycles is completely different. Most of the cycles will be relatively small. Yeah, but sometimes we'll just see that. Yeah, but it's not built. This is maybe not so different from LVS in the sense that most four cycles are blow-up divisors. So you have many of these small cycles and then you have a large overall volume, not because of volume exhibitation in this case, but because you need to make the volume large enough to fit all these cycles. So it does have some similarities to it. But then if you have many, many blow-ups there and they have relatively small volumes, why don't they sometimes show up with larger contributions? With larger contributions. I mean, that was what Mario was asking, right? So their incidents do show up. It's just they also come, there's also a lot of axions, and you have to absorb phases. And only when you get something, when you get incident one, the third one that's in the linear span of what you've already considered, going from massive to light, that's when you get an only suppressed margin which are left over basic. Yes, that's it. Eventually you get an irreducible phase, and that pulls on. Will phase and that holds on. So I'm totally out of time, I think. All this stuff. Okay, one key upshot here is concentrable appears to be absent pretty extremely for a somewhat large number of axions, while there's a kind of a toss-up in smaller numbers. And okay, well, axion photon couplings and decay constants. I just wanted to show you some thoughts here. Here's what we find for different kinds of models. For different kinds of models here, each one wants a number of axions, four and one appear, and you see that the coupling becomes that for larger number of axions, the volume drops. The axion of K comes about the same. And something that I find particularly interesting is that if you look at the mass of the QCD axion in the same class of models here, then you can put, for instance, the bounds that you get from. You can put, for instance, the bounds that you get from supernova 1987. And it turns out to be right above here. So, like, there's a tiny fraction of models that would be excluded, but most of them are not. But if you look at the projection... True, but there are a bunch of models, and as far as we know so far, those are the ones that immediately show up, in a very native set, the most varied ones. And they would be excluded if we saw hyperconnection. If we saw if like hyperchampicander, for instance, saw any direct supercomputer. So this this is this is kind of cool idea. But what you're plotting here is the distribution of the kind of juicy axial photon coupling. Here, yes. So here's the massive scale, which is awesome. For the left one, it's the coupling of the electromagnetic atom. So in a map, so in a map, there's also only one electromagnetic couple. only one electromagnetic or most of the time there's one or a few even if there's a yeah so one one one kind of cool thing that came out of this is that you might think that if you have 500 axiom 491 axioms then aren't you excluded like just because there are so many well no you actually just coupled to this to one or two this is a small one okay um selling point your observation might reveal Easter observation might reveal the limits of an axiverse, which I'm very excited about. I'm going to skip the rest, and I think this stuff will also be mentioned later on. But I'll just flesh an upload here. I think there's three kinds of sections here. One is you should study axivers more generally, not just C4 and type TB string theory. You should take a closer look at the hydrotic axivers, true for. A closer look at the hydrotic axiomers, true forms of type 2B, for instance. We should improve our model building and see if that changes our conclusions. More realistic extended models, including Higgs models, including much escalator, work beyond the lamp posts that we've populated so far. And finally, something that's more of a formal question: how large can we make decay constants? Can we actually understand why axions are always present at recoupling? Why are decay constants small and funky units? To kick off small and point units, these are the sort of big questions in quantum gravity that have been around for a while and you still don't know. And X, that's all. We're a little over time, but I mean, it's already launched now, so if people want to ask a few questions, that's fine. Have you tried to go beyond the land board by simply combining Simply combining this Axian study, where you basically standardize volumes under the condition of control, with the KKLT work, where you include a bit of attack to stabilize force like because that may seem to be something that you should right away at least maybe not write a paper but have an opinion on. Yeah, so if you just do like standard KKLT, then there's the general problem that the that the axion that there that there's some axion that has the same ma mass scale as the as the The same mass scale as the SQC accent. So if you solve the strong CP problem, you have some sort of force that rules you out. I don't think. So there was a paper by Condor a while ago. I think here's the last one. So you have a very light. So if QCD gives the dominant contribution to the. No, no, of course. The QCD cycle cannot stick as a table. That's obvious. But I meant you have all the other cycles which you basically keep large by your control. Keep large by your control demand. Yes, yeah. But if you say I want to generically stabilize them and I have to rely on one cycle being, say, large randomly, I mean, by group stabilization, then maybe you can make a more meaningful statistics. Yeah, no, I agree with that. No, we have not done it. We could do something like uh like some kind of hybrid model where it was mostly KKLT plus like some some perturbative summarization for a QCT cycle and yeah, that would be very interesting. No, we have not done we're not done. Okay. So when you say two form axials in technically from the point of view of the coupling topox plus any one priority would be something like with id five rails and all that form. I think I think you also you you'll also get uh uh couplings uh in the plus seven rings, but yeah, I think you you could look you could do five random as well to get. And I think for for two form, like what what is it that we that we don't know? So so we know we would get eight form one minus two form, two form axioms, but then is it that we and presumably that potential would be set by the sizes of the two cycles? Yes. But we don't know how to write down that potential in the same way that we write down here. I think all the ingredients are there. So, first of all, constructing models that have large numbers of these kind of axioms. Have large numbers of these kind of axions. So I wrote a paper last, well, announced two years ago about or interfolds that have this kind of features. That is there. There are ways to actually get, so this is based on this paper here, there are ways to get a control superpotential interaction for these kind of axes. So that is very much computable. And there are some toy models that we came up with here that have this feature. You can also get contributions. There are you can also get contributions to from the Keller potential directly, from D1 incentons and W shape incentons. And I think those, at least at leading order in the string company, I think you can compute those as well. So at the very least, we can estimate. I think all the ingredients are there. This has to be done. Yeah. Okay. So since many of the experiments will uh detect them by measuring the photon or gluon. By measuring the photon or gluon. But from C4, there one can also probably descend vectors since there are three forms in the calabria, harmonic three forms. So the coefficients will be vectors and that can also couple to photons like from the vector indices. Yes, that's right. Yeah, so are they suppressed? Like if we do the experiment, how will we know that the photon we measured is coupled? Photon we measured is coupled to the scalar spectrum as well. I don't think
