Be here. I'm going to talk about accumulated not probability. And so I think a lot of the people here are not theorists. And so I'll try to make this so that everyone can kind of follow along. And this is work with, I'm at an undergraduate institution. And this is work that I did with, or am doing really still with a couple of students. With a couple of students, Addie and Elizabeth. And then John just graduated. He's actually in law school now. So that's what's going on. So my motivation is really motivated by work that we have done in the past about knotted proteins. And this is just an example of one protein called one AZM to some people. To me, this is just kind of a To me, this is just kind of a the proteins are a toy set of things to play with, and I try to work with biologists so that they can actually make some more kind of biological meaning from this. But the fact is that one end of this is kind of that blue part and the other end is this red part. And if you were to kind of pin those things down and shrink it, you can get to a picture that looks like this, which still it's maybe not clear if there's. Which still, it's maybe not clear if there's a knot in there or not. But if you simplify it more, you see that there's actually some knotting inside of there. This is work that we did in the past here. And so if you don't know anything about knots, protein knots are not knots because they're open and mathematical knots are closed. Here's just three examples of knots that we will talk about. Of knots that we will talk about a lot. This is the zero, one knot, which is also known as the unknot. This is a trefoil, or actually, to be really careful, you know, one of the chiralities of the trefoil. And here's the 6-1 knot. And it doesn't matter so much why what these names are here, but if you don't know, the three has to do with the fact that this crosses over each other or crosses. Crosses over each other, or crosses over itself a minimum number of three times in a reasonable projection, and this one six times. And the second number is just which one it is in the list. And I do want to say that all these images are created with NOT plot, which is by Rob Sharine, who's here somewhere. And if you don't have this, you should have this because it's a wonderful program and it's really pushed along, I think, not theory research for a long time. Long time. So, all right. So, if we talk about if we talk about open knots, I'm kind of motivated by these three examples. So, these are all kind of open curves that if I were to ask, for example, I always pick on my mom, but I say if I were to ask my mom if these were knotted, she would probably say yes in all these cases. But maybe the degree to which they're Maybe the degree to which they're knotted or they're trefoil-like depends a little bit. This one on the left is the one that's probably most like what you would think of. If I gave you a rope and said, tie a knot as quick as you can, you'd probably tie this one. But if you take a closed knot and maybe chop a little bit out, those should probably be knotted as well. Although this spot where this one on the right is cut. Where this one on the right is cut is maybe makes it a little bit scary, or maybe possibly less knotted than these other ones. So there are lots of different schemes of measuring knotting and open curves that people have come up with through the years. And I mean, I guess Chris was talking about this a little bit, and Christian was talking about linking, but he's also done a lot with nodding and can as well. Can as well. So, how you do it depends on your goals. The physicists tend to be, I wish I could be a physicist because they seem much more relaxed about everything. And I'm always just anally retentive about everything. And so the thing that I really want to talk about here is how to assign a NOT type to an open chain. And this is kind of builds on work that we've done in the past. All right, so the question is: you know, you have something like this. Is this a trefoil? Right? By topological standards, it's not, because you could just manipulate this thing and get it back to look like a straight line. But I'm inspired by Bill Clinton, who once said it depends upon what the meaning of is, right? And that's really the question that we're getting at here, trying to understand. Trying to understand. All right, so this is the way we've been measuring knotting in open curves, kind of in general. And this is based on work by Ken Millette and Ako Stobe and Andre Stasiak. And I call it the uniform closure method. I think Ken calls it the MDS method because they came up with it. So the idea is that this orange curve right here is an open. Is an open knot. All right, I took a knot from knot plot and chopped out some edges so you just get an open curve here. And the question is: like, what type of knot is this? All right, so the idea in this method, I think the philosophy is that the open chain isn't a knot, but it kind of could be a knot. It has the potential to be a knot, and we want to see what types of knots it would likely be. And so the way we do this. And so, the way we do this is we shoot out rays to infinity in a bunch of different directions. So, a common direction from each of the endpoints. So, this red one is one ray closure. Of course, we don't actually need to go to infinity. We just need to get outside of the convex hull of the knot, and then we can close it up. So, we can do this in every direction. There's actually an S2 of these directions, but we can't really close it in all the possible directions. Um, close it in all the possible directions, and so um, what we do is we do it 100 times. I think Elaine does it maybe 500 times, and some other people do it more times or less times. Um, so what we're going to do is we're going to close it in 100 different directions. We're going to then in those cases, we get a closed knot for each of those directions. And so we can compute a knot type in the knot theory sense. All right, and then we can look at the All right, and then we can look at the distribution of knot types that we get by doing that. So, in this case, you can see the green and the blue one might kind of be more like what you think the knot should be. But there are other directions that you can go, like the red direction, where you get a much different type of knot. All right, and so this is how we measure the knotting as this probability distribution. And then, to assign a knot type, what we do is just take the knot type that had the highest. Just take the knot type that had the highest probability. So we might have 60% of them being, I think, this is a 7-5 knot, in which case we would say, okay, well, then we're going to call that a 7-5-0. And that probability gives us some sense of like how reliable that number is. But we're really thinking of it as a probability distribution. All right, so there are a lot of different ways of defining open knotting, some of them where you do a single closure. You do a single closure, some of them where you do like a probability distribution like this. And the fact is that for many chains, this is like open chains, most of the definitions coincide. And in particular, if the endpoints are on the outside somehow, if they're outside like in the first picture that I showed there. And this is the case if you look at whole protein chains, the endpoints of it are usually on the outside. Are usually on the outside. But it turns out that most chains have one knot type appear in over 50% of these closures. So I'm closing it 100 times. That means that over 50 of them are usually one particular knot type. I think the only place where anyone looked at this formally was maybe Ken in the past. But the problem is, if we want to locate where. If we want to locate where the knot is on the curve, we really need to know the knotting of all the subchains, all of them. And when that happens, you're forced into ambiguous situations where you're not going to have one knot appear over 50%. You might have 40% of this, 40% of that, 10% of this, 5% of that, something like that. And since in proteins, it's believed that the position of the knot could be linked to the function, to me, it's. To me, I believe that we need to be able to understand exactly where this is, or at least get a better sense of it. The other thing that I would say is it's just the right thing to do to understand kind of exactly where this knot is. All right, so we encode the knotting of an open chain in one of these kind of image matrices. I want to give you a sense of what's going on here. Going on here. So, this is the protein 3BJX, which is the most knotted of any of the proteins discovered to date. All right. And so what this does is it has a little square for each of the subchains of this protein. And then it's colored by what knot you have. And it turns out that the way that we do it is the opacity of the color. Opacity of the color is the percentage of knots that were of you know in that particular subchain. So, in this region right here, this is saying in any of the subchains related to this, that the plus three one knot was the knot that appeared most often. And where you see darker regions, that means that the number was closer to 100%. And where you see lighter numbers, it was, you know. Lighter numbers, it was, you know, maybe closer to 50 or 40 percent, something like that. So, to understand what chain is assigned to each of these squares, the x value here tells you the starting amino acid, and the y value tells you the ending amino acid. So this diagonal right here is all length one subchains, all right, and they're all unknotted because there's just nothing you can really do with one segment. This bottom left. Segment. This bottom left-hand corner is the whole chain. So this says that the whole protein forms a 6-1 knot. All right, and if you look at lines that are parallel to the diagonal, these are subchains of equal length. All right. This little spot right here, it's actually right on the edge, for example, is the one that goes from amino acid, say, zero to about 50. And so that's. About 50. And so that's this little piece right here, which you can see in that picture. All right. So, even if you don't understand all of what I just said there, the point is that what this shows is what knots you see and kind of where you see them. The other way to think of it is that you actually lay the protein chain down from here to here, and then you take a particular cell and you go up into the right, and then that. Into the right, and then that part of the subchain is the part that you're thinking about. All right, so here's the picture that we get when we run the 3BJX. Here's the picture. There's a little bit of 4-1-knot. It's right above there. And then there's trefoil and 6-1. And so this is coloring by the highest probability. Over here, I'm throwing out all. Here, I'm throwing out all the ones. Well, first of all, all the ones that are unknots because that's kind of boring, and all the ones where the highest knot type was under 50%. So you can see in this picture, the four ones go away. So that means that all the four ones that you see over here, all the figure eight knots, all appeared with a probability lower than 50%. Although they were the highest, it was still the highest percentage. They were below 50%. They were below 50%. And so I'd like to fix this somehow. And so I want to talk about the idea of the essence of the trefoil. All right, so this picture right here, you know, is like a typical picture of a trefoil, you know, or an open trefoil, I would say, with these free ends. And I would say, does this have the essence of a trefoil? And I think it's that most people would say yes, except for Ken, because he. Would say yes, except for Ken, because he always gives me a hard time. But anyway, I would say that that has trefoil in it. If we look at this picture, it's the same trefoil, but then I added kind of part of another trefoil on here. Does that contain the essence of the trefoil? And again, I would say yes, it's a trefoil here on the left, and then there's kind of more trefoiling on the right. But this is another way where you might add knotting to. Another way where you might add knotting to something is to twist around here. This is like a 5-1 sort of knot. And I would say that this still contains the essence of a trefloid. It just has kind of more stuff to it. All right. And that's the idea of what we're trying to capture here. This is actually like a figure eight knot, a knot plot figure eight knot with a little bit chopped out. Does that have the essence of the trough oil? And the answer is no, although it's maybe not clear. Answer is no, although it's maybe not clear to you why that's the case. I'll just tell you that the answer is no. So, not every configuration has a trefoil, the essence of a trefoil in it. All right, so if we have an open configuration and I want to ask, you know, is it trefoil-s, does it have the essence of the trefoil in it somehow? I'm going to fix this configuration. I'm going to compute the closures, these 100 closures in all these different directions. In all these different directions, I'm going to get a knot type for each of those. And then I'm going to ask: does that knot type contain a trefoil in some way? And if so, then I'm going to add it to the ones that are kind of have the essence of the trefoil in them. The problem is, what does contain mean? And then even once I do this, I could say how unknotty is it? How trefoil is it? How figure eight is it? How would I still then assign a knot type? Type. So if we think about containsness, all right, we can, there's a lot of different ways to do this. The way that we've been doing it is based on work by my buddies, John and Diao, Klaus Ernst, who's here, and Andre Stasiak. They have a paper that's about basically unknotting through minimal knot diagrams. And so the idea here is: here's a minimal diagram of a trefoil, here's one crossing. Here's one crossing that we see right here. If we flip the crossing, take the mirror image of that crossing, then we get this picture on the right. And you can imagine taking this top loop and pulling it over and then untwisting it, and you'd get a circle here. So this is a plus trefoil, which when you change one of the crossings becomes an unknot. So we can say then that a trefoil contains an unknot. It turns out that this is true of kind of all knots. Kind of all knots. All right, and so we do that on each of the crossings in a minimal diagram to get a sense for kind of what knots are contained in it. Here's a little bit more interesting example. Here's the 6-1 knot, again from knot plot. If you switch either of these two crossings to the mirror image, it turns out that there's a little clasp here, and you undo that clasp and then you can untwist it, and it's unknotted. Unknotted. If, however, you switch any of the crossings up here, you basically eliminate one twist and you end up at what's a figure eight knot. And if you change any of those crossings, it switches to an unknot. So we can encode that in a graph. Here's a six plus six one, and it goes to a four, one and a zero, one, and the four, one goes directly to the zero, one. Now we made these pictures. We were playing around with this. And so in With this. And so in this case, the coloring has to do with the unknotting number, if you know what that is. And the X position, right, and left has to do with the writhe of the ideal configuration, if you know what that means. And the vertical position is the crossing number. So that's why we drew it like this. The thing is that you don't, this kind of builds a family tree of knots, and you wouldn't have to use, you know. To use this kind of tunneling or cross-strand crossage, if you didn't want to, you could use nullification if you know what that is. You could use reconnection if you don't mind going through knots and links. Or Ken and Andre and I did some stuff where we were looking at what we were calling sub knots in tight knots. Or we could just make up something like ask Ken, as long as he consistently gave us the same answer, we'd be all right. The same answer, we'd be all right. Um, so again, here's some pictures of like the minus 918 knot. You can see that it decomposes to, I can't even see, my eyes aren't good enough anymore. It looks like a 7.5 maybe, which decomposes into some other things. And so you get an idea of how these things kind of flow down to the unknot. 10-123 is always a fun knot. It's an amphichiral knot. And so And so they always have these kind of beautiful structures right here. Oh, the other thing I didn't say is the thickness of these things has to do with like how many of the crossings go to that. So here you can see like the plus 5.1, all you change any of its crossings, it goes to a plus 31. But in the 918 case, there's some that go to 7.2, some to 5.2, some to 7.5, if I can read correctly. But we really need to go, well, down the tree or up the tree. Uh, well, down the tree or up the tree, depending upon how what you want to think of. So, um, if you have a plus trefoil, we say that the plus trefoil is contained in the plus 5, 2, plus 5, 1, and then we can kind of pull this down. Now, of course, I'm not doing this to have you understand what all these things are, but the fact is that the trefoil, the plus trefoil, is contained in a lot of different knots. All right, and this is based on work by Jason Kennedy. And this is based on work by Jason Cantorella and his former PhD students, Harrison Chapman and Matt Mastin. And they have a graph or they have all of the knot diagrams through 10 crossings. So that's kind of what we scrape to get through this. All right, so what I want to do is do something like a CDF more than a PDF. I want to say, not is it a trefoil, but rather, is it at least a trefoil? And then what we're going to do is use the most complicated knot over. Is use the most complicated not over 50 that gives us a percentage over 50%. So here's a real-world example. In the protein 3BJX, in amino acids 10 through 290, this is the percentage of knots that we get in these 100 closures. 42% unknots, 29% 4-1s, 23% 6-1s, and 6% 3-1s. Well, so in traditional terms, we would call this an unknot because that has the highest percentage. Unknot because that has the highest percentage. But if we think of this kind of accumulative, the 0, 1 is contained in all knots. So we would say that its percentage is the percentage of all the knots that it's contained in. So itself, the 4, 1, the 6, 1, and the 3, 1. So the unknot is always going to have probability 1.0, accumulated probability. It turns out the 4, 1 is contained in the 6, 1, so we can add up the 4, 1 and the 6, 1, and we get 0.52. 61 and we get 0.52. The 61 and the 31 aren't contained in any of the other knots in this sample, so they just keep their normal properties. And so I would say, since the 4,1 has a percentage, it's accumulated percentage of 0.52, and that's the most complicated knot with probability over 0.5, this suggests that the subchain is a 4,1 somehow. Now, if we were to ask Attorney General William Barr, he might say that he's trying to grapple with the word suggest. Trying to grapple with the word suggest, but that's all right. So normally we would assign a 0, 1, but instead we're going to assign 4, 1 to the non or to that to the 3BJX for that particular subchain. So if we look at 3BJX, this is the original picture where we take the highest percentage. Here it is, if we just cut it off at 50%, only take the ones where the percentage was over 50%. And now if we use this. 50%. And now, if we use this new regime, we get a much different picture. We see the 4-1 kind of dominating in many more spaces, spaces that used to be 6-1 because it was the highest, but a lot of those values are actually less than 50%, which you see over here, which then gets filled in with the 4-1%. So I might call, you know, I would say that this gives us kind of a better understanding of what's going on here. Going on here. Here's another picture. This is the protein 4-DJI. Here's the original picture, and this is what you get if you use this kind of accumulation. All right, so the questions are, you know, does this provide any information that would be helpful biologically? Well, this is why I talk to bio people, but I believe it gives us a better understanding of the nodding in proteins or any open. Knotting in proteins or any open chain. The other thing I'd say is maybe we'll discover some more knotted proteins, ones where the unknotting probability at some point gets below 50%. Currently, we're running this on the computer behind me, actually, and trying to see if we can find some more knots. The other thing, kind of aiming this maybe at Elaine and Lou, is I think this idea of accumulated stuff can be applied to knots. stuff can be applied to notoids. Although my understanding in talking with Deimos is that the kind of it's maybe not the notoid table doesn't go up so far. And then are there other applications? And I guess this is my question. Is greater than or equal to in kind of a CDF better than equal to? And so I thought that was a nice way to write it. I thought that was a nice way to write it. Anyway, I'd like to thank the Burrs people for putting this together, and of course, our fearless leaders here. And then also thank my students who are working on this and Rob Sharine, who's always helpful to us, and the National Science Foundation for funding this. And I'd like to say no thanks to COVID because I really would love to be in Banff right now, and I'm not. So anyway, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Dr. Rounder. That was a wonderful talk. Very clear, very, very clear. So please go ahead. We have some time for questions. And again, you can either go to the chat or just go for it directly. Okay, there is. Okay, there is a Javier asked something. How are these related to virtual knots? I would say you could do the same sort of thing for virtual knots, but maybe it's not, but you'd have to have some sort of family tree of these sorts of things or family relationship. Ken, did you have your hand up or were you just waving at me? No? Okay. No, okay. Well, one comment about virtual knots is: if you have something partial and you've chosen a projection of it, then you can just take a virtual closure and get a virtual knot for it. And then look at the topological type of that. Can I ask something Eric? You suggest the thinking about Just the thinking about probabilities of various configurations, how many, what is the dominant, and so on. But this arrangement of not tree-like arrangements that you're talking about suggests to me that maybe these ideas might be more applicable to the question of dynamics. So, suppose you have your protein. Your protein chain that fluctuates in thermal bus. It's not like biologists tell you its configuration from protein data bank. In reality, it breathes, it fluctuates. So as it fluctuates, probably it changes to some extent from one place to the other. And how it can change, probably I would guess, more or less along the edges of your graphs. On the edges of your graph. And so maybe you can come up with some classification of time-dependent kinetics of rearrangements of this noted. Did you think it along these lines? I'm just not a big dynamics guy, but I would love to hang out with more people who do that sort of stuff. And Shura, it's a pleasure to see you. It feels like it's been a long time. Same here. Same here, absolutely. I came specifically to listen to you. Yeah. So, yeah, it's a great idea. And yeah, I just have never really done kind of dynamic studies, but I would like to. Your ideas seem to resonate to me in this direction. Okay. Do we have any more questions? Any more questions? Okay, so otherwise, let's move on to the next topic. Thank you very much, Dr. Roundon. Thank you. That was fantastic. Yes. So our next speaker is Dr. Peylu. He's at the University of Minnesota. And I don't have the exact title, but I think he's going to talk about electrokinetic prompts in viruses. By the way, let me say that. Let me say that if Dr. Pei Lu is able to do very sophisticated numerical algorithms, develop numerical methods for very complicated problems. And he's going to be in the job market next fall. So if you're looking for a top numerical computational analyst that can actually understand complex models, this is your person. Thank you.
