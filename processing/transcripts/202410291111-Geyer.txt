I will talk about a joint work with you, Leo, and Dmitry Dalinowski that came out of a research and team's stay in Vienna a couple ago. It's about transversibility for solitary waves of an equation which was introduced yesterday by Doug Nielsen, so I can keep my introduction shorter. Thank you, Doug. So I will cut right to the chase. It's this generalization of commas a home to two dimensions, similar to how KP generalizes KDV. And so therefore, trivially, And so, therefore, trivially, every traveling wave solution of the Master-Holm equation, be it smooth, opique, solitary, or periodic, will be a solution of this Kamas-Holm Kp equation if there is no variation in Y. So then these so-called line solutions, line traveling wave solutions are the ones that we will study in this talk, in particular, the solitary line traveling wave solutions. And I mentioned here below the only result that we know of, which is a truly three-dimensional profile, was the one that Doug talked about yesterday. Doug talked about yesterday. So, to study the transverse stability of these line solitary waves, first of all, let me review quickly some previous results to set the stage. So, there's a result by Ming Cheng and he's a former student, where they prove instability in the case of Kamasaholm Kp1. So, with a minus sign here, using or expanding on the Russians and Svetkov criterion. Rousseau and Svetkov criterion. There's an extension, extensive analysis proving spectral stability and instability for the periodic case in the full BKP family, also by Ming Cheng and collaborators. And so what we do here is we complete the picture in the solitary case by proving stability for the Camason KP2 case. As you can see here, this is the sort of what one could expect from the KDV level. This was also true: instability in the KP1 case stability. In the Kp1 case, stability in the Kp2 case. And so, how to obtain this analysis? What is important and crucial is that this two-dimensional Kamaso-Holm equation has also a Hamiltonian form, which is exactly the same as in the one-dimensional case. In green, I'm always highlighting in this talk the transfers, the terms that are added because of the transverse part. So, the Hamiltonian energy is the same plus this green term here, and then you have also conserved momentum. And then you have also conserved momentum and mass, which we will need later. We need that these conserved quantities are monotonous wave speed. So if we then perturb around a solitary wave and we study the linearized evolution of this perturbation, we get this linear evolution equation and we write it in this way such that we can separate sort of the stuff that we know from one-dimensional plus this additional term coming from the transversality. Transversality. We separate variables in these typical answers, and so now from now on, the parameter eta will be the one tracking the transverse stability or instability. So this is our transverse spectral stability problem that we are looking at. And we will say that a solitary wave is stable, asymptotically is transversely stable, if the spectrum of this operator lies strictly in the negative half-plane. So, this is what we want to prove. So, sorry, I should have mentioned that we proved that the spectrum of this operator in this weighted L2 space is in the negative half plane. And the reason why we do this in negative spaces, so this is inspired by asymptotic stability of Fauquelivie, solitary waves by Pego and Weinstein. You will see in this slide what is the advantage. So, if we study, first of all, just the one-dimensional operator J L in L2, we have, of course, always the zero eigenvalue. Have, of course, always the zero eigenvalue coming from the translation and the invariance. And we can use, we can compute the continuous spectrum coming from the constant coefficient operators because of the decay at infinity. And we see that the whole spectrum is just the imaginary axis, so Ir. If we do that in the weighted space L2 with some weight mu, we see that the continuous spectrum is shifted into the left half plane. And this is direct calculation to prove that the real part is indeed strictly negative. Indeed, strictly negative. And what happens is that the zero eigenvalues, which is still there, of course, is now isolated. Now, this is still one-dimensional. So now we'll add the transverse perturbation, so the green part. And here again, I can compute the continuous spectrum. And I see that it is shifted. So the green curve here is the one which includes the transverse term. So it's shifted even further into the negative half plane. Half plane. And what happens to the zero eigenvalue? It's a double eigenvalue, and it will become, it will split into a pair of conjugate eigenvalues, which have strictly negative real part. This can also be computed. To study this splitting, we can use perturbation methods because it's isolated from the continuous spectrum. We can expand in powers of our transversal parameter eta and obtain at each level. And obtain at each level an inhomogeneous equation for which we check the Freton condition for solvability. And there we find that at first order, sort of the eigenvalue moves up the imaginary axis into two complex pairs. And in the second order, it moves to the left. And in order to show this, that it moves up and to the left, we need this conserved functional to be monotone with respect to the wave speed c okay. So once we arrive there, can we So, once we arrive there, can we conclude on transverse stability of the waves? Unfortunately, not, because it could be that the spectrum of this operator J L, so just the one-dimensional case, in L2 could have embedded eigenvalues, which we do not know, and they could become unstable once we add the transverse perturbation. So, this scenario has been ruled out in the KDV case. This is also found in the Pago-Beinstein paper using integrability problems. Einstein paper using integrability properties of KDB. And this information is just not there for the Kamassoho. So we cannot conclude at this stage. What we did instead, we looked at small amplitude cases. So we define a small parameter epsilon to be the square root of the maximum of our solitary wave. And for these small solutions, we can prove that the entire spectrum, except for the two pair of eigenvalues, is in the strict negative half plane. And therefore, these small Negative half plane, and therefore, these small amplitude solitary waves are transversally stable in this weighted L2 space. The proof, which I will not discuss here, is based on resolvent estimates and importantly, an asymptotic reduction of this Kamas-Saholm Kph to the Kp equation. We follow a paper by Mitsumachi and Shima Pokuro on the Penny-Luc equation. So, just to give you an idea, there's a coordinate transform which allows you to sort of map the cake. You to sort of map the K Camason Kp into at leading order the Kp equation, and you can write solitary waves of Camasome as bounded perturbations of the Kdv solitary waves. This allows you to rewrite the spectral problem into sort of a perturbation of the Kdv spectral problem. And then you need a result which also matches the eigenvalues of Kamasa-Holm and Kp to the Kp ones. So, to obtain these resolvent estimates. This allows you to conclude, and that's To conclude, and that's basically the result I wanted to tell you about. So, we'll finish just with some open problems. Of course, it would be nice to eliminate those embedded eigenvalues, which could become unstable to actually get spectral stability for arbitrary amplitudes. The non-linear transfer stability is also still open. And also, one could think about studying transfer stability or instability for these peaked line solutions, which are also solutions of this equation, which would. Of this equation, which I think would be very interesting. So, with that, I thank you. Thank you, Anna. Now, are there questions?
