Tate resolutions, which were built by Eisenbuck, Floyste, and Schreier, maybe a little less familiar to people in the audience. But how tools like that extend to multi-graded settings or Tauric varieties, other Tauric varieties. My interest in this is, you know, we've already seen a few talks on Tauric varieties from homological perspectives. And I think my interest is maybe a little different. Is maybe a little different than my big picture motivation is maybe a little different than some of those, which is my primary interest comes from the world of syzygies, where you use free resolutions to understand algebraic and geometric data. And so things like Mark Green's NP conditions for smooth curves goes way back, or if you heard of Green's conjecture about this. About the syzygies of canonical curves and the relationship with special line bundles, the Green-Lazarsfeld conjecture. Those are kind of geometry of syzygies, basic stuff. But then there's also ways in which homological notions and specifics on free resolutions can be a useful tool in other geometric settings. So the notion of being arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay. Being arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay is something that gives you a lot more information about a variety and projective space and various uses of syzygies show up in deformation theory, things like this. So we were interested in, I'm interested, along with a number of folks in the broad question about this kind of geometry of syzygy sort of story, but in other settings where maybe the defining Where maybe the defining equations in the algebraic setting had some additional structure, some multi-grading, or even some non-standard Z-grading. Those are very common. Or on the other angle, where you're looking at curves or varieties embedded in a weighted projective space or a product of projective spaces or something where the clock string is a little more complicated. And so that's my big picture motivation, and I'll allude back to it as we go. And I'll allude back to it as we go. But the core is: I'm going to talk about these three really central tools in homological algebra and ways in which they generalize. So the notation, K will be a field. It doesn't matter what field throughout. We're going to projective space over the field. I'll have the standard graded polynomial ring. And then that'll denote with S. And then that'll denote with S, it's a symmetric algebra, and then E will denote the Kazul-dual exterior algebra. And I grade those variables negative. And of course, they jump in anytime with questions. You know, I find these Zoom talks can be difficult, but I really, the more questions, the better. All right. So let me just give a brief overview of the BGG correspondence. Correspondence. So with S and E as before, and I'll use omega E to denote the canonical module for E. And just as a disclaimer, everything in the whole talk will be graded with respect to the natural, everything algebraic will be graded with respect to the natural groups. So for now, it's Z gradings. Later, it'll be multi-gradings. But I think that'll all be clear. So the central theorem in the BGG correspondence. In the BGG correspondence, is this equivalence of derived categories? You have these explicit functors, these BGG functors that turn a module, say an E module, into a linear complex of S modules, or an S module into a linear complex of E modules, and those induce an equivalence on the derived categories. And it's very explicit. These constructions are actually very explicit, and this ends up being important for some. Explicit, and this ends up being important for some of the applications I care about. It's, you know, you take what the R functor is, say, is you just tensor over the ground field with omega, and you have this very explicit differential, which is this sum xi EI differential. And you interpret the XIs. If you look at R of S, you can interpret the Xi's as moving you in a homological degree, and the EIs are giving you the mass, the twists. twists there. Okay, so it's this very explicit construction. And one thing I'm going to point out is that often for many folks, I think the equivalence of categories is the key. But for some of the kind of geometry of syzygy stuff I mentioned earlier, it's important that we also understand more detailed aspects of the correspondence. And of course, we do. We understand how not just an equivalent. Not just an equivalence of categories, we understand how important invariants on one side of the equivalence translate to invariants on the other, things in this form. So I've just highlighted one kind of these more explicit details to give a sense, which is the degrees in which the complex R of M is exact, is acyclic, is encoded by this invariant, the Castle-Nuovo-Mumford region. Variant the Castle Noobo-Mumford regularity of the module. So it's just an example of how these kind of important invariants go back and forth. And the Castle-Nouvo-Mumford regularity is a central invariant in the sort of geometry of syzygies type applications I've mentioned. Why is it not going? Oh, there we go. Okay. So, next on my list, I'll talk about Bailinson's resolution. So, again, these papers came out, many folks here know, essentially simultaneously. So, for the resolution of a diagonal, I just take the diagonal inside a product of projective spaces, and then there's this beautiful Kazul complex resolution of O of delta. Of O of delta. And it's, it's, I mean, it's totally explicit, and the maps are wedges with an explicit section of a vector bundle. And it's, I mean, I don't know what to say about it. I think probably most people in the audience are familiar with this and with some of the many applications that come from this resolution. Of course, it has applications to derived categories. It's shown up in some of the talks already. In terms of general In terms of generators for the derive category, certain explicit sets. It also gives an equivalence with the homotopy category of exact, that's supposed to say E-complexes. You can get, you know, these Balanson spectral sequences or the Balanson monads for sheaths. You can represent sheaths in very explicit ways. I don't know. There's just, I don't know how much to say on this. There's a host of applications to valence and its construction. And the last of this triad I'm going to talk about is probably the least familiar. They're called, they were defined in a paper of Eisenberg, Floysted, and Schreier. And it's a Tate resolution. It's in some sense an explicit inverse to one of the valence and functors, the Valence and equivalences of categories. Categories. And it goes like this: you have a coherent sheaf on projective space, and what you get is a doubly infinite, everywhere exact complex of E modules over the exterior algebra. It's minimal in the sense that all the differentials lie in the maximal ideal. It's everywhere exact. It's a free complex. And number two is really one of the key. Number two is really one of the keys. It somehow combines all of the sheaf cohomology of groups into a single object. So there's this explicit formula where the vast numbers of the Tate resolution line up with the sheaf cohomology groups of the sheaf. So it's over all twists in the Picard group and all HJ. And I mean, in some sense, what this is. And I mean, in some sense, what this is saying, this tate resolution is somehow, how do I want to say this? It's like you have your separate cohomology modules, you know, H0 lower star, where you add over all the twists of the H0 groups and add over all the twists of the H1 groups. And each of those gives you an individual module over the polynomial ring. And what the Tate resolution does is it takes that same information. Does it take that same information and on the kind of exterior algebra side and it weaves it into a single thing? So the Tate resolution somehow combines all of the information of all of those cohomology modules into a single object over the exterior algebra. And then there's a few more, I don't know, three and four are a little more detailed. I mean, three has to do with how it relates to the BGG functor. So if So, if you start with a module and you take the corresponding sheaf, how would the BGG functor R of M relate to the Tate resolution? And there's an explicit formula. The regularity here again is the Castle-Noville-Mumford regularity. And then four is just, I mean, this fact that you can get, I don't want to say this, how it relates to valence and monads. So it gives you, you can get a really It gives you, you can get a really explicit recipe for producing the Balinson mode out of a sheaf by applying this really simple functor where E twisted by J goes to the, what's it called, omega j. By applying that omega functor to the T resolution, you can get the valence amount very explicitly, including not just the terms, the maps, anything you want. The maps, anything you want. So, let me just show one example of what a tate resolution looks like. So, the top of the slide I left the same. The bottom is just going to be our example. So, I'll work on P1. I start with this R of S, which we had earlier, where it's a linear complex. And then it turns out that the kernel is resolved by another linear complex. Another linear complex which you know that which resolves the H1. So here by H1 lower star, I mean you add up all the H1 groups of your sheet. And if you work that out, you can see the H1 groups are arising here as the Betty numbers of the resolution of the R of S. And so the take resolution of the total complex. So putting this together, what we get is a doubly. Get is a doubly infinite everywhere exact complex. And the Betty numbers you're seeing here: one, two, three, those are the H0 of the twists of O of P1. And the Betty numbers on the other side are the H1 groups of the twists of O of P1. And this is kind of a simple example, but this is what works in full generality, is you always get this doubly infinite everywhere exact complex where the various sheaf cohomology groups appear. Various sheaf colonology groups appear in the threads of the cop. And so these three ideas are very closely related. This picture is meant to somehow summarize that idea. So the BGG correspondence is somehow about the structure of the Kazool complex as an The Kazoole complex as an SE bimodule. So that was the construction. I took my module S and I tensored it with omega E. And that was how I got the R of S over here. And if you want to pass from that to the Tate resolution, that action is just the action of taking a minimal free resolution in the category of complexes. So the Tate resolution is the unique thing which extends R of S to R of s to an everywhere exact complex, and that's one way to think about it kind of algebraically is it arises in that way. And then this omega functor transforms Tate resolutions into Balanson monads. And this was all, you know, much of this goes back to even Balanson's original papers. This resolution point was worked out explicitly in the Eisenberg-Sloyster-Schreier work. The Eisenberg-Floyster-Schreier work. And then there's also a parallel picture going on kind of a level above at the bimodule level, which is just like the BGG functors amount to understanding modules in their SE bimodule structure. If you convert S modules to OPN modules, then you can. Modules, then you can think of Tate resolutions as somehow arising from OPNE bimodule structures. And that'll be even more explicit when I do the generalizations later on. And then there are kind of complete the picture so you can understand Balanson's resolution as coming from, at least up to quasi-isomorphism, coming from the The original Kazul complex via geodification and then a sort of identity cross-oega functor. Any questions so far? It's all good here. Sorry, I couldn't hear that. I missed. Sorry, I think it's all good here. Good. Okay, thank you. All right. So let me now pass to the multi-graded form. For so the setup is: I'm going to want a simplicial projective Tauric variety, and I want to work, but I really want, what I really need is the stack, right? The underlying Toric stack. And I'm going to take the Cox ring in the sense of Cox's original work, which is I'm going to add up the global sections over all the twists in the class group. And so I get this polynomial ring. Polynomial ring, it's CLX graded, and it comes with some irrelevant ID. And there are two examples that I'll keep in mind and come back to over and over again. But of course, I'm sure many in the audience will know many more examples. But the case of weighted projective spaces, or really the weighted projective stacks, is going to be one I'll come back to a lot, primarily because it's easiest to. It's easiest to draw the situation there because the class group is only z. So I'm just going to have this standard weighted projective stack where in the Cox ring, the variables have different degrees. Of course, the irrelevant ideal in this case is the maximal ideal. And then another example is one where the irrelevant ideal is not the maximal ideal. It comes from a product of projective spaces and where the two sets of variables just have separate. Of variables just have separate Z-gradings. And it's this kind of classic example there. And the overarching goal, I said this on the first slide, but the overarching goal of this work, and again, work of a number of other folks in this area, including people like Craig Smith, Christine Burkish, Diane McClagan, folks in this area, is to understand how. How homological results for projective space and the standard graded polynomial ring to what extent do they have analogs for X and the multi-graded Cox ring? And there are some kind of easy analogs, you know, things like Hilbert functions make sense in this thing. There's some easy analogs, but I'm interested in somewhat more subtle ones that I'll come to in a minute. So, let me lay out a bit of the philosophy in this multi-graded setting. So, I mean, the first thing I want to say is multi-graded polynomial rings have more structure generally, right? If you're graded by Z2 or Z3, that's more structure. And so, somehow, I mean, I think there should be, we should expect results. We should expect results that are at least as strong or possibly even stronger, more structure in the multi-graded and toric case. But there's a mystery here, which is somehow, at least in the geometry of Syzygy world, where I'm coming from, that just hadn't happened. I mean, syzygies had been used as this kind of fundamental tool for studying. This kind of fundamental tool for studying certain families of varieties in projective spaces and extracting certain invariants in those families. And there's, you know, there's a whole book by David Eisenbaud on the geometry of syzygies. And the theory has moved way forward even since then. And yet, strangely, when you tried to produce analogs of these sorts of things, even for products of projective spaces or even weighted projective spaces, all the results were. All the results were kind of very weak in comparison. There was nowhere near as much going on. And so there was this strange disconnect between, on the one hand, from the algebraic perspective, you have a ring with a bigger grading group. It has a bigger group action on it. It somehow wants to be, you want more structure there. And on the other hand, the literature wasn't bearing that out in some sense. And I first saw the kind of idea about where the tension came from, really articulated by McLagan Smith in their paper where they explored multi-graded Castle-Nouble-Mumford regularity. And implicit in that paper is the idea that the kind of the right parallel between the classical story, where the geometry of projective space corresponds to the algebra of this. Corresponds to the algebra of the z-graded polynomial range is that the geometry of X needs to be understood in terms of the algebra of the pair S and B. And in the standard graded case, I mean, the maximal ideal just plays such a fundamental role in cumulative algebra that it kind of went without saying in the projective case. But when the irrelevant ideal becomes something more complicated, when it's not the maximal ideal, Not the maximal ideal, you know, we don't have as clear notions. I mean, said another way, you open up a commutative algebra book, you see theorems that refer to things about a graded ring in the maximum legal all over the place. And we've kind of developed a really robust theory for minimal free resolution, Nakiyama's lemonos, all these things we understand in terms of that pair, the graded polynomial ring and the maximal ideal. Ring in the maximal ideal. But in this relative setting, the algebraic tools aren't well adapted to understanding how to study a more complicated pair where you still have a polynomial ring with a complicated grading, but where you're trying to replace the role of the maximal ideal with some more complicated irrelevant ideal. And so MacLagan Smith showed that fairly convincingly, I find that for this notion That for this notion of Castle Nuovo-Mumford regularity, which I don't want to get into, it's not so relevant to my talk, but it's like an effective version of Ser vanishing. It tells you vanishing facts about a sheaf. They showed that if you wanted to understand it in a multi-graded setting, you needed to really kind of fundamentally reconceive what you expected from the invariant and its interaction with other objects. And its interaction with other objects. So, it was, you know, in the standard graded setting, the regularity has certain properties where it relates free resolutions and sheet cohomology vanishing. And they showed that you somehow have to rethink what you meant by free resolutions and by those sorts of relationships if you wanted to get a good working theory of it. And that idea that the right algebra for understanding. For understanding these multi-graded or toric settings is the algebra of the pair. That, I mean, that we've kind of seen more of in recent years, too. So, there's a paper of myself with Christine Burkish and Greg Smith that argues that if you want to use syzygies to understand geometric information, its minimal free resolutions are not the right thing to do because those somehow insist upon too much exactness. Insist upon too much exactness. You instead want to replace them with something that's more tailored to the pair of the ring and the irrelevant ideal. And kind of paper in that vein. And that's led to some breakthroughs in using syzygies to understand geometric embeddings, geometric objects in other torque varieties. And another very recent paper of a group of grads. Of a group of grads and postdocs, actually, Juliet Bruce, Lauren Heller, and Mahrud Sarafi, shows that in the setting of where the irrelevant ideal is more complicated, the notion of a linear resolution sometimes isn't the right one. You have to have what they call a quasi-linear resolution that incorporates data from the irrelevant ideal into the The irrelevant ideal into the structure if you want to find analogs of classical theorems about linear resolution. And so they have a really nice paper that just came out that's in this menu. But the kind of overarching theme is that you need to understand this algebra of a pair and that that's somehow going to be the foundation for these things. And in doing so, you often have to reconsider what your basic objects are. Instead of free resolution, Are. Instead of free resolutions, you might want something a little more flexible. All right. All right, so let's get down to business. So let me first talk about the multi-graded BGG correspondence. So this is not my own work, I should say. I'll get to the citations in a minute. But so the first thing I'll just point out is this r functor where if you just take the classical r functor, That if you just take the classical r functor and you work in a non-standard graded setting, even where the variables have degrees one, one, and two, and you try to write down what r of the polynomial ring will be. It's not a complex because the fact that you have a variable of degree two means that the kind of the in your formula, the X1 tensor E1 term wants to leapfrog in what would have been the homological degree. Homological degree. And so, what you get is something like a complex of E-modules, but it has a non-standard homological grading. So, you know, that another way. The BGG correspondence exchanges the polynomial grading on S with the homological grading on E complexes. And so, if you start with a non-standard polynomial grading, you expect to get a non-standard. And so, if you want to understand the output of this in the right categorical framework, there are a few options. But one is to just think of it as a differential module, which is just a module with a square zero differential on it. So, you, you know, it's draw like this. D squared is zero in this picture, say, follow the arrows, but you don't insist. But you don't insist that, what's it called? That each arrow just moves one term in homological equipment. Okay, and then if you, so once you get the right categorical framework, you get a very strong analog of the BGG correspondence. So here I'll mention the setup and a precise statement, but there's other ways to phrase it. So we're going to have X and S. So we're going to have x and s as above. e is the causal dual exterior algebra, and we're going to impose an additional grading. This where the grading of the variables is what you see. And then we're going to study the category of differential E-modules. So this is bigger than the category of complexes, except we're insisting that the differential have a particular degree. And so this is an explicit category. And so, this is an explicit category. It's also equivalent to a category of DGE modules. You can, equivalent categories. You can phrase everything in that language too. And then the theorem, which is originally due to Baranofsky and then was generalized by Howell, Hoffman, Wang, is that these BGG functors, the kind of natural extensions of them, make sense. Once you get the categorical setup right, you get a junction of functors, BGG functors. Functors, BGG functors, and you get an equivalence on derived categories, and so on and so forth. And I'll add just a few notes here. I said earlier I was interested in how not just the overarching equivalence of categories, but how some of the more detailed aspects, right? How modules on one side correspond to linear objects on the other. You get equivalence this and that thing, or how invariants move back and forth. And much of that is known here. And much of that is known here too. And it's either explicit or implicit in the work of Baronofsky, Paula, Hoffman, and Wang. And some things are also added in my work with Michael Brown. And I'll add the hypotheses on S can be significantly weakened. So the Hawa-Hoffmann-Wang paper in particular, you don't need S to have come from a toric variety in essence. This is really about a multi-graded set. All right, so we've got a very compelling analog of the multi-graded BGG correspondence. So next, I'm going to switch the order a little, because this is how it works in our work, is we're going to build toric analogs of these tape resolutions. And so let me start by explaining what Eisenbud, Flusted, and Schreier did and how they built a tape. And how they built the tape resolution. So, the basic idea in their work was to bootstrap up from the BGG correspondence. And so, if you wanted to get an explicit one, so they would take a finitely generated module over the polynomial ring, the S module psi, and to build the free res, excuse me, to build the table. The free res, excuse me, the take resolution, they use two essential facts. So, one is that if you take an S module and you truncate it in high degree, then we know a lot about the free resolution. In fact, it turns out the free resolution is linear and is therefore the image of something under one of the L B G functions under the L B G function. And so that's the first bullet point. We really understand what happens when we truncate. Happens when we truncate modules in high degree. And the second thing is that if you have a part of the Tate resolution, the high degree part, say, which is going to be this Rm or Rm at least D part. If you know the high degree part, that totally determines the rest of it. So it determines, that determines the Tate resolution via taking free resolutions of complexes and so on. Of complexes and so on. But so there's, it really uniquely determines what's going on. So we kind of understand what's happening in the high degree part, and the high degree part totally tells us what's happening in the low degree part. And the challenge Michael and I had was that both of those steps fail in really fatal ways when X is not projective space. So when X is a product of projective spaces, there was a theory of Tate resolutions that Eisenbud Schreier and I developed about it. Schreier and I felt it five years ago. But outside of that case, the kind of these two steps, they just totally fail. And so we needed to come up with a new way to approach this. And the idea in the end is somehow very simple. It's captured by, I mean, our idea was that these tape. These tape resolutions should just be a certain, they should arise as a certain Fourier Mukai type pull push where you're pushing onto the exterior algebra factor. So I have quotes around here because I'm taking spec of a non-cummative ring. And that's not, I don't know, it's not something well defined. But this picture somehow gives the idea here. Let me show you the actual answer. So I still have my. Let me show you the actual answer. So, I still have my little motivating picture down in the corner. But the, you know, if you have the motivating picture, you can figure out what the actual definition ought to be because the Fourier Mukai pull-push operation is really a sequence of three operations on categories. So here are my categories. I mean, as with the BGG correspondence, excuse me, actually that. Excuse me, actually, let me back up. I start with coherent sheaves on X, of course. I'm going to want to incorporate this E-module structure. So I'm going to also talk about the category of OXE bimodules. That's up here. And then differential modules are going to be essential because that's where the BGG correspondence land. And so my Tate resolution should also be a differential model. Resolution should also be a differential module. So I need to incorporate that. So that's why here I have the differential modules, again, OXE bimodules. And then here are differential E modules up to home of DOP. And let's see. I guess what do I need to still define here? The key is what the kernel of your Fourier Mukai transform is, and that's just the total Kazul complex. Complex. So I'm going to take the total Kazoole complex, which is with respect to all the variables, just like in the DGG correspondence. And that total Kazool complex makes sense as an OXE bimodule, as long as you're in the category of differential bimodules. It's not, as I've set it up, that's kind of the right setting to think about. On the E-module structure, it's not a complex. it's uh it's it's not a complex it's uh it's only a differential module okay and that sequence tells you uh how to define your your tate resolutions and so i mean it's a very different construction than than the eisenbudd-loysted schreier picture so just just to maybe contrast i mean it's somehow everything that was easy in their approach becomes hard in ours and everything that was hard in theirs becomes easy um in ours Easy in ours. So it's much easier to understand the way in which the Tate resolution. I mean, why does the Tate resolution compute the sheaf cohomology groups? Well, it's built in to how R pi2 low, facts about R pi2 lower star. That part's kind of the easy part. The harder stuff or the explicit aspects, it's the easy in there stuff. All right, and then here's our main theorem about Tate resolutions. It says they exist and they have all the properties you want. So as long as you build it in this way and you're willing to work with differential E-modules instead of complexes, you get a well-defined object. It's minimal, it's free, it's everywhere exact. There's no homological grading, so I can't say it's kind of doubly infinite or anything, but it's Infinite or anything, but it's infinite rank. It's infinite rank, but it has only finitely many generators of any given degree. What else do we have? It combines all the cohomology groups in exactly the same way. So it packages all the cohomology groups of your sheath into a single object, again, viewed on the exterior algebra side. And it subsumes, it kind of resolves R of M in the sense. R of M in the sense that it agrees with R of M in sufficiently ample degrees. So it's somehow an exact, it's an exact completion of R of M in that sense. All right. So just as one example, I worked out a little bit of the Tate resolution of O on the weighted projective stack P112. And the point is that the Betty numbers are the H0. Are the H0 of the twists of O, and the Betty numbers on the left-hand side come from the H2 groups. And so you can unravel it. And if you compute the whole thing, you'll have all the chief cohomology groups of O on this wave projective side. So this is the theorem where it looks like what was happening on projective space. what was happening on Projective Space. The next slide is this feature where you get something new, where the multi-grading is giving you more than what you had before. So this is kind of where I think things get even more interesting. So these sorts of subsets of rays that define the empty set have shown up in a couple other talks already, at least in Alex's talk, I think. So I'll say that a So I'll say that a subset, you know, the remember zero through n are correspond to the variables of the cox ring, which in turn correspond to the rays of the fan. And so a subset is a collection of rays. And I'm going to say a subset is irrelevant if that collection of rays doesn't define a face of the fan. Or more geometrically, say if you look at the vanishing locus of the corresponding. Vanishing locus of the corresponding variables, if that's the empty set on your torque variety. So, like in a product or projective spaces, the irrelevant subsets are the ones that contain all the y variables or all the z variables. And so, what our theorem is, I mean, the next theorem is that not only is this tate resolution exact, it remains exact. Exact even when you kind of restrict to variables in an irrelevant subset. So if you mod out by the complementary variables, that usually won't preserve exactness, of course, on a complex, but it will in this case. It continues to give you exactness. And so the point is that this is a structure which wasn't present on PN. It's a kind of extra. PN. It's a kind of extra layer of exactness and over-exactness. And it's an instance of this philosophy I was pushing that the multi-graded situation should we shouldn't just expect analogs of what happened in the standard graded case. We should sometimes expect more structure. We should get stronger results. And so this is an example of that. We get kind of more from these tape resolutions. And just to make this maybe a little more explicit in one case, it's if you're on a Herzebruck where the variables are, you know, the X0 and X2 are the variables on the base, and these are the ones on the fiber. Then you get a tate resolution in four variables, E0 up to A3, and you can kill any, you know, these two variables, E0, E2, or E1, E3, and the thing remains. And the thing remains exact. It somehow is, it's not only exact, it's somehow built from these exact threads where you mod out some of the variables. So it has this richer and more robust structure. Okay, so unlike the multi-graded BGG correspondence, this part of the story absolutely depends on the irrelevant. Depends on the irrelevant ideal. So the multi-graded BGG correspondence was purely algebraic. It was purely about S and the Kazool dual ring. Here, the irrelevant ideal starts to creep in. And I want to just give a sketch of that. So here I've got, I'm going to take the effective cone of my Herzograph, right? So it's the card group is Z2, and inside of there, I have this effective cone, depending how you draw your picture. How do you draw your picture? So, in this picture, the first quadrant is what I mean by the NEF cone effect, so the ampium, the Nephcone. And so for any ray inside that Nephcone, if you embed by a high multiple or whatever, you get X back. And so what you get is X and the corresponding irrelevant ideal. And in that And in that chamber, I mean, if m is my multigraded S module, I can take the T resolution of M tilde. And I get this thing whose exactness properties are captured by this irrelevant. But I could do something else. I can think of M as being a module on a different toric variety that comes from the other chamber. So when you cross that vertical ray, you get P112. array you get p112 and if you choose the irrelevant ideal where you set x1 to be irrelevant that's like contracting the exceptional divisor um and then the other set of variables to to to would then correspond to the maximal ideal in in the p112 um so if you cross over you can make sense of m as a as a module and this is a sheaf on on p112 in this way um and you can compute the tape And you can compute the tate resolution of it over here. And the point is, these are different, right? They have different exactness properties. On the right-hand chamber, the exactness properties have to do with dividing the variables in one way, whereas on the other, they have to do with dividing the variables in the other way. So multiplication by E1 is exact on the T prime, whereas it doesn't need to be exact on the T. Whereas it doesn't need to be exact on the T. And so the point is something I alluded to earlier, which is both of these Tate resolutions resolve the BGGR of M into an exact differential module, but it can't be unique because we're getting global objects that have different exactness properties. So somehow it's the algebraic operation of passing from Operation of passing from your BGG differential module R of M to this completed tape resolution, it's involving information about the irrelevant ideal in that passage. And you can kind of see it in that way. I mean, curiously, if you turn this idea on its head, it actually has an interesting little corollary, which is knowing the exactness properties of T prime. exactness properties of t prime and t actually tell you some things about the homology of r of m um and so in some sense the homology of r of m sees both chambers of of the the the mauric sense um it involves information from both all right all right um so let me see let me turn now to the the last column which is the balance in resolution Last column, which is the valence and resolution, or our analog of the valence and resolution. So here I'm going to let consider x cross x. X as before is my simplicial torque variety. R is the Cox ring with two sets of variables and the natural grading. And I mean, let me start with the kind of silly idea, which is that the diagonal is the set where xi equals yi. And of course, equals yi. And of course, that's a nonsensical thing to do because xi minus yi is utterly inhomogeneous on the Cox ring. So it doesn't define, doesn't give anything well defined on x cross x. So the plan underlying our resolution is actually a really simple one. We just want to build a module, M delta, whose chiefification is O delta, and where these equations And where these equations make sense. So, we want to build a module where we can basically enforce the equation xi equals yi. And here's how we chose to do it. We took the semi-group ring over t where you adjoin the effective cone. And I'll use chi variables to refer to corresponding elements in the cone. And we're going to grade dig of x chi to the d. Chi to the d in this funny way, but basically, so that we can write the equation xi equals chi to the big xi yi, and that becomes a sensible homogeneous equation on this auxiliary ring. And so our n delta is then, well, now these xi equals y now make sense. And so we can impose these relations on that ring. And if you count parameters, On that ring, and if you count parameters, I've got. Um, well, let me not do this because I didn't prepare it. But if you count parameters, you'll see that the dimension of n delta is exactly what it ought to be: that those n plus one equations are a complete intersection, and the amount of dimension you've added to the effective cone, but then subtracted with those equations is exactly what you need. And so you get a module. Turns out you get a module which defines the O delta. O delta. And so our resolution is we're just going to resolve this module m delta as an R module over the set of variables, the packs of x cross x. And it has a fairly concrete structure. So I'll explain the structure in a minute. But the theorem is that this resolution of m delta is in fact, if you look at the corresponding complex. If you look at the corresponding complex of sheaves, it's a resolution of O delta. So it's a resolution of the diagonal. It's a resolution of the type that I really like, which is F is actually a free complex. So F delta is all sums of line vials. So it does not equal the Elizabeth's resolution. I'll relate it in a moment. But everything in sight is just every term in F is a sum of line bundles. So it's kind of very simple in the algebraic category. In the algebraic category, it's a free resolution. We can say very concretely what it is as just a module. What it looks like is for each D, you get a box product of a truncated Kazoole complex and a free factor of S of minus D. The maps, if you work them out, are all linear. I'll show a few examples in a moment, but I have to put linear in quotes here because it's Linear in quotes here because it's not totally clear what linear means in these non-standard graded situations, but they're linear in the sense that all the maps are just involved variables or combinations of the variables, depending on your basis. You can realize this complex via the multigraded BGG functors we saw earlier. I won't give that definition, but there's an equivalent one. And I'll note here, if you want to relate it to And I'll note here: if you want to relate it to Bailinson's resolution, the point is the truncated Kazoolet complex Ki of I has homology isomorphic to omega I of I. It's a co-resolution. And so if you kind of go through it and you do a little few minor adjustments, you can easily relate this to valence and resolution. But it's not, it's even in the case of projective space, it's not the same. The case of projective space is not the same. Everything here is, it started with a free resolution. So everything here is a sum of black box. All right, so here's some examples. So it generally has infinite rank, though, though you can usually find a subcomplex that is also a finite subcomplex. That's a free resolution. So on P13, the resolution looks like this. I've kind of bolded the I've kind of bolded the terms where you get a negative three in the second factor. So it's a certain truncated Kazul complex. There's your truncated Kazoole complex, box with S of minus three. If you look at the differential, it's this kind of very explicit differential. Here, if I want to trim it down to some Here, if I want to trim it down to something finite by getting rid of things which don't contribute to the homology, I get this. I've just basically what I've done is I've removed the terms where K D of D was quasi-isomorphic to zero. I've removed those chunks. So, obviously, if D is very large, you get the whole Kazul complex. It's just zero. So, if you remove that, then you get this picture. And this is the resolution of Kananako and Kart from. Resolution of Kananako and KARC from over a decade ago. They worked out a resolution of weighted projective stats. And you can see it's here as you get this explicit differential. All the entries are linear. And it's somehow, if you think of the rows as corresponding to generators, it's somehow insisting that x0 equals y0, right, in some sense. Right, in some sense. And so that's how it was making those equations work. Okay, let me do that. Let me just, there's a couple more examples. Here's what you get on P112. Again, this is a kind of an Ako-Karp example. Let me maybe move on. So we have a conjecture that you can find always at least, I mean, one way this differs from Balinson's. I mean, one way this differs from Bailinson's resolution in a way that we're unhappy with is that the projective dimension of f does not equal the dimension of x. There's a gap between the two. And so we conjecture that there's always at least one subcomplex of f where the projective dimension of g is the dimension of x, which is the shortest it could be. Could be, and where it's also obviously a resolution. And so, this sort of trimming F down to a smaller complex, trimming the free F to a smaller thing. I mean, that was somehow the central question in the virtual resolutions setting. And so our conjecture can be rephrased in that language. But I'll say we've found a bunch of them. I mean, we don't have a, you know, we don't know of any counter. We know of a number of examples of no counter. So on a Herzebruck, So, on a Herzebruck, you can find a resolution that's length two, that's the dimension of the Herzebrick surface, and you know, here's some explicit map. All right, so that's maybe what we view as the big open question about this is, yeah, what sorts of subcomplexes remain resolutions? And in that sense, we shouldn't expect, I would say, a single. Expect, I would say, a single analog of valence in resolution somehow. And even on a Herzebruch, you can find different incomparable trimmed complexes that act the same way. So we shouldn't expect a single answer necessarily. All right, there's a valence. Once we have this, we can build a valence and monad functor. It's explicit in the same way. It in the same way the functor we saw earlier was. So it just sends omega twisted by d to this truncated Kazul complex. And one of our results, this has the same properties you want from a sort of Balanson monad functor. You can explicitly then build certain Balanson-type monads for sheaves, where instead of the omegas, you're building them out of these truncated Kazool complexes. I don't know. I don't know. This is the picture of what you go. You send it to these various truncated Kazool complexes. No, things are more complicated here because, for instance, this one, the U of omega E twisted by one, that's a complex which has homology in two spots. It's not even quasi-isomorphic to a sheet. So the building blocks can be a little more complicated. All right, the picture we. All right, the picture we saw earlier relating BGG, Tate, and resolution of the diagonal, that we have the exact same analog here. So you can understand from the multigraded BGG correspondence, our Tate resolutions kind of extend them to exact differential modules. From the Tate resolutions, you can explicitly get these Bayless and monads. From that k, the kernel of our Fourier-Mukai transform, you can build the resolution in a natural functorial way. So it all kind of fits into a diagram exactly like the classical picture. Let's see. So what have I got? I don't have much time. So let me do a few applications and then we'll do questions. So again, I started by saying I was interested in I was interested in this as it applied to geometry of syzygy type things. And so, at the heart of that theory for PN is this idea that the syzygies of a module, the free resolution of the module, are closely related to co-homological properties of the corresponding sheaf. And an open question in the multigraded setting is how that Is how that connection plays when you pass to a non-standard graded polynomial ring or a multi-graded polynomial ring or things like that. And without getting into the details, I'll say the answer is it's more subtle, but this theory of Tate resolutions lets us move information between these two sides. So the homology of R of N captures the Betty numbers or the syzygies of N. Numbers or the syzygies of M. And the Tate resolution of M tilde captures the sheaf cohomology. And so by having a framework where those two come into contact that allows us to really explicitly relate sheaf cohomology information to syzygies. And in particular, if we have enough positivity in the picture, if M tilde, if we get cohomological vanishing, higher cohomology of M tilde, Vanishing, higher cohomology of M tilde vanishing in a certain range, then we can get new results about what the free resolution of M looks like. And so as a sketch of an example, if you're on a Herzebruck and you have enough positivity, you can prove that the syzygies of your module come from this very limited range, this kind of range captured by this small little polytope. So those are the sorts of theorems we can get. So, those are the sorts of theorems we can get where what's possible for the syzygies is controlled by properties of the sheath, and the proofs that relate those go through the proofs that relate the Tate resolution to the BGT picture. All right, this one, I don't know, maybe this one is too much to wedge in at the end. But if you know about Mark Green's work from the 80s, I mean, the phrase geometry of scissors. I mean, the phrase geometry of syzygies, I think, really started in relation to what he was doing with what are the syzygies of smooth curves in projective space? And what does that tell us about special invariance on the curves? And how do the theorems about those syzygies generalize classical theorems of Sablovo and Petri and Mumford about varieties being cut out into quadratics? And so one of his famous theorems is that if you Is that if you embed, ooh, I forgot a key hypothesis here. I need the degree of L to be sufficiently large. But that if you embed a curve in a very positive way into a projective space, then you get really nice results on the syzages, you get linearity of syzies. And so this theory of Tate resolutions has allowed Brown and I, and this is work in progress that hopefully it'll be out soon. That hopefully it'll be out soon. We'll see, probably by Christmas, to give an analog of some of Green's results for weighted projective spaces and some other spaces. So we're starting to, again, I said at the beginning, I'm interested in these kind of geometry of Syzygy's results, and we're starting to have the tools we need to generalize some of the foundational results in that area. And then the last, I think this is my last slide, I'll mention. Last slide. I'll mention an application to computation. This is kind of a fun one. On PN, we have this formula where the sheaf cohomology groups are computed by the tate resolution, by the generators of the tate resolution. And so the upshot is if you can compute the tate resolution of a sheaf, then you know all the sheaf cohomology groups. And the reason this might be a good idea to The reason this might be a good idea to do is: well, Grogner basis algorithms are slow over the polynomial range, but they're not slow over an exterior algebra, because over an exterior algebra, there's no such thing as a degree blow-up. There's no high-degree elements. So you don't have to worry about the sort of complexities that arise for Grogner computations over the symmetric algebra. And so Eisenbud, Floystad, and Schreier had used this formula and introduced methods. And introduced methods for computing the Tate resolution as a way to speed up how Macaulay-2 computes sheaf colonology groups on projective space. And so Brown and I have done the same thing for weighted projective spaces, though we've had to use here, you have to use we can't use algorithms off the shelf because you've got to use minimal free resolutions in this broader category of differential modules. But even so, we've got there. But even so, we stop there. All right, let me stop here and thank you all for listening. Questions? I'd like to ask a quick question then. Hey, Andre, how are you? Good. Are you there? I thought you were there. Okay. Yeah, I'm there. I'm there. Yeah. Yeah, I'm there. I'm there. Yeah, what's up, Andre? I know that this is probably a stupid question, but if you have a sheep on PM cross PN on a product of two projective spaces, you can calculate its cohomology using your new algorithms, thinking about it as a bi-graded module, or you could embed it into some large P bigger and using the Segre embedding and compute the Using the segregary embedding and computer cohomology using the old algorithm. Wait, but be careful. Because on the old one, you're only doing it with respect to the O of one you've embedded by if you do it on the embedded. So it's doing it with the, you know, if you're doing it in the big, if you embed into a new projective space, it's just the twists of that ample bundle you're getting with respect. Right. Let's say I didn't care about the twists. I only wanted to pronounce. About the twists. I only want to know the cohomology of my original sheaf. Would your algorithm be more efficient? I don't know. I mean, these efficiency questions are hard because, of course, they depend so much on the implementation. And I'm not an expert at, you know, I mean, we've coded some of these things up, but it's hard to know. And a lot of things with Grogner base, even with the Eisenbud-Fluisted-Schreier one, there are always examples where the old traditional. Where the old traditional algorithms I dumped on as being slower actually be, you know, so it's a complicated, it's complicated, which is always faster. Okay, but that said, generally in my experience, it's faster to work without re-embedding because the cost of re-embedding just makes the module so much more complicated. It goes from some simple, you know, even, you know, if you imagine just the free module. If you imagine just the free module and the line bundles on your space, when you embed, you get all these equations, and it's just a much more complicated ring. The ambient ring has many more variables, and you have many more relations. And so, in my experience, re-embedding never helps. It's you want to do it on the kind of original rate. All right, thanks. Yep. Other questions? I guess I have a couple questions. Yeah, go for it. So, for the first one, it seems like this naturally generalizes to linear algebraic group actions. I t quotients of that by on vector spaces. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, okay. And a lot of people too. So our resolution, I don't have a statement in that vein, but it wouldn't surprise me if someone could show that something like that works for much more general. much more general, much more general. Multi-graded settings where you're removing a sort of the appropriate semi-stable. You know, I mean, there's probably some version that someone else could push in that vein too. Okay. And then the other thing is you can think of the R join, the effective cone. Yes. In terms of, okay, well, you have the torus that acts on the affine space. The torus that acts on the affine space, right? And the G-I exposure of that torus is your projective torque variety, yes, or whatever torque variety. So the space you describe is in some way a partial compactification of the torus cross the space. Yes. Right? And the effective cone is one natural one because everything sort of extends if you're projective, because it's strongly convex. Your projective because it's a strongly convex cone, right? But then you could take the NEF cones of the individual chambers and get different ones. Um, yes, uh, although that's not really the right thing to do, it seems. Yeah, I mean, the problem, so the key tension we run into is if you want to work algebraically, you can't truncate, you can't take a module and truncate it in only nef degrees because you have variables that leave that nef cum. That leaves that NEF cone. So, like, taking a module and writing the direct sum of D that are in the NEF cone, M sub D, is not a sensible algebraic thing. And yet, if it were, it'd be so much easier because we could do everything with respect to the NEF cone. So that's somehow the central tension is the algebra wants to prioritize the effective cone, whereas the geometer in me wants to prioritize the NEF cone. And so when they line up, it's much easier. It's much easier to make headway. Easier to make headway. And when they don't line up, somehow there's this there's always this tension in the construction between, you know, anything algebraic somehow has to involve the whole effective column. And then you're letting problematic things in. I don't know if that makes sense. No, no, that makes a lot of sense. I guess one more thing, and then perhaps we'll close. Are there kind of mutation-like formulas? kind of uh mutation-like formulas for the different take resolutions and chambers and some of how you that's my dream i would love to i don't know how to do it but i would love i mean i would love to see i'd love to see explicit with the with the resolutions i'd love to see that at the resolution level too that you have an explicit resolution on one chamber and you understand exactly how the kind of how the right subcomplex of our F changes from chamber to chamber. I would love to see that. A chamber, I would love to see that, and I don't have it, but you know, I'm always an optimist, I think those things have to, maybe one of you will find it, you know. So, yeah, I would love to see that. Well, thank you very much. It was a great question. Thanks again for the opportunity to be here. I've really enjoyed it. Let's think in so we are away until lunch, and then we. Lunch and then we will return with Frederico's talk Federico's talk at two okay thank you.
