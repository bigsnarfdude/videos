So, I will speak about categorical and geometric aspects of the theory of Art and Schelter algebras and non-commutative algebras in general. So, the categorical I will speak first about my preprint in Max Planck Institute 30 years ago. Institute 30 years ago. There's some conjecture there. And so I will try to give some perspectives in terms of, I mean, by giving some conjectures. So we will see maybe some of these conjectures after 30 years already solved. So you let me know then. Okay. So the idea is that. The idea is that the deformation, non-commutative deformation, well, we know that if you have an algebraic variety, then typically its non-commutative deformation makes no sense in terms of algebraic geometry. So we should deform something else. And that idea is that instead of x, we should consider some category related to this x. It could be either category of coherent sheaves over x, or you can go further and consider direct category of. Derived category of cognitive shifts. Let me just denote by dx because there is a way instead of cognitive, you might also consider quasi-coherent shifts. And sometimes you do, you should do it. And here you also can consider various categories you can put here: D Coch of UCO, E of UCOC. And the idea is that instead of Is that instead of deforming a variety, you deform the category, either this one or that one? So, this is the main principle which I try to push forward in that preprint in Max Planck Institute 30 years ago. And it looks like now it becomes popular. So if. So, if somehow non-commutative variety is a category with suitable homological or other conditions which makes it similar to X. We will see how it works, say, for projective spaces. And by the way, it gives something which is slightly different from Art and Schelter algebras. Even though sometimes it's the failure. So, given such a well, first observation. Well, first observation is that whether you deform this category, or I mean, this is a billion category, this is a stringulated category, but we can see this with DG enhancement. But somehow deformations of this, at least infinitesimal deformations, give you the same as this category. And that means that in particular, we can consider some other abelian category A and And such that the derived category of A is equivalent to this one, and then the non-commutative deformation of A and of X is basically the same. So then if you interested in what is deformation? I mean, in deformation, we have a deformation space, and the deformation space. And the deformation space we will consider infinitesimal, so it will be some algebra R such that the radical of R finite dimensional, say a local algebra or local meaning quotient by the radical of R is just the field, and everything over the field and the field for. Everything over the field, and the field for me will be algebraically closed of characteristic zero. So you can think of just complex numbers. So this is the spectrum of this algebra is the space of deformations. Deformation space. So we're speaking about because it's finite dimensional, it's kind of infinitesimal deformations only, but I will say something about, so to speak, real global deformations as well. So what is in categorical terms? What is the deformation of some category? Let me start from my billion category. So it's this one or this one. this one or this one uh so then this was uh written down in the paper by in the paper by uh leuven vandenberg so basically you need to fix um map from r to the endomorphism of the identity functor of your kitchen Entity functor of your category. OMS should be taken in the category of funders. So it means that it's natural transformation from identity funder to itself. So if you're given some object, say M in your category, so we start from abelian category E A and it shows here some object. How should I denote it? Object, how should I denote it? P because A is typically algebra for me. So let's take an object C, then any element R gives you some element in the endomorphism of this object A. Let's denote it by lambda R. We may ask why R should Uh, we may ask why are yeah, when I say I mean here commutative algebra. Uh, why did I require it to be commutative? Because in fact, this home space is an algebra, of course, and it's a commutative algebra. So, in that sense, deformations of categories always have commutative base, but that's not true about deformations of But that's not true about deformations of objects in the category. Deformation space may be non-commutative, and this is some relatively recent development. We have some paper with Agneshka Bodziento on this subject. But today, mostly it will be commutative deformation space. So, what is non-commutative is X becomes non-commutative. So, somehow you have a family. You should think about this as a family. We have a spectrum of R. We have Of R. You have here a family of categories. So one, the central fiber of the is our original category X. And this is some A, some abelian or derived category G of A, G of X, G of A. And then over this commutative base, we deform this category, and you got something which is non-commutative. Which is non-commutative. So we should think if you take this R, so to speak, maximal, though, of course, it wouldn't be finite-dimensional, it should be some pro-finite completion in the formal neighborhood of this point. But in general, you can think about this as M and C non-commutative, I mean, the variety which parameterize all deformations of our category. So, but of course, there is some. There is something, I mean, just giving this morphism is not enough to say that it's a deformation because we would like to avoid something situation like this. For instance, you have, say, this variety, which is over here. So this is curly X. This X is embedded in it. This is non-commutative, right? Over our base, which is in this case, the spectrum of R. In this case, the spectrum of R or M and M and C b M non-commutative. So you would like to avoid this example where you have, say, across the non-commutative M or commutative MNC is just a line, and you can consider this project because it's not flat. Somehow, you should not expect that line degenerates into a point. It's not a flat deformation. It's not a flat deformation. So there is some condition that this is a flat deformation. And well, maybe I skip the definition. There is some. Basically, the idea is that some functor should be exact. Anyway, let me skip it. Now, we can ask, so given a So, given a category, let's try to construct this non-commutative model as a space of its deformations. How we can describe it, or at least the infinitesimal neighborhood of this point, meaning those which are covered by all these R's, all R's, not just particulars. And the answer is the following. One should consider Hogsheet code chains. Code chains code chain chains, code chains. I always forget that from A to A. This is a DG algebra, but in fact, we should consider it not just as a DG algebra, but as a DG Lie algebra, how it's called L L infinity or homotopy Lie algebra, something like this. DG Lie algebra, all the same words. All the same rules. Yeah. What's your answer? Okay. Okay. Algebra. And if we have such a DGL algebra, let's call it L, then we can consider something. Something formal deformations which are related to this L, and these are given by solutions of Maureen-Cartan equation. So we should consider something like well so M C of L. Of L calculated on such an algebra Rhine here. So you should consider alpha, which belongs to R tensor. Tensor L dot. Well, it's L dot because I mean it's graded and you should consider in this tensor product. Well, R in general could be also DG algebra, commutative DG algebra, but let's consider just more simple way. So it's elements here in R tensile L1, degree one component of the Leo Edigu Liab. component of the digital algebra and the relations that dl alpha it's Maurer-Cartan equation and this is zero so the solutions modula some equivalence relation more or less obvious these are some modulated space which we can assign to just the Digital algebra. Just the DGL algebra. We will change this DG algebra for another one later. And some, I mean, I will consider other versions, I mean, other deformation problems. There will also be de George, but I think this goes back to maybe Deline and Greenfield to this kind of approach. So the point is that this The point is that this infinitesimal moduli space is given just by these solutions. I mean, those which corresponds to given R, when the spectrum of R is the deformation space for our non-commutative deformations. So then there is a statement which is due to, I think it's Konsevich. I think it's Konsevich and Tamarkin that this DG algebra is actually formal. Sorry, A was what? A was algebra. Sorry, let me be category. A. So now we consider this category, coherent sheets. Category coherence is or actually, this is well defined in terms of just derived category. So it's an invariant of derived category, so this deformation theory is independent of the choice of the abelian category. So now if you consider the derived category of x. Then this Lie algebra L dot of D this L dot depends on A or better to say of D of A. So this algebra is formal. Formal means it's quasi isomorphic to its It's quasi-isomorphic to its cohomology as a Li-DG algebra. Cohomology will be just a gradient algebra where differential is trial. So we need to calculate this cohomology, say, for this category, to understand what are non-commutative deformations of an algebraic variety. And that's what I did in that preprint, that cogomology of this digital algebra. Algebra, which is called, I think it's called Oxford cohomology of G of X. Maybe I should put only one A here. It's X the out anyway. So maybe I can. I mean, the point is that we should consider our category as a bimodule over it. Our category is a bimodal over itself, and that's what I mean when I write here. So, this cogomology is actually say kth cogomology is equal to the sum of h i of cognology of x as a variety with values in the exterior wage product of the tangent bundle to x. tangent bundle to x and the sum is i plus j equals to k the calculation is by looking on the diagonal and push forward the structure shift of the diagonal to x itself and some spectral sequence degenerates so this is the answer let's see yeah now if you have this Yeah, now if you have this DG algebra, so the first consequence of the formality is that we can consider just cognitive algebra and then differential is true, right? Because algebra is quasi-isomorphic to the cogomology algebra. So we just need to look at elements of degree one and put this condition. Ah, yes, I maybe. Put this condition. Ah, yes, maybe I forgot to say. Yeah, yeah, I assume X is a smooth algebraic error, so forth. But I should consider shift by one here and here. Somehow, because we deform not objects but categories, this shift by one comes up. This shift by one comes up. It has deep homotopy meaning, but I would write this. So let's see what is it in this case. So our alpha is now an element in HH1 and HH1 of X is just H but of degree one, and we shift it by one. So together. And we shift it by one, so altogether it's a shift by two, right? I mean, here we should consider elements of degree one, but we also shift it by one. So it's about shift by two. So this alpha is actually an element in H H2 of X and H and H H two of X according to this formula. According to this formula, is h0 of x wage squared of tangent bundle plus h1 of x in the tangent bundle and plus h2 of x in all. So we should take our alpha from here, and you see here is three components, and we know that this component, according to Codier-Spencer theory, is responsible. Kodiro-Spencer theory is responsible for commutative deformations of our variety. But you have two other pieces, this and this one, which corresponds to non-commutative deformations of our variety or category. And this one is the so-called Jerby deformations. Typically, they exist only infinitesimally, at least if you consider coherent shifts. If you consider the coherent. Coherent shifts. If you can say the quasi-coherent shifts, you can make some job perturbation of your category, and then the category of quasi-Kagirian shifts will deform, but it wouldn't have a compact subcategory of Kagirian shifts in it, only for some particular points in this. So these are directions of non-commutative deformations, right? So we have this space which I denoted by M and C. By M and C. And by the way, this decomposition, if I remember correctly, is not canonical. Or maybe you can make it canonical, but somehow there is more filtration with these graded factors, which you can. So you have this point in non-commutative deformations, which corresponds to our variety x, the derived category of x itself. And then this is the tangent space to the deformations. According to this, you can see. According to this, you can see that this is a quadratic equation. So the Zariski tangent space is just this space. So we have these three types of deformations. One correspond to commutative, this corresponds to gerbed deformation. And now what is this? What I want you to say about this. All right, that if you consider this direction, say is from here, then you have. Then you have a curve, say, along this guy, and only some points are actually give you some sort of deformations of your category. And it was in one of the talks here. It was the case when, I mean, these are categories of modules on Adzumaya algebras, sheaf of Azumaya algebras over our X. That's a typical example when you have, say, Big center. These are the case of big centers, but they are kind of discrete. No continuous families. Big center of the algebra, which if you deform in terms of algebra, then the algebra should have very big center. The algebra should be finite over its center. So this is this case. If you want to make it continuous, you need to consider bigger category quasi-coherent shifts, and then you can. Quite the coherent sheaves, and then you can deform the corresponding jerk. Now, this is commutative deformation. What is this? Let's denote P, an element in here, and P is, of course, because of Poisson, because, well, when I said it's identified with this guy, I didn't say what is the Lie algebra structure here. And it came from scout and break it. So on lambda.tx on sections on. On sections of this, of this, it is called polyvector fields, and there is this how to unbreak it on this polyvector fields. So, in particular, if you take just sections of the tangent bundles vector fields, then you just commute them. And then you can extend this bracket to a gradient Lie algebra structure on the whole guy basically using the Leibniz rule. The redness rule. So, if you look, this is if you consider this formal algebra, then differential is already trivial. So, we have this alpha-alpha commutator alpha-alpha by means of Halton bracket is zero. So, the condition is p Halton is zero. And this is actually an element in which cube of Tx, I mean global section. So, our condition. Condition, which you can, I'm sure you already guessed, is that P is a Poisson bracket for Poisson bracket in terms of polyvector fields, you have some p which is locally could be written something like. could be written something like p i j some functions on our x in some coordinates d x i wave dx j the Poisson algebra structure comes from here and then this condition is exactly that this is Poisson algebra I mean the one which is given by this so P is a Poisson bracket so you have commutative deformations so say this is So say this is corresponding varieties M commutative. We have this non-commutative Gerby deformations and we have this Poisson break deformations which are basically this conference are is about. So now right well there is a bit of a Right. Well, there is a bit of more structure here. Somehow, in general, if you have this story, so the abstractions, they lie actually, this is in degree two. So here it becomes degree three because of this shift. So, but in general, you have this Lie algebra, you have typically the tangent space is given by cohomology of the first. Of the first homology of this algebra, and the abstractions are in the second homology. But there is also zeroth homology, and the zeroth homology is the tangent space to it's the Lie algebra of automorphisms. So h zero of this L is always a Lie algebra. Of auto equivalencies, better to say auto equivalencies of our variety of our category D. For instance, in this algebra, when we deform algebraic, I mean, this is general theory, you can consider whatever triangulated dg categories. So, but in this particular case, when v is dx, we can again use this. We can again use this formula and we see that h0 of our algebra L is what? It's one degree less than this. So it's H0 of X in Tx plus H1 of X or so if you look on that our equivalences of this category DX that Category DX that the connected component of the unit consists of two kinds of autoequalities of this category. You can take some line bundle L and twist with the line bundle. So line bundle, you can consider functor. So if you have L a line bundle. Then it gives you some phi L, and out equivalence, which is just twist with this line bundle. Because it's an invertible sheaf, you'll get an outer equivalence. And then tangent space, yeah, I mean, line bundles are described by Picard group of x. Picard group of x is basically just h1 of x in top of x. H1 of x into OX cross invertible functions. And this is the tangent space to this one is exactly this second piece, right? So list by line bundles are given by, I mean, are described in this algebra by this piece. But there is also automorphism of the right x. And the tangent space to this one would be vector fields, which is h0 of xt. Which is H0 of XT. Yes. Okay? So it fits the commutative story as well. Now, let's now come to Woisson brackets. So now we see from all this story is that Woisson brackets, I mean, first. Poisson break. I mean, first of all, the tangent space to this, let me write it again. So, tangent space to M non-commutative deformation moduli space of our variety X or derived category of X. Well, this is probably already written is this one is H H two of X and uh And so it's a risky tangent space. But we have this quadratic conditions, which for again in algebraic geometry, they look like non-algebraic geometric condition, right? Because it's possible. I mean, it's this bracket is differential geometric. It's not algebraic geometric. But nevertheless, it's some quadratic condition. So our moduli space looks like this. We have this point, which quite often is single. Point, which quite often is singular. The tangent space is given by this, but here you have a quadratic cone and this quadratic tangent quadratic cone. And this tangent quadratic cone is exactly Poisson brackets. So P are elements on this guy. And in particular, it shows, for instance, that the moduli space cannot be spectrum. I mean, it could be a scheme. I mean, it could be a scheme, right? And this spectral, say, this M and C is never a spectrum of K of T modula T cube because this is a cubic relation. And we have only a quadratic relation, and our modulus spaces just somehow propagate in the direction of this quadratic column. I mean, I said this is a tangent space to auto-equivalences, you know. I mean, actual automorphism give you auto-equivalences by pullback. If you have phi from x to x, an isomorphism. an isomorphism of X. Then you have a functor F upper star. If you have shift from here, you can pull back it. So it's auto equivalence. From automorphism, you got out not necessary. Yeah, it is discrete for PN, right? But in general, say for a billion varieties, it's not. Yeah, what we have for PN, we basically, this part is trivial. This part is trivial, this part is trivial, and this part is trivial. So, but the point is that this picture, I'll come back to this picture, okay? This picture is a little bit too defiant because for the reason, exactly because of this, because of this, not even this out equivalence group. Auto equivalence group makes our This point, very sticky, one and say if x is a projective space, indeed, we have a lot of out, say, a lot of automorphism, right? This part is big. So it's a sticky point. It's not just a point, but up to this detail, it's okay. Yeah, yeah, these equations are quadratic. These equations are quadratic, or these equations. If you kill this, this is purely quadratic equation. So that's why it's purely quadratic code. That's if you, yes, that's okay, right? So, um, what I mean this, right now, I want to transfer to Poisson brackets, and I will start with Poisson brackets on a projective space. So, one point is that so tangent space Poisson brackets is a tangent space to the cone not space. Space to the cone, not space, the tangent cone to real non-commutative deformations, right? Now let our X is projective space Pn. Then, as I already said, we have this H H two of X is just It just consists of Poisson brackets. I mean, by vectors, better to say. And then we have this condition. The rest is, so we don't have commutative deformations of PN, we don't have job deformations, only this one. Now, I want to explain how it's related to how Poisson, there is no title of the conference, but I want to say. I want to say why Poisson brackets are related to Art and Shelter algebras, and in fact, not quite Art and Shelter algebra. So the point is, so when we there's many things to say, right, maybe I just say some statement. Say some statement. So, what is projective space? Assume it's projectivization of some vector space v of dimension one greater, so n plus one dimensional vector space. Then the claim is that you can lift, so you have a map, say by definition of the projective space, we have a map from v minus zero. I mean, we can say this just as some v is a fine variety, remote origin, and then. remove origin and then it projects with C cross to one to the projective space POV right that's a standard way to construct projective space so we have say Poisson bracket here because we want to deform projective variety but if you have a Poisson bracket here some of them you can push forward downstairs and these are those which are invariant with respect to this Invariant with respect to this action. And the claim is, it's again theorem from my preprint, that there is a unique, better to say, unique canonical unimodular, right? There is a unique unimodular lifting. Of p. I mean, p is the wage squared, a Poisson bracket of x, which is projected space in our case, maybe n U unimodal lifting of P Poisson of P Poisson to unit. To a person bracket bracket on on V minus zero, but you know, zero is such a small, so just on V itself. You can always extend it to the whole V. Is extended to the whole V. And this will be this Poisson bracket because it's convariant with respect to cis direction. This actually means that it's a quadratic bracket. So there is a canonical lifting to a quadratic bracket on V. And then we can think about deformation theory, which quadratics. So we can think how it was arching and Um, how it was Artin and then Artin Jean is Jean wrong. Yes, why did you undermine my sleeping tonight? Um, so so we can deform say category of Kekirian chiefs on X, it's due to on PM according to. Sir is the coefficient of the category of Kajerian shifts of graded model. You can say Kagerian shifts on C cross and C cross invariant Kagerian shifts on V mod a subcategory of Kagerian shifts torsion shifts. Its geometric description torsion C cross on V So it's C cross means they are equivariant if shift is equivalent with respect to C's direction and it's torsion, meaning it's fine, it's Artinian shift, then it should be the origin because origin is the only only orbit of dimension zero. So it's geometric description. So this it basically corresponds to this to this thing. You should remove zero and you should mod out cis direction. So you see here cis direction. So, you see here cis direction, and this is basically removing origin in categorical terms. Or you can think about this as the category of gradient modules, finitely generated modules over a polynomial algebra in n plus one variables module as a subcategory of finite-dimensional modules. So, we can think about deforming this category of Paguian shifts on Pn in terms of deforming this algebra as a quadratic algebra and making similar quotient category. Right? The point is that the statement is an infinitesimal version that yes, you can lift any deformation of the A deformation of the projective space to this deformation of this quadratic algebra. Infinitesimal deformations. Globally, maybe not. And we will see that it's actually, say, like on some talk yesterday where there was 20 points. It will never happen in this deformation situation. But I want to stress one point that actually. To stress one point that actually it's not the same. Deform the category and deform this algebra. And the point is that categorically, so we want to deform our category D to some, I don't know, some non-commutative some DQ data, some family of categories. And those categories which you obtain in this way, they actually have extra data. Have extra data. And this extra data is some functor f. I mean, those which come from quadratic deformations of polynomial algebra. These are category D together with some functor F of D tilde, somehow the equivalence of this one, such that the power n plus first power First power of this functor is equivalent to the serf functor of D tub. So we deform not just the, when we deform quadratic algebra, we deform not just a category, but a category together with some n plus first root of the surf anta. If you don't remember, then surf antel is something which on two objects A and B, sorry. B sorry satisfy the rule that home from A to B equals home from B to A, B to S A dual. If such a functor exists on tringulated category, then it's unique up to canonical isomorphism. So quadratic deformations of the Of the polynomial algebra corresponds categorically to this bit strange thing. So, in a sense, one should consider something else. And what I propose to do the same preprint is to consider derived equivalence of Pn with derived category of coherent shifts on Pn with derived category of modules over some finite dimensional algebra. Dimensional algebra and this finite dimensional algebra is an a sigma, it depends on the choice of exceptional collection sigma. So sigma is an exceptional collection. And so you can ask, yes, a sigma is the endomorphism. A collection is just some collection of objects, EI's, and then you can see the endomorphism of the sum of this object. It's the tilting. Of the sum of this object. It's a tilting object. For projective space, a choice could be this sigma is just O on minus n and so on up to O. This is the collection. So in the morphism algebra of this collection, it's a finite dimensional algebra, and our category is direct equivalent. Try to quantify. So, if you want to deform category, you just need to deform this algebra. Well, maybe I had to say that the serf hunter for projective space in general for X, the serf hunter of something is just a tensor product with the canonical class of X shifted by dimension of X. Okay? And then if X is a projective space, X is a projective space, then omega X omega E n is just O of minus n minus one. So the root of it is the functor F in this case is the functor. Let's take a tensor product with O on minus one about the shift. What is it with the shift? Presently the shift. Yeah that there is a sh maybe it's the root of this surf under shifted by one sorry. One sorry, I forgot. I mean, because this number is not divisible by n plus one, right? But altogether, it is. So I guess there's some shift by one present. The point is that if you have a graded algebra, you have, and you can say the category of modules over this graded algebra. You always have a shift. And this shift is exactly this root which. root this root which at categorical level it gives you this root of of the surf one term because the shift by n plus one up to shift right back it gives you anyway up to this shift it's okay and the point is that if you start deforming this algebra yeah maybe I didn't reply your question but Yes, yes. You have a self-under, but you not necessarily have a root of it. So, this theorem claims that infinitesimally you would have a root. But if you consider Arxon Shelter algebra, you will say you might not have this root. Ah no, you do have a stress, right? No, it's another straight. I'm going to speak about it. But it might not exist. That it might not exist. Choice of group. Yeah, maybe we have to discuss it later. Yeah, I didn't think about it. Sorry. So, what I So, what I mean to say is that we have this algebra, it's a finite-dimensional algebra. For instance, for P3, the algebra is the algebra of this clear with three vertices, three arrows here, three arrows here, and you can see the path algebra of the clear. Say this alpha i, this is beta j, and we put relation beta j alpha i is beta i alpha j. This is the endomorphism algebra for n equals. morphism algebra for n equals 2 it's x is e2 and then you just need to deform these relations in this finite dimensional algebra and if it's pn then you have more vertices more relations you can deform them and we developed with poischuk we developed some story where Story where, I mean, from this algebra, or maybe better, even from this collection, you construct, you can construct an infinite collection which is called helix. So it's a replacement of the shift O of I on the projective space. And you can put some conditions on this bigger helix algebra. It's no longer graded in principle. No longer graded in principle. It might be it's Z algebra. So helix algebra is Z algebra, meaning it's actually a category with objects numbered by integers. And morphisms go in the positive direction. So say from this tree, you can go in both directions in a canonical way. You can extend this to some infinite algebra. Some infinite algebra, and on this algebra, you actually have periodicity because of surf fantasy, you have periodicity n or n plus one. But if you deform it, you might not have this one periodicity, because this root corresponds to the one periodicity, the graded algebra is z algebra, one periodic z algebra. And for the case of non-commutative deformations of p2, we check that every deformation. Every deformation comes from this one. But for P3, it's, I guess, not just not true. Actually, I don't know. No, I don't know whether every Z algebra, I mean, we put some conditions, it should be geometric. Geometric means it's casual. It's Kajul, quadratic, casual, Gorenstein algebra. And you can ask the dimensions of the components will be the same as the algebra which corresponds to the shift O of I on the projective space. This would be our replacement for the notion of art and shelter. And as I was explained by Professor Mori yesterday, it's not necessarily true that even if algebra is quadratic. That even if algebra is quadratic and art and shelter, it's not necessarily true that it is casual. So our condition is stronger, but it's purely a homological condition. So for this purely homological condition, you still can ask what are to try to classify them. Classify them. I'm saying that if it's about P2, then still all of them are, you can make grading non-canonically, but you can make some grading, some grading. I mean, you can find this root, but in general, I don't know whether it's true. I mean to say that instead of classifying graded Art and Shelter algebra, we suggest to classify geometric. Geometric means Kajul and Gorenstein algebras where the dimension of these vector spaces of arrows is the same as for symmetric algebra. This would be for us non-commutative deformation of PN. And this problem is still open. And now I want to say about the generations of how much I have Generations of how much is it? Eight million. Ah, okay. So, conjectures. One conjecture is about degeneration loss size. So, assume you have some x, algebraic smooth algebraic projective algebraic variety, and p is a plus one bracket, p in h squared of x. P in which square root of x was on break it. Then we can consider varieties x x k which is the locus of points in x such that the rank of p at the point x is less than or equal to k. I mean, when I see speak about rank of px, maybe here, there's a bivector field, right? At every point, so we can check what's the rank of this bivector as a skew symmetric matrix at a given tangent space or cotangent. It's a bilinear form on the cotangent space. We can ask what is the rank of this guy. And this is the degeneration was high. Regeneration was high. Of course, it makes sense that this only if k is even or it equals just to dimension of x because q symmetric form has even ranked. And you take inequalities such that we would get some post-algebraic sub-varieties. One point why this is better than considering, say, symplectic leaves is that. Symplectic leaves is that symplectic leaves are not necessarily algebraic, and if I remember correctly, even for P3, for some Poisson brackets on P3, symplectic leaves are not algebraic. But this is algebraic because actually we can define this as a scheme. It's better to do not just say about locus of points, but saying that do we have this Poisson break it? And break it, we can, it's a section, so p is a section of the x, so it's a morphism from the structure shift to y squared. We can invert it, I mean, take adjoint. Then we have a map like this, right, to ox. And then we can take k to h power of this k. This would be a morphism from, you can consider it as a morphism from. You can consider it as a morphism from omega to k to ox, and then we can consider the quotient, and the quotient would be some scheme. And the scheme, let's denote it by OXK to k. This is the way how we can make this locus a scheme, it gets a scheme structure. Structure. Now, conjecture is that if X is fine operator, then in fact these operators have big dimension. X funo, which means that the canonical class of X is negative. For instance, for projective space, it's minus n minus one. So at this projective space is a fun override. And the conjecture is that the dimension of xk is greater than k or xk is just x. Of course, xk is a sub scheme of x, it could not have bigger dimension than x itself. What I mean by What I mean by this is that it's a scheme. It might have various components of various dimensions. There should be at least one component of dimension greater than k. So this is, sort of to speak, the first step to the classification problem. If you would prove this, then you can continue. Well, because say if it's T3 surface, then you can you have symplectic form a universe, you get Poisson structure, which has no zeros. For fana surfaces, it's obvious because this is the anti-canonical section. It gives you anti-canonical section, the zero divisor of the anti-canonical. The zero divisor of the anti-canonical section is a curve. So x0 for surfaces is has positive dimension. Already in that, I proved that n-dimensional three and maybe in codimension. Yeah, I mean, there are some statements. Yeah, let me just, I proved that in dimension three. I would not write in most general version. So true. I mean, in dimension one, we don't have Poisson brackets. One, we don't have Poisson brackets, meaning that curse has no non-commutative deformations, only gerby one. I mean, true for a dimension of x less than or equal to three. Even for dimension three, it's not, I mean, say if you consider section of wave squared, I mean, this Poisson break, but not Poisson. I mean, this Poisson break, but not Poisson's condition yet, just section, then it has 20 zeros. But here the claim is, and there are some non-commutative algebras, ultra-central algebras, which we heard on the talk yesterday, which have their 20 point objects, right? But they could not be, according to this statement, they could not. This statement they could not be deformations of a commutative P3. So the proof in dimension 3 already requires some technique. I used bot partial connection now. Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna say this. So through this. So, this was my result in the same preprint, even though I didn't write the proof. True for dimension x less than or equal 4. And this is due to pin and Gautierian pin. So, somehow this condition. So somehow this condition of being Poisson breaking and not just any bivector field put very strong conditions on so say for if x is a is a three-fold three-dimensional variety then then it makes sense to speak only about x0 and x2. x2 is of course the whole x, but x0 is at least a curve. It doesn't mean that it might be also some components of logic. might be also some components of low degree and we know that Poisson brackets which come from I mean Audiski-Fagin Poisson brackets there is an elliptic curve and which is intersection of two quadrics and four other points and for and another example which I guess also Adesky saying when you have elliptic curve which is embedded in the plane in P2 an extra one point oh there was example like in Like in Mikola Moitvichuk talk, where this X0 is like this, and some other talks here, when it's one-dimensional skeleton of the triad. But it's always a curve, at least a curve. It could be actually also for P3, for instance, there is an example when it's a quadric and the line. And the line, the union of a quadric and a line, but at least a curve. Now, next conjecture is that assume x0, that we have a c in x a smooth curve and component. And component X0, connected component. Well, scheme theoretically, how to say. I mean, scheme theoretically, it's theoretically a component. You mean you understand right? No, no, no, nil potent. No new potents. Then conjecture is that the C is an elliptic curve. This would explain, and it's again true in dimension, well, in dimension two, it's again obvious because the section of the anti-canonical class, if it's a smooth curve, it's an elliptic curve. In dimension three, I have proven it. So in dimension dimension of x less than or equal to three it's true in dimension four did they prove it they proved something i mean maybe pim himself he proved some statement that it's with some conditions if i remember about lock lock so probably something true in dimension four but In dimension four, but very open in high dimension, and I must say I believe in this conjecture more and then in this one. And then I wanted to say about non-commutative deformations of the stories related, but you ah, okay. You know, when allowed me to speak at once, so well, maybe I just say a few words. So, this X0 is somehow the somehow the i mean you can deform i mean i spoke about deformations of the categories but we can also ask how object deform the point is if even if your category is deformed flatly even though i didn't understand explain what is a flat deformation there is a notion of flat deformation it doesn't mean that every object will deform also flatly it might disappear and that's exactly the meaning of this Exactly the meaning of this x0. X0 corresponds to points, I mean, points of x0 corresponds to skyscrapers which do have deformations in this non-commutative direction. It's not true in general, but at least it's necessarily conditioned. There's some counterexample by translated W, German name, I forgot. W, German name, forgot, sorry. Well, but it's not about projective spaces. I mean, in principle, it's about linear possible, not linear, quadratic, linear, linear and quadratic. So you consider some SL2 C semi-direct product with C squared. So it's a five-dimensional vector space. You can consider there are some kinds of. Vector space: You can consider there are some quadratic brackets, and then the origin is the zero of Poisson bracket. But nevertheless, the corresponding skyscraper has no deformations. But if I remember correctly, I could not remember this yesterday, tonight, but my impression is true in this situation for projective spaces. That every skyscraper which in X0 does have a deformation. That's one point, and another point. That's one point, and another point which is kind of funnier, you can consider ideal shape, as Shinovsky proposed, right? But if you deform, I mean, people did it. Anyway, I don't know what they did. So what I mean to say that if you deform ideal sheaf, it's not the same as deforming the skyscraper. The ideal shift of points, they do have deformation for surfaces, for instance. Even for surfaces, the skyscraper. Surfaces, the skyscraper might not have, because X0 is a curve, elliptic curve, right? Only this Poisson elliptic curve have non-commutative deformations. But ideally, any ideal shape has a non-commutative deformation in the chosen direction of the Poisson bracket. So somehow you deform non-commutatively your surface, you got something non-commutative. But the claim is that there is still some underlying commutative surface. The model is space of deformations of the skyscrapers. Formations of the skyscrapers, of the ideal shifts. And this curve one is embedded. It's all about this sequence. So you have ideal shift IX of a point, you have OX and you have skyscraper, right? When you non-commutative, so you choose deformation of your category and you deform these objects. The point is that you can deform this one. You can sometimes deform this one. You cannot always deform it, but this always has deformation. Has deformation and so you have curve corresponding to this deformation, but you also have some surface not necessarily the same x, x prime, and c is embedded in x. The point is that when you deform this, that this morphism might disappear. So you don't have quotient object. So you have embedding C of in X, and you also have action of surf hunter skyscrapers are preserved by surf in commutative case, and they are non-preserved. So you have here some sigma, some automorphism of this curve. And this data of this guy, this and this geometric data, at least conjecturally, I can conjecture, it's not conjecture, that it's birationally equivalent to the moduli space of non-commutative deformations of Del Pets' surfaces. And I have no time for the fourth conjecture.
