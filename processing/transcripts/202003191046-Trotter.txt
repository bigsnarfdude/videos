Go, you're off. Tom Frost. Okay. So I want to say a couple of poignant things. It's a sad moment that Richard Guy has passed. Yeah, he will be missed. Here in the States, it's absolutely crazy. It's absolutely crazy. My wife works for CDC and she's on the Emergency Operations Center, working 60 hours a week, taking conference calls 24-7. It's just absolutely crazy. Nobody's going to the campus, so I'm at my home. Yeah. And my house is being cleaned. I'm trying to keep the noise away, but I hope it's not disturbing. Okay, so let me start. So, this talk has to do with analogs between combinatorial properties of posets and familiar ideas for graphs. And all of the stuff we are going to talk about is described in complete. Described in complete detail in two very recent papers that you can find on the archive, but you can also get them from my homepage. The first is a book chapter, which is going to appear in a forthcoming volume, 50 years of Tom Network's Graph Theory and Computing. And the second is going to be in the summarizing volume celebrating his 80th birthday. It's going to be published by Actomath and Garrick. To be published by Actomath and Garifa. So, I'm talking about posets, and even if you don't like them, you know what they are. Here's a poset. And I need a definition, and this is the only one which I'm really going to give you, is that you have a family of linear extensions of a poset, you call it a realizer if the partial order is the intersection of the linear orders. Things are comparable in the poset if and only if the Comparable in the poset, if and only if they're comparable in each of the linear extensions, and then the notion of dimension is the minimum size of a realizer. So, this poset, which I've used a thousand times, has dimension at most three as evidenced by these three linear extensions. And two minutes of thinking about it will convince yourself that the dimension is actually three. Now, I'm going to talk about ramp. I'm going to talk about random bipartite posets, and these are the poset analogs of random balanced bipartite graphs. So I've got two sides. One side is a subset of the minimal elements, the other is a subset of the maximal elements, each of size N. And then you have some comparabilities between A and B. Now, see, if you have no comparabilities, then the whole thing is just one giant integer. But we don't mix A and B. But we don't mix A and B. So those are separate parts, just like the distinction between a bipartite graph and a two-colorable graph. So I know that most of you don't care much about posets. So I just want you to relax. Almost nothing in this talk has anything to do with postets. It just has to do with bipartite muffs. And so don't be turned off by the idea that here's somebody at your graph theory conference talking about slightly different combinatorial objects. This is all about graphs. Okay. All right, so I want to warm up by telling you about a completely solved situation where there are some nice analogies between what goes on in graphs and postets. Okay, start with two. Okay, start with two trivial statements about the chromatic number of a disconnected graph and the chromium number of a connected graph in terms of its chromium number of its blocks. Okay, so now you ask the same thing for posets. You have a poset, it can be disconnected, it's separated into different components, and then it can have blocks, and the blocks are in the diagram, not. Are in the diagram, not the comparability graph, but it's in the diagram. And here's the result. The first one is trivial. The imaginary disconnected poset is just either two, or it's the maximum dimension of its components. And this is a 60-year-old result. And if you start with the basic definition, everybody would prove it in 20 seconds. Okay, but now the theorem that we have with Bartek, who was speaking. Bartek, who was speaking half an hour ago, and with Nurdon Wong done in 2016, is that for every D, if you have a connected postet where the dimension of every block is at most D, then the dimension of the postet is at most D plus 2, and this inequality is best possible. So, of course, there's two parts to this proof. You have to prove that this inequality holds. Have to prove that this inequality holds, and then you have to prove that it's best possible. And neither part of this proof is all that easy. It's quite a nice analogy between dimension and chromatic number. Okay, now that's the last completely solved problem we're going to talk about. Now we're going to dive off to the deep end into stuff where there's Stuff where there's analogies, but there's a little loose ground going. Okay, so here's Brooks's theorem, which everybody knows from kindergarten. If the maximum degree is K, Co-Mach number is at most K plus one. And that's the trivial part. And the non-trivial part, which you teach in an undergraduate graph theory class, is that equality holds even only if it have a clique or a non-cycle. All right, so now there should be a post-set analogy. Analogy, and you talk about maximum degree, and now this time maximum degree is actually in a comparability graph. And so, there's a quite recent result of Alex and David that was first circulated in 2018, but has now just appeared in the transactions. And their result is that the maximum dimension d k among all posets with maximum degree equals k. k satisfies its boundary from above by k times log to the 1 twelfth little o1 times k. Now the proof actually gives a more technical statement. There's an e to the square root log log k as a multiplicative factor. Now this proof surpasses previous results. So the first proof of the existence of this function was done by Rüdelin. Of this function was done by Ryrdel and me in the summer of, I think it was 1983, while we were drinking wine. And we have a quadratic upper bound. Then Fourier and Kahn came along and did a superlinear bound of the form k log squared k. And that proof is historically significant, remains so because it was one of the first applications of the Lovos local number outside of graph theory. Okay, so now along comes. Okay, so now along come Alex and David, and this paper, if you haven't seen it, it's just gorgeous. And they have this really clever, iterated application of the local level. Okay, now, so what can you say from below? And now you have the backup. So with Ergos and Kirsten, we proved almost 30 years ago. Proved almost 30 years ago that the maximum dimension V k on all possess p with delta satisfies it's at least a constant times k log k. So this is an extremal problem where the error is little o in the exponent on the log term. I don't know many such problems. That's uh, I would love to see this result. And I, the more you think about it, I kind of think that Alex and David are probably right that the DK, that's K log K is a little low with DK. I have no idea how to prove it, but this is one which has sat there for 30 years and then a really, really nice breakthrough. A really, really nice breakthrough, which is now again out in okay. Now let's talk about the relationship between chromatic number and cliques. I will start with some absolutely trivial statements, and then we'll have a real theorem at the bottom. So if you have a graph on n vertices, chromium number is the most n, and the only time it's tight is when the graph is a complete graph. Okay, so now you can ask whether that statement is stable. So if n is large. So if n is large and the chromatic number is very close to n, is the great size close to n? And you have a trivial result. If the chromatic number is at least n minus c and n is reasonably large, then g contains a clique of size n minus 2c. And here's the proof. If the graph is not a clique, take a non-adjacent pair of vertices and remove them. Okay, now what's happening? Movement. Okay, now what's happened? Your number of vertices has gone down by two, but your chromatic number has either unchanged or has gone down by at most one. So this iterative process has got to stop very quick. And then you have a click. Okay, so it's stable and it's trivially stable. Okay, so now at the other end of the spectrum, suppose you just bound the creek size. Suppose you just bound the clique size and say, How big can the chromatic number be if the clique size is restricted? And the classic result, which now everybody knows, and this is a very non-trivial result, is that the maximum combined number of a triangle-free graph on n-vertices is theta of n over square root log n. Okay, so now we want to talk about the poset analogs of these. Analogs of these. All right, so we needed the postet analog of a clique, and that's a standard example. So take this bipartite, balanced bipartite postet, endpoints on each side, and put in all the comparabilities with the exclusion of a matching. Then that poset has dimension in, and in fact, it's critical. So there are just many settings in which this family of postets. This family of posets plays the analog of creeks. So now, Paul and Alex have just written this massive paper on analogy, on the notion of tied bindedness, tied binded, or how do you tie binding, tie bounded? Yeah, okay, so the chromatic number for classes of graphs being bounded in terms of click size. And the beautiful talk by Bartek half an hour ago. Bartech half an hour ago was on rectangle graphs and sharply improved result on the chromatic number in terms of the maximum clique size. Okay, so the poset analog, which I'm not really going to talk about today, is for what classes of posets can you bound the dimension in terms of the exclusion of the standard example size? So it's Is dimension bounded in terms of the size of the largest standard example? Okay, now, just like in graphs, the answer in general is no, because you have the 60-year-old Erdős result about graphs with large girth and large chromatic number. Okay, so you have the same kind of thing in posets, but nevertheless, there are interesting classes where dimension seems to be bound. Seems to be bounded in terms of standard example size. And in particular, we believe very strongly that this is true when the diagram for the poset is planar. In fact, we actually believe it's true, and we're probably years away from proving this. We believe it's true when the diagram has Has excludes a minor. So, all the results of the last couple of years have been done with structural connections between postets and structural graph theory. We are reasonably convinced that if you exclude any given minor from the diagram and then bound the standard example size, then you bound it to dimension. I have no idea how to prove it, but it just feels right. It just feels. It just feels right. It just feels right. Okay. Okay. So now let's let's let's get the connection between dimension and standard examples. Let's start with an old result of Hiraguchi goes back 60 years. If you have a postat on 2n plus 1 points, and is a case 10, and this is a postet. Okay, now there's nothing wrong with the proofs of Hiroguchi. By the way, he wasn't a mathematician, he was a medical doctor. He dabbled in mathematics on the side. Mathematics on the side. With Rudon, we proved in 16 a really modern proof of this same result. Okay, the case when n is two is trivial. But once you get up to dimension being at least three, then one of the reasons that you can prove that it takes at least two n points to get dimension B is that you can find a matching of size being the comparability graph. Of size B in the comparability graph of B, and you can also find a maximum of size B in the incomparable graph. These are not trivial results. But yeah, we like them. All right, now there's an old law proof of Campbell that says here's the tightness. If n is at least four, then you have two n plus one points and dimension n, then you must contain the standard example, Sn. Standard example, SM. Now, this proof was completed in 2016. Notice that 43 years after it was first announced. And the reason is that the proof really depended on an inductive argument where you start with the base case n equals four. And the argument that Kimball gave. The argument that Kimball gave was incomplete. And he said the remainder of it consists of examination of a bunch of uninteresting cases. And he cited me as an expert who had verified that it was correct. You know, in most circles, that's not really counted as a proof. Okay, but using SAGE, Derek Stolley in 2016 checked all 183,000 83,000 unlabeled process on nine points and verified that none have dimension four unless they contain a standard example. Okay, so now after 40 something years, it really is a theory. Okay, so now let's do stability analysis. So with Biro, Hamburger, and Poor, we proved in 2016 the post-set analog of that element result for graphs. So you give me a C, then there's a least integer, some function of C, they'll do an analysis of C. And we can prove that it has to be at least of size C to the four-thirds. And it's O of C squared. So that if you have, if you, if you're big and you have two n plus one points, and your dimension is close to the maximum, it's at least. To the maximum, it's at least n minus c. Then peak things are standard example s d with d at least this n minus s of s and I really, really, really like this theorem. I don't know of any elementary way to prove that this function exists. In fact, the first proof produced a tower of towers. And then we cut the tower down to one tower, then a large exponential function, then a large polynomial function, then got the cubic, and then finally got the quadratic. And it's really stuck at quadratic. The lower bound C to the four-thirds uses a poset associated with finite projected planes. So the lower bound is also non-free. All right. Now, All right, now let me just comment about how this is done. So, 30 years ago with Erdős and Kirsted, we investigated the notion of a random bipartite process. But we really did this with emphasis on the range P less equal to half. Now, I'm going to try to show you guys a graph because I've just blown on the note. So, this red curve. Is supposed to represent the expected value of the dimension in a random bipartite coset where you put incomparabilities with probability p. Okay, so now if p is below one over log n, you can see the expected value that mentioned is rising very rapidly. And we have very tight upper and lower bounds around us over this range. But when you get up to right at But when you get up to right at one over log n, it flattens out, and then it's it's one minus a little o one times all the way out times. Now, the proof on that d of k function was established right here and other bounds of Fourier and Kahn about dimension in terms of maximum degree were were. We were established over here. Okay, so we, 30 years ago, it's only this part of this curve that we cared about. You know, what was happening over here, you know, of no interest, or little interest. And then you get this statement that when something is one minus little O1, you know, the little O1 might be big. And that's what's really And that's what's really going on. Okay, so now, since we did this work in 2015, published in 1415, published in 16, we can now push up the exponent in the stability analysis question to at least three halves. Remember, it was four-thirds when the lower bound. We got it up to three halves. So we can give two different proofs. One proof uses the local lemma with the value of p, which is With a value of p, which is very close to n, one minus n to the minus two-thirds, but it produces, as is typically the case, a rear poset. Okay, now the second proof uses the Janssen inequality with a typical poset when P is n to the minus one-third. So, some of you may have seen preliminary versions of this random bipartite posets because it's taken six years to write it. Years to write it. And various early versions of it claim to have theorems in it. But in fact, to be honest, some of the proofs were more of the flavor of, well, something like this should be true. You know, the post-hat part we could do, but there were certain things that we needed from Second Moment Methods that we said, something like this has to be true. Well, it turned out. Has to be true. Well, it turned out that in order to prove these things, you need not only the Janssen inequality, but you have to use the Talogram inequalities too. So this paper is quite nice. Okay, now let's talk about the second thing, and that is when you bound the standard example size, and then you want to say how big can the dimension be. Okay, so there's no graph equivalent of chromatic number when you exclude. Chromatic number when you exclude a K2. Because then all the graphs are independent, they have chromatic number one. But if you exclude the standard example S2, then these are the interval orders. And we know the maximum dimension of these combining results of a bunch of authors over the years. We now know this maximum value to within an additive error of five. But roughly, But roughly speaking, it's like log log n plus a half plus little log one times triple log n. Okay, now with Bureau, Hamburger, and Por in 15 proved that if you exclude a D, then the maximum division among posets on endpoints that doesn't contain the standard example S D is a little low n. So you can't get the constant fraction of N that you can. In that you can when you allow a large standard example to be present. And in our random bipartite supposed paper, we actually proved this. I think this is quite an appealing result. That if you exclude a D, but now the D has to be at least three, then the maximum dimension among postsets on endpoints that do not contain the standard example. Now it grows much faster. It grows like into the alpha, where alpha. Like into the alpha, where alpha is a fixed constant, depending on B, of course, alpha between zero and one. We don't have any upper bound of this flavor. The little O N is very, very weak. Very, very weak. Okay, so what was that? So, I want to close with this comment that Alex and David have both told me that they know nothing about post-ets. That's not true. It's not true because they've actually learned quite a bit. But they made all their progress in these better bounds by going over into graph theory and using the related concept of boxes. Of boxes. So, if you would like to take that approach, if you will contact me sidebar, I can give you a primer in like two minutes. And you never have to think about dimension. You never have to think about posets. Just think about bipartite graphs and boxicity. Okay, thanks for listening. Okay, thank you. All right, thank you very much. Are there any questions? I have a question. So in these, you're looking at bounds at the end for dimension where you forbid one of the standard examples. And I'm wondering if there's enumerative results known. How many post-sets on n elements forbid the standard example SD? Standard example SD, if it's large, then you have a lower bound, I guess, on the dimension just by a counting argument. Yes, yes, and there are efforts like that. So a young guy named Marcine Witkowski, a young colleague of Wuchek, obtained a result which is quite similar to ours just by counting. So roughly speaking, So, roughly speaking, he took a put in the edges at random. He got one more dense than ours. But then he said, I can restrict the size of the standard example, but I still have a lot of edges. So if I take all the subgraphs, the dimension in there has to be large. Okay, now you have to pay attention to some details because when you start throwing... Some details because when you start throwing away edges, you can now build standard examples where you didn't have them before. Okay, but the approach can be made to work. Thanks. All right, any further questions? No? All right, so thank you again. Great talk, thanks. So that's the end. I would like to thank all. So that's the end. I would like to thank all the speakers because I think we've had some very good talks. I mean, people lecturing at home in their bedrooms, I think this is very good. So thank you very much, all the speakers. And Paul, may I interrupt for the end? I think we all should also thank Paul for his really, really tough efforts in making In making this workshop and this lecture series possible. Thank you, Paul. It was really amazing.
