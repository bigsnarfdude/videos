This beautiful place to speak here. Much of this talk is not going to be recent results. I'll have a few recent things at the end, but I wanted to give an overview of the relationship between derived equivalents and rational points. And so I'm going to do this. I apologize to the experts that know everything I'm about to survey. Hopefully there'll be a few interesting things along the way. What I'm talking about is joint with Yuri Trinkle and supported by the National Science Foundation and the Simons Foundation. So let's let X be smooth projective rhiny over a field, K. And as usual, PB of X will be the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves. On X. And so the question that we're going to look at is so given two such varieties, X and Y, with equivalent derived categories, So I'm implicitly using all the structure, the triangulated structure that comes with the drive category, so I don't think I need to explain that too much here. So how are our rational points? On X and Y related to each other. So this is a basic question I'd like to focus on. So let me make a quick remark on what this equivalence means. Equivalence means, so let's unpack star. So, by a result of Orlov, it implies an interpretation of what the drive category means. So there exists an element E and the derived category of the product. Of the product of patchwork itself, such that the Fourier-McCaille transform associated to this So this goes from the one drive catboard to the other. It takes an element f and maps it into, let's see, I take It into, let's see, I take a projection of through the first factor. I take this and I tensor it with E and then I push back the projection onto the other factor. Let me make a remark here that all of these operations should be a tension product. This should be a tensor product. So, all these operations here, I'm taking them in the derived senses. So, I'm suppressing the blackboard bold R's and L's that one normally uses. So it's a derived tensor product. Derived pullback, derived push forward. And so, let me finish my sentence. There exists such that the Fourier Muki transform associated to this induces. So the equivalence is stated fairly abstractly in terms of these homological properties on triangulated categories, but really it's just meaning that you have an element here, generally called a kernel, so that the Fourier-Bukka transformation induces an equivalence of these categories. And the equivalents of these categories. And so we're just asking whether we can what we can say when we produce these problems. And so a specific subset of this question, for instance, is does the existence of a rational point does this imply the existence of a rational point on the other side? So this is a specific realization of this question. Realization of this question. Okay. So, this is what I'd like to talk about. And most of what I'm going to say is either very straightforward results on this and negative statements. So it's a question, it's not a conjecture. There are many cases where this is not true. So let me, in the survey part of this, give you a quick rundown of what we know. Are there any questions so far? Okay. Yes, the oral theorem. Is this a representability statement for factors of a sort, only for equivalence of sorts? I think it's true more widely than for exact functors. Just for exact functions. I think if you have fully faithful one to but there are examples of functors. There are a lot of examples. There should be a characterization of which functors are exactly at this time. Now I'm editorializing? They should be form one. I'm only going to talk about equivalent sense. I'm only going to talk about equivalences. And certainly there are many cases where it's interesting to look at kernels where it's not inducing equivalences. If you put curly D, then it's always true. Yeah. I'm going to avoid curly D. Is it a journey technological statement? I couldn't hear the. Is it a jaunty technological statement with all of the I mean I'm sure it uses the fact that we're working with Is the fact that we're working with coherent sheaves in the central way. I mean, I don't think the specific context of coherent sheaves on writings is important here. I'm happy to have questions, and I'm not asking. I'm happy to have questions, and I'm not the best person to answer, too. Discussion is good. Okay, so initial results. So let's assume that omega of x, so this is dualizing sheaf, x is always non-singular. x is always non-singular. Let's assume that this has is positive and negative in the sense that it's ampo or anti-ampo. So you have a positive dualizing sheet. So then, so there's a result of online will of Which says that under this assumption, so given an equivalence of the dry category of x with some other y, it actually forces an isomorphism. Again, assuming this assumption. And so here, of course, you know that the You know that the rational points are the same because they're isomorphic. This can be done over the field of definition. So these questions are fairly straightforward when you have varieties of general type or funo varieties. The derived category equivalence really is just realized by isomorphism. One has a good understanding of what points are when you have a sign. When you have a sign in the canonical class. So, from now, yes. General type or for final varieties. What do you mean by just thinking capital? I mean, all right. I guess if it's, I guess if it's only, I think you still would get, well, I should hesitate. Yeah, so as long as you have a sign. I don't think. That's actually an interesting question. It's probably an easy question, but let me just put it on the board in the interest of facilitating conversation. So probably by the end of the talk, an answer will be clear. But what if we only assume This is only general target. I think Calamano proved it by a rational part of the equivalent. That sounds reasonable. So, in any event, the purpose of this is that we're going to avoid all of these because there's other structural rules. Of there's a lot, there's other structural results. Sorry, could I ask you? In the case when you have, so by ration negative identical, but then you start blowing up, so you mess with the section break. I'm less confident about the case of the file. Ah, okay. Yeah. I mean, if it if it's if it's if it's for rationally connected varieties, see, let me see if I can channel. Let me see if I can channel or maybe all of that. But it's less clear to me if you have negative canonical birational because you anti-canonical rank doesn't behave well within the Oh, you're meaning if it's like in a uni-rule case, for instance. Yeah, I don't think I would wanna if you in between uh two In between the two extremes, I wouldn't want to say anything. I think I don't know what the answer is for rationally connected varieties. Maybe there are theorems like that. Yeah, I'm not sure. But yeah, so it's enough to assume this for X and not for X and Y? In the theorem, under the assumptions you just assume it for X. Yes. Okay, yes, and in and in particular it's a consequence of the argument that it's true for Y. Of the argument that it's true for y. Yeah, so let me just throw this. So, uh, oh, I'm just going to throw this out as I don't, I don't know what holds there. Okay, yes. Can you make this a more direct argument, a reconstruction argument, so not the full. Construction argument, so not the full Bundan or of theorem, but sort of directly saying what corresponds to a k-rational point inside the current category. Yeah, that's actually how that proof works. It gives a homological characterization of what a point is. And I think that state duality plays an important role, which is why the science is relevant. And that's sort of, you just say, oh, how do you recognize a point? And you give the these conditions on it. The argument is originally for, I think, over a non-closed ground field, but it comes through over an outbreak and closed field as well. Over not a closed field as well. Another comments or suggestions? Okay. So then, the next result I want to say, I'll keep this a little. I'll give it a little longer. So let's assume that X and Y are principal homogeneous bases for an elliptic curve. So they come with a with a with a with a geometrically transit action of E. So then there is a theorem that you know crash award that describes when these are direct equivalents. So if you haven't derived equivalence, it tells you that if you take the class of X and you look at the group generated by it, it's equal to the class of Y. And the base Chatelet group associated with B. So these don't have to be the same as elements. You know, if the elements have order 3, one could be two times the other and vice versa. But they generate the same subgroup. So you do get some interesting not drawn to the boxes, but the resulting varieties are called. But the resulting varieties are quite closely related. Any comments, questions? So, how biodimensional the billion array is? The data is. And so you have some similar results if you make assumptions. So let's say that X and Y are principal homogeneous bases over some of Billion Y they A and so the the same And so the same group tell us that if, so let's assume that A is simple with trivial endomorphisms. I want these conditions to be geometric conditions. Geometrically simple, geometric and Geometrically simple geometric endomorphism just equal to the integers with a neuron spary group of this isomorphic to Z and actually represented by a line number. In the sense that the generator of the neuron Suberic group, it's Galois and variant, and there's a line bundle representing that. Representing that, defined over the round field. And so then this relationship to star, star still holds. But there are cases where this fails if you drop this assumption. So let me. Be this assumption that the generator of the neuron subarium group is represented by a line below the ground field. If you don't have this, things are quite different. So and feel so. Until sorry I don't alphabetize correctly in real time. So they give an example where it shows that the box assumption is needed. So here's their example. So let's say that C is a curve of G minus G. Let me assume that G is greater than or equal to 2. So then So then the assertion is that the drive category of the Jacobian of C is equivalent to the derived category of the pick 2 minus 1 component. Of course, I mean, this is a billion variety. And it has a rational point. However, this here just need not have a rational point. So there are plenty of examples of curves of genus G where Of curves of genus G where peak G minus 1 doesn't have any points. Barger-Gross Wong shows that among hyper elliptic curves, a positive proportion have no points on pick 2 minus 1. So most of the time, over number of fields, this does not have points. And so clearly, this violates this. I mean, this is a non-trivial element in the Pay-Chat League group. And this is the identity element. And this is the identity element. So, even for principal homogeneous bases over positive dimensional related varieties, the relationship between the rational points is not clear. And so this is a really beautiful classical argument, basically just using Fourier Mackay transforms and sort of the fact that you have universal line bundles of universal data divisors. So, I don't. So, I so next results. So, I'm slowly sort of whittling away in territory where the question is not interesting either because it has an easy positive answer or there are negative results. Any questions before I start erasing again? So, the last thing I'll mention is the same group find give an example of a K3 surface. Surface and four-dimensional moduli spaces of stable shapes like M B of S M W of S That are birational, excuse me, that are derived equivalent. But one has rational points and the other does not. And the other does not. And so these examples have dimension, the moduli spaces at dimension four. And so the message here is that, hello? The basic is that hyperkillers are trouble. A trouble. In general, hyperkalo manifolds of higher dimensions, of dimensions four and larger, having a rational point that's not a derived invariant. There are even similar examples for twisted moduli spaces of K3 surfaces. So So, based on this, for the rest of the presentation, I'm going to focus on one example that sort of went its way through. I mean, you suggested other examples that probably would have been equally relevant for this talk, but I don't have any results to tell you about them. Yeah, Matt? Things that are too cloudy out of Matt, I would say I don't run it an example, and I think we were able to. I think we were able to it's it's still open yeah you know yeah so let me say the say the names of the authors so you myself uh Alicia Lamarge uh Sashi I also can't really Ajimoto and Isabel Bo yeah so so they they look at club you know basically Love you out and basically how the machinery of the Brauer-Manning weak approximation obstructions, how they behave like they're derived equivalents, and get some interesting results, but it doesn't specifically address the question I was aiming to. Yeah, Jack? This is a little silly. So sorry, I'm asking. Referenc by line bundle, do you mean the kernel is a line bundle? What do you mean by rapid by line bundles? What I mean by this is if there is, in fact, a line bundle representing so. Representing, so it refers to this sentence. Okay, okay, okay. And so the problem right here is I have data divisors which are defined over some geometrically connected variety over the ground field, but no particular one is defined over the ground field. And so that's the issue. Does that make sense? It has to be represented by a line field over the ground field. By a line model over the ground field, correct. Other questions or comments? Questions or comments? In the case of the elliptic curve, these assumptions are too strong, I guess. Yes, yes. I'm sorry, I should have said something in particular. I did have said this explicitly. Okay, yeah, so maybe it's not optimal. I mean, in the cases, there's more complicated things that you might say. I mean, I'm not sure what that. I know that. I know that you may have some ideas about this, but I guess I'm just looking at the endomorphism of the brain colours. Strange that that doesn't hold into the race of the breakdown. I think these can get more complicated when you have endomorphisms. Since I've said a lot of things in yellow that I don't think I want to be held responsible for, maybe I'll just, if it's yellow, it means I'm sorry I'm yellow and I don't want to take responsibility. I'm yellow and I don't want to take responsibility for it. But on the other hand, I think it's important to discuss. So, I mean, hyperchampus don't work, it's also in yellow. Oh, no! Oh, well, no. That's green. All right, my call. Sorry. I'm not going to redraw it. So, one thing that you might ask, you'll probably find a counterexample or proof right away, is given x. A is given X and Y principal homogeneous spaces over abelian varieties. Thing of is the right condition something like this that X Is there a relationship between derived equivalence and something like this? Oh no, maybe this is not the right thing. I'm thinking that. Not the right thing. I'm taking the Orloff condition that A and B as abelian varieties are derived equivalent if A cross A dual is isomorphic to B cross B dual. So this is probably wrong. I don't, is there, this shouldn't be a condition in general. I think that this is something that is probably within reach because angio crash and ward, they do quite a careful analysis of this. I think that this is something that maybe this is, I think. Maybe this is. I came up with this last night. I'm not sure it's correct or not. But I think that this is something that is probably accessible because there can be complexities that come as you have endomorphisms, but I think you can probably control them in some way. Yes. I think there's a result of the key thing that says that. Components of the automorphisms of the Picard group. The automorphisms of the right across. Across the Picard group. Yes, I think, yeah. And so that would at least tell you that the corresponding underlying abelian varieties, I'm not saying that X and Y are controlled homogeneous spaces of the same abelian variety, right? I think that that statement would give you that. Would give you that the underlying albaneses, varieties are driving corruption. So, yeah, Roquet's result is definitely relevant here. So, if X over S fibers, does that help in any sense at least constructively for the baseline fiber? Yeah, I don't know whether we. I mean, that's a great question. I'm asking myself whether the classification of variety is right. Yeah, I mean, if the variable zero, so to speak. Yeah, so I mean, I think it's a very natural question, for instance. Has someone done this for elliptic, like, say for elliptic surfaces? So you have a prop. So you have properly elliptic surfaces in the sense that you have simply connected the elliptic surface with PG to a larger, so you're not in the K3 case. How do you see the elliptic vibration in terms of the drive category? I think there are statements like that. I just didn't prepare references. I mean, I think that there are cases where you can see vibrations that would come naturally from the minimal model program. In the case of In the case of rationally connected varieties where you have vibrations that come, you know, they're sort of less canonical, then I think it could be really complicated. So, you know, I think it would be, the only thing I think is I think when the vibration is natural from the middle model program, I think it's more reasonable to try to look for it on the derived from the 67. I'm Piccolo Robbie sees this. Yeah, that sounds right. I didn't prepare, so I won't write, but it sounds like that sounds right to me. Are there other comments or questions? Okay. So what's Gotten through most of my negative results. Alright, so what's left? And so, well, lots of things are left, but what's left that I can actually tell you something about? And I'm going to focus on K2 services from that one. Okay. So here, I don't know counterexamples to the statement. Let me just. Examples to the statement. Let me just put my cards on the table, so to speak. So if x and y are k to be surfaces, the implication that derived equivalents implies that you have rational points on one if it only On one, if and only if there are rational points on the other. This statement, I think, is that I don't know of counterexamples to this. I don't have counterexamples. So this is a viable statement. So this is a version of our original. So, this is a version of our original question in the case resurface case. And there's some evidence for this, and so let me review the evidence. So, there are results for K in a nice field. Nice meeting in a field where the results work. And so, examples of this. So examples of this are for K, a finite field. You can use the fact that the kernel gives you relationships on the level of atopal homology. And this is valid. And so I think I learned this from Liebli-Golsund. I don't know if that's the right attribution, but that's why I learned. If that's the right attribution, but that's who I learned it from. So for fun, it feels this is fine. I don't know if you've is this right yet? I think void breaks also a bit. So for finite cases, it's fine. For the real numbers, this is also okay, essentially by isotopic classification. You just, for each complex conjugate, For each complex conjugation, you just write down the topology. And you see, oh, they're real points. So this is basically by the isotopic classification. So for some nice fields, we have results. There's not much that's known over arbitrary fields. Over arbitrary so for k arbitrary one thing I know is if again assuming this assumption here If xk has a rational point, then the index of y is equal to 1. So this is just the greatest common divisors of the degree of the field extensions over which you have a rational point on y. have a rational point on y. So you don't have a rational point, but over relatively prime extensions you can produce rational points. Matt. Is there like a statement on the minimum degree you need to produce a rational point? You're like an effective statement? I don't know. I mean, I think that if you, I think surely, if you realize y is a moduli space of sheaves with a given Machai vector over x, you know, I mean, if you tell me the kernel, I can get an estimate. I don't know. Let's see. And the index of the K3 surface, I mean, you always have. You always have, you know, points over a degree 24. I mean, there's things that you know, but I don't know of a global, I think there's some bounds that you have globally. But I don't know of any interesting statements for lower bounds. I'm just kind of working through what you get from the moduli space interpretation. Should it be the class, the order of the class of the germ, essential domain? Like a, so you get this germ. Like a so you get this germ of this, yeah, and then you look at the class of that germ. That'd be the same relationship, I think. So this is like the order of the term for the university. Curves, maybe. Yeah, I don't. I'm not sure. The order of some class is more like a period. You said something class. The order of a class is more like a period, and then this would be a period index question if that description would actually be index. Yeah, I'm not sure. I mean, I think it's interesting to think about the... When we did this some time ago, we weren't focused on these germ-type obstructions as she used. I think it makes sense to. Use, I think it makes sense to revisit all this. So, things like what you say, they do show up in the NGO Crash and War work on the alien varieties. I mean, they often give characterizations for when one object is a twisted drive category of another object where the twisting comes from some Brouwer class of the route field, and then they have statements that are in that A. But I didn't know in this case, I'm sorry. So, um So, are there other comments or questions? All right. So, let's assume that K is local, for instance, dp or Or complex power series ring. So here I could say things under some restrictive hypotheses over the closed fiber. So star holds Let X and Y have good reduction. And even ABE reduction. At least if I avoid a few small residue primes, which I'm going to That's in the footnotes. So, as long as the surfaces have a model with a fiber over the closed point is smooth or close to it, you can basically use Hensel's lemma to produce rational points. And so, this is not very interesting. But I'll just say Hensel's lemma, this gives This gives the existence of rational points, provided the model has mild singularities. And so this is sort of not a very interesting case. But it does point to the fact that the details of the singularities of the reduction are relevant to doing the analysis. And so I think that this is an important point of. An important point to keep clear on. Okay. So let me get even more special. Let's explore a little bit more in this vein. Excellent X be a K through surface over K and let's choose a model So what can So, let this be a model of X that is proper, regular, and with normal crossings. Fiber, special fiber. Alright, so here I have our base and I have internal fiber over some value t. And then I want to assume that over t equals zero. Over t equals zero. Do I have some kind of normal processing style? I don't know. All right, so let's see that we're in the situation. And so, when I have a situation, I have a monography operator. We call this T that goes the homology of a general point. over a general point and at the risk of oh I'll use my green chart for this. So basically if I take the loop around here T is the induced map on the level of the cohomology and so there is a result of a compo A result of a combo that allows you to compute. Well, let's introduce one other thing. From inside of here, let's take the locus where the central fiber is smooth. And so I'm looking at for this tensor keven, I'm just taking the interior of the faces. Taking the interior of the faces, where you don't have intersection of others. And Acampo says that the Euler characteristic of the smooth heart can be read off. So, this is sort of an analog of the analysis with the Bay conductors. With the big conjectures, that if you know the trace of the monodromia operator, you can read off the Eulie characteristic and the smooth part from that. Why is this useful? Well, if this is not empty, before I say this so So our vibration here, pi as a section here, if and only if acts as a rational point if and only if a smooth locus Of the fiber is not equal to the empty set. So, in other words, if I have some point in the smooth locus, I can use Hensel's lemma to get a section. And so this trace, this is a derived invariant. Because it's just something that you compute on the cohomology. So the interpretation of the dried equivalence on the Mukai lattice, this is a drive invariance. So how should I visualize such a model where the smooth voltage is empty? Because my understanding of regular normal crossing requires a lot of fun to be specified by the lots of smooth functions. Well, for instance, here's an example. For instance, here's an example. Suppose that I have a K3 surface that arises as a double cover of the nucleus surface. And then I take an isoturbial family, where as I go around the loop, I apply the mucous involution. The central fiber there, at least the most obvious central fiber, the one that you get by taking quotients, has an in recurrent surface with multiplicity 2 everywhere. Then this would not be a fiber because it would not be a normal crossing because it's pi positive two. I didn't say reduced normal crossings. Yeah, yeah. I think maybe the pi inverse of zero. That's not a scheme theoretic statement. You're not taking a scheme theoretic study. Well, yeah, I guess this is a cultural difference. I can say reduce normal. Yeah, I can say reduce normal, I mean this reduce closed fiber. Yeah, so normal crossings, but maybe not reduced. So the underlying divisor is a normal crossing of the divisor. Yes, the underlying division. In other words, this is what I can do if I take resolution of singularities, right? Resolution of singularities tells you that the divisor is set theoretically normal crossing, but there could be multiple cities. I understood the addition first as the stronger. I'm sorry for being unclear. Are there other things that I can clarify here? Okay, so then the conclusion here, so let me just say the punchline. So if the trace of the mumdrum is Of the Mondromy is not equal to minus 2, then you're guaranteed that x and k is not equal to the input step. So this is one large class of examples where you can do this. You can do this. Okay. This is the end of the survey, and I have all of seven minutes left. I'm going to try to say something new. Although maybe it's not, I mean, it's not so bad just to discuss things I didn't prepare as well as things I did prepare. Are there any other questions before I kind of go off? Okay. I'm going to take this and specialize it even further. Now I want to assume that this is, I guess I can keep the picture. I want to assume that this is a family, an isotrivial family. A family, an isotrivial family of K3 surfaces associated with the cyclic subgroup and the automorphism group. And I just said it to Group. And I just said it in answer to your question, but I mean, basically, the idea is I let X be a quotient of one of the fibers, X T by some disk covering this. So this is like taking an n root of T. This is like taking an n root of t. Sorry, I don't know. Isotrivial means that all the fibers I spots. Isotrivial means that all the fibers has. Yeah, isotrivial means all the fibers are isomorphic. And so I'm actually saying exactly what I want to do here. I'm taking a quotient of a fixed member of the family with this disk under the action of the cyclic group with the cyclic group max by roots of unity. With a cyclic group max by roots of unity on the root of t and by the automorphism here. And in the request case, I get the example that I mentioned. So even this, we couldn't figure out how to do it in 2014. It's kind of embarrassing because it's really just a property of the automorphism. So, yeah, so this is something that we left. And so, what has changed since And so, what has changed since we thought about this eight years ago? So, here is a here's a news flash Brand Force. Brand horse offline they classify all finite coup actions on K3 surfaces up to isotopy Topic. And I even wrote down the number. They're a lot. So the ones that they do, there are at least 4,167. This is not including the 84 symplectic actions. And so when I saw this paper, I said, well, come on. If we can classify all the actions, then surely we can solve. Then surely we can solve this problem. Because they're all written down. So I said, well, surely this must solve the isotrivial case, right? And so I dutifully went through the classification. I downloaded the Hyup files on GitHub. I figured out all their notation. In every case, worked. And then it's like, then I felt confident. And then it's like, then I felt confident. Oh, this is correct. And so then, so then it turns out that we didn't need the classification. But I want to give credit to the people who did the classification. Because had they not done it, we would not have had the courage to try to look at this again. And so there are probably interesting cases where the classification might be usable for harder, like isotrivial cases. Isotrivial cases. But the theorem for isotrivial K3 surfaces over A local field, C double parenthesis T having a rational point is a derived property. So this uh this is uh I think the only new thing I want to tell you. thing I want to tell you. And so the proof actually let me say two sentences about the proof. The first thing to remark is that this depends only on whether This group action has a fixed point. If you analyze these vibrations and analyze these quotients, the condition of having a fixed point under group action is equivalent to the condition of whether you whether you whether you have a Oh, what do you have a section? And what you get to trump all is you compute the Euler characteristic of the fixed points. If it's zero, then you said, is it the empty set or is it an elliptic curve? I can't tell. That's the kind of problem. Or is it in a recurring? I mean, you get into trouble. You can't tell from the Euler characteristic whether it's the empty set or not. And so the other element of the proof, I mean, once you know that the answer is right, Is right basically just work through the combinatorics using the regular and holomorphic Left checks fixed point formulas. You need both formula. So there is some fun, I mean some of the actions they leave the symplectic form unchanged. Some of the actions act the character of the symplectic form. Be a character in the symplectic form. And you have to do some bookkeeping in these cases. But between the classical and the holomorphic fixed-point formulas, if you just work through it, the proof comes out. So it's actually just a page or two. It's not a lot. But I don't know. I want to do some support. The classification made it clear to us that we could actually do this commentarial, an LSS and the page. So I think I should stop here. Thanks a lot for your patience. Thanks a lot for your patience. Questions for Brendan? Just here's some highlights of this group classification. What kind of groups occur? Ah, well, so there is a lot of work that's been done on the structural aspects of this. Dozens of papers. One of the highlights, for instance, Highlights, for instance, is let's say that you have a finite group acting in a way that preserves a symplectic form. So Mukai gave a characterization of the groups and can act in that way. I think it's related to whether the groups can be embedded in certain ways into the Metu group. And so that gave, he gave a somewhat coarse description of the combinatorics in terms of sort of properties and elements in the mathematics. Properties and elements of the NI2 group. About 10 years ago, Hashimoto actually went through and gave, did all the work, allowed us theory to classify the 85 different groups that can occur. And so basically, you look at the group actions, you look at the decomposition we call homology, you look at the various subtle addicces that are natural, and you classify those subtle addresses using techniques. Techniques of Nicoolin and genus theory. And you really, you know, you just write down all the lattices. Generally, the lattices are not terribly large because of the complexity. So you can do that. One thing that does make the bookkeeping difficult is that there are actions on the cohomology that come from Karl Levcech's reflections that are not automorphisms. And so, probably, one of the most delicate things is to sort of not pick up Karl Levschet's reflections by mistake. Reflections by mistake, because those are not, those are symmetries of the cohomology that are not actual symmetries of the underlying variety. So that's probably the most subtle aspect of it. I hope that answers your question. Restrict attention to more special cases, like Coomer cases. So, stronger results for sort of special classes? Um I guess geometric my feeling is that this should be doable for coomers, but I don't think it's I don't know of a theorem, but I think that that's a it's a good thing to work on. Let me just say that much, but I don't have a theorem off the top of my head. Yes, if I understand correctly. Yes, so if I understand correctly, uh the method to find the web brackets T rational problem is always to find the C value problem in the reduction. The smooth locus of the reduction, correct. So essentially it would work if C is replaced by any PAC field. I think that's true, yes. Yeah, I mean you just need to be able to do these. Need to be able to do these. Wherever you can do the headshot lifting type argument, you can get a result. Yeah. Yep, 10-4. And we'll resume at 10:30. Thanks for that. Yeah, these questions are always interesting and the new person.
