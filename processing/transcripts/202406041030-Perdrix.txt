This session, Simon will be telling us about quantum circuit movements. Okay, thank you very much. So, yes, first, I want to thank the organizers for this very nice workshop. Thank you very much. And so, today I want to talk about quantum circuits and more precisely, completeness for quantum circuits. Okay, so we all know that quantum circuits are a big interest in quantum computing, and in particular for in the quantum stack or compiling fast. Or compiling tasks. And in general, when you have a quantum circuit, the first thing you want to do is to transform the circuit. Maybe you want to optimize it, increase the number of gates, T gates, or you may want to transform it in order to satisfy some hardware constraints like topological constraints, for instance. Or you want to transform your circuit in order to make it fault-to-harrant. Or, I don't know, verification, verifying that the circuit you have is active. Verifying that the circuit you have is actually an implementation of your specification and even a simulation. So we have seen that we can do a quantum simulation, simulation of quantum circuits. Okay, and so for all this task, we need to do CPI transformations. And an elegant and efficient way to do this is to use an equational theorem. That is a set of simple equations like this one, which are telling you how to transform your circuit. If you have two C naught, you can just remove them. If you have two C naught, you can just remove them. And okay, so here you see that there are some simple equations on quantum circuits. So this is a way to transform the circuit, but this is also a way to have more information about your circuit, to capture the properties of your formalism. And in particular, a nice property to have when you have an equational theory is to have a completeness result, which says that essentially you are capturing all the properties of your quantum circuits. The properties of your quantum circuits. Any true property on quantum circuits can be derived using just your equations, your set of equations. Okay, so this is in general a hard question, but this is what we want to do. Okay, so let me just introduce a little bit of formalism. So I'm going to work with quantum circuits. So everybody knows quantum circuits. I'm going to work with this get set. So the standard one, C0, Hadamard, and the C. That one C0 had a margin, and a Z rotation, which is represented like this with a P, that's the phase gate. I will also use X rotation, but it's just a shortcut, just this shortcut, it's not really a generator of the language. Okay, an important point when we are talking about the completeness is to distinguish the circuits, which are a graphical object, a gate related by wires, and the unitary transformation, which is represented by this circuit. By this circuit. And so, in this talk, I will always use this funny bracket in order to talk about the unitary transformation which is implemented, represented by the quantum circuit. And so with this, I can define the property of being a complete equational theory. If I have two circuits which are implementing the same unitary transformation, like this, if my equational theory is complete, it means I can. Is complete, it means I can transform C1 into C2 using the rules of the language. This is what this notation means. Okay. Okay, so what is the state of the art about completeness? There are a few interesting results obtained by Peter Zeninger here and Bian, in particular about quantum circuits for Clifford plus T, so Clifford Plus T quantum circuits. So, T Clifford plus T quantum circuits. So, for two qubit circuits, they introduced a complete equational theory, which is made of 20 equations. Here, I just put three of them to show you that, well, they are non-trivial. And so this is a complete equational theory for Clifford plus T circuits on two qubits only. Just for two qubits. More recently, they have introduced a similar result, but now it's for Clifford plus Cs circuits and for three cubes. Circuits and for three cubits. What progressing now is three qubits? There are also results for a Clifford fragment. All your gates are in the Clifford fragment. There is a complete equation theory. And also for other fragments like C naught plus X plus T, which has been proved by Matt Yanshing, Channel, maybe. And Julian. So all these results are very So, all these results are very interesting, but they are for fragments of quantum circuits. And in particular, they are non-universal fragments. And efficiently, you can efficiently simulate it on classical computers. Because for these two, it's clear, and for these two, it's because of the restriction on the number of cubes. And so, what I want to introduce today is a complete equational theory for arbitrary quantum circuits. Arbitrary quantum circuits, an arbitrary number of qubits and with arbitrary gates. There is no restriction on the angles of the Z rotations. So here is the equational theory. So it's just for illustrating the thing. I will not go to the details of this equational theory. And one reason is that actually this, oh, I should forget to say that this result has been obtained with Benoit Valirant, who is here, and also Alexon Claim. And also Alexon Clement, Nicola Lottell, Shane Mansuet. Okay, so the equational theory. So it's here. It's not, well, it's a complete equational theory for quantum circuits. Yes. Yes. No, it's not going to be in the exam because actually we can simplify it. Okay, so we made a few simplifications. A few simplifications. For instance, this big rule actually can be derived from the other ones, in particular, this one. And even this one can be derived from the other ones. And this one is not very easy to work with because there are lots of parameters and it's actually an equation on an arbitrary number of qubits. And we can also simplify this. Okay, so in this paper, we proved that we don't need this. This paper, we proved that we don't need this. And then we worked again on this, and we finally end up with this equational theory, which is much simpler. And this one we can go through and see what are the equations of this equational theory, which is complete. So I think that most of them are fairly simple. So 2H is the identity. A Z rotation of angle 0 is the identity. identity. Here, if you take phi is plus zero, you get two C naught is the identity and otherwise you have a commutation property between a Z rotation and C naught. Here it's a way to say that the 3C naught is a swap but presented in a more biological way for those who know ZX calculus for instance. Here we have two Euler decomposition, Euler decomposition of Hadamard and Euler decomposition of an arbitrary rotor. Arbitrary unitary transformation that you can represent as x, z, x, or z, x, z. And okay, maybe the last two equations. So this one actually is the equation is a CZ because it's a way to implement the CZ, a control Z operation. So to do that, you can just take a control naught and apply pattern art on both sides, or you can side or you can do a whisk compute h c naught for protopre speakers and and another way to do this is actually to use two c naughts and some z rotations that pile the two rotations and they are equivalent and you can put it as as an equation because you actually you cannot derive this equation from the other ones and finally we have this this equation which is uh maybe more complicated Maybe more complicated. Okay, so what is this equation? So we have a two-pi rotation, so which is essentially the identity, right? But this two-pi rotation has multi-controlled, is multi-controlled, okay, with an arbitrary number of controlled qubits. So from a semantic point of view, this equation is trivial. You have the identity to 2π rotation, which is controlled n times. So it's just the identity. But the point is that. But the point is that this multi-controlled operation is not part of the syntax of the language. It's not a generator, it's not a gate of the language. So actually, it's here a shortcut, a notation. And this notation is defined inductively as follows. So a multi-qubit multi-controlled phase rotation is defined like this using three instances of multi-qubit multi-controlled rotation. qubit multi-controlled rotation acting on n minus n minus one qubits where the angle is divided by two and it's an inductive definition like this right so for instance if you look at this equation for a equals four you apply this definition inductively and at the end of the day you get a circuit made of control naught and t gates you say that this piece of circuit is equal to the identity and um okay so it's a non-transparent And um, okay, so it's a non-trivial equation, uh, syntactically. So why is this only for n greater than three? Um, okay, for n one or two, the equation is true, but can be derived from the other ones. Um, okay, so again, for uh, so people who know ZX calculus, actually, this equation is nothing but the spider nest equation. which is a some well it's uh okay so we have these equations and it's complete and uh an interesting property extreme interesting in additional property is that this equational theory is minimal we cannot remove any equation from this equational theory and uh and uh so it's uh and this is the case for any n here so if you take Case for any n here. So, if you take this equational theory and you remove maybe just n equals seven, then you get something which is not complete, okay? Which is probably not complete. So, we really need all these antivesis of this equation and all the other equations to have a complete equation. Yes. So, is that the subset of equations? There is these, but there could be like another set that is some set smaller, like fewer. Okay, yes, so it's minimal by inclusion, so. It's minimal by inclusion, so yes. But at the very end, I will, but I can say it now. So, for instance, here you have an unbounded number of equations, or more precisely, you have equations acting on an unbounded number of qubits. And this property is true for any complete equational theory for quantum circuits. Even if you change the generators, you will always have this property. If you have complete equational theory for quantum circuits, you will have an equation. You will have equations acting on the unbounded number of qubits. Yes. But two of the other equations are also similar, like the other equation depends on parameters, and the C equation depends on the parameters. Are you also saying that if you remove just any one parameter, that's still not complete? No, this one. What we proved is that we need an uncountable number of these equations. Maybe if you just remove one sixty of them. If you set the alpha to some specific angle, you get a complete set of minimal relations for plot plus three circuits. Ah, not with this one, but there is an alternative one because of Euler decomposition, but there is an alternative Euler decomposition where somehow is a stable when you consider when you fix the angle to be a multiple of pi over two. Multiple of pi over two, and in this case, you get uh you get a complete equation of theory for Clifford when you restrict the angle, but it's not the case for this one. I'm not like a like an expert on these equational theories and whatnot, but is there any notion of being able to write these in terms of like the algebras, for example, in a way where you can just use it like talk in front of the generators as opposed to you know harvester and enable. You know, harder to already able rotations and whatnot. Are the bulbs of generators in the sense? They are, but like, you know, you, for example, these become like algebraic statements where you no longer have parameterized things where it's like an infinite family of equations anymore. With comparatively many generators, you could never generate all limit series, right? Yeah. So probably not. Okay. If I look at B, it is just if you add the C naught to both sides of the equation, you just get definition of the swap gate. And if we look at other decomposition, it's the definition of Halgar gate. Why are they indispensable? Why do we need them? Like, only just the definition of the gates? No, so the swap is the generator. I didn't say it at the beginning, but we assumed that the swap. Say it at the beginning, but we assume that the swap is a generator. So you need an equation to relate the swap and the 3C node. Otherwise, it's an equation that you cannot. The Hardamart is a generator. P is a generator and Rx is a shortcut, which is a P with a Hadamard, conjugated by Hadamard. And when you read P, is it like a rotation rather than Z-axis? Yes. I was gonna ask if you were only asking for approximation. Is that like totally the question, I guess? Yeah, it's a totally different question. Yeah, here it's exact equations. Yeah. Yes. Maybe you said this already. So the n greater than equal to three is that just so it will not be redundant in the equals two case. Yeah, the equations are also true for n both one and two. One and two, but it's just that you can prove them using the other equations. Okay, so I will first talk about minimality and try to convince you that this is minimal. And then if I have time, I will talk about completeness, how to prove completeness of this. Okay, so minimality, how to prove minimality of such an equational theory? The idea is to be able to show for each equation that you cannot. Show for each equation that you cannot derive it from the other ones. And a usual way to prove this is to find an invariant which is preserved by all the equations except one. And if it is the case, then it means that this particular equation cannot be derived from the other ones because otherwise it would preserve the invariant. Okay, so for instance, if I give you the invariant, which is the number of h modulo two. Can we say with this? Is it preserved by all the equations? No. No? Which ones? We just pointed out this there, which one it was, right? The one that red Rx has two, which is yes. Yes, it's EH, this one. Because on this side, we have one, and on the other side, the first side, there is zero, but actually in Rx, there are two. But actually, in Rx, there are two. Okay, so an even number up here, an odd number on this side. And for all the other equations, it's preserving the parity. So using this invariant, we can show that this equation cannot be derived from the other ones. Okay? So this is one example. I will not go to the details for all the equations. Sometimes it's a little bit more involved, but I will do it for this part. But I will do it for this particular equation because this is the most complicated one. And actually, we have to prove the necessity of an infinite number of equations. And so to do that, we use another invariant, which is not the parity of the number of h, which is an angle, which is computed using this formula. So here it's just a linear composition. And the angle associated with Hadamard is a pi times 2 to the k minus. Phi times 2 to the k minus 1. So here we have a parameter k, which is going to be fixed later on. For the z rotation is phi times also 2 to the k minus 1. For the c naught, it's this one and swap is the same. And actually, this parameter is related to the determinant of the matrix. We have this formula. It's essentially the argument. Essentially, the argument of the determinant times this power of two. So, when we have k larger than n, so the parameter k is larger than n, we have this equality between the determinant of the matrix and this invariant here that we are computing. So it means that, thanks to this property, it means that when k is larger than n, n is the number of qubits of the circuit, if two circuits are representing the same unitary, then they are going to have the same invariant. Then they are going to have the same invariant because of the previous property. Okay, so we have this invariant, this determinant-like invariant. And this is actually what we are going to use to prove the necessity of these equations. So now we fix 1n. So we fix an equation like this. So n is fixed. And so how to prove that this particular equation is necessary? Okay, so first, a general. Okay, so first, a general remark, which is that when you want to prove an equation here on n qubit, but it could be, for instance, on three qubits, all the equations which are acting on more than three qubits are useless. If I have an equation on four qubits, I will never use it to prove something on three qubits because I cannot add n-serial qubits or these little six. So, to prove this equation, it's enough to look at equations acting on n qubits or less. Then all the remaining rules which are acting on less than n qubits are preserving the invariant because of the previous property. And so it remains just this one. And it turns out that if you compute the invariant, you are going to get pi on this side and zero on the other side. Okay, so this is the example of an invariant which is satisfied by all the equations except this particular one. So it shows that we cannot prove it using the other ones. Okay, um okay um okay not for completeness don't have much time so very briefly uh the completeness is actually coming from uh optics uh the story is that the completeness for consume circuit is a kind of unexpected byproduct of a project that we had with Benoit and others in particular the startup Candela and The startup Candela. And the project was to have a formal language for quantum optics. That is to define this kind of optic circuits, photonic circuits, where each wire is representing the possible path of the photon and you have some optics apparatus as generators. So for this talk, I will just focus on beam splitters and phase shifters, but you can have more than this. And this language is called the Love Calculus in our auto. For the love calculus in our optic and the V for vacuum for some reason. Okay, so beam splitters and phase shifters. I don't really have time to explain, but it's a fairly simple behavior where if you have your photon here, you get a superposition of two photons and so on. And when you have an optic circuit like this, you can define its semantics, the matrix associated with this, which is describing the behavior of the circuit. Is describing the behavior of the circuit. Yes, get a question. Same part. Can people hear? Can people hear me? Ask your question. You can hear, you can't hear. Is that someone in the chat? Yes. No, see, I can see it's kind of hard. Can people hear me? Yeah. Okay, so my question. Okay, so my question is it Greg? Yes, yes. I'm speaking next. Someone else online try speaking. Yeah, I am speaking. Zoom seems to recognize that there is audio coming from Greg, but we don't hear it. Uh-oh. It's there. Okay. There is an audience. Since I'm speaking next, you should try to. I hope there's a way to. I hope there's a way for me to talk so that you can. Hello? Okay. So can somebody let me know in chat whether you can hear me? Okay, okay, thank you. Okay. So just briefly, can I, what I'm wondering in What I'm wondering in the way that this is going to go in the next few minutes, I'm sorry for interrupting. Is this completeness going to be with a fixed number of qubits in the ancillopree sense or a variable number of qubits where to show completeness, the number of qubits in the circuit has to grow or shrink? I'm not hearing the answer if people are speaking. It's a good idea. Can you hear me now? Yes. Okay, good. So it's not for a family of circuits. It's for it's really to. Ord circuits. It's really to prove completeness on individual circuits. But the point is that if you fix the size of the circuit, if you know that your circuit is of size seven, as I said before, you know that you will never use equations acting on more than seven qubits. So you can just take your equational theory, and if you know that you are going to apply it for the circuits of size seven, you can just forget about all the equations acting on more than seven qubits. Okay, that's interesting. Thank you. Interesting, thank you. Okay, so regarding the optical circuit, so you can describe the behavior using a matrix like this, which is essentially: so this entry, for instance, here is the amplitude to output, to have the photon here, if you input the photon here. And you can construct this matrix inductively. For instance, if you have two circuits in parallel, it's the direct by construction. The matrix is unitary. The matrix is unitary, and we have a universality result, which is a result from the 90s, which says that you can always represent a unitary transformation using a surprise of that shape. Okay, so we have introduced a complete equational theory for this language. So with Alex-Henro, Clement, Nicole Hartel, Scheinman-Field, and Benoit Valémon. And okay, so it's fairly simple. But and what is interesting is that the way we prove the completeness. That the way we prove the completeness is actually somehow constructive. Because what we do is that we slightly change the equational theory. So, this one is equivalent to the previous one. It's not very hard to see. There are just some redundancy. And the advantage of this one is that we can turn this equational theory into a rewriting system. And so, okay, so we get a rewriting system, and this rewriting systems has. And this rewriting systems has all the good properties. So thanks for the introduction to rewriting system previous talk. So it's terminating or notariant if you prefer. And it's continuous. So it means that if you have two possible paths, you can always close it. And so it means that we have normal forms, and the normal forms are of that shape. We recover this triangular shape circuit with some extra conditions on the angles to guarantee unicity. And this is how we prove completeness. Because if you take two optical circuits representing the same unitary, you can put both of them in normal form using the rewriting system. And the normal form, the unicity of the normal form, guarantees that you have here the same circuits. And so you have your path from C1 to C2. And in practice, you can even use this to actually prove, transform the circuits. Yes? That's a very good question. Yes, that's a very good question about the previous slide. So, in circuit equations here, you don't have a google for angles with the add-on. And in this equation series, we have things like P1 follow-up gives us some. So, yeah. I guess I was expecting to see some sound less for the problem. Yes, yes, so you can add it to the quantum circuit because it's obviously a true equation, but it can be derived from the Euler equation. From the Euler equation. So there are some particular parameters of the Euler equations. Well, you recover actually addition of parameters. I believe. Okay, so this is the completeness for optical circuits. And now the idea is to show that we have a complete equation theory, or more precisely, to construct a complete equation theory for quantum circuits. We can use the following compilation. Following compilation approach, which is that you take two quantum circuits, which are representing the same unitary transformation, and you are going to encode these two circuits into optical circuits, using an encoding. And this encoding should preserve the semantics. And so, this is not the usual encodings of quantum circuits into optics, because in general, the encodings that we are using to do quantum computations are non-deterministic. Do quantum computations are non-deterministic. They are probabilistic or post-selection or these kinds of things. Here, you really want to preserve the semantics. So, we use another kind of encoding, and this encoding are not efficient. You get a circuit which is optical circuit, which is exponentially larger than the quantum circuit, but it preserves the semantics. Then, by completeness, there is a way to show that these two optical circuits are equivalent. And then, the rest of the proof consists in lifting this. Proof consists in lifting this derivation to the quantum circuit using a decoding. This is the general idea of the proof because then you just need to fill the gaps and find enough equations on quantum circuits to be able to do these small steps. Okay, so this is the general picture. I think I don't really have time to go to the details, but there are lots of technicalities, essentially coming from the fact that the encoding and the decoding. Fact that the encoding and the decoding are not preserving the parallel composition, they are not monoidal because the tensor product, because the parallel composition is tensor product for quantum circuits and the direction for quantum optical circuits. So, you have to do lots of things. And well, and you have this kind of things, you start from a quantum circuit, you encode it into optical circuit, when you decode it back, you get this. And you have to prove that it's equivalent. And you have to prove that it's equivalent to the previous one. So you need somehow a basic algebra of control gates in order to show these equations. And okay, so that's a lot of work on these controlled operations, but at the end of the day, this is how we obtain this equation of theory. Okay, so just to conclude, we have this equation theory, which is complete, minimal. And as I said before, actually, for the minimality, and in particular, the necessity. And in particular, the necessity of equations acting on an unbounded number of qubits are generic in the sense that it does not really depend on this equational theory or on the generators. Any complete equational theory on quantum circuits requires equations acting on unbounded number of qubits. Okay, so it's not very good news, but that's the way it is. So if you really want to go around So, if you really want to go around this, the fact that you have here an infinite number of equations, there are ways to do this. And in particular, you can consider more expressive languages. If you consider quantum circuits and you add ancillary qubits with a qubit initialization and a qubit termination, then you get this equational theory, which is also complete. So, it looks like the previous. And so it looks like the previous one. There are some extra equations to the initialization. And you see that in this case, we can remove the unbounded equations. And so we can use ancillary qubits. And if you go to CPTP maps by just adding initialization of qubit and trace out, just discarding qubits, then you also have a similar result. Have a similar result. You have complete equation theory, and now it's acting on a bounded number of qubits, three qubits. Notice that this discard here, it's actually a general construction. When you have a language for pure quantum mechanics, you can add this discard, and there is a construction with recipe to transfer a result like universality or completeness from the original one to the new one. To the new one, CPP maps. Yep, I'm done. Are we time for just one question, Peter? Oh, I bet the one question. This better be a good question. Sorry, I wonder if you restricted all your generators to be of determinant one, you could do that, right? Because the rotation. You could do that, right? Because the rotation you can also write it as a diagonal matrix of the terminal plot up to a scalar. Would you then still get this unbounded requirement to have an equation on an unbounded number of qubits? Good question. This is you want it to be a good question. Excellent. So, and actually, yeah, so here in the presentation, I was a little bit cheating because I'm talking about quantum steps up to global phase because I'm not representing global phases, but actually, this determinant invariant is not working if we are working up to global phases. So the good way to do it is to work with quantum circuits with global phases, at global phases, and use the determinants and so on on these circuits. And then we can show that if you get rid of the robot phases. The of the phases, the necessity is still working. So, I think that if you change the definition of your generators, then we can have something similar. And I think it's going to. What I'm saying is not the same as working of your global phase, it's because when you control one of those, the phase actually does matter, right? Yes. So, but you're saying in some cases that you've done, you still have this return of. We still have the strict line of an equation. Well, okay, maybe we can double-check with the generators you want to use, but I would say that, yeah, I would say that probably we still need it. Okay, that's interesting. Very depressing. Thanks, Evan.
