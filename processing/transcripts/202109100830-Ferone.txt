Territ approach, please. Okay, thank you for the presentation, and thank you to all of the organizers for this opportunity to talk in this very nice and interesting conference. And what I will do is to report about some results con obtained in collaboration with the Bruno Wolzune. The Bruno Waldzuna, which have recently appeared. And they are about the possibility to symmetrize to symmetrize, to obtain symmetrization results for problems concerning the fractional Laplacian. This is not a new argument. I mean, there are already results in this direction. And essentially, I will point out my attention to the Attention to the way we have got these results, and I will explain during the talk. So, what I mean by synthetization, many some of the talks I've heard up to now, I have seen that some people use signatures, use The properties of rearrangements, and essentially, nowadays, classical results concern this meritation for local problems like the one which is written here. So, in which the operator is an elliptic operator satisfying the usual condition of ellipsicity. So, what is known? What is known and is that if we start with this problem, which I numbered with one, then symmetrizing the right-hand side and transforming the operator in Laplacian, where the constant in front is exactly equal to the constant of ellipticity, then the problem which maximizes the solution is the one. Is the one which has on the right-hand side what we call f star, which is the Schwarz symmetricization of the function f, and it is defined on the ball, which I denote by omega star. Then if this is the for this problem, so if v solution of this problem, then we have the point-wise estimate that u star is less or equal than v. So just a few. them so just a few words maybe all of you know about this result anyway just a few definitions well with omega star i will denote the ball centered at the origin having the same measure as omega and u star denotes the schmart similarization of u that is the function which has whose level sets are both and the measure of each bolt of each The measure of each bolt of each of these bolts is coincides with the measure of the corresponding level of the function u. Obviously, all these balls are centered at the origin. Sometimes we use this constant omega n, which is the measure of the unit pole in our n. So, a consequence, a possible consequence of this result is, for example, the fact that any normal view The fact that any norm of U can be estimated in terms of the norm of V, and being V the solution of a symmetric problem, they can be explicitly computed sometimes. Okay, this result goes back to Weinberger, Marja, and in the way I will show you now is related to the result by the paper by Talent in 76. So, what is the idea which gives us the proof of this result? Okay, the first idea is to use the equation in order to write down an inequality like this. call it like this. Here I've used the minus t over the t over the integral where u is greater than t of gradu square just because this makes clear something which I will say later. But actually if you look this quantity this is nothing else that integral over the set where u is equal to t of the gradient of u, so of the normal derivative of u. So this is what comes from integration This is what comes from integrating the equation ball on the level set of U. And on the right-hand side, here I have already written there is a lesser equal because when you symmetrize F, then the integral of the level set of view of F is majorized, but the integral of the level set of U star of F star. Now, the way The way chosen by Italy uses the Schwarzenegger, the Fleming-Gricher formula, the iso-barium inequality, in order to transform this inequality in an inequality which involves only a star. And from this first order differential inequality, one is able to get the inequality u star less than equal than. Star less or equal than P. Now there is a slightly different approach, which is due to Lyons, Pedro Lyons in 81, where he observes that actually one, it is not necessary to use this part, the second part of the argument. Argument, it is enough to start from inequality three in order to get the differential inequality involving U star. And this comes out from the observation that one can apply what is known as a Polarzigo principle, which says that for the function in H one zero, then the gradient of the function decreases under synthetization. Decreases under synthetization. So he uses this inequality in order to transform three in the differential inequality, which is necessary to prove the comparison principle. So he observes that actually this derivative can be written as if we As if we pass to the differential portion, can be written as the integral of graduate squared over a set where u is greater than t and lesser than t plus h with t greater than zero. And then one can apply to this integral, because the truncation of u is still a sublife function, one can apply to this integral the Polyzig inequality. Polytic inequality. And so, from this observation, one ends up directly with the same inequality as I have shown before, but now on the left-hand side, there is u stars. There is already the function u rearrangement. So, at this point, this integral here and the integral here and the derivative can be easily computed. And in particular, this is computed in order to write this integer as the derivative of u star. And finally, one ends up with minus derivative with respect to r of your star less or equal than this quantity here. So the function v satisfies the same inequality as an equality and the comparison follows. And the comparison follows. Okay, the application of these arguments is very wide. Many, many long list of application can be made. And actually, also the case where the elliptic problem involves Involves if a non-local operator has been already studied. And so an equation like minus Laplacian, Laplacian delta S U equal F has been studied. And actually, some symbolization results have already been obtained. And the paper recently are just a few of papers where this are. Where this argument, where this result has been obtained, this kind of result has been obtained. But the way the result is obtained is in some way indirect, in the sense that they use the possibility to obtain the solution of the fractional problem via a suitable extension problem. Problem defined on a cylinder. And this goes back to a well-known paper by Cafare and Silvestre and others. And so you can apply the classical similarization techniques to the problem about psi. And these symmetries techniques are known as a Steiner symmetrization in the sense that they In the sense that they involve for each fixed y only the variable x, which is in omega, which is the section of this rider. So it is well known when you apply this kind of similarization, the natural result which one expects is an integral comparison. It's not a pointwise comparison, but this comparison result, which is about the function. Which is about the function psi, transfers a mu, which is the trace of psi, and so they obtain the comparison in terms of mass concentration. I will say something about this later, and actually, I say in the next slide. So, the typical theorem which one can prove is the one which is here, which is also. Is the one which is here, which is also in our paper. So I report here our paper, but actually it is in all the previous paper, the same result, where we have that if we symmetrize the right-hand side, so F is substituted by F star, then U is majorized by V, and here there is the definition. The definition what I mean by u major by v, which I've already referred to as comparison of mass concentrations. This means that when you integrate the arrangement of U on any ball centered in the origin, this is less or equal than the integral of this star on the same pole. Maybe. Maybe all of you know that this is obviously weaker than the pointwise estimate, but however, for the application which I was talking about, the application about the possibility to estimate the norm in L P of the function u in terms of the function b. Okay, this inequality is still sufficient to get. Sufficient to get a sharp estimate of the LP norm, for example, of your star of you. Okay, so what I would like to point out is that the interest of what I'm going to say is the fact that the argument we have used in order to prove this result seems to be new and especially seem to be very flexible. Flexible, and they are based in particular on the second approach, on the fact that we wanted to state a kind of polyadzigo principle in this in this context. It seems, and there are still some work in progress, that the possibility to extend this result to Extend this result to different problems seems possible. So we hope to get the result in other direction using this method. So just a word about the optimality. One could wonder if, for example, one can get a pointwise estimate, but it is possible to build some example, for example, when f is. Example for example when f is equal to the modulus of x in R and the rearrangement will be one minus modulus of x over one minus f and it is okay this can be done explicitly and actually we have proved this for NES that is that for NES it is not possible to get pointwise estimate of the rearrangements for this example. For this example, and actually, this is due to the fact that here there is s equals 1/4, 1/1, 3/4, and s equal 1. Then, close to the boundary of minus 1, 1, close to the boundary, the line, the blue line, which is the solution U, stays above the purple line, which is the solution V. So, in all of these Of these cases, except for the cases equal to one, which corresponds to the local case to the local problem. Okay, let's give, I think, 10 minutes. I think that I should be able to say something about the method. So, there are two key steps, in my opinion, which are in some sense. Some sense new and maybe are interesting for the possible application to other situations. And the first one is to deduce an inequality for U star similar to the one which has been obtained via the Polyad-Ziego principle. And this time we use the so-called Ritz rearrangement inequality. So for simplicity in what we say. For simplicity, in what we see written below, we take f non-negative and regular, so also u is non-negative. And I consider the equality, the weak formulation of the problem. And we put as a test function, a truncation of you with the class. A truncation of u with the classical truncation gth, which is written here. So we put this into this integral. And so we everywhere where you find the phi, you have to put g. So what we use? We use this inequality, which is Which can be found in the paper, celebrated in the very well-known paper by Almergen and Lieber, but continuity of rearrangement from 89. And in this paper, they state and we prove in a Ritz rearrangement inequality, which is written as by saying that the double integral of a function of two functions f and g times g times the third function w is less or equal than the same double integral where f g and w are symmetries and then they also have this inequality which is a kind of arduitive inequality but in order to have this inequality the main hypothesis that f is a continuous function which is zero to the origin and satisfy this inequality which means that the which means that the second derivative, the second mixed derivative of f with respect to v is non-negative when f is regular. But it is not necessary that f is regular. It is enough that this inequality is true. So going back to the weak formulation, we want to prove, we want to prove that this inequality here is satisfied. Is satisfied that is when you symmetrize u, the integral where there is ux minus y times gth u minus gth u in x and y divided x minus y to the power n plus 2s is greater or equal than the same quantity with the symmetrized function. Okay. In order to do this, we use the representation as an integral of the first quantity, the integral of a quantity I alpha uth, which is written here. This is just an equality. And as you can see, when you write this in this way, you have here a function. A function which depends on ux and uy, and then you have here kind of w. In this case, the function w is already rearranged, it's already decreasing with respect to the argument. So we can try to apply the Ritz rearrangement of inequality. It turns out that high alpha UTH risk-grider than I alpha. which is the inequality which we want and w is the function which I was saying before and the function f capital F is this function u squared plus V squared minus U minus V G th minus G Th and it satisfies the required assumptions so we can apply and then we obtain that this And then we obtain that this integral is greater or equal than this, and this is a chance enough to obtain the desired inequality. So in the end, we have an inequality and now this quantity here is in some sense the analogous sort of quantity which was obtained via Polyazigo principle. Now there is Now there is a technical part which concerns passage to the limit as h equals to zero. And I skip this part, but what I want to discuss is just the kind of inequality which we obtain. In the left-hand side, there is a double integral which looks like an integral on a ball of the integral. On a ball of the integral of outside of a ball, and okay, in the right-hand side, there is the integral of star. So, in some sense, this quantity can be looks like an integral ball of the Laplacian, of the S Laplacian of U star. And what turns out, which is maybe useful. Maybe useful also in other situations is that when you integrate this quantity, then you end up with the S-Laplacian of an integral of u. More precisely, one can define the spherical mean function capital U as one over x to the power n times the inter between zero and x of your star over rho rho to the power n minus one rho, which is essentially the Minus one the rho, which is essentially the average of you on a ball. And this, the double integer, which was written before, is nothing that r to the power n times a n s Laplacian. But what changes in this operation is the fact that Is the fact that it is computed not on Rn but in on R to the power n plus 2. So it is not just the S Laplacian as before, but it is an S Laplacian in higher dimension of the function UR. In order to compute this formula, we have used some formulas. Formulas contained in paper by Ferrari Birbiski, where they give formulas for the Laplacian of radial functions. So, in the end, what we can say is that the S Laplacian of U, of capital U, is less or equal than one of the average, if you like, of F star. f star so the function v and the corresponding corresponding spherical mean capital V satisfy the same equation but with equality sign and then one obtains that capital U is or equals less or equal than capital V and this implies that U is marginalized by V in terms of In terms of the definitions, the definition which I have given before. So this ends for the first part of the proof. Then the inequality about the energy follows from this. And I will skip this. I want just to conclude by saying that actually the The result we have found reduces to the result of the case of the local operator when S goes to one because the inequality which we have found with S here, so the S here and the S here, becomes this one, and a straightforward computation shows. A straightforward computation shows that this quantity is just minus star prime over r, and this is minus v prime over r. And so if we take our approach and we put test which goes to one, then we recover the point-wise estimate as obtained, for example, in the paper by palette. Okay, I think that I can stop here. Thank you for your attention. I just should be. I just should be on time, I think. Yes, you are. So, thank you very much, Vincetta, for the beautiful talk and the very nice result. If anyone has questions, please feel free to ask.
