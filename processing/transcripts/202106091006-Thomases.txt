And for organizing the wonderful JN and FM seminar series, which has been quite a service to the community. I also want to thank the organizer of the BERS Conference for a really lovely set of talks so far and also for allowing this seminar to be cross-listed and included in the program. So I'll begin by saying that microorganism locomotion in complex fluids is a highly nonlinear problem. A highly non-linear problem. The aspect I will focus on today involves how the gait or kinematics of a swimmer is coupled to the fluid environment, although there really is so much more to the story. So I'll review a few results from experiments in the past 30 years to try to highlight some of the important questions that I want to address today. First of all, back in the 90s, experiments by Suarez showed us that sperm kinematics are significantly affected by both the fluid Significantly affected by both the fluid environment and the activity state of the sperm. The significant gait variations seen below were found for a range of viscosities as well as varying hyperactivity. These gate changes may be significant for important functionalities of sperm, such as fertility, but it's still unknown exactly what leads to these different waveforms. Some years later, Aratia started doing some systematic experiments with a range of microorganisms and asking the question. Microorganisms and asking the question, among others, does viscoelasticity speed up or slow down a microorganism? And as we see in this graph, experimental results appeared to be matching asymptotics, but there were inconsistencies with simulations. Further, experiments on CLAMI again revealed that viscoelasticity slows the swimmer down, but this time the slowdown was actually due to asymmetric speed boosts, i.e., speed on both power. i.e., speed on both power and return strokes were enhanced, leading to net slowdowns due to a higher boost during the return stroke. So, this, of course, beds to the question: why? And how could we get at the mechanisms affecting these speed changes? It isn't straightforward to measure things like elastic stress accumulation in an experiment, particularly with biological organisms. And not only that, as was shown in these experiments, the gait and the fluid rheology are intimately coupled. Rheology is intimately coupled. When you change the fluid, the gait changes. So it is impossible to decouple those effects from these experiments alone. Now, more recently, work by Guasto et al. showed that sperm flagellar shapes are actually more linked to the fluid environment than to their family tree, which makes a very intriguing connection to adaptation. Namely, why are certain waveforms more likely to be seen in swimmers naturally adapted to a mucosal environment, such as human or bullfight? Coastal environments, such as human or bull sperm, rather than in sea urchin sperm, which naturally fertilize in water. All of these experiments highlight the interconnection between gate and environment and the complexity of this problem. They also hint that some answers might be achieved if we can decouple the fluid from the gate. So within that framework, we suggest that in order to dissect these coupled effects, we need to unlock the physical mechanisms related to microorganisms. Physical mechanisms related to microorganism locomotion. So, the biggest question we ask is: why are certain strokes preferable in certain media? Here in this talk, I will focus on the fluid-structure interaction or fluid-swimmer-body interactions. And in particular, we'll look at how different gates affect where and how much elastic stress is accumulated in the fluid. So I will examine flows near long, waving, flagella-like structures, and in particular focus on oscillating tails and orientation-dependent drag. And orientation-dependent drag. So, here I've highlighted some of the work that has been done to try to understand microorganism locomotion in complex fluids. And of course, this list is not exhaustive. You'll notice that some color coding coordinated with results suggesting swimming speed is enhanced in green or hindered in red indicate that this isn't a complete story yet. First, let me clarify that if I say a particular experiment shows an enhancement of swimming speed, what I mean is that Of swimming speed, what I mean is that the speed is enhanced relative to the Newtonian counterpart. But as we just discussed, there are coupled effects, in particular for living microorganisms. If you change the fluid, the stroke changes. So part of the work we as a community have to do to understand this complex problem is figure out what we learn from these various related but different experiments. So for example, considering the 2015 experiments on Clammy, the conclusion that viscoelasticity slows swimming speed is perhaps not as informative. Swimming speed is perhaps not as informative as the details of how that happens. I already mentioned that they observed boosts on both power and return stroke, which lead to net slowdowns. They also observed important gate changes, such as how the flagellar beating frequency depends on viscosity. I'll also point out the results of Espinosa, Garcia, Lauga, and Zenit, a physical experiment with a flexible tail swimmer in a viscoelastic fluid that saw very large viscoelastic speedups. And this, it Speedups. And this is related to the Turan, Fauci, and Shelley simulations where they observed speedups as well. And those computations specifically pointed out the importance of the finite length swimmer and the fluid structure interaction, both of which I'll talk about more today. But as I said before, we need to understand what we can learn from an experiment. Sometimes a simulation can help disentangle effects that are inherently coupled in an experiment, such as the gate and the fluid. And the fluid. So, first, I'll talk about the modeling that we do and how the setup of the numerical simulation is an essential part of the exploration into the relevant physical mechanisms. So the work I'll discuss here today derives from two different methods for simulating swimmers in a viscoelastic fluid. The earlier results I will show come from 2D simulations with a 1D filament representing either a flagella or a swimmer body in the case of a CL. Or a swimmer body in the case of a sea elegance. In the simulations where we want the emergent shape to be a result of the fluid-structure interaction, there we use a penalization method where we prescribe a target curvature that will result in a specified gate, but we allow for fluid-structure interaction to change the actual achieved gate. Now, the penalization parameter is both a numerical parameter as well as a physical parameter related to the body stiffness or body memory time. Body memory time. The second set of results I will show later come from both 2D and 3D simulations of a prescribed shape. For example, here you see the model of a clammy swimmer. And there, in this model, we have a 3D body and symmetric and planar 1D flagellar arms with a surrounding 3D fluid. And in these simulations, we prescribe the shape exactly, and therefore we can explore separately both gate changes and fluid changes. Changes and fluid changes. So, in both of these simulations, we'll be using the olderoid B model for a viscoelastic fluid, where the background force is used to prescribe the motion. And the way we prescribe the motion is due to a no-slip boundary condition on the body, which is enforced using variations of the immersed boundary method, as we heard about yesterday. Our viscoelastic fluid has two important dimensionless parameters, the Deborah number and the fluid modulus. And the older B modulus. And the older B model does a good job of capturing viscoelastic effects, such as storage of memory from past deformation on a characteristic time scale. But it really is just a starting place for theoretical exploration. And as all of you know, more complicated models are definitely needed to get exact details of the rheology. Now, from these movies, you can see that in these simulations, there are areas of large stress concentration that are indicated by the color scale. The color scale, and so numerical simulations need to be well resolved, which can be expensive, especially in 3D. And so, first I'm going to, now I'm going to present some results, and I'll start with these flexible swimmers to examine how body flexibility plays a role in the fluid-structure interaction for viscoelastic fluids. So, here, what are the physical mechanisms that lead to speed enhancements? Swimming speed ups are sometimes found. Swimming speedups are sometimes found for undulatory motion in a viscoelastic fluid, and two key features appear to be necessary. One, a preferable gait, in this case, a particular large tail amplitude, and two, body flexibility. As you see over here, when the swimmer was stiff, meaning the target curvature is achieved, neither the keeker stroke nor the burrower stroke actually sees a speed up. But when you have both a soft Both a soft kicker, then you actually see these non-monotonic speedups, as in the Tram, Fauci, and Shelley paper. So, how does body flexibility lead to these swimming speedups? Well, the answer is that swimmers can get a speed boost from body flexibility. Here I'm showing results from the Terran Fauci Shelley on the left. And in particular, you can look down here to see the different shapes that are achieved. And you can see that these shapes are not equal in the different types. Are not equal in the different types of fluids. Again, the importance is that these simulations were for a finite length undulatory swimmer with a large tail amplitude, and the enhancement's not monotonic. And in fact, by Deborah number five here, you see that this is behind the Newtonian swimmer. On the right, similar speedups were observed by this physical experiment where they put a micro swimmer in a viscoelastic fluid that had a flexible ore for a tail. And there they found monotonic speed ups. And there they found monotonic speedups beyond around debris number one, nearly doubling the swimming speed. Both groups acknowledged that shape changes were seen in the different fluids, but in neither case was the significance of those shape changes explored. I highlighted these changes in this yellow here. They're subtle changes at the tips. Finally, I'll point out that the biggest difference between these two experiments is how they vary the Debra number. In the simulations, the Debra number is varied by changing the relaxation time. But in the experiments, it was the frequency of oscillation that was. it was the frequency of oscillation that was varied. Of course, in a simulation, it's easy to vary the Deborah number either way, so that was what we did. And we can see from this graph here in the middle that there really is something going on. When the swimmer body is soft, varying the Deborah number by varying the period, as was done in the physical experiment, leads to significant monotonic speed ups. By comparison, varying the Deborah number by varying the relaxation time yields a smaller non-monotonic boost in swimming speed. Of course, Boost in swimming speed. Of course, this is only when the body is soft, and so we can see that there is another important dimensionless parameter here coming from the body stiffness. And this is this related to the sperm number, which we call the body relaxation time. With this additional dimensionless parameter, now we can see why varying the Debra number two ways gives us such different results. Because of course, when you vary the period to change the Debra number, you are varying both Deborah number and G. Deborah number and G, whereas using the relaxation time to vary Deborah number can be done for a fixed value of this body stiffness. So this explains why the two different experiments can give such different results, sorry, how, but not really why. And for that, we needed to see what effect this body time scale was having on the swimmer shapes and the resultant motions. And we could do this using asymptotic analysis, which this work relied on some ideas from the 2007 work of Fu Wogle, Myth and Power. 2007 work of Fu Woolgelmuth and Powers, where they looked at shape changes in flexible filaments due to viscoelasticity. We were able to apply similar results to the case of large amplitude motion by using curvature deviations as our small parameter. And we found that the asymptotic analysis predicts that for soft swimmers, the amplitude of the swimmer is larger in viscoelastic fluids than in Newtonian fluids. One way to see this live is here to look at this movie, where if you stare at it for long enough, you see that the viscoelastic swimmer in red tracks the target. In red tracks the target shape, which is in black, better than the Newtonian swimmer. There's an amplitude boost at the tail. Both of these are soft swimmers, so they do not achieve the target. They're floppy, but some of the stiffness is restored by viscous elasticity. And this effect is actually increases with increasing fluid elasticity. Of course, this effect goes away as the target is achieved because then the swimmer, the simulations do not allow for any body-fluid structure interaction. Any body-fluid structure interaction. Now, to go back to this graph, we can see the theory, the asymptotic theory here is in the lines, and the numerical simulations are in the markers, and they are nearly on top of each other. Now, this also works, this is for the small amplitude data, but this also works remarkably well for large amplitude shapes. And so we see that if you prescribe a curvature amplitude and the swimmer is soft, the fluid is viscoelastic, the swimmer shape in the viscoelastic. The swimmer shape in the viscoelastic fluid will track the target shape better, i.e., there's small amplitude boosts at the tips that lead to a that should lead to a swimming speed boost. Although here we're just talking about looking at amplitude boosts. So how do these affect swimming speed? So we compute an analytical swimming speed in a Newtonian fluid that will measure the effect of these shape changes alone. To do this, we define a stroke Deborah number, which parametrizes the gate changes as the fluid changes. As the fluid changes, but we calculate a swimming speed, which is the speed of the swimmer in a Newtonian fluid, with these observed gate changes, i.e., the amplitude boost we were just talking about. And as we saw for soft swimmers, more of an amplitude boost that increases with Deborah number. This will translate into large swimming speed boosts for the soft swimmers. For moderately soft swimmers, you see a smaller boost. And for stiff swimmers, there's no boost because, of course, there is no fluid structure interaction. There is no fluid-structure interaction. Now, in the fully non-linear simulations, which include both the effects of the fluid elasticity and the body flexibility, we see that these swimming, the qualitative behavior of these different regimes is preserved. And in particular, if we look at the low amplitude regime, you see that you have these three regimes, and then there's maybe some additional effect which kind of lowers the overall. effect which kind of lowers the overall boost from swimming in a viscoelastic fluid. Now in the high amplitude regime you still see these three different regimes. However in this high amplitude high Deborah number there is another something else going on which leads to these really large slowdowns and this is actually what gives you these really large concentrations of stress around the body. This is a log color scale which is why you see color everywhere. Which is why you see color everywhere. There is, in fact, an amplitude transition near the tips where the flow is close to an oscillatory extensional flow, and therefore regions of high stress will accumulate. So, this brings us to the oscillating tails. So now I'm going to talk about how these large stresses that are accumulating around the swimmers are the results of a Debra number-dependent Weisenberg number transition that relates to the swimmer body amplitude. And so, here, again, we are going to. So here again we are going to look at the stress accumulation in the two different low amplitude and high amplitude motion and the low Deborah number and the high Debra number. And here we're plotting scaled strain energy density, the trace of the stress for both the low and the high Denver number and the low and high amplitude. And the large stress accumulation at the tail only occurs in the high Denver number, high amplitude case. And this is also where the And this is also where the swimmer sees significant slowdowns. So, to mathematically understand this phenomena, we simplify this problem by studying oscillating extensional flow in the Stokes-Oldroid B model in three different ways. The first is purely theoretical, where we quantify the viscoelastic response to a fixed oscillating extensional point where the stress response is not coupled back to the velocity. Next, we consider a body force driving the oscillatory extension. driving the oscillatory extension, which is coupled. And finally, we model a we look at a model swimmer where the tail motion is driving the oscillatory extension. I know most of you are familiar with the viscoelastic response to linear flow for a given velocity, and we see that for pure extension, the olderoid B model predicts infinite extension beyond a critical Weisenberg number. But this changes for oscillatory extension, so let's see how. When the strength of the extension is oscillating in strength of the extension is oscillating in time with mean zero and period t. We prescribe a fixed velocity here where h of t is a periodic function with period one, mean zero, ranging from negative one to one. And so a represents a, this script a here represents the strength of the extension. And using these values and these parameters, we define the non-dimensional Deborah number and the Weisenberg number and the Weisenberg number and the scaled dimensionless polymer stress based on these relaxation time, the period, and the amplitude of the stretching. And at the origin, the diagonal components of the stress in the Old Roy B model satisfy the following ODE. And one can analytically solve for the max of the trace of the stress if h of t is a square wave. So now our periodic function just one and then negative one. And in that case, you get an expression that looks like this. Get an expression that looks like this, which is not particularly easy to parse, but in different asymptotic regimes, we can see that this is actually linear in Weisenberg for small Weisenberg number and exponential in Weisenberg number for large Weisenberg number. So we lose that infinite stress, but we still are getting, we lose the divergence of the stress, I should say, but we are still getting a transition. It's now a soft transition. And so these curves here are plots of this maximum of the. Our plots of this maximum of the trace of the stress as a function of both the Deber number and Weisenberg number. And so we see we have a soft transition which depends on the Deber number. And so, for example, in the case of Debra number is a half, this transition occurs between two and four. Now, in studies of locomotion, it's useful to consider how the speed depends on Deborah number for a given gate. So it's useful to consider how the stress depends on a relation, sorry, on the relaxed. Relation, sorry, on the relaxation time as an object changes shape with a fixed amplitude. So, in those problems, it's useful to consider how the stress depends on the non-dimensional stretch rate, which we call script A here, which is equal to the Weisenberg number over two times the Deborah number. So we plot that. Sorry, we plot the maximum of the stress of the stress versus Deborah number for a range of these amplitudes. And in this And in this non-dimensionalization, Debra number zero corresponds to the Newtonian flow. So we see here in the low Debr number regime where relaxation time is shorter than the period of extension before it starts turning around and compressing in that same point, the stress has more time to grow, leading to these interesting non-monotonic behaviors. Now, this is sensible when you think about it this way, but it does appear to be related to non-monotonicity in swimming speeds at low Deborah number that have been observed in the literature. Number that have been observed in the literature and not really well discussed. But again, so what we see here is that we have a large regime of sort of large stress that happens for low Debra number and in this theoretical expression. To compare the swimmer simulations with this theory, we found it instructive to first go to a coupled simulation. So we prescribe oscillatory extension in a four- Oscillatory extension in a four-roll mill, periodic geometry. And now we define the Weiserberg number based on the strain rate, gamma dot, which for in a Newtonian fluid with our definition here of this alpha, which is related to that script A, this in a Newtonian fluid, this gamma dot would be 2 alpha. Due to the coupling with the stress feedback, this could change, but we find that the scaling holds really reasonably well, even with the coupling in the highly numbered. Even with the coupling in the highly nonlinear regime. So it's reasonable to use a similar scaling for the stress. And so, because gamma dot is approximately equal to 2 alpha. And so we scale the stress as we scaled it before. So now in this four-roll mill oscillating extension element flow, which is fully coupled, we're solving the Stokes-Oldroid B, which I've written in dimensional form here for some reason. Deborah number a half and Weisenberg number is 12. What we see, if we zoom in at the extensional point, If we zoom in at the extensional point, we see oscillatory extension as we expect. So, this is the time t equals zero when we begin our vertical stretching. And so, it's horizontally stretched because what I'm showing you is at equilibrium. And so, this horizontal stretch comes from t equals minus a half over here. And so, and again, there's this lag, which is proportional to the Deborah number. So, you are going from vertical stretch, sorry, horizontal, horizontal least. Sorry, horizontally stretched to over time, then the vertical stretch is coming and then oscillating back and forth. So to compare the results of the fully coupled simulations with the theory for the decoupled case, we actually numerically solve the ODEs we showed on the previous slide with instead of the H of T function being a square wave, we use a sinusoidal temporal oscillation. It's not possible to get an analog, well, it's not. possible to get an analysis well it's not possible we we were not able to find an analytical solution with sinusoidal temporal oscillation but we solved the odes um numerically and we make the same plots as before showing the max of the trace of the stress as a function of the dimensionless parameters in both the coupled case as well as the decoupled case the behavior of the stress with the sinusoidal temporal oscillation is qualitatively the same as that of the square wave oscillation so as before the stress So, as before, the stress as a function of Weisenberg number shows two regimes: a low Weisenberg number regime where the stress is linear and a high Weisenberg regime where the stress is exponential, and the transition again depends on the Deborah number. The agreement between the decoupled and coupled cases is quite good, but in the high Weisenberg number, low Debra number regime, where the largest stresses are expected, there is disagreement. And in this problem, we find, in fact, that the nonlinear We find, in fact, that the nonlinear coupling has the effect of reducing the stress rather than enhancing it. All right, so now we go to the flow near tips of waving flagella. And for this, we remove translation from the problem and examine just a standing wave oscillating with period T and curvature amplitude capital A. So this is my third A. We non-dimensionalize this as before, only using the amplitude as the proxy for the strain rate. The proxy for the strain rate. We'll see in a bit that this is a reasonable choice. First, we show plots of the stress accumulation in these flexors for low and high Weisenberg number at different phases of the period. For Weisenberg number equals one, the top set of graphs, the maximum is about 0.6, this dimensionless stress. And for Weisenberg number 10, we have large stress accumulation of around 20. The spatial distribution of stress is more. Spatial distribution of stress is more symmetric about the flex curve for the low amplitude case. And as I said, the low amplitude case corresponds to Weisenberg equals one. This value, as suggested by the theory, should develop for the purely oscillating extension is well in the linear regime. Whereas down here for Weisenberg equals 10 and Deborah number equals one, this is in the transition regime between linear to exponential, sort of the knee, closer to the exponential side. Exponential side. So, why is it reasonable to consider the flow near the tips as oscillating in extension? So, we can examine the flow near the tips by following particle paths in the Newtonian flow. So, these are particle paths in the Newtonian flow. In the top two figures, we highlight a portion of the particle path near the tip for the high amplitude, low and high amplitude flexor. So, here there's not much motion for the low amplitude, whereas for the high amplitude, it's moving quite a lot. And we measure to measure the strain rate near the tip. measure to measure the strain rate near the tip we first take the average of the strain rate over a set of trajectories which begin um at time equals zero which is flat in a sort of a region just above the tip of the flexor about five percent of the length of the flexor and in the lower left figure we plot this average gamma dot over a over a period for both a equals one in green and for a equals four in purple here and what we see is And what we see is the strain rate is oscillating periodically between about plus or minus two with a vaguely sinusoidal profile. And if you plot the temporal maximum of the gamma dot average in the neighborhood as a function of for a range of amplitudes, we actually see a pretty nice linear profile here, which has a slope of a 1.9. Has a slope of 1.98, so about two, which is consistent with basically saying that the strain rate at the tip is two times A. To examine the direction of stretching, we plot the eigenvectors with positive eigenvalue of the strain rate tensor, so gamma dot, scaled by the eigenvalue over a period on a particle trajectory that begins slightly above the flexor. So again, in that same picture. The flexor. So, again, in that same picture you saw in the previous slide. And in these plots, the dots are equally spaced in time and hence indicate the speed of the motion. The red dots correspond to the downstroke and the blue are the upstroke. And the three additional highlighted times here are at eighths of a period with t equals one-fourth and three-fourths when the flow is at rest. It's notable that the direction of stretching in the downstroke is perpendicular to the direction of motion. Perpendicular to the direction of motion in the upstroke, which is indicative of an oscillating extensional flow. But unlike the problems analyzed in the previous sections, there's now some rotation of the stretching direction, you know, given the fact that these are not straight lines. Also note that in the high amplitude case, there's a much more complicated path as well as a longer path relative to the amplitude. Because if we look at this, divide it, this here, this is. look at this divided this this here this is 20 uh four 20 divided by four is five here whereas you know two divided by one is two um although the trajectories change for different initial positions these are representative for a region of points in the fluid above or below the flexors near the tip this is a funny detail which is that i was making these graphs ages ago around st. Patrick's Day and they looked like four-leaf clovers so I found the one I liked the most and it turned into like my four-leaf clover of course I you know did that in green anyway You know, did that in green anyway? I should keep that. I should have thrown that up there, maybe next year. Anyway, so we concluded that near the tip, the fluid particles are experiencing an oscillating extension in this region, along with some rotation. So now we compare the results of the stress response for flexors with the analytic solution and the 4-Ohl mill simulations. And here we quantify the polymer stress around the flexor tip. So to do that, we define So to do that, we define the max of the trace sigma by averaging over trajectories similar to how we define the gamma dot. So we were only looking near the tip. And for sigma here, we chose the location of the patch of fluid where the average is taken to be the center of the centered on the spatio-temporal maximum. And we define that as the spatial average in that region. Now we're plotting the max of the traces of the stress for a range of Deborah number and Weisenberg again in order to compare with the theory. Theory. And so we plot the theoretical predictions for the sinusoidal decoupled case along with the simulations for the flexors. And the stress as a function of the Weisenberg number again shows linear behavior for low Weisenberg number and exponential behavior for high Weisenberg number. And at low Weisenberg number and Deborah number over here, the stress is. The stress is similar to the decoupled theory, but generally the stress response is larger for the flexor simulations than for the theory. And we just note that there is this regime here where things really start to deviate. And in fact, that actually is the regime we were trying to explain. So somehow, although what I've said was very interesting, I think, it didn't quite get at exactly what we were after, which was why is it actually like you get these really, really, really big stresses? Really, really big stresses now for high Deborah number and actually high Weisenberg number. So, um, so we explain this by looking at particle paths because in the low Denver number, low Weisenberg case, you have this stretch-de-stretch story, right? So the particles that are being stretched on the downstroke, then they get de-stretched on the upstroke. And this just happens periodically, and you get the accumulation as the theory predicts. Theory predicts. But somehow, in this more nonlinear regime where you have large amplitude, large Weisenberg number, now the stretch de-stretch no longer happens. This nonlinearity destroys the reversibility of these paths. And there is more accumulation of stretch because the stretching part is longer than the de-stretch part. So, and of course, just And of course, just reminding ourselves, this was all for flexors. So these were not translating. So, of course, these are in equilibrium, whereas swimmers are not. And the flow in the wake of a swimmer also is not in equilibrium. So particles experience this stretch, de-stretch for some time, but eventually the stress at that same Lagrangian point in the fluid will decay. Overall, the swimmer carries a wake of large stress as it stretches fluids nearby. As it stretches fluids nearby, you can see on the graph on the left here the stress over time for particles initially near the tip. And so, this red highlighted one is a single particle that starts out near the tip, and they exhibit large stress over some period of time, but eventually the particle is moved away from the tip. And so, this so this analysis is only partially relevant in the sense that for swimmers, the stress it keeps. The sense that for swimmers, this stress accumulation is a transient rather than a steady shape phenomenon. But it does explain, this theory does explain the role of tail oscillations in creating, or head oscillations, which I didn't really talk about, in creating large stress accumulation. So what about the orientation-dependent drag on a flagella? Now, we found our way to this story through studying the motion of the claminomonous algae cells in a viscoelastic fluid inspired by some experiments. Fluid inspired by some experimental results from the Aratia lab. So, a quick recap of those results. They measured how flagellar strokes change with viscosity and elasticity and saw net slowdown in swimming speed due to fluid elasticity. But this was further analyzed to show net speed, net boost in speed on power and return stroke with fluid elasticity. And you can see that here, this is the power stroke, and this is. And this is the return stroke, and you see some enhancement at the higher. This is as a function of viscosity. So, sorry, down here, let's see what we're gonna look at as a function of the Deborah number. You see enhancements for the higher Deborah number on power and return, but these enhancements were larger on the return stroke. And this led to these net slowdowns. But inherent stroke changes with fluid changes are unavoidable in this biological experiment. So, we can use our computational model with a prescribed shape to. Model with a prescribed shape to analyze stroke changes separately from fluid changes. So we use the experimental data to develop what we call a Newtonian stroke and a viscoelastic stroke. And the model prescribes the gait exactly. So we are able to vary the fluid properties, which in this case were just the Deborah number, independently in each stroke. You see here that the model captures the Newtonian speed quite well. And so with this validation, we proceeded to compare the performance of the different strokes. Compare the performance of the different strokes of different Deborah number. The first big result was that the polymer stress accumulates at the tips of the flagella, which is not a surprise having heard what we just heard, but at the time, this was kind of an interesting fact. And that's an order, this is a log scale. So this is an order or two orders of magnitude larger than the stress near the body or in other places around the swimmer. Now you can see some subtle changes in the difference between the viscoelastic and the newtonin stroke. Between the viscoelastic and the Newtonian stroke. In particular, the highlighted contours of a particular stress show that the tip stress is slightly larger for the Newtonian stroke. But the stress accumulation is more similar than different for these two different strokes. So let's just talk about the generic behavior. Generically, for both strokes, the polymer stress accumulates at the tips and more stress accumulates as the Deborah number increases. Unsurprisingly, this is just a linear increase in the strain. Linear increase in the strain energy. And we also saw that the stress, something else that we saw that's different is that the stress generally decreases during the power stroke and then increases during the return stroke. So just tuck that back in our mind. Now, when we look at the velocity as a function of time and the Deborah number, we see speed boosts on both power stroke and return stroke. These are indicative the Deborah number zero is really close to the Deborah number one half. So these are the, you can kind of see this as the blue line here. Of see this as the blue line here. This is the Newtonian. And when you go to debris number one, you get a mild boost. But by the time you get to debris number two, you get a much stronger boost here. But then the return boost is larger. And so this is consistent with the experiments that there is this net slowdown due to boosts on return stroke. Now, if we compare more detailed comparisons for the Newtonian and the viscoelastic swimmer, we see that the Newtonian swimmer is actually faster. In both strokes, there is a decrease in the swimming speed as a function of the Deborah number, but it's qualitatively the same when we look at the normalized speed, which is also relatively close to the experimental swimming speed. Now, if we turn to the power output, we see a much more striking difference. In particular, if we look at how the power increases with increasing fluid elasticity, it required a lot more energy or power to use a Newtonian stroke in the viscoelastic fluid. Newtonian stroke in the viscoelastic fluid at high Debr number. So, and this certainly correlates with the elastic to viscous stress ratio here, where the Newtonian stroke induced nearly twice as much elastic stress, but also had sort of a greater increase as a function of the Debber number. Now, it's interesting to note that, sorry, now if we turn to efficiency, we see that the efficiency decreases for both strokes as a function of Deborah number, but they're about equal. The viscoelastic stroke is slightly different. Equal. The viscoelastic stroke is slightly more efficient, and this becomes more pronounced as you increase the fluid elasticity. One interesting point about the power is that it was about the same amount of power output when we used the Newtonian stroke in the Newtonian fluid, its natural fluid, as well as the viscoelastic stroke in its natural fluid, which was Deborah number two. So this hints at a possibility of some sort of power limitation. But back to the elastic stress. But back to the elastic stress accumulation. We see both strokes accumulate a lot of elastic stress as you increase the Deborah number. And so we wanted to understand how that affects the dynamics of the problem. So a quick thought experiment. If you're swimming at zero Reynolds number and you freeze your stroke, what happens? Motion stops instantaneously. There's no inertia or coasting. But in a viscoelastic fluid, this is not so. Of course, the swimmer will continue moving in the direction it was traveling if you froze the stroke due to the If you froze the stroke due to the memory of past deformation, we quantify this by measuring the velocity at the moment when the stroke is frozen and compute the peak coasting velocity during both the power and return stroke. And these are streamlines, sorry, a vector field just of the sort of coasting effect. Now, we plot this peak coasting velocity on power in return and see it correlates strongly with the speed boost that's seen in the simulations. In the simulations. In particular, and it's notable again that the coasting velocity is larger here on return than on power. So the picture we have so far is that a speed boost due to fluid elasticity occurs on both the power and return stroke, and this correlates with the initial posting velocity due to accumulated elastic stress that's larger during the return stroke, potentially explaining these net slowdowns. But it still begs. Showdowns, but it still begs the question: why are the elastic stresses generally decreasing during power and then increasing during the return stroke? What's causing this asymmetric response? And the clues to the answer about the asymmetric response have to do with two things. One, the stress accumulates at the tips, and two, the orientation of the tips is different during power and return stroke. We demonstrate this here by measuring the angle between the swimming direction and the tip and see that it's closer to perpendicular or normal during the power stroke. Or normal during the power stroke and tangential on return stroke. This orientation dependence of the flagella is essential to how chlamies move at low Reynolds number or how any organism moves. The swimmer is taking advantage of the asymmetric force-velocity relationship, namely in a viscous fluid, it takes more force to drag a rod normal to the direction of motion than tangential, leading to higher velocities on power stroke than return stroke. But what we are seeing here is that viscoelasticity somehow reduces that advantage. So we analyze why this might be. So we analyze why this might be using a more classical geometry. Just move a thin cylinder in a 3D viscoelastic fluid and look at force-velocity relationships. We'll use finite length cylinders, which is essential to this phenomena, because the phenomenon is local to the tips. But due to the non-local interaction of the stress with the velocity via Stokes equation, those local effects have global consequences for the swimming dynamics. So how does elastic stress depend on orientation? What I'll present here is a theory. What I'll present here is a theoretical investigation into the relationship between orientation and elastic stress accumulation, and further how that translates into force on cylinders near tips. First, an important note about these simulations, to fully resolve the 3D flows around smooth cylinders, ours had spherical tips, we used a weakly coupled setup. Namely, we fixed the velocity and just computed the viscoelastic response by integrating the polymer stress along streamlines of the fixed velocity. This is sometimes called the weakly coupled limit, and in this limit, the strain energy density And in this limit, the strain energy density can be used to compute the first order correction to the force on the cylinder due to visco elasticity, which is what we present here. These results theoretically confirm both the CLAMI results as well as the simulations to the full non-linear problem with 1D filaments, which we presented in the supplementary info on our paper on the CLAMI. Now, we're going to present stretch rates for the velocity. This is the maximum real part of the eigenvalues of the velocity gradients, which gives an orientation-dependent stretch rate. If you just show the fiscous stress, it will be front-back asymmetric and doesn't provide orientation-related information as this stretch rate. But this stretch rate will also give a quantification of when the polymers in the fluid will undergo a coil stretch transition. We define this transition in terms of the Weisenberg number, which we've already discussed. So the stretch rates are different for tangential or normal motion. And we note that for a certain range of relaxation times, Certain range of relaxation times, namely between 1.8 and 2.9, the tangential motion will exhibit exponential growth while the normal motion does not. So this leads to a different critical Weisenberg number beyond which large stress growth is observed. So we see here that the coil stretch transition will occur at a critical Weisenberg number, but this critical Weisenberg number is different for the different orientations due to the fact that the stretch Due to the fact that the stretch rate is larger for the tangential motion. So these different critical values, two for the tangential motion and three for the normal motion, are computed from the velocity field. Namely, it's at those critical values that each flow should undergo a transition from low stress to high stress. Indeed, this is what we see. Beyond Weisenberg's number equals two or three, depending on if we're in tangential or normal motion, the strain energy density transitions from Energy density transitions from being quadratic in Weisenberg number to quintic. And the strain energy density at Weisenberg equals five, these blue or cyan circles, is plotted here. What we see in both cases is that we have undergone a transition to the large stress regime, but because the transition happens earlier in Weisenberg number for the tangential motion, the stress is about eight times higher in the wake for the tangential motion at the same Weisenberg number. At the same Weisenberg number. As we said, the strain energy density can be used to compute the first order correction to the force. So, to see what this effect has on the force, we measure a tip force by integrating this strain energy in the tip region and see that again, the tangential motion exhibits more localized force on the tip region of the cylinder than the normal motion. Again, this is only a first-order correction to the force due to viscoelastic effects. We see that at a high Weisenberg number, the tip A high Weisenberg number, the tip correction is nearly twice as large for tangential motion than for normal motion. This implies that the force-velocity relationship for these different orientations needs to be adjusted in viscoelastic fluids. We think this is a really significant result. The orientation dependence of elastic stress at the tips is reversed from the orientation dependence of force on velocity and resistive force theory and related viscous fluid theories, which form the basis of much of our intuition about microorganism locomotion without inertia. Locomotion without inertia. Classical viscous theories do not include these TIP effects, but these results and others, as we discussed today, suggests that the TIP has a special role in the elastic stress development, which has really not been analyzed in these swimmer problems. The importance of this TIP effect is highlighted in the CLAMI experiments and simulations. If you're as convinced as I am that these elastic speed boosts are related to the elastic stress development at the tips of the flagella, and this local effect of concentrated stress is The effect of concentrated stress is felt throughout the fluid due to the long-range effects of the Stokes equations. So, to conclude, we see that elastic stress accumulation near tips of swimmers can enhance swimming speed, but direction matters. So this can lead to slowdowns or speed boosts. And I'll just finish by saying that these mechanisms are, of course, only part of the story. There's still a lot to understand, such as the internal dynamics or active motors inside the flagella and how they interact. Inside the flagella and how they interact with the flagella body and fluid, because of course these organisms are active.
