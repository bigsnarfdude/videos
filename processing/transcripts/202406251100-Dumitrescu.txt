So, first of all, I would like to thank very much the organizers for the invitation. So, I will give a very brief overview about the linear programming approach for mid-3 games, and I will talk about theory, merits, and applications. And actually, the applications are in an area which is of large interest now to energy transition. So, the plan is the following. I will start with the The plan is the following. I will start with the brief context about midfield games and then about the climate change. Then I will talk about the linear programming approach, theory, and MERICS. And finally, about the application to an entry-exit game. I will do the setting without common noise. And probably I will not have time for the setting with common noise, but if you have questions, I can answer. So I will skip this introduction because I think. This introduction because I think everyone knows that midfield games are a useful tool to describe large population games with symmetric interactions. And MIMF games, as you see, are a very natural tool to describe the interactions between different actors in the energy market. So which is the standard mean field game formulation? The standard mean game formulation is the pole. So you fix a flow of probability measures, μt, then you Then you solve a standard stochastic control problem for the fixed mu T. And assuming that you have, let's say, uniqueness, an optimal control problem, you say that you have a multi-year game equilibria if the rule of x along the optimal control coincides with mu. Okay, so you have a fixed plot. So which are the different approaches? So, which are the different approaches which have been developed so far? So, this is the PD approach, which was initiated by Last Rivience. So, it consists in a coupled system of partial differential equations, an HGB equation backward in time, which is standard in stochastic control. And then you have a Fokker-Planck equation to describe the evolution of the population. Then you have the probabilistic method, which is based on the population. Method which is based on the forward-backward system of equations, okay, which are coupled and they are also of McKinney-Lassov type. And finally, we have the so-called vectification methods, which allow to solve the problem undermined assumptions by relaxing the concept of equilibria. So, here we have two possible approaches. We have the controlled martini approach, which in the case of Approach, which in the case of regular control has been initiated in the MINTU game theory by Daniel Laper. And then we have the linear programming approach that we introduced together with Gérardine Pouvret and Peter Tankoff in the case of optimal stopping in 2020. So, medical games with regular control have received a lot of attention in terms of mathematical treatment and applications. I will not give citations because Give citations because for sure I will not be able to cite everyone who worked on this area, but many people in this room have contributed. And then, in contrast, optimal stopping MIMFI games represent a new trend. So, here we have, I think the first one who introduced these MINFI games of optimal stopping in a particular setting is Marcel Nut, and then Carmena de la Lecker in the case of Bank Fran models. Then Charles Bertucci worked. Tuchi work introduced the PDE method, okay, so the analytic approach. Then we have the linear programming approach, and then there is a paper which has been already mentioned where they use the supermodular metric gates. And then for optimal stopping of marking flash of dynamics is the paper of Jiang Feng, Lizar and Mehdi. Okay, now about climate change and Now about climate change and energy transition, I think that everyone knows that the aim is to increase renewables which have to replace carbon intensive energy sources in order to reduce the global warming emissions. And in the net zero emissions, by 2050 scenarios, renewables allow electricity generation to be almost completely decarbonized. Which are the two key strict Are the two key strategies in the energy transition process? So, the first one is to wrap up renewables, and the second one is about demand side management, which is a dual of two approaches. One is energy savings, and the other one is demand response. And as you will see, to implement each of these strategies, meaningful gains appear as a very useful tool for modeling. So, in the context of So, in the context of the two strategies that I presented, we can either have a mean field between producers. Okay, so here are some papers, or we might have mean field between consumers. Here also I have a selection of different papers. There are two, I mean, there are the midfield games for midfield games, but we also have Stackelberg Minfield games, okay, in the principal agent version. version when we are when it is about the design of context okay so I'll talk now about the linear programming approach theory and numerics so what is the linear programming formulation as mentioned previously it is a compactification technique which is inspired by works on Inspired by works on linear programming formulation of stochastic control problems, on which mainly Stockbridge has worked. They are related to the controlled martingale problem approach, which I said was applied to mitigate regular controls by Becker. The controlled martingale problem approach is very nice because you can get existence results of an equilibria. Distance results of an equilibria. The disadvantage is that the results are very abstract. You cannot propose numerical algorithms. The linear programming approach is particularly suitable for mini-field games with optimal stopping or regular control with absorption or singular control, if you want, because it allows to deal in a nice way, let's say, with the lack of regularity of the flow of measures. Okay, because in the case of optimal state, Because in the case of optimal stopping, the flow of measures is not continuous anymore with respect to time. As you can imagine, there are many players who can exit suddenly the game, so there is a discontinuity in the flow. And which makes actually the PD approach much more difficult to use. And there are many applications to optimal stopping minfield games, to investment timing, industry dynamics, and so on. So when you think about the So, when you think about the PD approach, you have two objects. You have the value function of the representative agent, and you have also the distribution of the population. Whereas when we use the linear programming formulation, we don't iterate back and forth between the value function and the population dynamics, the problem being formulated exclusively in terms of the population measure flow. The condition that the measure flow The condition that the measure flow corresponds to the flow of marginal laws of a control stochastic process gives a linear constraint on the measure flow. And this formulation simplifies the theoretical analysis of the problem. I'm thinking here about the existence of equilibrium. And also it's a method which allows to propose numerical algorithms. Now the problem Now the problem, so the linear programming formulation is related to mixed controls, okay, mixed strategies, and this is not a problem in the case of minimal games because different agents might use different strategies. And we also get equivalence to strong formulations under appropriate assumptions. So, how the mean field games of optimal stopping can be described, but the problem is strong foundation. Described, but the problem is strong formulation. So we have an agent. Here I consider the case when there is no common noise. So each of them has an state equation is driven by your brown motions, which are independent. So here I present the simplest case where my coefficients do not depend on the measure and I don't have control, so only optimal stopping. So this is based on this paper. Based on this paper, but we have an extension to the case where we have control and also coefficients which might depend on the measure in this second paper. So which is the problem that each agent aims to solve? So let's say that I take the I-the player, he wants to solve this optimal stopping problem where the flow of measures n, capital N minus one, represents the The empirical distribution of the state processes of the players who are still in the game. So you'll see here that I have indicator functions that T is smaller than tau k, where tau k is the exit, the optimal stopping time of the player k. And then mu n minus one represents a probability measure, which is the joint temporary distribution measures to and x to. So this will be a flow of sub. So this will be a flow of sub-probability measures because of the fact that the players can exit the game. And we look for a mesh equilibrium, which is the linear game formulation. So this is the state process of the representative agent. Then we have the optimal stopping of the representative agent where we fix a flow of sub-probability measures mt and the probability measure mu. So we expect by propagation of chaos. We expect by propagation of chaos type results that m n and v n would converge towards these measures, which are the yes. So by propagation of chaos type results, we assume that we get mn, which converges to m which is deterministic here, and mu n would converge to mu. Now let's assume that I have a unique stopping time for the previous problem, which depends on m and mu. And then we say that we have an equilibria if these two equations admit a fixed point. So m that I get as an input is the probability of the kilt process x at the stopping time to, and mu corresponds to the joint law toe x2. As shown in the paper I've shown. As shown in the paper of Charles Bertucci, there are counterexamples of existence of an equilibria, a strong equilibria associated with stopping times. And this is mainly due to the fact there might be an indifference region of the back measure, which is strictly larger than zero. So it's very natural to have relaxed solutions. So which is the linear programming formulation? Which is the linear programming formulation for optimal stopping, so no mean field interaction. So we solve this problem where I take the supremum here over all measures which satisfy this constraint for all test functions u, which are C1, 2 with bounded derivatives. How do we get this idea, let's say, about this constraint? It's very It's very simple. You just take, you pick a stopping time and then you consider the measure associated to the stopping time, m toe and mu tau. You apply to this formula and you take the expectation and you observe that you get this constraint and also the criteria to optimize can be rewritten in this form by introducing the measures. So, of course, that this set R is larger than the set of measures induced by stopping times. Induced by stopping times. But we get some characterization in terms that this set is the minimal one which is convex and compact. So a very important thing is that this set has two nice properties, convexity, and we can show also the compactness. So under appropriate assumptions on the coefficients, the one that I insist on is the fact that F is only measurable with respect to time, to T. Respect to time to t, and we need this because then we have to plug in the mean field term to be discontinuous with respect to time, we show that this problem admits a maximizer. Let's now go to the mean field formulation. So I fix m bar mu bar. So I didn't introduce all space because yes? I think I understand it and that's nothing about because you explain it later why it's called a linear program. Play the why is it called a linear program? Yes, because the criteria to optimize is linear with respect to m and μ and the constraint is linear as well. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay, so here I don't introduce the spaces, but this is a space of measures, of sub-probability measures, which is endowed with the topology of weak convergence. Nu is the set of probability measures, which again is endowed with the weak. Endowed with the weak topology. And I define the criteria that I want to optimize. And you see that here, and I apologize for the fact that here I should have bar. It's easy to say. So I should have bar here and mu bar as well. So you see that now I include the dependence of f and g on m and mu. And we say that m star mu star is a L P Nash equilibria if The L P Nash equilibria if first of all it's admissible, so it belongs to the set R. And then for all admissible mu, we have this condition, okay. And again, under appropriate assumptions on the coefficients, there are mild assumptions, we show that we have at least one LP mesh equilibrium. Okay, so we use tools from set-belield analysis, in particular the capital. In particular, the Kakutan-Nifan-Guiesberg theorem. So, which are the main theoretical results that we get, so besides uniqueness, we get uniqueness of the value of the representative agent at equilibria, but this is only in the case when the coefficients do not depend on the measure, because if the coefficients depend on the measure, then this admissibility set will depend on the measure as well. As well. Then we get a link between occupation measures and randomized stopping times, and also a minimality property of the set of admissible measures R. So this would corresponds to the closure of the convex hole of measures associated with topic times. Then we show how to construct an approximate Nash equilibria for games with finite number of players. We also establish a rigorous link with the other notions of military games equilibria, in particular the notion of mixed solutions introduced by Charlotte in his paper. And we obtain existence of the solution under weaker assumptions and also the control martingale approach. And also we extend these results to the case of mid-regames in discrete time with common noise and partial observation. Now a bit of numerical algorithms, because I said that this method is nicer than the control martingale approach, because we can do some implementations. So in the case of regular control without absorption, there's an important literature on numerical algorithms. So here we have different methods, either analytic methods or probabilistic approaches. So the papers, so people contribute Archduke, Guerron, Laurier. Contribute Arto, Guerron, Laurier, Chatham, Clichan, Des Rouge. Another method, which is based on the fictitious play algorithm, which is a learning procedure, has been introduced by Cardania Adi Carlo in the context of MIFIGAMES with regular controls by using this PD system. In the case of MIFIA games with optimal stopping, there are very few algorithms. So one of them is introduced by Introduced by Charles in the case of non-potential stationary immediately gains under a strict monotonicity condition. And then, in the case of optimal stopping and regular control with absorption, we introduced a fictitious linear programming algorithm that I will describe now, for which we also prove the theoretical convergence. So, how this algorithm looks? So, how this algorithm looks like actually is quite simple. So, we start with an admissible measure and then for a number of iterations, what we do, we compute the best response math. So we take M here, which is at the previous iteration. We compute the best response at this map. Okay, then we updated the measure flow, which will be a Which will be a convex combination between M at the previous iteration plus a coefficient times the best response that we have here. So this is the convex combination that we take. So we can rewrite this as the average of all best responses. And how are we assess convergence? We monitor what we call the expression. We monitor what we call the exploitability error, and I think this was first used in some papers by Matthio Laurier and Rome Ardelli, I think. And this exploitability error shows how far is the output of the algorithm from being a true equilibrium. Okay? So this is, of course, then we have the discretization part. So this is just the idea of the algorithm, but then we have also, of course, can increment and discretize the problem. Discretize the problem. So now I will talk briefly about the entry-exit game. So, which are the questions, which is the idea of the model? So, we have conventional producers going to exit the market and renewable producers who enter the market. And the producers interact through the electricity price. Which are the questions? So, one of the questions is: which are the effects of the interaction and Which are the effects of the interaction and of the market mechanism on the long-term price levels and the renewable penetration? So, at which speed renewable energy will replace conventional type of energy. And then in a second paper that I probably don't have time to talk about is which are the impact of the uncertainty on future carbon pricing and the scenario uncertainty, which is determined by the uncertainty on future climate policies on the dynamics of the electrical industry. Industry. Okay, so and of course, that mathematical resolution is based on this linear programming approach. So the conventional producers, very briefly, so each conventional producer has a marginal cost functional CIT xi, which represents the unit cost of increasing capacity if it's operating at xi. And we assume that this Ci xi is the sum between a base. xi is the sum between a baseline called CIT, which follows a CIR process, and some function C of ψ, which is increasing with respect to xi. Okay, then for each price P, the conventional producer I chooses a proportion of capacity alpha that he wants to offer by maximizing this profit per unit. Profit per unit, functional. And we can compute that the optimal proportion of the capacity is F of P minus CIT, where F is the inverse of functions. We compute the gain of the producer at the price level P, which is this one. And then we have this optimal stopping problem. So this is the gain of the producer. This Kappa C is some fixed running cost and this And this capital Kappa C is the cost of assets recovered upon exit. The renewables aim to enter the market. They pay a cost Kappa R after which the plant generates ACIT units of electricity per unit of time at zero cost. It follows a Jacobi process to be between zero and one. And the renewable producers build their full intelligence. Build their full intermittent capacity and solve this optimal stopping problem. So you see that here I'm from sigma i, which is the enter time up to capital T. This is the profit. This is the running cost. This is the sum which is paid in order to enter the market. And this is the interest rate. And here we have also some depreciation rate. So we introduce the infrequent distribution of the costs of the conventional producers. The costs of the conventional producers who are still in the game. And we can compute the total supply. Okay. And here we have F0P, which is some baseline supply. So we also have some conventional producer who never exit the market. And we can compute, I don't have time to go in all details, we compute also the total renewable supply using the distribution of the capacity factors of those players who Those players who entered the market. So we compute the price at equilibria. So it's the smallest P for which the residual demand, so the demand which is not satisfied by the renewable type production, will be satisfied by the conventional type of production. So the interaction is through P, as you can see. So now we go to the mean field limit. So we have the measures. Limits, so we have the measures which converge to some limit measures. So we have the state processes at the limit. We have, we write the linear programming formulation of the problems as I showed before. Okay, so nothing special. Okay, we have the definition of the price of the limit. We define the L-Pinache equilibria here. Okay, so it is a couple of measures such that The couple of measures such that these two conditions are satisfied for all admissible measures omega and beta. Okay, so this is just the extension of the Nash equilibria to two classes. And what is the result? So we obtain a Nash equilibria and also we can show that for two different equilibria we get the same price. This is actually essential. And some And some, yes, so what I wanted to say is that actually we can include entry and exit here. We have another paper that I didn't present. We can have at the same time entry and exit in this formulation by introducing, by having three measures, the entry measures, the measure of those who are still in the game, and the exit measure. Okay, so we take some demand projections for 15 years in order to be more For 15 years, in order to be more realistic, we distinguish between peak and off-peak prices, peak and off-peak demand. Sorry, and then we consider three scenarios. So the first scenario, the baseline case is that the costs are estimated for the UK market. There is no subsidy. The baseline is in blue. And as you can see, the conventional capacity doesn't change too much, and the renewable capacity doesn't change. The renewable capacity doesn't change as well. Then the first scenario is we offer 30% renewable subsidy. So this means that the capar, the entry cost will be smaller. And in this case, you can observe that the conventional capacity will decrease very fast and the renewable producers will enter progressively the market. And the second scenario is when we The second scenario is when we have a combination between the renewable subsidy and some payment to keep producers in the market. So we obtain this second scenario. You see that, which is in between. But what is important for us is in terms of carbon emissions, what happens? So we have computed the carbon emissions for all three cases, and the difference between this one and this one will... Actually, the difference between this one and this one will not be significant. And why we had to consider to see other cases than the baseline case, because as you can see on the peak prices, in the case when we have subsidies, the prices increase a lot. Okay, and if we take the second scenario, which is a combination between subsidies and the payments per convention, we are Payments for convention, we are closer, we are quite close to the baseline case. Okay, so of course, I'm not having time. The common noise in our case will be when we add some carbon price, okay, which will impact the cost of conventional producers and the demand. And we produce an analysis how uncertainty impacts the speed at which renewables will enter the market. Okay, so thank you very much. Okay, so thank you very much for
