Yes, yes. Thank you very much. First of all, I would like very genuinely thank the organizers for inviting me here. Nowadays it's especially important having personal meetings with the Zoom and everything else going on. Okay, so this talk is based on a joint work with Sasha Soudin. And the subject of this talk, as Ilya said absolutely correctly, is the quantum dynamics, which will be from now on Q D associated. With a robotic operator with singular continuous spectrum. And the main example that you should keep in mind with that talk is one-dimensional surely your One-dimensional shrouding operators with positive Laubanov exponents whose spectrum is continuous due to arithmetic reasons. I'm trying to write as large as I can, so that's why it takes a bit longer. So if you need me to write even bigger, please do tell. Okay, so this subject has been studied quite extensively. Been studied quite extensively by the manager of Chances Kai Mobius. How's your owners come? And I will discuss some of these results later in the talk. And recently, Gikarska and you Consider the parallel question for low-grade operators still in one dimension. Now, our contribution to this subject is a new approach that allows us to recover and strengthen most of the existing results and also to obtain new results in dimension high. Results in dimension higher than one and as long as for the long range of protocols. And the main message here is the following. That the large deviation estimate of the green function at the fixed energy implies upper bounds on quantum dynamics. Now the left-hand side, the large deviation part, has been studied extensively for various classes of operators. Various classes of operators, irrational shifts, Q shifts, many more, starting from the work of Goldstein and Schluck. And the recent work of Vinsai is kind of state of art for large deviations. Now, we can actually take any result from Vensai's paper and obtain upper bounds with function. But before I proceed to new Before I proceed to new results, before I discuss the new results, I would like to tell a bit about the most classical case, which is Domos Matthew Bertu. These, as you all know, but I will repeat that for self-completely, so these one-dimensional discord shorting your self-defense. Now this we're shorting your self-adjoint operator that that's an L2 C one dimension by h psi of n equals to the free Laplacian, free distribute Laplacian plus the potential, which is cosine 2 pi alpha n plus theta psi n, where alpha, which is called the frequency, some number we can. The frequency, some number between 0 and 1, theta, which is called the phase between 0 and Ï€, and lambda, which is the strength of disorder called Kaplan constant, is some real number, and we can always assume that lambda is positive because it's simply a shift of theta by pi. Now, today it is known that That in the so-called subcritical case, when lambda is smaller than 1, the Lambda exponent is 0 on the spectrum. And in this case, the spectrum is purely absolutely continuous for all phases and frequencies. There is a completely different picture in the so-called supercritical case, namely when lambda is greater than 1, when we know that the corresponding Lapanov exponent is positive for all frequencies, and this goes back to Hermann. And here, when I'm saying Lapunov exponent, And here when I'm saying Laponov exponent, one you need to understand that I'm talking about the theta average Laponov exponent. However, the uh the spectrum, here comes the but is pure point only for nice phases and frequencies. Which satisfies certain Diaphragmal conditions, certain arithmetic conditions. Now, in particular, in Backham 76, Gordon proved that if alpha is very well approximable by rationals, the so-called Liouville number, then the spectrum is purely absolutely continuous. Moreover, and this goes back. A singular continuous. Thank you. Singular continuous. Singular. Singular conditions. Moreover, and this goes back to the results of Geithomers and Simon from 94. Even for poorly approximated alphas that satisfy certain Delphine conditions, for each alpha there exists a G delta dense. A G delta dense set of phases for which the spectrum is purely singular continuous. And then the natural question that we can ask is the following. Is the following? How does the quantum dynamics behave for such phases and frequencies? Now I need to explain what do I mean by What do I mean by this question and introduce a main object? So, one of the main objects of interest in this context is quantum transfer probabilities. Which is dt of w is the absolute value of e to the i t h 0 w square for non-negative t when h in general is the Hamiltonian that evolves according to Schrodinger dynamics. In our case, in this example, h is simply the almost magneton. The almost mine floor. So, this is the probability that a quantum particle that starts at zero is found at the point W after turn t. And obviously, since this is probability, the probability measure, we know that the sum of all of them Is one. Now we say that this family of probability measures form a tight family. And this is basically the definition of dynamical localization. So in that case, we're saying that the operator So in that case, we're saying that the operator exhibits dynamical accommodation from now on dL if for every positive epsilon there exists positive r such that the tail, if you wish, The tail, if you wish, of these probabilities is smaller than epsilon uniformly in time. And now Rage theorem, which was also mentioned yesterday, says that if If this family of measures form a tight family, namely if we have dynamic homogenization, then the operator has two multiplexers. And now I can translate the question which is still work and ask how badly Can dynamical localization fail in the supercritical case. So I asked how does the quantum dynamics behave. Now I can ask a little bit more precisely how badly dynamical location can fail in the supercritical phase. Critical piece. And for that, given the quantum transport probabilities, let us define transport moments, associated transport moments, which is denoted by m of t when p so this is the peace moment of the position operator for any positive p. So, and this is precisely. So, and this is precisely the sum over integers later, it will be z mu of the probability times w to the p with some positive pieces. And then we can translate the questions about the dynamic of localization into the language of transport, of the peace moment of the opposition. Of the peace moment of the position operator. In particular, we know that if for some p the piece moment of the position operator is uniformly bounded in time, uniformly in time, then we know that the operator exhibits dynamical localization. Dynamical localization. On the other hand, we know that the motion, this is always, the motion of a quantum particle is always not faster than ballistic. And when I'm putting this strange thing, I mean that A over B is bounded. Now, this bound give Give the correct order of growth when the potential is identically zero, namely, we are dealing simply with the free Laplacian, or in a more general way, when the potential is period. In 1996, Last proved that if alpha is very well approximable, Very well approximable. Once again, we're talking about Louville numbers. Then the growth rate of the moments of the position operator can be arbitrarily close to ballistic on a sub-sequence of times. Let me know that there are star views that will need it. Okay, yes. If alpha is very well approximate. Oh, in the I'm only concentrating on supercritical region. And but but delta is a public for you. Because you have before this T delta set uh yes, no, here it's for in for for in so for For in so for yes, here that theta doesn't answer. So you have to have everything but expect from that. Oh, that's that I'm coming. In a second I'm coming. So on the other hand, look at this result very carefully. On the other hand, we have the following result due to Gitomer's triangle theore, which said that, which says the following. Let me erase that. Replace that. So my step follow and I will put here plus and I will explain what this plus means. So let us concentrate on the supercritical case. Then one. If alpha is Is poorly approximable by rational, namely satisfies certain Dalfine-Dalm condition, then for any lambda greater than one, the peace moment of the position operator is bounded by logarithm to the power Cp uniformly in the phases. Uniforming the phases. So, and second for each alpha, now without any condition, we have that between your two stars, limit when t goes to infinity, supreme number theta of m p t divided by logo et c. Cp over T is smaller than L the. And our contribution, which I denoted by plus, is precisely the uniformity in theta. So the fact that the base moment of the position operator is smaller than one for almost every theta is kind of obvious because we have localization. But this is completely false when it comes to all t's. So, and here, So, and here, once again, our contribution is disuniformity. One and two. Now, what I would like you to do goes back to our question is to compare these two results. So, and we see now actually that something amazing happens, that if alpha is very well approximable by rationals, then at some instances of times, the quantum dynamics is almost ballistic. And at other instances of times, And at other instances of time, it's almost localized. I mean, from my point of view, the logarithm is almost a constant, so it's basically localized. Now, I would like to proceed to tell you about new results, and for that, I would like to introduce the general framework. General framework is the code. We consider bounded, self-adjoint operator that acts on L2 of 0 as a sum. Of a convolution with a symmetric kernel and multiplication dark potential. So I will say in a second what A and what V is. So here we have V is equal A of W minus V side of V plus B plus W some W where A from Z mu to R is a symmetric kernel and V from Z mu to R is the potential. Now we Now we always assume that the kernel is exponentially decaying, namely there exists if there exists some positive c such that the sum over z mu of a w e to the c norm w and here. Norm W and here norm W is the max norm is in U. Is bounded and we also assume that the potential is bounded. So these are our two assumptions. And now our main contribution here is once again a new approach that allows now we can say Now we can say it more precisely, that allows to obtain upper bounds on the transfer moments in dimensions higher than one and also for the longer interference. So in these general phenomena. Now, as I already mentioned, the main message here, once again, and I'm sorry that I'm repeating that, but this is kind of the most important thing, that the large deviation estimate on the Booing function at fixed energy. At fixed energy implies upper bound now on transfer moments. Now, recall that in the strategy devised by Goldstein and Slug for localization, first one proves large deviation estimate. And then in order to prove localization, one needs a lot of additional work, and most of the time, many additional assumptions. Additional assumptions. Now, for many models, the second step is simply not available at all. Now, using this recent state-of-art work of Fensai for large deviations, we can obtain upper bounds on transport moments for any taking any result from his papers. So, just like a black box, we're taking any large deviation estimate. Any large deviation estimate, we plug it into our machinery and we get upper bounds for the choice for now. Let me present you with three results that we can prove this way. We can do much more, but let me just take three rules from this table. And the first result is one dimension. Is one dimension one frequency operator. A one dimension multi-frequency operator. So, one dimension, so mu equals to one, multi-frequency. Namely, the potential is defined by V of n equals to g times f a theta plus n. Plus n alpha, where G is simply a coupling constant, the strengths of the disorder, f is analytic non-constant. n is an integer and alpha with error and theta with error are on the k-dimensional force. On the k-dimensional force. So, this is the potential. This is one-dimensional multi-frequency operator. And then we have the following theorem. Theorem 1. If alpha is diophantine Minus kappa, this is kappa, then for any coupling constant greater than or equal to some g naught, peace moment of the position operator is uniformly in the phase bounded by a logarithm, okay, I can put it like that, logarithm to the power p k cubed. P K cube kappa square plus little O of 1 of T. And the previous work on this subject, the previous result on this subject is due to Gutmanner's frame in blue, where they proved a sub-power low bound. sub-power low bound for an individual theta. So they proved that the limit of the logarithm and pt divided by t is zero. So this is sub-power law and we have the logarithmic law, the power logarithmic law and uniformity interface. Okay. So now I would like to pass to the higher dimension, mu greater than one. And as far as we know, there was no previous work on this subject at all. Namely, all the previous results for in dimension greater than one require exclusion of a positive measure of a set of positive measure of frequencies. Set of positive measures of frequencies and also most of the time non-arithmetic conditions on editor. Exclusion of the positive set of phases and non-arithmetic conditions on the frequencies. So let us do that. So here I'm taking dimension greater than one and one frequency shift. So there was a One dimensional multi-frequency now it's dimension greater than one and one frequency. So once again, my potential here is a Capli constant time F theta plus and times alpha, where F is once again analytic non-constant. Uh G is the coupling constant which is positive, theta is on the torus. Theta is on the torus and this is the mu and alpha is on the new dimensional torus. And then our second theorem is once again if alpha is diaphragm time And here I need kappa from kappa to be greater than the dimension. Yes. No, theta is on the torus. So you're saying I'm doing actually multi-frequency? Well, it's just a termicover show. Well, it's just a terminology. It's terminology, it's just no, it's one. No, no, no, no, no. N is in Z new, so it's one frequency. Anything z in U, and alpha is in new dimensional curves. It's one frequency. It's very important that the dimension of the operator is greater than one. So if this kappa is greater than dimension, then for any coupling constant. Any coupling constant greater than or equal to some G0, the piece moment of the position operator is bounded, once again uniformly in the face, is bounded by logarithm to the power p1 minus little once again for any for any positive case. And the last thing that I would like to present is two dimension, two frequency. Yes? So what does G1 I mean? So like roughly. G node here, nothing. Yes, yes. In these two cases, on nothing. And only in the third, yes, only on the third case, it will depend on something. So the one that I will provide now. So the third case is. So the third case is two-dimensional two-frequency shift. So we have mu equal to two, k equal to two. I will not write down once again the potential because it's the same potential. Just plot mu equal to two and k equal to two. And we have theorem three under explicit. Now if I find Now if I found conditions, assumptions, let's put it that way, which we borrowed from Medzai's paper, we have that for g greater than or equal to g naught, and here g naught depends on all these explicit different assumptions, we have that the piece We have that the peace moment of the position operator uniformly interface bounded by logarithm to the power CT isn't guaranteed not also depend on the single this is new I need to look at new table and I will tell you a few Care about, and I will tell you in a second. I think not, but I will recheck myself. If this is, we said one frequency higher dimension, no. Okay, are there any questions so far? Because from right now I would like to pass the technical part. Yes? Yes, so if I assign two pre-consumer practices, somehow in the first theorem, the dimension of the candidate. The dimension of color line space is one, but of the frequency or space is higher. There it's a bit other way around. But when they are equal, then suddenly there's nothing in the sense of the constant and the diatom assumptions, right? Yes. So there must be sometimes. Yes, there is something special going on there. Yes. So is it always when the two dimensions are three or is it just? So somehow, whatever you see here, the appropriate force. Here, the appropriate question will be not about what I'm doing, but about actually what's going on with the large deviations. And in order in this case to prove large deviations, one needs certain assumptions, certain explicit assumptions. But once again, luckily those assumptions are, at least for frequency, they're purely arithmetic and there are absolutely no assumptions in the face. Is it correct that all the assumptions? Is it correct that all your assumptions come exclusively from the large deviations theory? Yes, yes. So you have a matter theory. If you have large deviations, you can have this. Yes, yes, I have a black box. Give me large deviation, I will give you the power log. Yes, that's exactly what I'm going to do now. Yeah. I just get one more very quick comment as if we spoke when we said the Yes. Yes, thank you. Thank you. You're absolutely right. Thank you. By Bogjer Goldsteinswag. Yes. Okay, so now I would like to pass to the technical part of my talk, in which I will formulate precisely our main result from which we deduce all these three the worms. And if time permits, hopefully I will present you with the proof of the main step. Now, the plan of the proof is as follows. So, first we prove the result for a large set of thetas, and then we upgrade it to all thetas. And in this talk, I will focus only on the first main step, so large set of thetas, because the upgrade is quite simple. First, let me introduce some notation. So let lambda be a finite volume. And let me introduce the restriction of our operator to that. Of our operator to that volume H lambda in the standard way. So where you start on the standard where P lambda is the usual coordinate projection. Okay, and let me denote by GZ uh the green function that corresponds to our operator, when z is obviously the resolvent set, and by g z comma. C from alpha the green function that corresponds to the restricted operator restricted on this final flow. Now I need one more definition. So if zero is inside a box and there is positive epsilon, then I am defining, so let me first say and then I will write. I am defining the set I am defining the set of all of the energies for which the green function does not decay sufficiently well from the center to the neighborhood of the boundary. Okay? So once again, the set of all real energies for which the green function does not decay sufficiently well from the center to the neighborhood of the boundary. So this is a Thomas set of all real energies such that there is That there exists a point in the W and a point in lambda and a point not in lambda, such that G epsilon lambda 0 is greater than epsilon and my symmetric kernel is also greater than epsilon. Now, our Now, our main theorem controls escape of probability of quantum probabilities in terms of this epsilon and the measure of that set. And the Lebesgue measure of that set. This is the main theorem. Let me formulate it precisely. Theorem let H be as before, the pollution with the kernel plus the potential and let lambda, which contains zero, be a final box in zero and assume that x is the same. Epsilon is between 0 and delta 8 mu plus 1 is such that the Lebesgue measure of that set of energies is smaller than delta. So I need a bound on that set. So here, actually, if you're wondering where the large deviation comes into play, this is. comes into play, this is precisely where it comes into play. Into obtaining this bound. And then for W not in the volume and T time of order roughly logarithm models logarithm epsilon, so the modeling constant divided by delta, we have that the point That the quantum transport probability is bounded by, ignore the constant, e to the minus c norm w times square, the measure of the square of the measure of that set, plus square of the volume times epsilon to the power over five. There are other assumptions of the potential and the potential boundless. We need the potential to be bounded. That's what I said from the beginning when I said about the general framework. A needs to be symmetric kernel and potential needs to be bounded. Nothing else. Deterministic result. In what sense? In the sense that we is not a goatic collection. That we use not ergodic or anything. We are talking about, so all of our applications are to ergodics for legal query. Yes, yes, yes, yes. So you don't need the Telta or the alpha, only setting is not easy to for this work. It has nothing to do with the applications at all. This is just a black box to which I can plug in any application. It has nothing to do with any of the applications, nothing to do with operators. It's completely just To do with operators. It's completely general framework. There is a symmetric kernel and bounded proposed one. Just a motion. So I do need for the operator to be self-adjoint, but this I promise by symmetric kernel. And now what I would like to do is to present you with the proof of the main step in the proof of that result. Let me mention. Let me mention actually that even though I'm presenting here just the main step, but the actual proof is another maybe 20 lines. So the whole proof is quite simple and short, but the main part is the one that I would like to present, the non-standard part. Sorry, the player is going to ask you one other question. Yes. I don't know if it's like raised. What is E in the statement? Like the set of E from R side? Set of E from R such that E or F E in the grid? In the grid function. Oh, so sorry, sorry. Oh, okay. I said, please. Thank you. Thank you for not slipping. Of course it's B. What is the last term? It's the symmetric cardinal. Oh, okay. This one. It's the symmetric cardinal. So I want for the symmetric cardinal to be large. It's this one. Yes, precisely. It's this one. Yes, precisely. Once again, it's the set of all the energies for which there is no good decay of the green function, which you want kind of to exclude. You want to throw them out. Those are bad energies. So you want to control the escape of the probability, of the quantum probabilities, in terms of somehow of the smallness of the set of bad energies. Those are bad. Those are value matches. Okay, now the bounds on quantum dynamics or on transport moments can be reduced to the bounds on the green function using the quantum integral, which I will write in a second on the board, actually right now, which was also used in this constant, in this context by our predecessors, for example, by the managing church in Johnson. So minus one with two. So minus 1 over 2 pi i. And here, sorry, let us make it. C is the contour that encloses the spectrum contour clockwise. e to the I T Z G Z zero double indices. Okay? So therefore, we kind of, if you're noticing, we kind of gradually Gradually reducing the question to something else, something else, something else. So now we reduce the question to the control over to the bounds on the green function. So this is the main point. How do we bound the green function? And this we do using the following, once again, completely general grammar, which actually has nothing to do with any operators. None. It's just simply a complex functions. Complex the complex functions lemma. So let me present you the lemma and its proof. So consider a finite collection of functions which I will denote by u v z, which are the sum Are the sum of simple fractions such that all the coefficients and all the poles are real and let epsilon and delta be between the epsilon? B becomes 0 and 1. Okay? So this is the assumption. Okay, I have no choice, but to result. Then, if the sum of the modules are the absolute values of the coefficients, Is smaller than one and this function uv is smaller than epsilon outside of a set of measure at most delta. Then we can move away some constant time delta from the real line and this function will be bounded by say square root of epsilon. So then for z Zx plus I Y with Y greater than delta over pi, the maximum of this function is bounded by 4 over y times epsilon to the power 1 minus delta over pi y. As you can see, there's absolutely no As you can see, there's absolutely no parameters behind it, nothing. So, whatever I said before, you can forget completely. So, this is literally just simply complex variables lemma. And the only thing which I need to tell you before I proceed into the proof is how I'm applying this lemma. And I'm applying this lemma, obviously, to the green function, namely g z v g z. V GZ lambda is 0 V if we inside the finite volume and 0 otherwise. So this is how we're applying this level. This is how we're getting back the connection to the operators and everything else. So in the past, last, I think, seven minutes will be quite enough for me. I will present you the proof of that lemma. It's quite short. Present you the proof of that lemma. It's quite short and quite simple. Okay, so the assumptions are there, and this is the most thing that I need. This I don't mind. Let me present you with the proof. Proof. So, first of all, without also generality, let us assume that vice positive Vice positive. I don't want to drag with me the modulus. And let us let him use T big Poisson measure. Okay. Now recall that For any subharmonic function which is sufficiently regular at infinity, we have the bound that the function is bounded by the integral with respect to the Poisson shirt. And in our case, we will apply a We will apply everything to the logarithm of the modules of this u, and since u has only real poles, then u is analytic, so therefore log of the modules of u is obviously sacrament. Now for y greater than or equal to delta over pi, so we move it a little bit from the green line, we have that the Poisson measure of the set of Of the set of all the points where our function u is large, namely greater than epsilon is bounded by delta over piy. And this is immediately from the definition of the Poisson. Okay? So therefore, for any V, Where any V, we have that the complement of that Z is quite large. So we have that for some measure of the complement is smaller than A is greater than one minus delta over pi delta. Up in a trial. Now I'm going to use that fact and I'm going to break logarithm of I'm going to bound logarithm of the models of my function. The only unfortunately I'm raising the assumption, I will maybe reword them again. Now, from there Now from there we have that the logarithm of the models of UBC is bounded by the logarithm of the models of QBT integrated with respect to the Poisson nature. And this is smaller than or equal then 1 minus delta over phi y log epsilon. Note that log epsilon is Note that log epsilon is negative, so there is no problem. Plus the integral of the logarithm plus of uvt with respect to the Poisson measure. And now the only thing which I need to do is to, so here I already have a very nice bound, so the only thing which I need to do is to bound that integral. Okay, so let us do that by the definition of the Poisson measure. The definition of the Poisson measure, first of all, I have that the Poisson measure of all the points for which this function is large is bounded by a 1 over pi y, the Lebesgue measure of the same set. Okay, and now I need to tell you, so now I will use one more thing, which is the rules inequality, and I'm pretty sure that all of you will be very familiar, but I decided to remind you. So we have rules in identity first, which says that if all AI are positive, then the LaBegger measure of the set of T's for which Set of t's for which this sum of the simple fractions greater than t is equal, sorry it is the identity, is equal to the sum of the coefficients divided by t. But in our case, we cannot say that all the coefficients are positive, they simply not true. So we use in the cornering, which is the Bausen equality. Which says that the measure of almost the same thing, but once we put it, the absolute value greater than or equal to t is bounded by 4 times the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients divided by t. Okay, so this is the possible property. So therefore now I can bound this set. So this is smaller than or equal than 4 times the sum of the coefficients divided by a pi 1 e to the r. And I'm reminding you that we said that the sum of coefficients is bounded by 1. This was in the By one. This was in the assumption of the lemma. So this is smaller than or equal to 4 over 5y e to the minus r. So I have bounded this set. And now I have last step, very last step, is to bound this integral. I mean having all that already finished. Let me just write down one last one. 1 plus 1, we have that the integral of the log plus uvt dvuz of t. First of all, this is equal to the integral from 0 to infinity of the Poisson measure of all the t's for which qt is large. Now I can split this integral into two integrals. So one is from zero to the logarithm of four over piy plus from logarithm of four over piy to infinity. This integral, the integral, I'm bounding by one. This is probability measure, so I can bound the integral by one. The integral by one, or the integral of the integral. Here I'm bounding by this bound, by star. And altogether, I'm getting that this is smaller than or equal than logarithm of 4 over pi y. This comes from this one bound plus 1. And now this is logarithm 4e over pi y, which is the Y, which is the logarithm of 4 over y, getting rid of the e and p. Okay? So therefore, now combining all together, I'm having my last line that the logarithm of the modulus of u b z is bounded by 1 minus delta over pi 1. Over 5y log epsilon plus log of 4 over y, which gives me precisely what I wanted, which is log of 4 epsilon to the power 1 minus delta over pi y divided by y. And this is precisely the value that I aim for, and this finishes the proof of the lemma, and basically pretty much And basically, pretty much up to really standard work, not much, but standard work finishes the proof also of the main result. That's it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Questions? Yes. So, like in your original setting, there was no pattern for the There was no dependence on the dynamic system in the coefficients of the Laplacian main. But in your main theorem, it seems to be error. There's still no dependence. The green function, as it is, the green function is the inverse, so the green function depends on everything. Yeah, no, no, I mean, but like the experiment, the classroom, the center class, was completely independent of the like Teta or whatever. Yes, yes, yes. It's a complex but it's a theory of complex parts. It's a theory of complex functions. It has nothing to do with shorting your operators. None. So, in principle, you can also apply it to operators where you have their coefficients. Depending, when it's alpha teta or whatever you want. I need large deviation. Give me large deviation, give me an operator which looks like symmetric parental plus potential. That's it. We need that. Otherwise, you have a problem. Otherwise, it will not be self-adjoined, so you need self-adjoining us. So, this is kind of part of a standard definition of the operator, if you wish. Is it believable that something like that also exists for continuous string operators? Uh I would guess so. I would need to check. Then you have an infinite sum, rather than define a Poisson measure. Still, you can define a Poisson measure and work very similarly to that. But I haven't checked that, so I'm not interested about it. But yes, theoretically, once again, so this particular lemma doesn't use anything except for the fact that the coefficients in the poles are real. So whether you have finitely many of them or infinitely many of them, one needs to be a little bit careful to check whether it affects anything. But I think it should work. That's what I would say. I guess. Yes. So, uh, papers like divisions is in the phase, and you're using live division inevitably. Do you just use Fubini to go to one to the other? Yes, Fubini and Chebyshev inequality. So it's a combination of Fubini with Chebyshev. Yes, that's why I said that this step is quite standard and quite simple. No, okay, standard. More questions? Questions? Yeah, so we continue on the same question. So we put some cyclopinia because we should just get very x. But then there is this set of small measure which could be just rolls out to what we do. No, no, there is absolutely no problem. You're using Chebyshev inequality to bound the probability of this atypical theta. Titan. But using Fubini and simply chapters. Yes. Yes. Yes, I can write down precisely the estimate. Second, I will write down the estimate for the probability. For the probability. So the estimate is as follows. So the probability that theta is atypical is bounded by 1 by delta, the expectation. The expectation of the measure of this set with delta 8 mu plus 1. I'm sorry, I need we have a little bit different notation, so I'm on the card changing the notation. This is bounded by one over delta uh okay uh it's bounded by some constant delta to the power two k. To the power 2k. Okay? And then from that, you already can conclude the uniform bound. Do you want me to continue? Maybe just... So from that, you're saying that the set of integral deltas cannot be contained in the disk of radius delta square. And if theta is typical, you have theta of w bounded by I need to change the notation as some constant n to the power 2 nu when Power 2 new way and comes from the bound of the norm times delta and then the full probability is already bounded by the sham of these two. So you have p t theta prime w plus 2 some other constant delta square. constant delta square t, which gives you the final value. But this is kind of three lines which gets from form Fubini plus championship in a quality. And this upgrades it to all theta. Very nice. Well, it's a very good question. Yeah guys uh the most remarkable to me is that this is basically the first damage you know acid from the filling of the bars and that's also and also there are there are there are no non-arithmetic conditions so there are only arithmetic conditions and there is no exclusion of phases this is the this is the first result as far as we know this is No. All our results are uniform in theta. All the applications are uniform in theta. The supremum over theta of the moment of the position operator. There is absolutely no exclusion of anything. No measure 0, no measure 0 over 2, no measure 0 over 3. Nothing. This is very, very important that there is no explosion phases at all. At all. Everything is uniform in phase for any dimension. You give me large deviation, I'm giving you uniform ground. Power logo is making uniform ground. So, Nier, so what can you obtain for one dimensional every market practice the operator? Yes. As a large deviation, we have the bound of the proton dynamics for that. Okay, I mean, any multi-frequency, then if you incorporate the multi-frequency with the obedient number, then Bogan has validation as mean. So in that setting, what can you think? Uh I think actually it's it's once again we can and for you're asking for new field? You're asking for new build. We've worked on the FinTech case, so I need to think. I will not be able to tell you on the spot. I need to think about that. Yes, Matthew, you had a question. Your arithmetic condition on SGD, that just comes from the line of conditions. Yes. Yes. All the conditions that we have in the applications, so all the, what is this condition? What is this community interested in, namely the power logarithmic bounds on the quantum dynamics? All the assumptions, all of them coming from large deviation. The proof is always three line. So apply our theorem, take the large deviation, finish. That's it. We don't even list them as theoretical. They are all corollaries because they are really very much corollaries. Yes? Can only imagine taking away a bit more alpha and get somehow? For alpha, I'll get somehow bounded in time. Can you please repeat? Right now, your condition is diofunting alpha, right? Yes. So can you imagine taking a subset of geophanting omega so that instead of a log you have boundedness? Oh, but this is for almost every phase, this will be actually true because you have localization. This is all in the regime that you have theoretically. All in the regime that you have theoretically, you have localization except for very special cases when you have the singular continuous spectrum. So, in that case, it's, I mean, yes, sure. I mean, whenever you have localization, this is obviously true. But the whole point is that it's not true uniformly in the face. So that's that. This addition is very important. Okay, so I suggest maybe let's stand here again. So we're talking right now, but if there is any need to continue discussion, the Zoom is open. I'm here. Yes, yes. I think it stopped by itself. I think it stops at after one hour. I'm a it. Okay.
