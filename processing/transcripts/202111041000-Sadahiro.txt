My name is Taito Sadahiro from Tokyo, Japan. I would like to talk about a slight extension of a theorem originally conjectured by Prope and proved by Joseph and Robby, which is on a saturn to dynamical system. This is a joint This is a joint work with Erika Hanauka, who is my former student. To start with, I would like to review the theorem of Joseph and Robby. A path graph is a pathograph which consists of the particular The particular indices from zero up to n and edges are of this form. It's just a pass graph. An independent set I of G is a subset of B containing no adjacent pair of vertices. We can express a subset S of B as a string, a binary string x0, x1 through xn, where xi is 1 if i is contained in s and zero otherwise. And z otherwise, then an independent set I is encoded as a string without consecutive ones, one, one. For example, when the length of n is three, we have g8 independent set. Each set doesn't contain any adjacent topic series. Many adjacent vertices. Let carigraphic I denote the set of all independent sets of G and let V be about X. The total map tau B from I to I is defined by this form. Tau B, when applied to X, tries to rip the button. To rip the buttex Bui. That is, if B is contained in X, Tau Bui removes Bui from X. And if B is not contained in X and adding Bui to X makes another independent set X, tau B will add B to the X. Otherwise, Otherwise, tau b leaves x unchanged. For example, tau3 when applied to the independent set one three six removes three from the set. If we apply tau 3 again, tau 3 add 3 to the set. But if we apply tau 4 to the independent set 1, 3, 6, it cannot add 4 to the set because 4 is adjacent to 3. The map phi is Y is composition of these taus. Each tau is contained exactly once in this phi in the order from 0 to n. For example, phi of the independent set 0 to 8 is computed as phi. 8 is computed as follows. Tau 0 removes 0 from the set. Tau 1 cannot add 1 to the set. Tau 2 removes the vertex 2. Tau 3 add 3. This way, we obtain independent set 3. Since phi is a permutation of A permutation on the set of all independent set repeatedly applying y the starting set 0 to 8 appears again. On this orbit, the terminal vertex 0 appears five times in the orbit and so does the The other terminal, but x8, 1 appears twice and 7, so does 7. The bottom line the numbers of occurrences of vertices Forms a parindrom. This is true for any independent set and for any n. To state the theorem. To state the theorem, we introduce the orbit board of an independent set X. The orbit board let L be the length of the phi orbit of X. Then the orbit board S of X is a matrix is L by N plus 1 matrix. plus one matrix whose entries are one or zero. S of ij is one if j is contained in the independent set phi to the i of x or zero otherwise. Joseph and Robby proved the following theorem conjectured by Probe. The sum of j square of the orbit board is equal to the sum of n minus j squared. We show a sketch of the proof when we embed the orbit board into the two-dimensional relative. Into the two-dimensional lattice, the points, the position of ones in the orbit ball, shown as blue points, have the following geometric properties. If S of ij is 1, then for some j smaller than n, then exactly one of S of ij plus 2 or i j plus 2 or s of i plus 1 j plus 1 is 1 if s of i j is 1 for some positive j then exactly 1 of s of i j minus 2 or s of i minus 1 j minus 1 is 1. That is, a blue point has exactly one power. One forward in the direction of following two types, there two or one one. Since the blue points have one follower and one following, it can be considered to be on a curve starting from the left terminal vertex and ending at the right terminal button. Like terminal buttics. These curves do not intersect each other. They are called snakes. More precisely, a snake is a sequence of the indices of this orbit border satisfying these three conditions. conditions J0 is 0 and J n is n that is snake starts from the left terminal vertex and ends at the right terminal vertex all entries on this indices these indices are all one and the differences of two consecutive indices are one one or It is obvious from the definition of the snake, it gives a composition of n whose parts are 1 or 2. That is, the difference of jk plus 1 gives the differences jk plus 1 minus jk are 1 or 2, which sum up to n. This snake gives a composition of A 12122. If we sum up these numbers from left to right, we obtain a rising sequence of partial sums 0, 1, 3, 4, 0. 013468. It is obvious that these numbers are the distances from the left terminal vertex to the blue points, the positions of ones on this snake. And if we so let me call these sums left cumulative sums. And if we add, sum up this sequence from right to left, we obtain another rising sequence. These are distances from the right terminal vertex to the blue point. The positions of ones on this name S of Ij. S of ij s of ij if s of ij is one then ij is contained in some snake sk exactly one snake therefore j is equal to some left cumulative sum so the sum of j's column of the Of j's column of the orbit board, the left-hand side of the equality in the theorem is the number of snakes having such left cumulative sum. And the right-hand side, the sum of n minus j, the sum of n minus j scarum is equal to the is equal to the number of snakes having J as one of its right cumulative sum. In this example, we have these five snakes, each of which gives a one, two composition. So we need We need to show that left that as a merge set, the left cumulative sounds are equal to right cumulative sounds. To show this, Joseph and Robbie showed the following. Let CK be the composition obtained from the K snake SK. Then CK plus 1 is plus one is obtained from CK by applying a rotation. A rotation is defined by this form. The head is moved to the tail. In this example, we can observe here C1 is obtained from C0 by a rotation C z from C1. from C1 and so on. Using this theorem, we can prove the parindrum theorem. Let C be a sequence of one and two and L P of C denotes the left cumulative sum. That is the sum of The sum of first p element of C and R P of C denote the right P right cumulative sum. That is the sum of last P elements of C the merge set of let L P denote the Lp denotes the merge set of p's cumulative sums and R P the P's right cumulative sums since C k plus P is obtained from C k by applying rho the rotation for P times R P of C K plus P CK plus P is equal to L P of C K. So L P is equal to R P as a merge set. Thus, the paradigm theorem is proved. This is an example. P's depth cumulative sums as a masset is equal to p's right cumulative sums. In this ordinary independent set case, left is obtained from right by a prime Rotation So it may be natural to ask if the spindle serum whose if the when we when the independent sets are replaced with With different families of subsets of vertices. Let G be a pass graph of length n and n a fixed point, fixed positive integer. Let the chariographic IM be the set of Be the set of subsets of vertices, each of which does not contain any pair of vertices within distance M. That is, if a vertex is contained in X a member of IM, then G's G's but buttons are not contained in X. are not contained in X. Therefore, I1 is equal to the ordinary independent set. In this sense, Im can be considered as a generalization of the ordinary independent set. Let me call this more independent set. Dependency. The toggle map is defined in the same manner as it is in the ordinary case, and so is phi. This is an example where m is 3 and the orbit board is defined in the same manner, also in the same manner. Then we can prove that the perinderone theorem holds for this more independent case. This is an example. This is the orbit board obtained from Moha independent set for M is 10 where m is 3. The bottom line is again perindrone. We prove this using snakes. But in this more independent setting, the shape of snakes are different from those of ordinary Those of ordinary independent set. The horizontal part is different from that of the ordinary independent set. Therefore, a snake gives a composition of n whose parts are 1 or n plus 1. This is an example where m is 3 and x consists of 3 and 10. We have 9 snakes, but in this more independent setting, we can see that C K plus 1, which is the composition obtained from the snake S. The snake Sk plus E1 is not necessarily the rotation of CK. For example, C2 is not obtained from C1. So we need so we realized that we need to generalize the rotation, the generalized rotation. The generalized rotation rule n is defined as follows. Let C be a sequence of 1 and M plus 1. Then, if C start with M consecutive 1, they are moved to the tail. Otherwise, row M revers the starting The shortest reading sequence containing n plus 1 and moves it to the tail. This is an example where m is 3. If the sequence starts with 3 ones, then they are moved to the tail. Otherwise, row 3 reversed the shortest leading. Shortest reading sequence containing four and move it to the tail. We proved the following. Let CK be the composition obtained from the snake SK, then CK plus one is obtained from CK by applying rho m. row m the generalized rotation this is an example where m is 3 and x is x consists of 3 and 10 the first snake gives this composition on which a four appears here at the head it is moved to the tail the second tail. The second snake composition starts with one, four, so it reversed and moved to the tail. The C2 start with one, three, one, so they are moved to the tail. This way we obtain whole snake composition by applying this By applying this generalized rotation. But for this more independent setting, it is not obvious, at least for me, that the merch set of peace left to cumulative sums. P's left cumulative sums and p's right cumulative sums are equal as a merge set. We have a proof which is long and complicated, so we should simplify it. This is an example. The P the Marsh said the P's cumulative sum are equal to the P's right cumulative sum. But for this more independent setting, left Left cannot be obtained from right by applying simple rotation. We don't know any explicit bijection between these sets. We then think a relaxation of the condition for independent set, for subset to be independent. Let G be a path graph of lengths n and m a positive integer. Let j m be the set of Subsets of vertices, each of which does not contain any m plus one consecutive vertices. That is, if we look at an interval of length n, it must contain at least one vertex which is not contained in x. X is a member. X is a member of I M. When this is an example where M is 2, the bottom line, it is expected that the Paninder Rome theorem holds for this less independent set. independent setting but we can't find any we can't we haven't succeeded in finding any snakes on this board thank you well let's thank our speaker Do we have any questions? Yeah, I had a question. So if you try, just with ordinary independent sets to start, doing this same sort of operation on other graphs, maybe other trees, you know, that have a nice structure or even things with cycles. Or even things with cycles, theta graphs, or whatever, does anything nice come out? I don't know. I haven't explored in that direction. Has anybody else in it? I have a question. Yes. So, if I recall correctly, the independent sets of the path graph can also be viewed as anti-chains of Anti-chains of like a zigzag poset. What Bruce Sagan was calling a fence for the kind of most up and down version of a fence, the shortest compositions. Is it possible to view your more independent sets also as anti-chains of a certain postet? I'm sure I don't know. Okay, thanks. So I don't know if Taizo can see this, but Matthew Macaulay says on the chat: some of us have studied this over a circular graph. Circular graph. I can't get what. And Sergey says, well, he's just repeating. Says, well, he's just repeating the question that Bruce asked. On the chat? Yeah, on the chat, and Matthew has a link to a paper. It's a pre-print. One observation I have is: so I think you can mix them more. Can like mix the more and the less to generalize, make another uh generalization because, like, like independent sets are you have at most one vertex included in any two consecutive vertices. And then the more independent sets, you have at most one vertex included in any, you know, M, you know, I guess it'd be M plus one consecutive vertices, and then the less independent sets you have. And then the less independent sets you have at most, at least one, like not included in any M plus one or consecutive vertices. You could also have something where you look at like sets where like with give me any five consecutive vertices, like at most three of them are included. And that would be mixing the more and the less. Is there something like a generalization of like all of this? I'm sorry, I I tend to. I I don't I don't understand what you are asking, please. Like if you go like if you go to the definition of less independent stats, it was like you have like so many so many vertices in a row and at any given time you need at least one of those to not be included. But here you have, if you have any, you can have at most two vertices included in a row. Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you have any three consecutive vertices, you have at most two of them included. What if you said, like, if you have like Said, like, if you have like any five consecutive vertices, at most three of them are included, or at most two of them are included. If you had like at most one of them were included, then that would be the more independent sets. If you had like at most four of any consecutive five vertices included, that would be the less independent sets. But you could also generalize like in the middle there. There. So you are asking for the generalization if possible. Like another generalization that kind of combines the more independent and the less independent philosophies. Philosophies yes but I I haven't tried I haven't thought of such generalization thank you I want to suggest a different variation which is to forbid vertices at distance one or at distance three One or a distance three from being both occupied. Bruce, you're nodding like you thought about this too. The advantage of having distance one and distance three being forbidden is that we're looking at independent sets at a bipartite graph. And there's a result that if you've got a bipartite graph, then there's a lattice structure on independent sets that relies on the two coloring. So you could view independent sets. So, you could view independent sets in this graph where you draw edges in Z, at distance 1 and distance 3. There is going to be a lattice structure there. So, one might be able to exploit that lattice structure in various ways. Yes, thank you. Sure. And this is sort of this folk result. People often ask me, where can I read about this? And I never remember where it might be in Lovas's big. It might be in Lovas' big problems book. I can't remember. But if anyone remembers where you can find this nice argument for why independent sets of bipartite graphs have this lattice structure, please send that to me because every five years someone asks and I can never remember. Other questions? We still have plenty of time. Um Jim, are you talking about this paper of you, Thomas and Nathan? No, something quite a bit older, although their paper may rediscover this observation about independent sets in bipartite graphs. But it goes back to the 80s, I think. Okay. Because they put a partial order on these things, which distribute generalized distributions. Which distribut generalized distributive lattices. So, Vic Reiner says: Has anyone ever seen Anders Bjorner's notion of higher distributive lattices? I have not. Instead of posted on anti-chains, they posted on Sperner K families, that is, the unions of K anti-chains. Huh. Wow. That is a provocative suggestion. Has anyone ever seen anything about that in terms of dynamics of In terms of dynamics of low motion or anything like that, for
