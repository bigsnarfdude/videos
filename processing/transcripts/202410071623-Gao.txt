Like constitute a serious threat to public healthy. Like, for example, WHO reported that more than 249 million malaria cases in 2022, and it's induced more than 600,000 deaths. So it's a serious threat to public health. And so, mathematical modeling of veteran disease has a lot. Of Vetimo disease have a long history, and the only Vetimo disease model is the Ross-Metal model. And it was proposed by Ross in 1911. And originally, it was proposed for study of malaria. And you see, like in this model, like both humans and mosquitoes are divided into two classes. So you have sustainable and infectious classes. And here, the small H is the number of infected. Small H is the number of infected hosts, and the V is the number, small V is the number of infected vectors or mosquitoes, and the capital H is the total host size, and the capital V is the total vector size. And then there are some other parameters, like A is the biting rate, and B and C are their transmission probability. And you have the gamma is the recovery rate, and the mu is like the mortality rate for the vector population. Vector propagation, okay. And for this model, we know like the dynamics are very simple and it's determined by the basic return number. And you can see, like, this model is obviously like oversimplified, right? So network, there are many like generalization based on this model, but it's like this model is provided like a framework for modeling vector mood disease. And like this morning, like Aba Gumier gave a talk and he showed some very complicated mosquitoes for. Like mosquito TZ model, and part of the basic model structure is the Ross-Madan model. Okay, so then later on, there are many generalizations, and in this talk, I will focus on human movement or Houston movement. Okay, so then as we know, like population movement forcing the spread of infectious diseases, including mosquito-bone disease and back-bone disease. And for modeling, like for modeling, like human movement, generally. Modeling a human movement that generally there are two approaches: one is the reaction diffusion model, the other is a patch model. And for patch models, we can classify the patch model into two classes. And one is using the Euler approach for migration, and the other is for the using the Lagrangian approach, that is for the visitation. And so, here I list some papers or publications on epidemic patch models for vector disease. For vacuum diseases, and they are like the first few papers, they are for using Euler purge, and the main is for the Lagrangian perch. And most of these studies focus on establishing like threshold dynamics. And so they are very useful forecasting the trend of disease spread. And so today I will show you a simple model. So this model was proposed by Oger and his collaborator. And his collaborator, and in 2008. And this model is a generalization of the simple Ross-Medal model. And you can see it's now a multi-patch Rosmel model, and it's considered the disease spread like between n patches. And here, like, you only have the host moment. So, here, in this model, you can see the subscript I represent the patch I. So, different patches have different biting rate or transmission probability. So, that's showing like the spatial hydrogenity. Showing like the spatial hydrogenity. Okay, and here these terms represent the migration between patches. And here, the Lij is the degree of moment between from patch J to patch I. So the epsilon is for the migrate, the disposal rate or diffusion rate for host population. And in this model, they only consider the host moment. So there's no mosquito vector moment. And this model was also considered by Chris Carson and his collaborator. Chris Carson and his collaborator. And for this model, we can study the dynamics. And so, this, you know, part two, I will show you some results on the dynamic behavior of the model. So, this is related to the disease persistence and measured by the basic return number. And for this model, first we can show that if the collective matrix, the L matrix, is irreducible, so then the model has a like a disease-free equilibrium. Like a disease free equilibrium. And interestingly, you can see here the like the disease free equilibrium only depends on the collective image L, but it's independent of the diffusion rate of infected population. So it's independent of epsilon. And so that's very helpful in our analysis. And so the model has a DV free equilibrium, and then we can show in that, like define the basic reduction number using the next generation matching method. And here you see the R node is like. The R node is like special values of a square matrix, and here you have like four matrices. It looks very complicated, but actually, it's not that complicated. Okay, so here like the A and B and the D, these three matrices, they are all diagonal matrix. But the C here, this matrix C is a diagonal matrix minus epsilon time L. So you can see the anode depends on the host disposal rate and also the collectivity matrix. Okay, and actually, you see like the structure of this anode. See, like the structure of this anode is similar to the reflection number of SIS model for directly transmitted disease. So, for this model, we can show that the disease dynamics are completely determined by the base result number. So, if I know less than when the disease die out, if r not greater than when, then the disease persists and the endemic equilibrium. So, it's quite simple. Okay, so for this model, you can do some simplification, assimilation. simplification uh simulations and it's interesting that the disease can become endemic in like uh in when the human wound presents okay uh even though it's a die out in each uh isolated patch and here like i show you like a two patch case you have two patches and the two patches have the same parameter center and initial position and when there's no uh human movement the disease die out in each patch okay so and then when human movement present and neither the two patches now are collected by human movement so Is now collected by human movement. So then the back reduction number is now greater than one, and the DVD is perceived in both patches. And this phenomenon was originally observed by Chris Carson and his collaborator. And later on, we're showing that this is always true. So if you consider two identical patches, so then you can always show that the R naught of the two patch is always greater than the single patch case. Okay. And so biologically speaking, this means that. This means that non-homogeneous mixing of a host and a vector in a homogeneous environment will increase the vector reduction number. And more generally, we can show that this kind of result is still true if you consider an environment with three or more patches, or you consider both host and vector can move between patches, or you can consider an environment with different movement approach. Movement approach, like you can consider the Lagrangian approach or the Lagrangian and Euler, the mixed approach. So, this kind of results are still valid. So, this is for the Bexrotton number. In addition, we can study the impact of Cousta disposal rate on the Bexochart number. And in this case, we can show that this is similar to the SIS patch model for direct gene transmit disease. Model for direction transmit disease. And in this case, we are showing that the R node is decreasing in the disposal rate of infected host population. So that means fast host disposal will reduce R node. So biological species means like if the host moving fast, then it will reduce the breakthrough retractant number. So that will reduce the disease persistence. Okay, so this is very good in terms of the GV persistence. And also we can do. persistence and also we can do like estimate the basic number um yeah so so from from here you can see like a faster movement is beneficial right um but in the next part i was showing you like this is not always the case if you measure like uh the like the effect of uh host moment like using other um quantities okay so in part three i will study uh how the host moment affects the disease per balance the host disease per balance okay um so as we know like the So, as we know, like the disease eradication is always usually very difficult and even impossible. So, we know the smallpox is only a human disease that has been eradicated globally. And so in reality, reduced disease prevalence is a more feasible and costly infectious goal. And the fact that number can determine whether disease can persist or not, but usually it cannot calculate the disease per volume. And this is even. volumes and this is even for like for the single patch case you can show that you cannot use r node to characterize the host t v par volumes okay so the for us we are we are interested in studying how uh the hosted moment affects the uh host t v prevalence okay or the number of uh infected uh host okay so this is uh our research question there are very few studies on this uh topic so here now we consider the the multiplex boss metal Consider the multi-patch worse matter model, and here we assume we know that the population size, host population in each patch approaches, like HI star. So then we can consider a reduced like model. And so for this model, we are interested in studying how host movement affects the local and global disease per bonus and the endemic equilibrium. So this model we know is had a unique endemic equilibrium if I know it greater than one. And this equilibrium is global in stable symmetrically stable. So we can study the Stable. So we can study the local and global disease per balance and the equilibrium. And here, the local disease per volume is the proportion of people being host infected in patch I, and the global disease per volume is the proportion of people being infected over all patches. So you have the local disease performance and the global disease per balance. Okay, and here to study the global and local disease per balance, we have here. we uh like we have uh here we consider like uh yeah we are very lucky because we get a system of equilibrium equation that is uh only depend on the like the the infected host size okay so this is like this kind of equation so it's it only depends on i so i is related to the uh infected host size of patch i and so then we can study the local and global TV per bonus and in particular here so here I'm not sure whether you uh so here i'm not sure whether you can see the below but but you can based on this level you can rewrite the local and global disease prevalence um yeah so then we can also like you can consider the simple simple patch case right so so for the simple patch case you can study the um the dise prevalence and uh like uh in isolation like you give the patches there's no charge between patches and in this case we can write the disease local disease prevalence and here we can define And here we can define something called the host reproduction number of a patch I. And you can sure and see that the patch may have a larger like R0 I, but you have a small like RHI. So RHI can be used to measure the local DZ per balance. So this means like sometimes you have a very large R0, but you have small local DZ per balance. So this suggests that we cannot use R0 to characterize the local DZ per balance. And we're assuming that the R000. And we're assuming that the RHI is non-constant. If otherwise, you will see that the local disease prevalence or the collaborative disease prevalence is constant, we pack to the host disposal rate. And so then we study the local disease prevalence and the local disease prevalence. And we assume we find that the local disease prevalence of patch I is between the minimum and maximum of the disease prevalence of patch patch each patch in isolation. Uh, patch each patch in isolation. Okay, so we give a kind of estimate on the local disease per balance, and in addition, we find some like other presumed property on local disease per balance. And in particular, like if you consider two patch case, you will see that the patch with a larger like a local disease per balance in isolation will always have a larger local TV provalance when the human host movement presents. Okay, so you have some result on the local TV program. Some result on the local GDP problem. And then we started the global GZ power balance. And for the general case, like you have n patches. So in this case, you can consider just some like limiting results. So like when the disposal rate approaches zero or infinity. So you can find a formula for the global disease performance. And also we can compare the disease per balance on the no disposal and infinity disposal. So this will tell us like whether a large disposal cause more postal infections than no disposal or small disposal. Then no disposal or small disposal. And so finally, we studied how the two patch case, right? So for this, this is now you only have two patches. So in this case, we can get some nice result. Like we can answer two questions. Our first question is when the host disposal can cause more or less infections than no disposal. So that means we compare the P2 of epsilon and P2 of zero. So this is with disposal and without disposal. And the second question. Without disposal. And the second question we can answer is: how the total infection size, how or how the global disease prevalence vary with host disposal rate? And this means we can study the motonicity of the P2 of epsilon. And we give two classifications. And so this is the classification. So I do not have time to go through the details. So this is the result. And that's the first classification. And the second class for the second classification about the modulation of the About some multination of the global disease per balance. And we find that the global disease provalance is either a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing or initially increasing or then decreasing, a constant we pack to host the disposal rate. And if you know like some result on the like the SIS patch model, the direct and transmitted disease, you will see that the analysis here are quite similar to the SISI model. Okay, so finally, I want to say, like, in today's talk, I showing you a simple multi-factor, like vector-mode disease model. And we studied how the host disposal affects the disease persistence and disease per bonus. And we've shown that there is inconsistence between the disease persistence and disease per bonus respect to the host disposal rate. So this highlights the lesser rate of like. The lesser way of quantifying disease risk using other measures, instead of just a basic reduction number. And of course, there's much room for improvement. You can see here, I only focus on two patch case, right? And also, we only consider the host movement. Sometimes you need to consider both host and vector movement. And also in the model, we do not consider the wider dynamics for host. So in nature, we. So, in nature, we need to consider the both and death for humans. And so, finally, here I used the two references, and these two references are for the SIS patch model. But you can see like our analysis here, I like for the max like adopted from the SIS patch model. And finally, thank you so much for your attention. Thank you. So we can have a few questions? This is more of a comment than just a question. It's interesting that we've seen in the case of reaction diffusion models that you can have an increase in population because of the increase in diffusion. The population level can go up and go down. Go up and go down. But the population growth rate tends to reduce the ability to invade the growth rate. And it's part of the general reduction principle. And it looks like there's something similar philosophically going on here. I guess my point is, the simple reaction fusion case suggests that it's not surprising that you could have inconsistency between Between the prevalence and the persistence. And it's interesting, it also seems to go in the same direction in the two different modeling contexts. Maybe there's something somewhat more general going on that sits behind this. Thank you, Chris. So let's thank Professor Gaudier.
