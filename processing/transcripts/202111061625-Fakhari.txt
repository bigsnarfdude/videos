Impact positive impact problems. Thank you, Andrew, and thanks to the organizers for the Uh the study of the largest period of uh this expansion wa of the expansion of 1 over P when P is the prime goes back to Gauss. So for example, if we consider number 7, the prime 7, then we can see that this period is that the length of this period is equal to 6, but then for 11 we get 2. And then generally we can put some upper bound for this. Some upper bound for this 1 over p, which is p minus 1. And the goal is to study that when for which prime actually we get this longest period p minus 1. And one can check that this happens if and only if 10 actually has order p minus 1 mod p. And in this case, we say that 10 is a primitive root modulo p. So we can generalize this question, and instead of 10, we can think about Then we can think about any arbitrary integer like a, and then we can generally study the prime such that a is a primitive root, mod then. Or we can also say that in this situation, actually, we mean a should generate the whole FPS term when FP is the finite group of P elements. So then in 1927, Emil Artin actually proposed some conjectured density. Conjecture density for such primes for a given integer A, which is not 0 or not equal to plus or minus 1. The density, or better to say, the initial density that he conjectured is like this product. And then in this product, in here in the denominator, we have the order of the Galvo groups, the final Galvo groups of KQ over Q, and the product is over primes. And then by KQ, I mean the splitting field. And then by KQ I mean the splitting field of x to the power q minus a. And we usually name these fields in this type, we name them Kumer fields. Okay, but then in 1957, Derrick and Emma Demer saw some unexpected result in these conjectured densities. For example, they saw that for integer phi, their calculation is quite different from this product. So then they told this to R. So then they told this to Artin, and then to deal with this problem, Artin introduced a correction factor for his conjectural density. So the corrected conjectural density is now this product of E d times that product A that we saw above, when Ed is equal to this, and here by mu I mean the Mobius function. And we have this correction factor whenever the discriminant of k Whenever the discriminant of k2 over q is 1, 1, 4. And by k2, by the definition, k2 is just the q with a square root of a. Otherwise, we don't have any correction factor, and that product gives us the density. But then the reason that we have this degree of this number fields is because of the following lemma. So we can prove that A is So we can prove that A is we can show that A is a primitive root mod P if and only if P does not split completely in any JQ when Q divides P minus 1. Okay? Then using this lemma and Chabotrov density theorem, Juliander Giores in 1967 proved that the density is equal to this summation. Again here by mu, I mean the Mubius function. Okay, and then in denominator we have Okay, and then in the denominator we have again that Galois group of those Humer. Generally, we name, and then Hooly showed that this summation is the same as that product that Artin actually introduced. So generally, we name a problem, an Artin type problem, and we can tackle that problem by using the Hooly's method for Arting primitive root problem. So, as an example, So as an example for artin type problems we can look at the simplicity problem. So let's assume that we have an elliptical D, then we know that the rational points of D have this group structure and then we can look at all of these rational points module P. This gives us another group. So the goal for simplicity problem which introduced by Ser is to find a sympathetic formula for the find a sympathetic formula for the density of prime such that this group of rational points modulo P is cyclic for a given elliptic curve for example E. But then in 1976 Ser actually using the Hooley's method proved that under the GRH the density is equal to this summation. And then you can see now the connection between these two problems, simplicity problem and artin primitive root problem. In artin primitive root problem Problem. In our temperament problem, we have the same summation here. We have mu and Mubius function. And then in denominator, instead of this, we have the degree of Kumer fields over Q. But then here, we are dealing with degree of n-division fields over Q. And by n-division fields, I mean we can add all x and y-coordinates of n-torsion points of E to Q. This gives us a number field. The next example that I wish to talk about is in the That I wish to talk about it in this talk is as an artinite problem, is the Tishmash divisor problem. So we can define Tishmarsh divisor problem for different family of number fields, like for example we can consider it for single atomic fields, but here in this talk I want to focus on Tishmarsch Leweizer problem for family of Kumer fields. Okay, so for this purpose let me define this function tau A of p, which is a number of n such that PSP is complete in Kn. And by Kn I mean again the splitting field of x to the power n minus a. Then the average value of Felix and Morty in 2012 proved that the average value of this function tau a over prime is a thing Is asymptotic to this product, and then here this constant, you can see that this constant is similar to the ones that we have in RT primitive root problem, but instead of mu n, here we have 1. Actually, they used again the Hooly's method to prove this asymptotic formula, and they use also GRH. And we can also add more conditions on P. For example, we can consider all of these artin type problems for prime in a. Problems for prime in a given arithmetic progression. Okay, then we have some new artifact problems. So the goal of this talk is to find a method to somehow construct the product formula for summations appearing these art and type problems. And for this purpose, we first look at a method introduced by Len Straum, Moody, and Stephen Hagen, which named K. Which name character sums method. And then we will see that this character sums method, for example, cannot be we cannot use it for, for example, Titchmarsh Deweys problem. And mostly we can use the character sums method for the problems that we are dealing with density, not for example the Titchmarsh Dewey problem which we are dealing with the average value of that function. So because of that we try to modify this method in an effective way that we can In an effective way, that we can cover more argentine problems, like teachmax-deviser problems and teach max-devisor problem for a given uh or for primes in a given arithmetic progression. So, let's start with character sounds method. So, as I told you, it's a method that introduced by Len Stramorian and Stephen Hagen in 2014. For this purpose, let's assume that G and A are pro-finite groups, the inverse limit of this. Finite group, the inverse limit of these finite groups, for example, Gn and AN. And also let's assume that we have this exact sequence, short exact sequence. Here by mu2, I mean the multiplicative group of plus and minus 1. So we have this injective homomorphism and this quadratic character on A. Moreover, let's assume that A can be written as product of AP when each AP is again another profinite group. Okay? So, because So, because we know that profinite groups are that they have actually this topological structure and the topology is compact, so we can define a hard measure for them. And then we can, because the hard measure in this case is finite, we can think about a normalized hard measure. So, we define a normalized hard measure on A and because A can be written as a product of AP, we can actually write this measure as a product of. Measured as a product of, for example, measures new AP for each AP. Moreover, assume that we have, for example, moreover, assume that SP is a measurable subset of AP with positive measure for all P, and then we define S to be the product of this S P inside A. Then they proved that, then they proved this theorem. So you can look at this identity. So here on the left-hand side, we have a Here on the left-hand side, we have a density inside G. Okay? But then, by using this theorem, we can move this density problem to some problem to this, to the right-hand side, which is everything in the right-hand side is based on A. And for instance, here, you know that A can be written as product of AP, S is the product of S P. So if we can write also that chi, that quadratic chi as a product, then on the right-hand side, everything is like. Then on the right hand side everything is like product. Okay. This theorem for for example the Titchmansch divisor problem. Because in the Titchmansch divisor problem we are dealing with we don't have density, we are dealing with that summation of one over a d degree of the those Kumar fields. Those Kumer fields. So, because of that, we try to modify this method. So, in our modification, let's again assume that G and A are profinite groups. And also, suppose that we have this short exact sequence. By mu m you can think about, for example, the group of m sort of unity. And yeah, so then the goal is to find some product expression for. Some product expression for this summation, but then we need to put some conditions definitely. And then here by gn, I mean this size of that, and these finite groups. This exact sequence, this short exact sequence, actually gives us this theorem. So the theorem is say that this summation g n over size of g n is equal to this summation of this integrals. This summation of these integrals on A. So now in this theorem, we actually move our problem from G to A. And if we have some good properties in A, then we probably get our desired result easier compared to study directly this summation. And here by g tilde, I mean the summation, this summation, and here we have this characteristic function for kernel of phi a and n. When in this theorem, phi a and n is the In this theorem, phi A and N is the projection map from A to A parenthesis, and for example from A to this finite group A n. So, yes, so we have this theorem. Then, if we have some nice conditions on A, for example in this curlery, if we know that A can be written as product of A P, and also if chi is product of chi p, then we can write this summation by using that theorem as this product expression. And I should notice here that if m is if our mu m is just mu2 then this then we don't have this summation anymore and then we get this product formula also g should g tilde should be written as g tilde p when g tilde p is this summation and by phi p to the power k I mean the projection map from a p to a to the power k. Okay, so the only things that we need to now consider is this That we need to now consider is these quality characters, or generally characters, not quality characters when m is equal to 2. So we need to study these characters and we focus on the case when m is equal to 2. So we need to add some conditions on A and G to get some nice structure for our character chi. So for this purpose, let's assume that G is actually the inverse name. G is actually the inverse limit of some finite Galois groups, for example Kn over Q, such that Kn contains zeta n, n through to unity. Moreover, let's assume that K2 contains a quadratic field like K. We also need these two homomorphisms, so we define, we let's suppose that we have these two homomorphisms from A to Z had a star and from A to mu 2, such that the following, this Such that the following, these paragraphs commute. Okay, so here, for example, because we know that zeta n is in kn for all n, then we definitely can send g to galvov the maximum of the extension of q over q by restriction, for example. And then we need to know that this diagram commute when here we have this homomorphism. And the same thing happened here. So if we have all of these conditions, then then we can define a quadratic character on A such that R of G is inside the kernel of K. And also we can write with those conditions we can show that our character can be written as product of characters chi P. Okay? And also we can construct a character such that we have a good understanding about the action of this character on kernel of 5. kernel of 5q to the power k because we need because of that characteristic function of one of kernel of phik to the power k we need to know the action of these characters on each kernel of 5p to the power k. For example, if p is odd and if it divides the discriminant of k2, then we can show that the character is non-trivial on a p and it's trivial on all kernel of ki a kernel of five peter barber k for all k bigger than or equal to one. Bigger than or equal to 1. Okay? So let me again remind you that that corollary. So in the previous query that we had, g was multiplicative, k was something like the product of a p, chi is product. And then this gives us this identity, these conditions. And then here, because of this one of k l phi p to the power of k, we need to know the action of chi p on each k l of phi p. P on each kn of IP to the power k4 k bigger than or equal to zero. So considering this curtary, if we have all of those conditions that we talked about, about A and G, then we can get this curly which gives us an explicit product formula for this summation. So, but the only things here we need to be careful about prime 2. So, this 2. So this L here is always 1, except for 2. We need to be careful about the R discriminant. For example, if B is odd, then we can show that this summation should start from, for example, 1, but in the case that 4 device, it should start from 2. So let's look at some examples that we can apply this theorem or this currently for them. So the first example should be naturally the Kumer family. So let's So let's assume that again Kn is the splitting field of x to the power n minus a. And just for simplicity, we assume here that the absolute value of a is not a perfect power, but we can just reduce this condition easily. But for simplicity, because it gives us a simpler kind of representation for g at the end, just for simplicity, let's assume that we have this condition. Moreover, okay, so then we can. Moreover, okay, so then we can actually define for this family of Commer fields, we can define an injective homomorphism from G, from this profinite group G, to this profinite group of multiplicative matrices that we have, multiplicative matrices that we have here when B is in Z hat and D is in Z hat star. Then we can check and see that all of the conditions, that exact sequence and the other conditions hold here. Other conditions hold here, and therefore we can apply that the last quarter that we saw. So then it means that if we have, if this G is multiplicative and this summation is absolutely convergence, then we get this explicit product expression for the summation, for this summation. For example, now if instead of g n we put mu n, mobile's function, then we get the product expression for R term. Expression for RT primitive root problem. And if we put one here, we can get the Titchmarsh divisor problem, we can get the product formula for the Titchmarsh divisor problem. The next example is the family of SER curves. So for this one, let's assume that Kn is the n-division field for a given elliptic curve B. Then we know that there is a representation. Then we know that there is a representation for Galbo of Q torsion points, so I mean we just add all of torsion points to Q. Then this gives us this representation from this Galvo group to GL2 of Z hat. And what the problem here is that to have that short exact sequence from G to A to mu 2, we need to know that the index of the image of this map in Image of this map inside GL2Z hatch should have index 2. But this is not the case here for all of the elliptic curves. For some elliptic curves, this index is bigger than 2. So because of that, we just consider those elliptic curves that we get exactly 2 here for this index, and we name them cell curve. So therefore, for cell curve, we have, we can use that, again, we can apply the That again, we can apply that corollary, and we get that this summation when here is here the G and I mean the size of Galmo group of the n division fields over Q. Then we can write it as this product formula. Again here, instead of Gn put mu n, then it gives you this product formula gives you the simplicity problem. And if you put one, for example, you get the Titchmars divisor problem for the fact. You get the Titchmark divisor problem for the family of cell curves, or yeah, for the family of N-division fields for a cell curve. So the last thing that I want to mention here is a generalization. How much time do I have? You have nine minus nine minutes. Okay, good. So for the generalization, generalization of this Then, generalization of this method that I just introduced, let's assume that B is another profinite group and B can be written as, for example, the local prime BP. Moreover, suppose that there is a surjective homomorphism from A to B. Then the things that we want to change in our theorem, first of all, instead of considering phi of A and N as the projection from A to A N, we consider We consider the natural map from A to B N, which is well defined because we have a surjective homorphism from A to B, so we send A to B, and then by projection map we send it to B, Francis N. And instead of considering the kernel of phi A and N, we consider the inverse of phi A and N for some Hn when Hn comes from a subset of B like H. So Hn is just a projection of So Hn is just a projection of H and Pn. Then by changing this map and this Hn, we can get this identity. So you may say that what's the point of this identity? We don't have any G here, but then if you remember, we have that short exact sequence. And then that short exact sequence tells us that if we have that short exact sequence, then this kernel of chi is equal to g. But then how we can use this generalization. So by using by so let me first talk about the Tishmarsh divisor problem for prime in a given arithmetic propression. For example, let's assume that we just consider those primes that are equal to L mod F. Okay? Then one can predict that the average value of tau p in this case is negative τp in this case is equal to the asymptotic to this product when the constant here is this summation. And then by C Ln I mean something like this. And then here by sigma L I mean the map the Galois elements of Q zeta F over Q which send Zeta F to Zeta F to the power F. So then by this C L N we can predict that we can predict that is we can predict that this is the constant in this asymptotic formula. And then if we consider phi A and N from A to A n times Z hat over F Z hat star and this is well defined because so the first component is just a projection map and the second one Projection map and the second one, if, for example, we consider Komer family and we consider that representation, we can send A is just those matrices. So we can consider determinant, and then we send A to Z had a star and then mod F. So, and also if we define Hn to be the identity of Z over NZ and L bar, then we can apply that generalization which gives us. That generalization, which gives us a product expression for this summation. Yes, so that generalization at the end gives us this tool that we can add more conditional P, like this one. And in this situation, we can deal with so many artinite problems and we can add so many conditions of P. So many conditions of P. Okay, thank you. Do we have any questions for Ela, please? I don't see questions from our participants. How can we speak before you do the generalization? The generalization and you did it for a family of cyclot, if you just replay it by an easy, like a cyclotomic family of fields, how the result going to be? Oh, for the cyclotomic family. Yes. So the fact is for this fact is we have for the cyclotomic family we have the product. So the correction factor doesn't. So, the correction factor doesn't appear. So, I think it's easier to deal with that family. And then the reason is SER family and then core family. For example, here, the reason that we have that correction factor is because of the entanglement that happens between, for example, Q abelian. example Q of L, if we just consider that those eta n, and the other ones. And then the entanglement is because of that K, which I think I think, yeah, I talk about it here. But then in the case of sigma atomic field, we just have that zeta n's and then k is inside them, so we don't need to be worried about correction factor. In that case, for example, for the Titchmark the Ways problem. For example, for the teacher marketing, it's probably also. Thank you. Thank you. Do we have other questions? Is there a kind of easier way to do this in the sense of like computing this? So you have a sum you want to write as a corroga. Yes. So is it a very difficult problem? Problem if without these profonal groups or with profonal groups? What is the challenge? So the fact is yes, we have this k which appears in because if we want to write things as product of over primes, then this k appears in component two and also appears in other two. Also appears in other prime components, product of other prime components. And then if we, for example, want to write the correction factor for the case of, for example, Tishmash divisor problem, because we are dealing with all integers, then it's really complicated to just directly find the product by starting from the summation without considering these profile groups. We built basically We will face a lot of con uh a lot of different conditions there. But then, yeah, I think by considering these profinial groups, we can look at the problem better, and then the approach becomes really easier if you just want to directly find a product. Can you find those GNs like directly? find those GNs like directly and yes so we cannot I think because so you mean we just start from this summation and then so you have a summation of a small g n divided by a big g n so small g n is a function that is given which is one for example is mu1 n is one For example, this mu1 is one or something. Big G N. So do you, if you know about this big GN, so you put it there and then you try with some, try to factor it some. Yes, but then the problem is because this entanglement is really depends on, for example, that component two. If we want to just but I remember there is also some problem. Problem. It should be definitely messy because we need to put different conditions on the discriminant and on the especially the component 2 in our discriminant. But then I think also there is some major problem if we want to avoid to use these profinite groups. I mean the case of Tishmarsh Dev is a problem definitely, not the other cases, because the other Definitely not the other cases, because the other cases can be done without using this method. I don't remember what was the major problem that happens, but definitely it gives us, we need to first of all, this method actually gives us the reason that we have this correction factor, it makes everything clear. Factor, it makes everything clear that the correction factor comes from that k and then also it and then that character where is that character, it's not here. And then that quality character actually gives us a really nice idea about the things that happens. About the things that happen, the reason that we have this correction factor. Otherwise, we cannot actually understand why we get something like that. So, one of the benefits is this. And definitely, the direct way is really messy. And I'm sure there was also something some major problem, but I don't remember what was that. Thank you. Really, for the time frustration, we can discuss more and then I'll can you first briefly? Thank you. So what time with us again?
