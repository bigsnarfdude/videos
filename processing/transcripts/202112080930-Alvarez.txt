Muchímas gracias, Victoria, and the organizers. Muchísimas gracias por invitation are pleasure here in a conference incredible conference. We are very and mathematical. Muchas gracias, many gracias for here. Because Victoria, I am my doctorado, the University of Bristol in Englater. In Englater, I worked in the studio of statistics of allatorias. The applications of my work of Dr. Advanced many objectors of numerous areas analog in theater markets, which can be applied to information conjectures in theory of numerous. So, if you practice authors in first matrix, can be theory of numerous applications. And what is applicable to the post are applications sense of climate sense. So our applications, if we start the plan, is a very rapid introduction. We are a more confused with two things that with these statistical calculations in salient metrics. In matrices, we will see how profound numerous and measured with the climax. It's pretty good. It's my first Spanish channel. So, if you have situations, if you're the palabra, por favor not interpir, sister human, no vision for favor. And when we are not, like, okay, I work with the studio of proprietades, statistics, matrices, allegories. In particular, In particular, I studied the compact classical compact. That was a ratito. There are other conjuntos that Gaussian possibilities or conjunto orthogonal Gaussian organization. Estol que yo losina primara parte espar los conjuntos compactos. Ah, well, the matrices in this conjunction has valuable proprietors or in values, in the circle of unidash, and the majority of the applications for those conjugates in studying proprietors of valuable proprietors, and that the utilizes as models for the statistics of interest. And the systems that And the systems that are also moderated by systems that have many correlation. No, the systems like many correlation. It's very rapid. We are working with Joe Esir Equis. Joe ESIR Ekis en el grupo unitario, the grupo especial group orthogonal there two can cuando enumero par o en es unumer grupos. And the simplectical group that is dimension to the polynomial characteristic with Lambda, evaluated a point that determinante del identity multiplication for es. The identity multiplicated por essay, the characteristic polynomial has raised the raises of the characteristic polynomials valuable in the matrix. That is important. Equis, von square y seta chain. If the matrices of dimension in the valuable proprietors, and how in the circular united circles, the pupils cried and the hot is. Teta Jota is the angular. Okay. So here, we are simpler, vaccine. For the matrix in a matter, you can distinct propriofoses, and we are in the specific orthogonal group, which will Conjugados complex. Perfect. Conjugados complex, perfect. So this case, when it is a rosa, for the ten una cases. Or this case sufficient to see the first and malores because with that. And that is the same for the group simplectic group, okay? So you know, So, you have to know the first and all. When this group is special of dimension in part, they have simply one value in one. The more is that the determinants of the group is specific or toponyms, simply that they have determinants one. Well, there are the characteristics of proprios important. Tiempre. Okay. I think one example. One example of what type of system is also. One example of what type of system is also modeled with Mexico, also power, is autobioses of cornerback. I think there are examples. Well, but we have 20,000 numbers. And the example, the tobaccos.  In the conductor, you have to use their own passage. So, the conductor that is maximizing the number of passages, to maximize the case, then locations that contract in the past, we are creating these unless parades. And if many agent have here the day in the Papel with one, that the decision here is much agent, we are rapidly for the cancer and recover the agent. But if you don't write, cancel more. Ok. This This is a very correlation system. Because one authors are many authors is competencia. This competence is that creating the interaction. Because in models of classical transport, as models of sites like the LAD, and models that are in the LADA, systemas independent systems, typically representative models. Representados models for variables of what is not in interaction. But I did a queue to see no horror, it would be quite rapid, and the model and if this distribution of GOE that is what the most rapid or toggle of ocean is compact, but What I'm doing for very interesting is that they have a lot of platinums of numerous and well of matrix in the compact is that they are circulating the circular unidentified and put the uniformement. Formally pasaber como puton a cluster como accumulation and dependientes Si, CCC, IIDO la camera. Well, if we recognizions, and many passes, these normal passes, these normal energies that don't have this interaction. Sebury lays passions in our buses, not passing the order because there are traffic, because this and between transport systems, no correlation, but there are other accumulations and when we Raison for this is that tiene repulsion. Los valor proposed, and the view is for the. Probably, and the most por the probability function has repulsion. So, we don't correlation, but they have repulsion. Here, in the repulsion, because if a minutes could collect pasters, this can have a repulsion that has been reported to pass. Stabien, well. Legs will be this element of repulsion in the probabilistic aspect. Other second place, in what works with a lot of what you are doing, is apprentices that are automatic. And also, in red, what is models of reds? Well, I can say, when you have stability. If you want to pass with the stability of your system of automatic system, you can have a perturbation and introduce a rule. And if you want to see what is your system with introducing a ruido, you can use the authorities because the interest is that the coefficients of your matrix are variables, the values because they don't have much correlation. Well, the result that the values for opioids. That the values for matrices are conjugate unitario are very well models for the seros of the function of set of riman function. So it is very rapid, the function of set of riman function, which is like the 2 is the infinite for the real For the real part of one, with a product on the primos, primo, one, okay. So the function of rim ten, clear the seros is also with the numeros first, the hypothesis arriment, is that all the seros who are. That is going to say that normally sigma and tejota tejota real. Ok, that's not trivial. Of the function of that, all tienen que la parte la parte real estual unpa esto sería como. And this linear criticism can be pens as involved in the circular, okay? And the series, we have the space, the space between the series.  Y don't have time for the quieter cafe or in the sena queen that Daison and Montgomery. That is very good, because I don't think many people are Montgomery. This history of how people, how when we say that the seros of the function of Rimen is also por. Y so if comparing it, but if we compare what the two-point correlations are specimen, and that can be end-point correlations, the correlation of three points, three points in it.  Unable to las dos that consider the doses that are essential to a calculo of statistical provides in the compact. Well, ton the dosarientos, the first is the for. The formula integration integration integration. Formula, formula. A formula no llaba? Formula. Gracias. See, it's a formula, and the formula is the integration of. Well, that the formula of integration of integration. OK, when we por exemplo estudiar or promediar diamos, the valor of the characteristic value of one, we have the promise about all the unitarias how this conjugate is compact, well, we don't. But well, I can see it. Well, I know, it's actually like integrated on a group of matrices. So, the formula of integration how this is how to make a matrices with these properties. When the goal: the formula of velocity is a group compact and And it has a statistical queue. F is a function of class functions. It's a function of class. In this case, they are the values proposals. So, if it is not a function of class, it is constant in equivalent classes, as the characteristic polynomial, or many other statisticals. So, puedo promediar on the group compacto group, 36 por values about the dimension, evaluated in the value of proposals with the function of density, probabilities, probabilities. In fact, no. In fact, no, know that valores propios. Because they are original or complex, it is like a integral, multiple integral and how integral evaluation is that if it is a function of class, about the values, evaluating this function, about the proposed value needs air la function probability of the values. And if you are And that's the possible. That is a integral multiple integration. Well, we are concrete, I will say the function of probabilities of the group, oops, pen, in the factorial factor, and this determinant that we have. Okay, let's give this. This yes, what is it that all That is what all integral assemblers will have one, to integrate the production, this also determinante de vanderman. This capturing repulsion. Pulsion of it. Because we have these functions of probability. This is what probability probability with this matrix in the United States. So two values that coincide. We have to meet. So I probably compare. So, with probability, in center una matrix in the pond, that have two proposals that coincident. And if very circumstances, the probability is very bad. That creates repulsion in the probabilistic. Okay, very rapid. Okay, very rapid. El determinante de vandermon que normante describe delta se la terminante duna matrice because one la raya, the first equivalent are variables.  So the determinants of determination. So this determinant, like the cuado tengo los determinants evangelized. Well, no sorry. Well, I think the valor absolutely, it tengo tengu el vandermann and tengo sugar complex. Bueno. La segunda ramienta. The formula of Andrea, but if you have a multiple integral with two determinants, and it is. When two terminals say F, if one is N, who goes integral, and a determinant for this notation, also critiques here, we are doing some. Porque, uno, when we sell the indici of filas, y cas indicate columnas of one. Los que voice because for Andrea vandover. Evaluado a minute of other function. The other function, and we have this integrated equivalent. The product of achieve, F, y. It is a man of evaluation like a determinant. It is forbidden, because it's exactly what we have: we have multiple integral, we have a function, we have two determinants. That is like collapse in a determinant. You will see here. One sequel with the indicants, and one has a change. Because all those values are different. If not, we can cabar, but this is like the gold, and we say very rapidly that the characteristic, the product, the races are the proprietors, this evaluated one privilege. Privileged that the polynomial characteristic, whereof the integration first, the vendor form. The values proposed and not in complexity. If you have a two que falta, the function of probabilities, two. Probability, 2 in factorial, and 2 verses determined by 2. And here the factorial, because it aquí connects the formula of form. Ok. And this valuable, especially. This que valence por val. Andrea, pomestar a determinante. Se que sustain pukto rapio, tempeso profante espación. So if the determinant. Tengo que mi. Tengo que mater one por dos pi a cada fila o cada colúna. Tengo en copias, teno comes acadafila. So one por two pi. Porcer esto transformación de la multiple integral multipla a determiniente pier do un factorial. estendo parés. Integral de 0 p estes mi function ache. My function ache, it supervised because a product of one por a calafila un van derman que es y feta hota menos uno. El se one vanderman que perond estos valor absoluto es el. That complex. Because they came up. And that's clear that a trivial because normally we don't. No promise about the characteristic polynomial, not only absolutely. And we can imagine that the characteristic point could be the logarithmic derivative, which is what you can collect because it can be studied. Because it studied for the numerous. Perdandente, how relationships are here. Yes, okay, exactly. Well, for example, how the polynomial characteristic of a matrix. Of a matrix, the pupil terminus of the values proposed from this matrix. So, how is a function of classes, that is constant on the property, so that it was more here? If you can describe your functions, it's a function of the matrix in terms of their values. If the context is bueno, Buenos ok. Toría de numeros. Okay. Okay. Typically, like a dictionary very classical for the studio of matrices and numeros. This dictionario oscillator. For example, the function of remains. No, no, right. No, no, functions of it. The function of setting is not functional. A lot more can be defined functions of algebraic concurbas, the pupils definitely with characters. The functions of the tier tier families, right? When the definitions with a character definitely cubic character, quadratic character will have a typical symmetry. So here's families and symmetria symmetria, symmetria, symmetria, symmetria. Well, symmetry las familias. Symmetria esto dependeve. The um la functional equation, la equation functional functional function, seasonal and functional and here the typical symmetry corresponding to the three conjugates, the four conjunctions of the compact. That par and simplex. Rather, that is what the determinant simplicity valor absolutely, and it is a valor complex. If the property doesn't have their complexity, then you can see a absolute value, but simply in the circular. Or absolutely in the circular unit, it is absolutely here also in the functional equation to the signal of all functional equations, and families of functions. That signal can be complex, but simply as absolutely. So, these statistics correspond to statistical corresponding unitaries. Here, if you have determinants, if the one here also. Answer because it is studying orthogonal also. Here can be determined. We are in the group, especially orthogonal groups in the last simple queue in one special, orthogonal, also in one. Outrages when they are functional, when they are familiar, that can be more or less unfortunate, but not complex. Omenos uno, but complex corresponding statistics orthogonal statistics and here simply determinant. Here we have the circular unity, which all values properly in this circular, and here we have the critical linear. For all functions, we have the hypothesis generalized, which is. And we paramos closer to those functions in the linear critical function, this studio. Here we have in seros, achan here we have a density. We have a pura, like a por log. And this dictionary, but we are concrete. Yes. Las varieties of the question of the matrix in the world. In the functions that we can see that the variable of the authors, the variable of the function. But what is the authorities? Because no, well, no, there. We don't have models, no? Lides, here we are variables. But the interest is that the coefficients of the matrices are the properties can study very well, and that are models correlations very, so that no randomness, allegatory intrinsic. So, oh, we don't know. Intrinsic. One. We do not call the distribution of the numerous primos, but if it allows us to distribution. If I think many definitions, this was the function of Riman, part of real function of L Damos that you will also. And here my machine is not a restriction. Machine that is not restriction. This character is what you will. And this character, well, for the function of this trivial character, the character that present character of a curve, can be a cubic character. Cubico button there as a tamenessan authorities, like that of Casino. If it's actually what expedition. And now you must probably have it. If there are no deficiencies that the functions are, it has a functional question, which has representation as a rep and have a representation of product representation, but it functions that have no satisfaction and that they have. Satisfaction alloy that has our cosas, no, but general siences that have satisfied these three proprietors. Well, we are the civilization. A conjecture that is going to one of these very good. The main estimate of 6 and for the two in the 96, but we valued absolute function. The moment, the two moments, the moment. And here is our log. This aca, that is what the decentral arithmetic factor, okay? This explicit. This explicit explicit effect is that we do not see that because we are what the arithmetic factors will be with a product or primaries. But the reason why this is a rule for general is why we are what is the factor that is geometrical. Well, the miles here, we can result in momentos, the characteristic polynomial of the group unitarium, because. And well, for And for one and cad, if it is the same, it's the configuration. So if the three cycles have one collectors based on the same thing, and if we also coincidentize, What coincidence? The valores, so that we can quiet. What are those metrics that we can calculate expressly? And how the auditors are models for numerous models, that can form a clave that we can launch. It is more fascinating. It's more fascinating with the sabes like that. Answer that the scenario because we have ignored the object, what's the critical criteria that the matrix is not able to capture all the information because no arithmetic factor is. Obviously, this factor arithmetic. Okay, but the respuestes that I don't review, but also the response that we have the arithmetic. OK, and that's why the work that I doctoral, this is my I work much with. I work much with simple analyses, which have a structure with the different structures. I want to study moments of the characteristic polynomial, which is not that confusing, but if you want. But if these spaces are between the seros and this, it's que no estecos que están toda la linear critica. And that calculos the derivative of the function of set function or. Of the function of setting or the characteristic polynomial, you can inform it. So, this is a great. Yes, perfect. Let's go explicit a pocket what people say, about applications of materials since the climate. Lases, the pupues for model muchas. What can I do if we are ecological? Ecological relations between predators and established ecological systems that introduces animals. So, that is established, and the paper that I think is much global correlations. Correlations correlation matrix spectra of the surface temperature of oceans oceans from random matrix theory and plus. Theory. If the record is not a very important thing, I don't think many people with this title. If required in a collection product, when our interactions we model, and we are interactions, we authorized it. The superintendent is Papel is that. Santos Papel is that the sectors yet there are the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. So the temperature of the oceanos, sa de la surface, of the oceanos, gracias, or the superficial. It is the longitude, which is very much. For the three societies, Pacifico and Atlánico del 192. And create matrices. We are the authors of matrices. OK, with the temperatures. What is that? Because no podium. Because I can go here. And here Pacific aquí Pacifico Norte, Pacifico Central, Pacifico Sur y que loque en el Pacifico Polo, que del Polo central. Antarctica, for the surf. The mission with the Atlantic and with Indio. So, region has a conjugate 2, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6. This is six. OK, so it has a matrix and central pacific dimension. This dimension will be greater than this dimension, but important. We have a two, two, three, matrices for region. Paca region that we have in the matrix. Please. What if the correlation correlation will be for here transposed? They are what the transpuesta of equals. And the divides for the dimension and this matrix. See, if they are Me Lamos. Se va ser la matrice e correlation or el correción estabión correlation because capturing interactions, no entry to components and bueno y se diro y o que que aquí pues ordinar. And what you do. What is ah, what is the distribution of product? This dad presentes this my group and universities a mesh and vista distribution of products and the person that first distribution these three parameters. Beta pony veta ka se y la se veas veta es y veta sal de se veta es y uno más veta. Well Okay, um Okay, um here for example and the continuous analytic continuum. If the sero recovered the distribution of distribution, when it sibled one recover the distribution of GOV because. Giovín que confuntos poconal te oceano. El mismo que vimos para loses corna vaca. Super interestante. Ok, so what if valores propios studio la distribution two per correlation? So the values propios and region. No line of best fit concise. El mejor Juste. Okay, the mejora just. Obviously, para spaceamento que vamosir un spaceamento silo esquiraca. Studiar el space y. Puedo los valo espropios va ser. Lambda y menos, lambda y menos uno tideo por promedio de espaciamiento esbre todo los two 10. Okay, so the space. It valor del 2into valor propium, but the cuarto dio por promedio del espación es el quinto y el cuarto valor. Of the space between the Quinton and the valor proposition, all the matrices in that conjunto. That's the space. So, to contrar the veta, we have to promote all veta. Once the promise of the side of the side, the light Promedos of Quinto space, of sector, septimo, October. And valores, so that region and what contrary is that tienes valores that are in one in all parts of North, all the societies, central, and survey. But when we are. And exactly, that's what this is: in very friends, we have the survey temperature not interaction. That what implications have the application for models of climate change, what is that in the interactions. The polo have interactions that are in the surface. The surroundings are the most interaction and the north and central center. That is that if the temperature here is the most information on the temperature here, which is the same distances in the polo. And I think with that. Con matrices can model. Puedes model function of Lois or function of Medius. What are your results? No, if you practice the function of movie and Louisville, but no vista. But no vista cannot matrices. My major information comes to the numbers first also as intrinsic, but no vista. But no vista. But I don't know why no. Ah, Claro. What you see is what is the analogy? So we have the analogy. So, what is what is the analog of the function of the UV inflation and verse calculating the promise? That's what we're talking about. In the chat, the microphone octave. In the last example that presentation is more data, because you can see a diffusion in the city or explain just the different in Ecuador, or only Correct data and compare with matrix editors. If we porque, we definitely parametro de veta, there is a model physical queue explicitly, so this is not what I observed. But no, no, because we understand that the implication for models of climate have studied classes. Because in the polo we are going to be able to do that. And my question is because we know that the distribution of products in the una relevance to model this problem. Because in the language, well that the presentation of positive things from the sensors can be like the plots, a little like other questions that how we model seros, based on the galores, and putting it. Galores and putting the distribution of GOE and basically like if we also criticize that I am a professor in the department that clearly, how variable you can variable so that it just goes, but if you have to be able to do it in our uniform, for example. But if you complete how. How if heuristic as computational health, and limiting as if we create more data, data? That's it. Brody, paradoxical documentario and pregunta. Brody is the Brody de Matrica Letorias, no? Y well, we are in Mexico. Yes, that is the distribution of production to be with theoretical materials. So, this natural queue with this type of distributions, because it is quite quick, because if one recover with it, but if we are. We have to continue the commentaries of octavio. When we are platinum, this parents matrices, well, matrices are discretizations of the sean. So, segura can say a solution is the question of calories, and then. And then it will be a relation between a coefficient of diffusion that is biennial through the correlation in these matrices. So, speculatively, I think it has to do with what it is. It's a discreditation of the placement, what you say. De la placida no, si como de la cosiende que. For the silence that is not expectation because in the motors and the men. And there are things that are stochastic, clear. So, stochastic ideas are not. So, we are delarious process of discussion of calories, and the resolution are in the question with a coefficient of deterministic coefficients, in a stationary solution. But in the market, this is statistical variable diffusion and what they are retracting, or these solutions do. And so this relationship of statistical relations of solutions from these questions with quantification in septumbre. So I pad the relationship. Well, I'm going to go Emilia because it's a very good question. And we have a minutes for logistics of the Platica.
