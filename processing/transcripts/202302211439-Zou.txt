I'd like to thank the organizers for inviting me to this lovely place and thanks for the opportunity for me to speak. And I'm talking about triple light on smooth cubic surfaces. So I talked the same thing like half a year ago and some of you saw it, but then it's half a year ago, so you might have forgot already. But I talk the similar things on reducible. So this, I will talk about. So, this I will talk about on irreducible smooth cubic surfaces, but I also talk about similar things on reducible cubic surfaces. And the result will be the same, but the proofs are very different. So I hope I can get a bit to the proof part. Otherwise, you will see it again. Okay, so this is joint work with Martin Beis and Jan Dobrovsky. And here is a beautiful picture from Urik Egan. So this is So this is a Klerbisch cubic and so these so these lines, the lines on the cubic, on the cubics. So I will talk more about it later. Okay, so the focus will be about triple lines, which is originated from the classical orchard problem. So the setting is like you have The setting is like you have an orchard planted with trees, and the task is to find the maximum possible number of distinct lines containing three trees. And this problem is like earliest they can find is by Jackson in 1821 in a book called Rational Amusement for Winter Evenings. And it's a pro book called in a very nice way. It's a proposed in a very nice way. Let me read it. So, faint would I plant a growth in rows? But how must I its form compose with three trees in each row to have as many rows as trees? Tell me, artists. This is an important one. Artists, if you're pleased, it's all I want to know. So, this is what they do in the interviews. Very rich. Yeah, very rich. Yeah, very few. So here is an example. So you have 11 trees and 6 lines of 3 trees. So it's like very... Probably this is the maximum one for 11 trees, I guess. Otherwise, if I fail it, I think we would just put it as an example. I mean, I didn't check it, it's the next one. Okay, so we can say, so let me give the definition of triple line. So think of, in general, if you have a Of in general, if you have a set A in some Euclidean space R D, or you can work projectively if you like. So a triple line is a line, in A is a line that contains at least three points in A. So here is an easier observation that if you have a finite set of n points, then you can get at most n times n minus 1 over 6 management voice. So this is an easy hacker. So this is an easy calculation because if you have a line will be determined by a pair, right? A pair of distinct elements. So you have, how many pairs you have? You have n times n minus 1 over 2 by the pairs, different pairs. But if you count in on the triple line, so you have at least three points. So you will count the pairs The pairs at least three times. So this one, this one, and this one, right? So it turns two, three, three. So you get this easy upper bond. And so we will actually do a very loose bond. So I only care about when we can get quadratically many tripolines. So namely, and also asymptotically. So namely, and also asymptotically, namely for any epsilon, I can get a set of size n with more than n to the power of 2 minus epsilon minus x. Okay, so let's see some examples. So they are all examples in R2, so under your plane, which usually an all chart is. Okay. Okay, so I have three equally distanced parallel lines, and I put three same equally spaced points on them, and then I get approximately n squared over 18 management parts. And the calculation is easy, I figured out. Yeah, anyway. Okay, so what surprised me a little bit is like you can also do it with non-parallel binds. So here's the example. So you take three non-parallel lines and they form a triangle. That's a triangle and all three edges you take geometric progressions in the following sense. For example, on this edge you put On this edge, you put these red points D such that C D over T B is 2 to the power of N, where N you can take from minus N to N. So for example, you can also take a point here, so that C D over D B is 1, so 2 to the 0. So B is the middle point of C and B. And you can get, as before, from endpoints, you can get n square over 18 millimeter lines. So, this is a picture adapted from Alex Sabo's paper. And let me say a bit more about why you can get this, so why geometric progressions like that works, is because of this Menelaus theorem, which is very elementary, probably you know it. Probably you know it in high school or something. I don't know, but I don't know. Which is if you have EDF collinear, if only if, so these like these proportions, what is ratios, yeah, these ratios, and like you take the product of them, they're equal to one. equal to one. So in this case, for example, AF over FB times BD, so on this line, BD over DC times CE over EA is what? And this is the if on if. Okay, let me get to another example which is even more complicated. So now I work, so I take an elliptic curve. An elliptic curve, so to make it work better, so I need to work on projectively. And so, on elliptic curves, so they are, there's Iron structures, and they have a lot of common points. So, I have a lot of finite subgroups. So, I take a subgroup of size n on the elliptic curve, then with n points, I can get n times. I can get n times n minus 3 over 6 to take the floor plus 1 management products. So you see we are getting almost to n squared over 6. So this is the almost to the natural upper bound we can get. And actually, this is proved by Brintel, like this is in R squared, this is the actual upper bound you can get. So finite. You can get. So, finite subgroups on the elliptic curves gives you the upper bound on R2. And let me say a bit more about why it works like before. So you can take actually, so you can define the, choose the base point of the, that you define the abelian group rule so that on this elliptic curve. And on this elliptic curve, x, y, z are collinear if only if they sum up to zero. So there's a lot of similarity between this example and the triangle example. So what about the first example we showed? Like, actually, we can also think it as some group law and some arithmetic progression, some progression. So you can Progression. So you can place arithmetic progressions like this. So you take 0, 1, 2, and same for the first line and the third line, and you make the middle line double, but also on the reverse direction, so 0, minus 2, and minus 4. And then you can make sure that x, y, z are co-linear if only if they sum up to 0. So we're the So, where this kind of shows that what explains here is a group law. So, the collineality really corresponds to some group law, and you take arithmetic progressions or geometric progressions or subgroups, then you get a lot of triple lines. And so, here's a theorem by Alex Abo and also later proof. And also later proved where it's never published, and then they were published by a lot of other results by Hart, Shakir, and Desleuf with explicit bonds. So this theorem states like on algebraic curves, this is the only case, and it's actually because there's a group. So, what it says that is, so if is so if in R2 in the plane so if you fix any constancy and D, which will be the degree of the curve, so if an irreducible algebraic curve of degree D contains a set P of n points with quadratically many triple lines, so C to the N square multi-triple lines, in this P for some n big enough, then the curve must be cubic. And so we know the curve must be cubic, and in all cubic cases, so I skip the conic case. You can have a line and a conic, and there's also a group law associated to it with collinality. So by theorems in combinatorics added to pin reverse, you can see that actually the points that you The points that you, the sets that you have quadruple, many triple lines omit must come essentially from finite approximate support. And by the structure theorem of we have green tau, morally they will be translates of alphabetical aggressions or cosets of subgroups. So, which explains like these examples are kind of the canonical example we can expect. sample we can expect so that we can get quadratically managed on the algebraic curve. Okay, so one of our motivation is likes to think what happens in higher dimensional, so what about in R3 or projective or over the complex numbers? So what are algebraic surfaces that can have quadratically managed polarization? And one guess would be Gas would be cubic surfaces, because this is the lowest degree surfaces that can have tripolized, right? And so we're smooth qubit surface examples, and the main theorem I will present today is no. So if you have a set with large enough with quadratically manageable lines on a smooth cubic surface, then Cubic surface, then almost all the tropologies will be concentrated on some cubic curve. So actually, we plan a cubic curve, which is like a projective plan intersect this smooth cubic surface. So which will be back to the original case that it's a cubic curve on the planes. Okay, so let me say more a little bit more about smooth cubic surfaces. So I would think okay, so we would consider cubic surfaces defined over the complex numbers. So an irreducible cubic surface also projectively. So will be defined by an irreducible homogeneous polynomial equation and with Normal equation and with four variables, and of so only one equation with four variables of degree three, and you take coefficients in complex numbers. And so such a cubic surface is called, okay, such a surface is called smooth if for any element uh and an any rational point on the surface. So the partial derivatives so you have four partial derivatives at this point is not all zero. At this point, it's not all zero. So, for example, the Fermat cubic surfaces and smooth cubic surfaces. Because you can see, so the partial derivatives of like each variable is just 3x squared, right? And it's 0 if only if it is 0. So the singular point will be 0, 0, 0, 0, which is not a point projectively. So you never get So, you never get a singular point, so it's smooth. And a projected pen on the projective three space is just defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree one. So, for example, you can take x equals zero or x plus y plus z plus w equals zero. And two distinct project planes intersect in the project line. And if you intersect a plan. If you intersect a plan pi with a cubic surface, smooth cubic surface, or cubic surface, then you get a cubic curve. And we call this cubic curve plan a cubic curve. And most of the time, generically, so S intercept the generic plan, the cubic curve will be smooth, so it will be elliptic curve. But if sometimes you also get reducible ones, for example, cornic and the line. For example, Koenig and the line, and now smooth one is where. And here is an interesting fact that a smooth cubic surface over complex numbers contains exactly 27i's. I mean, it's an interesting for me useless without it. Yeah. Okay. Okay, let's look at back this beautiful example of. This beautiful example of a picture of cubic surfaces, so these lines are the 27 lines, I guess. Okay, so what is the May theorem? So I went to, yeah, so I will talk about the Make theorem, which will be, as I said, like if you have quadratically many triple lines on the smooth qubit surface, then all of them. They would concentrate on rare cubic curves. So, I will, because we work asymptotically, so the best way, I mean, not the best way, a neater way to do it is taking out a product and use the cos pseudo-finite dimension developed by Udi. So, yeah, the definition looks a bit, yeah, I would say the definition later, but then I would. I will say the definition later, but then I want to advertise that this is really a good thing to work with because with this dimension, so it's like you can define an independence relation and with this independence relation, it has almost all the properties you want for an independence relation. So, for example, it satisfies all the properties of a focal indicator. All the properties of a Falkland independence except the independence theorem. So you can do the basic Fokking calculus like symmetry, transactivity, base monotonicity, anything like, except you cannot use independent theorem. I guess this is really the new stability part of my talk. Anyway, okay. Okay, so let me go back to the definition of the setup. So we take out products. So we take a fixed and non-principle attribute on the natural numbers and we take the archer powers of the complex numbers of the natural numbers and then the rears with the same archer product, with the same arch theater. And so if you have a sequence of smooth cubits, A sequence of smooth cubic surfaces, then you take that product, then you can think of it as a smooth cubic surface defined on with coefficients in the non-standard complex numbers. And now I want to count the triple lines, so which will be collinear triples. So I will define this algebraic relation R as the tunnel relation such that The terminal relation such that R x1, x2, x3 holds if x1, x2, x3 are distinct, collinear. And I also want it to avoid, so this, this, so the line that x1, x2, x3 is on should not be on the 27 lines of s. This is because if you have a lot of points on the 27 lines, then you will count them too many times. Too many times, and I want to avoid count this triple line too many times, so I'll just avoid it. I just not counted at all because there are only 27 of them, so it's okay to ignore that. Okay, so we have this tunnel relation, collinearity relation defined already, which will correspond to triple lines. And so now I will define the cost pseudo-finite dimension on internal sets. So internal sets of Of this cubic surface will be just the outer product of subsets Xi of Si. And for internal subsets, we define, okay, so fix a non-standard network number, which is not finite. Now I can define the cost pseudo-finite dimension delta x on all internal sets defined in this way. So delta x of So delta x of x will be just extended part of log c of the size of x. So it will take the value into non-negative rears unit infinite. So the expression looks a bit difficult, but actually it just picks up the power. So if you think of you can you want to write the size of x in terms of casi to the sum power of t. So this is Some power of t. So this is just like the t, the power that you pick up. So this just defines this. So for example, if c is some limit of, so yeah, a sequence of ni, and the size of xi is ni square. So it's a little bit smaller than this over log ni, then delta xc, it will see the power two, because log ni is just too small. Just too small. Sorry. Okay, so the main theorem is that so for any such non-standard number, so we define this cost dimension delta xc. So suppose there are internal sets x1, x2, x3, with the cost dimension of xi is 1, and the cost dimension. And the cost dimension of this co-linearity, like this terminal relation r intersect x1 times x2 times x3 is 2, which means that you have quadratically many collinear triples, which also means that you have quadratically many triple lines. Then they will concentrate on planar cubic curve. Namely, so there will exist a projected plan pi such that already. Such that already delta X C, so this cost dimension of R intersect the product of Xi restricted on this plane, pi, you get the cost dimensions 2. So you already get quadratically many collinear triples concentrate, like on if you only count on this plane. But we're not seeing the top type of this uh plane or smaller. Where I mean yes and no. I mean, yes and no. Because if you can argue in types. So if you ever have a type that contains this, I mean, the cost dimension is 2, then you can find some kind that concentrate on it. So it's actually the only reason that it is, I think, gets the quality like quadratically melody triple act. Okay, so I still have maybe seven minutes to talk about proof. Maybe seven minutes to talk about proof questions. I didn't understand Artem's question exactly, but you say there can be multiple such planes, though, right? Where if you have like five of them, then you take the cost dimension, then it would still be two. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you can have, but not cost dimension positively many such planes. Okay, um so right, okay, then to come to the technical part. Um, okay, um, so what we have, we have what we call configuration, ES configuration. So you have internal sets Xi with the cost dimension of Xi is one and cost dimension of And cost dimension of the terminology intersect on this internal pseudo-finite sets is two. I mean product of these sets is two. And instead of looking at collinear triples, I want to look at energy relation, which will be later seen as a binary relation, which is an algebraic relation, and it's defined this way. So it's about So it's about four tuples, x1, x2, x1, y1, y2. They are in this algebraic relation EX, if only if there exists some Z such that Z Y1 X1 is collinear and Z Y2X2 is collinear. And this will be called an energy tuple. And from our original EX configuration, so we get large energy, maybe. Large energy, namely so the cost dimension of EX like restricted on this like product of these pseudo-finite sets we had in the beginning, x1 squared times x2 squared, you get delta 3. And so now I consider this ex as a binary relation, so between these two. So, between these two pseudo-final sets. And if EX does not contain any complete bipartite graph with two vertices on one side and S vertices on the other, with some S such that delta S is 0, namely, I mean, a K to S, then we already get a contradiction by some already taught, by some Like commendatory bound tool that you can use in fields of Calcutta Zero. But we do have K2S's. So what we can do is, so we can, so the key observation here is we can delete all these K2S's, and we can, the separate total theorem still holds when we delete these K2S's, so these edges. K2S's, so these edges, and then we get so all these energy triples, like quadruples, will be concentrated on incidences of K to S. Because apart from them, they will concentrate energy strictly smaller than 3. So the part that energies has delta 3 all comes from K to S. So this is the first step and First step, and the second step is to understand where can they come from. So, here is an example of K2S. So, you have 2 means you have, so we have this relation x1, x2, and y1, y2, and 2 on one side is x1, x2, and t1, t2, and s on the other side is you have y1, y2, so these two, s tuples of these pairs of. These pairs of y such that you form each pair forms energy with both x1, x2, and t1 t2. This is an algebraic dimension. So this theorem says this is just a pure algebraic theorem. So under some generic assumption of these x1, x2, and t1, t2, what you get is a cubic curve. A cubic curve, like a cube planar cubic curve. So so if you have, yeah, so we so we really work very hard on it. So if you have such infinite many y1, y2s, then in the end, they will all lie on one cubic curve and it will be a planar cubic curve, and that's what the T1TG will also. And the T1 TG will also be on that. So everything is co-planner. And okay, I'm almost done. So there's step three that you need to eliminate the case that there are like cost dimension, positively many such planes, and we can only get one plane from this. And that's all. Thank you. Thank you. Does your proof in the theorem that you just don't mean does you somehow also construct like the equations that it's fairly curved, depending on S? Uh uh no, it can be any kind of No, it can be any kind of qubit. Yeah. I mean, but so the S there can be any. Yeah, but so we have this S is dead S is greater than zero, so it means that you can find unbounded many finite elements on that, right? So in particular, you have at least a dimension one or dimension two curve on that. I mean, dimension one. On it. I mean, dimension one, you have at least dimension one curve on it. Okay. So then we consider what kind of curves can be on this configuration, and we figured out it can be all in planocubic. Okay, okay. So this is really just algebraic relationship. I mean, algebraic statement, it doesn't. I see, it doesn't roll the structure. Okay, okay. Yeah, very fun. Why do you call this energy or um I don't know, it's um where we're so I think in groups they are called in additive combinatorics, but it's in groups they are called energy, yes. And what are they called connector? I don't know why. In group, in the words, some other. Some other guys call it. So it's like either increasing the energy or the system or something like that. The thing is, in groups you have like large energy and this happens when it really looks like the curve. How do I have to find the curve? The curve probably I can find the curve. Um yeah, it's very complicated. So the thing is, you if you look at x1, so you fix one point and then you look at the collinear, so the map that maps y1 to the third point by collinearity, so it will be a birational map, so it will be called a Geyser evolution, so it's a birational map, and then by our And then by our understanding, by the understanding of smooth cubic surfaces, you can. So if you have a curve on a smooth cubic surface and you have a point either on a curve or outside of a curve, then you can think of what this curve will be mapped to it will be mapped to another curve by this collinearity relation through x. Collinality relation through x. So, I mean, so if you have y, then through x is mapped by that. So this map, you can calculate it in terms of devices or these kind of things. And then you can calculate the degree of it and the multiplicity of the points of these kind of things. And then you just with some generosity assumption, then you just eliminate other possibilities and see it's it. I mean say it's a cubic first and then C they will be X1 X2 F T1 to 2 will be copena. It's really just an algorithm. Yes, yes, yes. Maybe algebra geometer already knows it, but we don't know. It wasn't a quick integration. No, no, no, no. Like very specific to smooth cubic surfaces, we need to look at divided To look at divider classes and how to either divide the classes. But in this case, we have to find a group to get a group and then claim this group to use. No, no, no, this is our like, you know, this is our motivation. We want to find a like, I mean. want to find a like I mean because yeah I mean could you say what is your motivation again so our motivation is to see so the there's a Alexabo theorem which says if you have these kind of configurations Alexabo configurations like in the beginning like this one this kind of configurations with algebraic ternary correspondence relations Ternary correspondence relations, these kind of things that also Scott talks about, then it must be caused of group. And we want to generalize it to higher dimensional case, so we are looking at, so this is like a very easy example we are looking at, so we have this relation is collineality and it's dimension two, so it's a surface point on the surface. And kind of prove it because there's no group, so we cannot achieve anything like this. How do you find a group? Well, there's no group here, so you cannot find a group, yeah. About energy. Don't you look for energy? Well, you can take the curves, actually, I suppose. Yeah, on the curves, yeah, on the groups, yeah. Yeah, but you don't get this feature on this. So maybe this was also like a different. So, maybe this was also like in the context of weak general position, right? So, because some of our stronger version of general position, and then we're wondering some like data cases, whether it be places where we general position, whether we see correctly, but this kind of related counting card or not like this group doesn't control like this relation on their home. Surface rate, just on some part of it. Yeah, but they want to do it on the break. It's kind of hard to do. So, maybe we'll take the questions outside. So, you find this one first. So you find uh this one curve, right? And by you like I have the local lines in the context. All very different curves.
