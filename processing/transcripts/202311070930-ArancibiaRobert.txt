Yes, before being able to talk about actual packets, I need to introduce some notation. Most of you probably already know it, so it's going to be fast. During all this talk, G is going to be a real redacted group. In fact, most of the time, it's going to just be a classical group, classical or inter-group. I'm going to develop by check G the dual group of G for the previous group is given as follows. And as usual, WR. As usual, W R is going to be the very group of R. So this is the union where the element J is desidose property. So J square is equal to minus one, and conjugation by J give you the conjugate. Okay, we will also need, of course, the L group, which is just this semi-direct product, and I will denote by capital C of J the set. Uh the set of L parameters. Okay. It's okay raising okay those the set of L parameters that mean of course the set of G conjuous classes of group homorphism refine the two following properties. The two following properties. So the diagram is commutative, and next, the projection of the image of W to the dual group is just semi-simple. Okay, that's for the basic notation. Here, in fact, I will give one more notation. In fact, I will be working with more than one real form at a time. So that's why, in fact, we are going to see G. In fact, we are going to see G has a complex group, and I'm going to denote the real form by sigma. So, in this way, the real points are going to be given by this formula. So, the real points of G are going to be the fixed point by sigma. And we're going to be studying then the set of irreducible representation. Okay, and since we are in JNNR, sorry, since we're in the real, we likely we have the local language. We likely have the local language correspondence for the reals, and which means that this set of representations is just a disjoint union of finite subsets, which are the L packets. Okay, so that I will denote by that pi of psi of sequence. Okay, so this is all the basic notation that I need to start talking about, about the outer curves, author local. Auto local conjectures. So that's why we start doing now. Yeah. So yes. So in fact, guided by his work on the trace formula, Arthur realized that in fact the notion of L parameter need to be modified if you want to describe the automorphic representation. That's why he introduced a new set of parameters. Parameter, it's not working. I think that right, and which this time, so that he call that we call the A parameter, and they are this time are group homorphism from the Bell group times SL2 to the to the lang to the Langland group, and they verify these two properties. So, the restriction to WR is bounded, and the restriction to SL2 is holomorphic. So, after introducing So, Arthur introduced this set of parameters, and then he conjectured a correspondence. To each Arctur parameter must correspond a finite set of irreducible unitary representation, and each of these sets must be representation on each one of these sets must be the local components of automorphic representation. In here, we are talking about the real, so these are the Archimedean components. About the real, so these are the Archimedean components of the automorphic representation. So, not only that, in fact, this correspondence needs to verify a list of properties. So, property A. So first, maybe I start by recalling that to each parameter we have attached an L parameter, which defines like this. And so, the first property is that the A packet must contain. The A packet must contain the corresponding L packet. And the second property, property A means say that, in fact, the A packet must be the support of a stable distribution, or you prefer a stable virtual character. I'm going to go back in a moment to this stable distribution. In fact, I'm going to, in property B that I'm going to say my give now. I'm gonna give a more explicit expression of it. So let's go to property B. So property property, for that we begin by considering the component group and what property B said. Said that, in fact, to each representation in the A packet, there must be There must be a non-zero finite dimensional representation of the component group, and the stable distribution of property A must satisfy this property here. Okay, so the dimension here are given, are rated to this finite dimension representation of the component group. And with this sign that I'm not going to give, but it's plus or minus one. Okay, there are two more properties. The third property The third property is that the stable distribution must verify the spectral identities, ordinary and twisted. In fact, I'm going to go back. I'm going to say a little more detail what we mean by twisted identity. The ordinary one probably will not talk about it. And finally, the last property that I already mentioned is that this representation must be all of them unitary. Okay, that's for the introduction of the R through conjectures. of the R through conjectures. So now let's go really to the to what happened in the particularity of the real. So in the real case, there are in fact two approaches toward the solution of our to local conjecture. In fact, the first one, which we can say is the more traditional one, at least from the point of view of the trace formula, is the one that came from our bike analysis. There's a second one. At least a second one, which is the one who was used by Adam Barbach and Bogan, which is the one from Tif Theory. Okay, and let me mention, and I hope I will have time to say something at the end that in fact showing the equivalence of both approaches, in fact, give the opportunity of give enough tools to try to answer some questions. To answer some questions, which up to now have been mostly studied from the Amoricanized perspective with a shift-theoretic perspective. Okay, so let us mention that, for example, of course, the first approach, the one from harmonic analysis, was used by Arthur in his book where he treated the quasi-split classical group. Then Mock extended to the case of unitary quasi split. Of course, both of them, they did. Of course, both of them they do not only for real, but also for periodic and global. And finally, Meglin and Renard, they extended the case of the proof of the local anthropology to the case of purial form of classical and uteric. Okay, that's for the first approach. Then the second approach, so the one that we're going to talk a little bit more today, that use connection between representation and equivalent chips. And equivariant chips. So it's the one that was taken by Adam Barbers and Bogan in their 92 book. Okay, and it's important to mention that in fact they don't, their method works for any real group, not only classical group, or unitary group, and is based on quite sophisticated tools from geometry. I'm going to go back to them at the yeah, I'm going to talk again about this notion. I'm going to talk again about this notion, especially the notion of keratic cycles almost at the end. Okay, so we have these two approaches, and what the next of the talk is going to be divided into. I'm going to start first by giving a fast overview of both approaches, and then at the end, I'm going to explain how both approaches in fact are equal. Okay, I'm going to give a answer. Okay, I'm going to give an overview of the proof given in collaboration with Jeffrey Adams and Paul Mezzo of the proof of the quality in the case of pure real form of classical and unitary group. Okay, so let's start then by giving the description of the two approaches. So yeah, I'm going to start with the quasi-pit case. So I'm going to denote the real form, the quasi-real form by sigma q, and we fix an a parameter. We fix an A parameter. So, and each approach gives us an A packet and a map to the component group. So, to differentiate both, the R through approach will be noted by A R and the ABB by ABB. Okay, so there we have the stable distribution of ABB and of Arctur, and proving that they are equal, in fact, is. Proving that they are equal, in fact, is just so proving that the packets are equal, reduced to prove that the distribution are equal. And then I'm going to say much, but in fact, once you prove that the packets are equal, proving that the map to the component group is the same is not follow with more or less not much difficulty. Okay, so let's start then by describing, I'm going to be a little fast here, the Arthur or mock way of doing this. Or mock way of doing this. So the mock approach. So let's see how he defined his packet. So the approach can be divided in three steps. So a first step who is expressed this group G has a twisted endoscopic group of a nice group H for which the definition of the The definition of the packet is easy or already known. And which is this group H? Well, for classical group or unitary group, it's given by like this. So just GLN in the case of classical group or the restriction of a scalar in the case of unitary. So that's the real points. So GLN R or G L N C and how the group H is related to the group G. So that's So that's there exists an outer automorphism who is given like that. So for JLN, it's given the first one, and for a restriction of scalar, the second one. And so the idea is that there exists this element S theta who live in the non-identity component of this semi-direct product, such that you have this equality between the dual group. Okay, so this. Okay, so this last equality, what it permits, it permits then to we have, we can see then the dual group of G inside of the dual group of H right inside inside okay, it's not there. I think it's blocked by the blackboard. I can wait. We have this inclusion that can be extended then into an inclusion of L groups. Okay, so that way we can see G to be a twisted endoscopic group of H. And so the second step, which is just follow directly from what I said, is that with the A parameter. That with the a parameter of g, we can define an a parameter of h. And then here we are in the real point of h is just gl and r or gl and c, so I mean that everything is stable. So we're going to define so the a packet for h is just the l packet, which in this case is just a synthetic. Just a single. And it's important because I'm going to say it just now, I'm going to say it immediately. In fact, I'm going to use it immediately. Is that since the representation, since the A parameter came from an A parameter of G, we have that, in fact, this representation is stable by table, so it's fixed. So we will be able to extend it to the. So that's what I'm going to do now. So that's step two. Now, so that's that's step two. And finally, step three. Step three. Step three. Step three. Okay, so yeah, we are going to be defining. So I'm going to explain what it means. What it means defining the A parameter, the A packet of G to be the pre image under endoscopic transfer. So for that, I need to. Endoscopic transfer. So, for that, I need a little notation first. So, each time that we have a representation which is fixed by theta, we can like we cannot say much, but thank you to the White normalization, we can extend it into a representation of this extended group or semi-direct product of H with theta. And I will denote it by pi tilde. So we can extend it and We can extend it, and once we can extend it, we have the twisted trace, like that. So, the twist character, and I'm going to denote by that symbol there at the end to be the set linear space of all of these twist characters. So, that's for one group that I need. And I also want to need the case of character of G, which in this time is this grotto group of finite length and misery representation. And missive representation. And how are we going to relate the character of G with the twist character? Well, that's synced to the transfer map that I'm going to talk about now. Okay, so just I'm going to, maybe it will be important to not forget that this the pi tilde is so this extension through the White normalization. If I have time, I will give another type of normalization that I will denote with a plus. Will denote with a plus. Okay, so we have character and twist character. And so the step three is that thank you to the work of Meso and Chess that so the twist character are related to the character, thank you to this transfer map, right? That goes from the stable distribution of J to the stable distribution of H. And this is the this is the This is the this is the uh this transfer opens up a path toward the definition of a packet, in fact. Uh let's just recall the property C. The property C say this. So this should this the stable distribution should verify the spectral identities. So in fact, what Artur does, he defined the stable distribution attached to the A parameter to be the To be the solution of this twisted spectral identity. Okay, after doing this, he proved all of the different properties, but this is the starting point to defining the solution of this identity. And of course, then, so that's for the distribution. And of course, the packet is then just the irreducible representation appearing in the support. So okay, so that's how so yeah it well so this maybe I should differentiate the case of the even orthogonal group, but I'm not going to do it. But right, this is let's say that this is the unique solution of this of this identity. Okay, that's that's for the Arthur approach. Now, so we know more or less now how to define this stable distribution and this. This stable distribution and this A packet. So now let's go to the other side, go to the geometric side and right, the Adam, Barbach, and Bogan approach. And what they do, in fact, they use completely different tools, but let's say more or less the idea is the same is that they introduce a chief-theoretic version of the spectra identities, and then they prove that their definition of A. That their definition of a packet verifies these identities, and then we need to prove that both identities, in fact, say the same. Okay, but how they do this? How they define this chief version? So first, they start by defining a pairing. Yeah, well, yeah, they define a pairing between admissible representation of G and G equivariant chips of a topological. Chips of a topological space that I'm going to say a little more now what is this topological space. And well, they do all the work in the geometric side. And so, and then sign to the pairing, they transfer sync back. So, they work mostly with cheaps, and then the pairing permit them to go back to the representation world. Okay, so let's try to describe a little better. Try to describe a little better what point one and two mean. And for that, I will start by talking about this variety. Right, so the novelty in A-B work is this introduction of this variety. I don't have the time to introduce or to say into what we define, but let's say that more or less you can see it like a disjoint union of generalized flag varieties, which is going to. Which is going to reparametrize the set of L parameters. What this means. So, this means that it's equipped with an action from the dual group, and you have a bijection between orbits and parameter. And the important part of this new variety is that, in fact, it has a much more richer topological structure. For example, the orbits are not necessarily close in the Are not necessarily close in this new variety. And that's what we're going to do is that to each orbit, you are going to be able to attach one or more than one local system of complex vector space. Yeah, and for notation, I'm going to denote, I'm going to call what is a complete geometric parameter to be this couple, and because This couple, and because it's going to appear later, the set of this couple is going to be denoted by in that way. Okay, so let's so we have the variety, we have now this set of complete geometric parameter, and let's start by talking how the pairing is defined. So, so for the pairing, so let's, I just said we have this bijection. I just said we have this bijection. So that means that the local lang lens can be described also like this. In some way, it's a bijection between orbits and L packets. But in fact, ABB do even more. They refined this correspondence into a bijection between complete geometric parameter and representation. But if you want to obtain the bijection, you need to. The bijection, you need to, in fact, take all of the inner real form in the inner class of the cossplit. I'm not going to be more precise on that, but if not, you will not obtain the bijection, you will only obtain an inclusion from representation. In fact, if not, if you take only the speed one, you will need to take one subset of this complete geometric parameter. Complete geometric parameters. Okay. And yeah, let me just say that, right, I also going to need this. So I'm going to denote by M C to be the the standard whose Langdon's quotient is pi, so I can also see the correspondence to be a bijection like this. A bijection like this, right? So to each parameter, I can attach the irreducible or the standard, which say this. Okay, but both of these things are related to the real points of G. In fact, what they do is that they attach two more objects, but these two objects now are they they are related to the to this complex to this abb variety so for that let me just um right first a little notation i'm gonna decontribute the dimension of the orbit and i have this suite of inclusion and the third object that they relate to this parameter is a contributable shift so how this is defined this this one is not so difficult This one is not so difficult to define. So we start with the local system, we apply extension by zero to obtain a contributor shift on the closure, and then simply direct image to extend it to the AB variety. And the last object that you attach to your parameter is what is a paper chief. So we start in the same way. So, we start in the same way. So, we start with our complete geometric parameter, but this time we're going to see the local system. We see it like a complex concentrated in degree minus D. So now this thing is a purva chief on the orbit. We apply intermediate extension to obtain a purva chief on the closure and then direct image. and then your image and that give you and that give you um the the the the pervert chief on the variety and maybe for those who that say something this is the intersection commoly this is the intersection commoly chief attached to the local system okay so we have now four objects attached to each complete geometric parameter so four objects um four objects four objects Four objects. Four objects. Okay, even. So, thank you to this. Thank you to this correspondence, this bijection with these four objects. So, let me just say that means that the Grötlering group of representation is also parametrized by this complete geometric parameter. And of course, this thing has two bases: the basis of irreducible and the basis. The basis of iruscible and the basis of standard. Yes, yes, because of notation here. I'm seeing at the same time more than one real form. So this is the virtual character here going to be a sum of representation of more than one real form at a time. So that's one side. On the other side, the grading group of chips, which also has two bases. Which also has two bases. So the basis of perverse or of contractible. And so both Grudling groups are parametrized by the same set. And okay, so this gives us how, if I say explicitly, how the pairing is going to be defined. So I'm going to be defined like this. At least in the basis of the standard and contributive. standard and and control people so we have we have to be this equality here here delta is the croener and and and the e of c is the cut with sign but it's just plus or minus one okay and a deep result on abb is what happens if you express the pairing in the outer base so in the base of perverse and and irreducible and in fact we have also this nice Have also this nice expression. Okay, so in both bases, this is the way that the pairing is going to be defined in both bases. Okay, all of this is for G. So I mean in the untwisted, what happened in the twisted case? So in the twisted case, we are also going to define a pairing. So let's explain how we're going to do that. Do that. So let's just go back fast to the notation as before. So recall that H is GLN or the restriction of a class and G is the classical or unitary group. And also recall that we have this set of twist characters. I only looking at here the quest split. So in this case, for H, I'm only going to see, I don't care of other real. I don't care about other real forms. And of course, we have both bases of standard or of irreducible. And what we're going to do, we're going to define a new pairing, this time between this twist character and something that is called twisted chips. In fact, I don't want to define in detail what I mean by twisted chips. Let's just fast. Fast said that in fact, right, this automorphism, since it acts over the variety, it will act over the parameters. And so we can consider the fixed parameter, the fixed complete geometric parameter. And doing the same thing that we did for representation, in fact, we have also an action. Over contractible and perverse shift. And in this way, you can also, for each fixed parameter, you can also extend the contractible and the perverse into a twist achieve. And we can do it in two in equivalent ways. Okay, and we're going to choose one that I'm going to denote by a plus, but I don't really go into the But I'm not really going to define how this is defined. If you're in somebody's interest, I can explain at the end how we do this selection of one of the two. But so the important part is that we can extend it and we have a preferred choice of this extension that I'm denoted with this plus symbol. Okay, and so, and what's the set that I'm gonna pair? What's the set that I'm gonna pair with the twisted character? Is then this one. Okay, so this one of twisted shifts. And always can be expressed using contractible or using perverse. Okay, so now we have the objects that are going to be pairing with, and the pairing then is then defined like this. In the same way that before, but this time with contractible and sorry, contractible, extended contractible with the plus and not forget that the what the tilde is a Whiteker. That's the Whitecker normalization. So that is expressed in one base. And of course, we have the important results also took some. Result also took some time, and it's the difficult one of the difficult parts on the proof is that you can also express it in the other basis, and you have this way a nice formula for it. So they are here there. Okay, here we are in GLN, so that's why the Kronecker or the code width sign is one, so that's why it doesn't appear here. Okay, and so and the pairing is the key. In fact, thank you. In fact, thank you to this pairing. We can, that's the bridge between character and chips. In fact, that permit to so you're going to permit that to each character or twist character can be regarded as a set value linear function, functional on a geometric parameter on twisted geometric parameter. And this is going to be what's going to permit us to define. What's going to permit us to define this chief theoretic version of the transfer map? So, this is for the harmonic analysis one that I do not transfer. The one who is defined through the pairing, so through geometric methods, I'm going to denote it by lift. So, the question is, I'm going to say a little more now how this lift is defined. So, in fact, the definition goes quite. The definition goes quite easily. So we have this inclusion of L groups. This inclusion of L groups can induce an inclusion of varieties. And now we have the variety. So we can take the inverse image functor that goes this time from so from. from a so from the set of twisted character twisted chips to the set of twisted uh character twisted um sorry go from twisted chips to um to chips and thanks to the pairing so we're going to define a this a map that go from character to twist character defined by that equation and then how the lift is defined so the lift is just a rest is defined, so the lift is just a restriction. So the lift, we're gonna restrict this, the map E star through the to the stable character on the quasi-speed. Okay, and the important theorem is that in fact both of them, the lift and the transfer are the same. Okay, that is I'm not going to explain the proof, but it just reduces to proving what happened with the stable standard and showing that both stable standard are sent to the same scene permit to show the proof, the equality of both. Okay, so let's go back now. So I have just introduced the pairing. The pairing is the key to is the bridge between both worlds. And now Both worlds, and now what's missing is how the packets are defined by ABB. So, let's go back a little to the micro-local geometry. And let's recall also that we fix our A parameter and we have to it we can attach the A parameter, the A parameter and the orbit. Okay, that the last one is the orbit of the variety. And okay. And okay, and the key object that permit to define the ABB packet are this micro-local multiplicity. Okay, I don't have time to say in detail how these micro-local multiplicity are defined, but let's just say that they appear in the theory of Kerk cycles. Cycles, and maybe let's just say that, in fact, they are related in some way to a local system on a cornerbund. In fact, these multi-pieces can also be defined through Morse theory. And if that says much to people here, is that so? Morse theory permits to attach to each perverse a local system when a coroneral bundle, and in fact, this micro-local multiplicity. This micro local multiplicity, they are the dimension of the stocks at some regular point V. Okay, that's not really important. Just the thing is important is that we have this linear functional on the set of sheaves that is this micro-local multiplicity. And this is the key ingredient to define the packets. In fact, let's recall that we have. In fact, let's recall that we have this identification between characters and homomorphism of the chiefs. And so, how they define this stable distribution, the stable distribution is defined in ABB as the pre-image, is to be the pre-image of this micro-local multiplicity. Okay, that's how it's defined. Okay, and okay, let's just notice that in this case, case if you just pick the pre-image you're going to take more than one real form so if you want to take the for a particular real form sigma any real form not necessarily quasi split any you just need to take the restriction uh that's I wrote delta but it's sigma so the delta that appear there is sigma the gr delta is gr sigma okay so that that give us So that gives us the stable distribution. So I mean that the ABV packets are the irrusible representation in the support. If you prefer a more explicit definition, they are the representation whose pervert shift when you want to compute the micro local multiplicity is different of zero. Okay, so that's the definition of the AB packet. And let's just mention that using more micro-local geometry, they're able to prove that this table, the map to the component group is defined more or less through Morse theory. I can say a little more of this probably at the end. I will say a little more of this property. Property B. Also, they show that he verified the spectral identities, and they just mentioned that, in fact, property D, in 92, the others leave it unsolved. But recently, in fact, that is important because it's the talk I think Lucas is going to give. In fact, recently, Adams, Mason Brown, and Bogan show, in fact, that any representation inside of this. That any representation inside of this packet, you can obtain it through parabolic or cobalic induction from a unipotent, A-B packet. And it's important, the last phrase, that the range between where you're doing parabolic or comolical induction preserves unitarity. And important is what happened with the unipotent AB packet that is. AB packet that is known now, thank you to the in the classical group, thanks to the work of Barbash, Ma, Su and Shu. And for example, for exceptional group is computed by the Atlas predict, that's a work of Adams, Miller, Valuvan, and Bogan. Okay, so in a way, now property D is more or less proved now. Okay, so now we have say both so both packets, the one from Arthur and the one from ABB are defined. What we do to reconcile both definitions? Well, in a way, both packets are defined through a transfer identity, but the diff the Transfer identity. But the thing is that one is from analysis and the other one from chief theory. So in a way, we need to adapt the framework of ABB to R2 definition. So what is Arthur definition? So recall that the A packet from Arthur is defined to be the solution to this equation. Equation. So the equality between both distributions, what we need to do is to show, in fact, that the ABB distribution defines the same equation. But we already did a big part of the proof because we already know that the transfer for marmoric analysis is the same one that the lift. So that means that we just need to prove this. Just need to prove this. And right, and this, well, is the last one of the big part, the proof that follow from the result of this person there. And so we have the following result that if you pick an A parameter of G, so you define. Of G. So you define the parameter of H. And the first thing that you can say is that in the same way that the Arthur packet is a singleton, the AB packet of H is also a singleton. In fact, so is just the L packet that means that they are equal to the R packet. And second, we have that equality there. So let me say a little more about this first equality. So in fact, the first equality So in fact the first equality so here the eta IBB is the distribution that corresponds to the H1 but since the AB packet is a singleton, in fact this eta ABB is just the representation pi of psi, so the only one in the L packet, that all the difficulty of the first for so first to prove that first equality, the lift going to the eta VB eta bb that's follow more or less from from from abb that it reduced to a left jet fixed um left uh left jet fixed point left jet fixed point theorem but the difficulty is the problem with the normalization so and is in some way that's why i denote a plus there we introduce some way uh another normalization Some way another normalization that is called Atlas normalization. Well, in fact, that came from a work of Adams and Bogan, which is a little more easy to work with when we are doing the geometric stuff. So it's easier to work with this normalization. And the difficult part is to show also that how this normalization relates with the Whitegrey one. And we have in some way through this. Way through the this we were able to find this easy relation with both is related with that symbol that appeared there. Okay, so if we do like a in summary, so we have that the if I apply the lift of ABB, I obtain I obtain so equality with it with the with the twisted trace of the Whitegirl, but this by definition. But this, by definition, is equal to the transfer of the arter, which is equal to the lift of the arter. And so, and at least in the case that G is not isomorphic to SO with n even, we have that the lift is injective. And since the lift is injective, we have the equality. And okay, in the case, I will not say much, but in the case of the n-even so. So the lift is not anymore injective, but the ABB pack, I made a mistake. Yeah, I yeah, well, lady package, no, it's not the sum. In fact, the yes, I made a mistake. Right. Yeah, in the in the I mean I should I also should in the in the i it should i also should put the in the in the the problem with the after one for the end even the arter packets define uh model the the orbit so they are looking at orbit so um yes i should have put the the both abb anyway the for the and even uh the primary you are looking at orbits and and um and you have you have a you you can yeah uh how you explain it um Yeah, I'll explain it. Right, okay, you can see that like the in the case of AB, yes, in the case of AB, you can define there are two packets that correspond to each of, you can differentiate in the case of N, the even orthogonal, you can define, you have a actual definition of the A-B packet of the orthogonal, but you don't have that in the case of Arthur. In the case of Arthur, but in the case of Arg, you're only seeing that orbit. So instead, the ABD definition is finer than the Arthur one. That's not really a little. That's for quest split. Do I have the time? 50 minutes? So maybe that's for the case of quest split. Maybe a little fast. What happened with the pure real form? Well, In the case of pull real form, so now we are going to pick an element of the component group, a simple, so that permit us to define a endoscopic group. This time it's just an ordinary endoscopy group. And then now what it follows is more or less the same. So we have a map. We have a map between L groups, between the endoscopic. And we can also define a lift. So this lift here, so remember that once you have the inclusion of L group, you have this time an inclusion of varieties, and that's the only thing that you need to define the chief theoretic transfer. And important is that this chief theoretic transfer. This chief theoretic transfer is also equal to the R Mechanized transfer, and then more or less the same thing that I did before, the proof then work more or less equally. So, if the stable distribution of that corresponds to this pure real form, in fact, is In fact, it's equal to the so here you're going from the transfer from the cost split. So you're going from the cost split to your, I made a mistake. So yeah, I can't. Yeah, this is sigma. This is sigma. I can't. Okay, you're right from the quest fleet to to to the um to the To the purial form. Okay, and what's important is that what is the G prime? I say there, G prime is just a product of classical or unitary group. So I mean that for classical, it's a for quad split classical or quasi split unitary, we have that we have we have just done, we have the equality between Arthur and ABB and then other mystery. And then other mistake. No, okay. Sorry, no, that's not a mistake. That's the transfer equal to lift, first step. And the last step is that G prime is a quasi split. So I mean, we have equity between AR and ABB. Okay. And ABB1, we know that that was proved by ABB, that was proven in their book. Proving in their book, verify this last equality. So we obtain more or less the same as before, and then that implies, so we have the equality between the stable distribution, that implies the equality between the packets. And when you start, have the equality between packets, you have show that the map to the component group is also equal, or also equal. Okay. I don't know if there are any questions. So I have to meet or okay, so maybe what to do now? So we have so okay, in conclusion, what do we have? So we have an equality between Arthur packets and AB packets in the case of In the case of real classical and unitary group. And maybe what are things to do from here. So what I mean by that, probably will not be so precise, but this equality was only proved in the case of GLS. The case of GLN, twisted GLN. So maybe it will be interesting to also expand the quality to a more general endoscopic group, not only for GLN. And that maybe that will put ABB more or less in the language of Arthur. In fact, that will maybe permit to show that AB packet also verifies that these two sendoscopies that appear in the in the work of Arthur. Here in the work of Arthur, or in fact, or express them in like in a more analysis language. Also, maybe another thing to say is a more computational approach. Maybe in fact, in here, I would like to talk about the ACDA software that has been developed by A group of people like David, who is there, and Jeffrey, and well, a group of people. And in fact, well, this more or less already exists in Atlas a way of computing a packets. But so it will be, so what I mean, so right, implement a tool that computes Implement a tool that computes a packet. So you give to Atlas the parameter and that gives you the A packet. And with Jeffrey and Metzo, well, it's mostly Jeffrey's work, that we have in the classical setting, so for classical groups, we have more or less able to implement this function in Atlas that you give an A parameter and I give you the A package. An A parameter, and I give you the A packet, and it works in work more as well for the regular Ethiopian simple character, but it still needs some progress to be made in the case of singular case. Okay, it's important to mention that, in fact, Atlas already more or less have a tool that computes unipotent a packets, but in fact, they are what they call weak unipotent packets. Unipotent packets. You have a unipotent orbit, and to it you can attach more than one a packet, and that can compute it quite well. But it's seen that it has some problem to compute a unipotent a packet using that method directly. It's too slow. So that's why maybe this other method is quite useful, in fact. I asked to Jeffrey about Yeah, I asked to Jeffrey about what happened with like normally using the method of the associate variety, it can compute honest a packet, but it's too slow. That's why maybe it will be useful to have this more explicit or more faster way of computing a packets. But not only that, in fact, But not only that, in fact, the Atlas can help even more. Other questions that Atlas could help to solve are, for example, yeah, there. So the inverse, in such a way the going backward, if I have a erusal representation, so implement an algorithm that determine whether this representation belongs or not to an A packet, and not only that, determine all. And not only that, determine all of the A packet that contain this given representation. I think this is, well, this is real group. I think in the case of Paidic, Atobe has a similar algorithm. So, but, and also maybe related with ATES can also help to when a package has non-trivial intersection, or when does any package contain a temperature. So these are questions that Atlas probably can help to solve. So and then we can say a little more. So now I'm going to go back to geometry. So what happened with the structure of real A packets? So more or less talking about this map. So we would like to describe a little in more detail the property of this map. For example, we know that this map is not injective. We know that this map is not injective and it's not surjective, but maybe describe a little more the condition that we have or not have this property. And important is prove this multiplicity one property that showing that in fact the dimension of this are really characters. This representation of the component group are really characters of dimension one. Right, so, and let me, I don't have time to say more, but let me say maybe two strategies that could lead to the proof of this dimension one, or at least describe a little better the properties of this map. So, maybe the first one, and let's just say that the in fact Moegland and Renard, they already prove. They already prove the multiplicity one in many cases. So, for the regular infinitesimal character case, so it's known. So, that means how you go from singular infinitesimal to regular one. And the problem is that the way that they did it in Moi Gla Renard's paper to describe the packets is that they cross the wall. So, it's a translation, they do translation, but wall crossing translation. Translation, but wall crossing translation. And that complicated thing a lot. And so, but there are this query and continuation representation method that could help, in fact, to using the translation principle that help more or less to explain what happened when you cross the wall. Okay, I'm not going to say much more than that. In fact, I don't have time. Okay, maybe. Okay, maybe also let's go back to the right to the so like I said this the this map that go to the component group is defined in ABB well they explain one way of defining is through Morse theory but for example this is another way that is the way that was that is applied in the work of for Piadic in the work of Work of Clifton and Bean that you hear that they use the binding cycles approach. And in fact, you should be able to define, you can define the same map through the through binding cycles. And at least in some example, and that what follow from what Clifton and Bin and others did, is that these benches. Did is that these matching cycles, at least in some cases, is more easy to work with. Um, okay, so that's for, and maybe one last thing to say. What happened with other groups? And of course, the PADI group is a work already started by all these people, and there are going to be other expositions about that. But also, what happened with Adelic? Like, if you if we are able Like if you if we are able to to um to you are able right if if if you have a more or less uniform way of describing AB packets in every local field, why not try to do it combine them to the local object to to obtain global ones and to obtain like some global AB packet and maybe why not trying to Why not trying to work with non-linear real groups? I'm going to ask you.
