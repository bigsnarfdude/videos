So, glad to see everyone bright and shiny this morning. Avi Potarni is going to talk to us this morning about non-Arc median integral geometry. So, please take it away. All right. Thank you, Brendan, for the introduction. And I've got to say, like this sort of, I'm not quite used to this sort of round table all with the raid, but from this angle, it's actually really kind of nice. It's sort of like a swanky jazz club. So, I hope I can perform and make some improvisations as I play. So, what I want to talk about today is maybe a subject that is not so common in number theory. Well, this part certainly is common, right? Well, non-Arbonianness is part of our bread and butter. It's like there's this cottage industry in number theory about taking things that work over the real world and then saying, why not QP? And the answer is usually, well, why not? And the answer is usually: well, why not GP? And it just works anyway. This is going to be one of those stories today. And so I'll spend the first part of this talk introducing this other thing, this integral geometry, part of the story. So what I'm going to sort of, the first part of my talk is sort of lifted from this paper of Edelman and Cosplay, and it kind of has the bonus for entertainment value of amusing facts about planetary. About planetary. So I'm going to start with this: the unit sphere, right? S2. Maybe I'll even put S2R to just be a little, you know, belabor the point that we're really starting in the real world. Okay. And so when I have a sphere. Okay, great. Lovely. I think, you know, we're all about spheres. Now, one of my favorite things. Well, one of my favorite things about, you know, you start with something two-dimensional, you want to maybe understand some curves inside that sphere. So we'll sort of start thinking about little rectifiable things, right? You can draw little paths on the surface of the earth and so on. So we'll assume that these things are nice and rectifiable so that they have things like milk. And well, the first question you might ask about, you know, someone gives you a curve and tells you the length of it. Oh, what's the length? Oh, what's the length? Right, of course, we could compute this in a lot of different ways. Like we approximate it by linear segments of red circles and calculate the length that way. But there's an amusing and very interesting connection with sort of how does one determine this length by a sort of statistical frame. So what you could do is, well, every point on the union circle, you could kind of imagine shining a light directly. Of line directly, sort of sort of directly parallel to, or directly along the line between this point and the exact center of the Earth. And so you get a bunch of rays that kind of go in that direction. And you get an associated bright circle on this sphere that's orthogonal to the line between this point and the exact center. So, okay. So, okay. So we'll get a nice little great circle. And if you move this point along this curve, this great circle will start to sweep out various areas, various looms, as you travel along. Okay. And as you might imagine, the area of the loom that you get, or the area swept out by these sort of terminating planes, is related to the length of the original curve that you started with. So, more precisely, the volume of the shaded area. Divided by the total surface area of the sphere is equal to one-half times the total length of the curve, which I'll just write as Of the curve, which I'll just write as sort of absolute value, divided by the length of the equation. Right, now this factor of one half is over here because, I mean, that turns out to be the right normalization factor to remember it's the right one. If you go halfway around the circle, your sort of equators will sort of start here and then flip exactly 100 nations around. Exactly 100 nations around. So you'll sweep out the total area of the surface of the sphere. So, funnily enough, this has a really nice kind of astrological piece. Maybe it's a definition. So, of course, we're fortunate enough not to be far enough north to see the northern lights and things like that. Of course, if you go even further north, there are areas. Further north, there are areas of the Earth that are either in perpetual light or perpetual dark, depending on the time of year. So, of course, we have a 24-degree tilt, and we have up here the Arctic Circle and the Antarctic Circle, right? And depending on the time of year, you know, you might be exactly on the summer solstice where this area is sort of in perpetual light. So, everything north of the Arctic Circle is going to be. So, everything north of the Arctic Circle is going to be fully lit for an entire 24 hours. Yes. Different points on your curve, do they give different rates or not? Because otherwise, you repeat yourself a lot. Oh, yeah. So, the way that you count this area is that if you happen to sort of see the same point twice, you count it with the same like with added multiplicity. So, yeah, for example, if I went all the way around to sort of For example, if I went all the way around the circle, then I would sweep out the whole surface of the earth twice, and I'd count each point with multiplicity too. All right, thanks for the question. Right. So essentially, if you sort of think about, well, what happens, like, what do my equators look like when I travel along the Arctic Circle? What does that say? And you get this sort of And you get this sort of directly from this put from this formula. You get that the area between the Arctic circles is Antarctic circles divided by the area of Earth. Is equal to the length of the tropic of cancer divided by the weight of the equation. Okay, just a sort of reminder: when is the topic? Remind her, when is the tropic of Cancer? It's well, it's one of these lines over here, and it happens to be the sort of latitude where at the summer solstice you're okay, maybe I threw the picture slightly, slightly off. But it's the line of latitude such that at the summer solstice, when your sun is shining, the ray between this point and the exact center of the earth is parallel to the ray. Parallel to the rays coming in from the sun. So as you sort of let this point travel around the tropical cancer, you'll sweep out twice the area of, or you'll sweep out the area between the Antarctic and Arctic surface. That's kind of cool. Integral geometry is really kind of about this connection, where we care about lengths, but we interpret them as probabilities. As probabilities. So if I were to drop some point on the planet Earth and I say, okay, give me the terminating ray sort of orthogonal to that point and count the number of times that ray passes through my curve. That probability, right, what's the expected number of points I expect to see in that intersection is directly proportional to the length of my original. So, okay, now I train them in algebraic geometry. So, why am I talking about spheres? Well, the first thing to realize is that if you take S2, you quotient by the antipodal involution, you get the real projective plane. And that's the domain where I really have this. So, let's talk about things a little bit more. Preciseness and generality. So let's start with the real. Before I was talking about the real world, like the one we're standing on. Now we're sort of moving into the actual world. All right. All right. So, in order to really do integral geometry, like this is really a subject about understanding an object by averaging some statistical metric properties under the action of some sort of homogeneous need. And it has all kinds of applications like representation theory, algebraic geometry, and probability. So, in order to really start doing this kind of averaging, we need to talk about metrics on our spaces. So, what's the metric that we're going to put on the projective plane? That we're going to put on the projective plane is going to be one coming from the unit sphere. So, what we'll do is we'll consider the map from sort of the n-dimensional sphere to n-dimensional projective space. Right, this map we just commonly refer to as the Hopf vibration. It's really modeled by Mondus. All right, so now we're going to define the metric on our projective space. And what we do is we say that the distance between two points, x and y, is equal to the absolute value of the sine of the angle between those points. Okay. Right. Now, of course, if you want to get rid of sines and cosines and want to express something a little bit more intrinsically, you could say, well, okay, in S2, the specific case, you could think about this as being the norm of the cross product of the two associated vectors, x and y. And they both live on the unit sphere. I don't need to divide out by. Here, I don't need to divide out by their total height. In general, what you do is: okay, instead of trust product, what we're going to do is take the norm of the wedge products of x and y. All right. So, okay, this will define not quite a metric on Sn, but it's certainly a nice function. And it'll push forward under the quotient map to a metric on projective space. I have a projected space. Again, not a metric because if I take two points of opposite poles, this map will basically tell me that the edge of the point is zero point, therefore that's two points. Is zero and therefore the pseudo-distance is zero. But two points at the opposite end, you know, two points that are sort of um antipodal from each other back to the same point in projective space. So I really do get a metric. All right. So that's the first ingredient we need. We'll always need some sort of distance metric to talk about. Now, in these types of formulas, on one hand, I needed points, on the other hand, Needed lights. On the other hand, I needed volumes of areas that were swept out. So, if y is a co-dimension M minus k sub manifold of a Romanian manifold for example a curve on the inisphere. So Now, what I want to do is, I don't want to just think about areas of the sphere. I want to think about lengths. So, normally, when you sort of define a volume form of the open sphere, anything that's sort of a positive area is going to have a positive volume. If I take things of strictly smaller co-dimensions, the measure of that object is going to be zero. So, that's not quite useful for our purposes. We want lengths. So, we're going to define some sort of correct. We're going to have to find some sort of correct dimensional volume for all of the objects involved in our story. So, okay, so we have our Riemannian manifold M, right, with a volume density ball right and we're going to define something called the tube neighborhood. Define something called the two neighborhood of an object. So a reconstruction sub-manifold of the Riemannian manifold. And all that is, if you just take a union over all the points in Y, all of the radius epsilon centered at points in Y. So of course, this cube neighborhood contains Y. Wonderful. And so we call this the epsilon neighborhood. And then we define the correct dimensional volume by saying, so in fact, the k-dimensional volume, to be the limit, as epsilon goes to zero, of the volume of this tube neighborhood divided by the volume of the cross-section of the tube. So, in this case, we're working with real Riemannian manifolds. So, our cross-section is going to be some ball of dimension m minus k of radius epsilon. Okay. And if you pick the correct dimensional volume, right, so it's a codimension m minus k submanifold. So, um, right, so. Right, so inside some sort of remodeling manifold of dimension m, then what you want is sort of when y is dimension k, you want to take the k dimensional volume thing. And so when you when you pick k to be exactly equal to the dimension, this limit exists in a spider. Well, okay, depends on the submanifold you pick. You could take a rectifiable curve of infinite length. But when we're working with something like y being some algebraic variety, then this. By being some algebraic variety, then this limit will exist and be finite. All right. So we now have two of the ingredients we need to formulate integral geometry formulas. We have metrics, and we have not just volumes, right, coming from volume densities, but correct-dimensional volumes. So we could talk about lengths of curves. So, so for an A-dimensional algebraic set A. Let's take a look at the algebraic set for this idea. Real algebraics that focus ID. Back away. Okay, and B of B-dimensional algebraic end. Of course, I mean real algebraic set. Of complementary cohimitage. Okay, I'm just going to pause for a second and point out what I mean by complementary co-dimension is: you know, if I take something of dimension A, I'm going to take some objects where I generically expect the intersection to be nothing. To be non-empty. So if I take a line inside free space, the linear space of complementary co-dimension is a plane, right? I will generally always expect, you know, for a sufficiently randomly chosen plane, that plane to intersect the line. Certainly, this is true of projected varieties. They necessarily intersect. And in fact, intersect in a finite number of ways. So a complimentary cogimension just means that if I sort of randomly toss the other variety inside. Randomly toss the other variety inside of my projective space, then it'll meet A in finitely many points. Okay. Int. All right. Then, well, as I was saying, we cared about lengths of curves, and we want to interpret these as probabilities. So, or at least the Or at least as some sort of statistical phenomenon. And this is the exact formula that lets us do this. So one half of the integral over the orthogonal group of the volume, by which I mean the correct dimensional volume, of A intersect GB divided by K dimensional volume. K-dimensional volume of projective space of dimension k right now with respect to the hard measure on this topological group, this topological group that's compact, the hard measure is exist. All right, then this expectation, right, it's an expectation because it's sort of looking at an integral over some thing where, you know, if I put one here, I'm going to normalize the volume such that this total probability vector is one. Probability X was one. Maybe I'll sort of fudge it by a factor of two to get things to work for projector space. But this whole thing is actually equal to the A-dimensional volume of A times the B-dimensional volume of B divided by explicit normalization constants, which look very similar to the normalization constants. Very similar to the normalization constant in the integrand. So, I mean the a-dimensional volume of an a-dimensional projective space over the reals and the b-dimensional volume of a b-dimensional projective space over the reals. Okay, this is a really nice formula. In particular, if I take B to be a hyperplane or a linear space of complementary co-dimension, right, so I take it to be a projective space. Take it to be a projective space. This factor will just turn out to be one because if I'm taking B isomorphic or sort of a linear copy of Pb, they have the same volume. And so I can learn what the length of my real algebraic object is just by computing the expected number of intersection points of A with some randomly chosen height. All right. So. So before I move on to the next section of the talk, let's just examine this formula here. And this is sort of called the integral geometry formula. In more specialized cases, it's sort of referred to as a kinematic or Crofton formula. But taking this formula and looking at its pieces, we'll sort of understand what we need to do in order to move to the non-Archimedean realm. So the first thing we needed was So, the first thing we needed was, well, some sort of volume form to tell us everything that was going on. And in fact, something, you know, there has to be some metric in order to define two volumes in the first place. We also needed some compact topological group equipped with a hard measure. That's what we needed to do this sort of probability statistical like thing in general. And the last thing we really need. And the last thing we really need is: well, we needed some sort of invariant measure, and also we needed this notion of d-dimensional behavior. So, the good news for us is that we have all of these things in non-Archimedean elements. Before I move on, are there any questions? Yes. Right. So, I just mean that you have two reasons. You have two real algebraic varieties. So when I write GB, I just mean, so G is sort of an element of the special or viral group. So I just mean, you know, take, you know, you can put B anywhere you want and then just move it under the action. So when I say A and protect GB, I mean, you know, put A and B inside a projective space. Fix A and let, you know, our group act on the other. You know, or the group act on the other variety and move it around. And then track what the volume of the intersection is. So if I pick them to be of complementary code dimension, in fact, I'm just counting the number of points in that intersection. And that's all that means. It's just beautiful. So the zero-dimensional volume of a point is just one. Okay. Cool. All right. History All right, we started this talk talking about planet Earth, but now we're really getting it all off the rails. So we'll start with QP, although really everything I say is sort of true of arbitrary, well, almost arbitrary non-Archimedean fields. So what I say. In the following valid for a non-Archimedean local field Okay, with ring of integers R A characteristic zero. All right. So just to review some minor topological details. Finite extension of UP finite extension of UP because what you'd be below. Oh, yeah, I do mean that the residue field is finite. So I think that doesn't imply that K has to be some finite extension of yeah. Of course, we have aspirations to work out the characteristic e case. This is kind of ongoing work, and there's some weird technical problems. Work, and there's some weird technical problems. All right. So, in any case, so of course, the first fact to note is that if you take QP and the standard metric on QP, this is a metric measure space. Okay, well, wonderful. And we all know the basis for the induced topology, which is just a ball set. Induced topology, these are just the ball centered around zero. Of course, Qp is not just the metric measure space, it's a locally compact topological field. Right, and of course, the ring operations are continuous. So, naturally, this means that whenever I take QB vector spaces, they become topological groups where vector addition is continuous, et cetera, et cetera. And I can sort of start considering much more interesting objects. So we're always going to normalize. The measure of Zp to be equal to one. All right. Now, unlike in the real world, the topology on this thing is totally disconnected. So all of the techniques from integral geometry, I mean, we're all used for this. They, you know, talking about paths and path connectedness, that kind of all goes out the window. We need to think a little bit more abstractly in order to deal with this. So, this is sort of why we think about things at first in the algebraic world, but it sort of works in more general. All right. So, before we have the unit sphere, I should also point out one more thing, is that we need to sort of think about our analog of the topological group that showed up inside of that integral geometry. And so it turns out that It turns out that GLN, I'll say even GLN plus 1cp. So this is a compact topological group. And of course, it has a hardness. Right, so this guy, in fact, it's the unique compact topological subgroup of GLN plus 1QP of the conjugation. And this will serve as our analog of the orthogonal. And of course, you know, whatever metrics and measures we define at QP, they sort of lift the metrics and measures on like QP to the power n in particular, n equal to n plus y squared. And so that could do. Juice is all of a nice topology and measures and stuff on a nice room. All right. So, okay, before I was talking about like spheres, right? That's how we develop a projective spaces. All right. So, in the real world, the unit sphere is just the set of points of radius one, of distance one away from the origin. We're going to do the exact same thing over here, but we get something a little bit funnier. So we're going to define SQP of n to be equal to the set of points to the n plus one of norm. Of norm of sort of distance one away from the origin. Okay, I mean by the norm of the vector, you take the chaotic absolute value of the components, take the biggest absolute value you see, and that's the distance. The right thing to do in the non- So it's a bit funny because we say unit sphere, and we sort of think of something as one less dimensional than the ambient space. Ambient space. In this case, that's not really what happens. So, if we want to picture, say, for example, of t equals 3 and n equal to 2, our units here sort of looks like a grid of a 3x3 grid, where this is sort of the one containing the origin. Containing the origin. All the other ones you sort of represent by congruence classic module three. And so the unit sphere is really what we get by shading everything in. Okay, what's nice about having the units here is that now we can consider the map of projector space. We still have a Hopf vibration. So this. So, this covers P2, or I guess P1, sorry, over QP2. In general, the way the Hops libration works is you take the tuple of points, sort of the tuple of coordinates A0 through AN, and you map it to the projected point. All right. And what's a game? And once again, we have a unit sphere, right? It lives in a vector space. That vector space has a nice metric on it, induced from the metric. So how do we get a metric on trajectories? Well, we do the exact same thing that we did before. We take two sort of vectors on the unit sphere, we take the angle between them, and we ah, right, angles. Angles are a little funny. So instead, we do the linear algebra thing that works. Instead of we do the linear algebra thing that worked before, we say that the distance is equal to again, this is a situation where we define a pseudometric up here, and then we switch it forward to get an actual metric, but you just take the piadic absolute value of x, y, y. And that gives this projective space the structure of a metric measure space. Of course, this kind of construction works. Of course, this kind of construction works in general. So a metric measures piece. Great. Well, right, we've sort of found two things on our road to integral geometry. We've found a nice compact topological group that maps out. Compact topological group that acts naturally on a vector space. And we've given our manifold the structure of a measure space. So now we just need de-dimensional volumes. So how do we go about building those? Okay, first I'm going to define volumes. And it's going to be the volume we all expect. Take the volume of here. Volume, we all expect, take the volume up here, as push it's lower. But I'm going to pick a precise normalization constant. So if U is a subset of our projective space over QB of dimension, then the measure of U is going to be equal to, well, the measure of the object you get by pulling back under the hot flip position. Pulling back under the hot vibration, right? Now we're taking a measure inside of an actual vector space, but I want to normalize by the volume of the fibrill. To do that, I put a one minus. Okay. So, of course, this measure and this metric are invariant under the action of GLN plus 1cp. This is good. So now we need to. This is good. So now we need correct dimensional volumes, and this is where things get a little beer. So what we'll do is we'll let X be a subvariety of projective space. All right. And then for each n, And then for each M, define the number of points on X, this NM of X, to pretty much be the number of points you get by, well, it's a bit funny. What we're going to do is we're going to say X modulo e to the M such that X actually lives in X actually lives in sort of inverse image of X divided out by e to the m times one minus e to the x. Okay. So what you're really thinking about is look at this object, take its zp points, reduce all of those zp points, module p to the power m, and count the number of things that you have left in that area. Things that you have left of that image. So it's not quite the same thing as reducing the defining equations of X and counting the solutions module of B to the Power M. It's slightly different. You're counting the number of reductions of genuine CP solutions. All right. So if you're wondering why this point counting thing is useful, this is exactly what. Is useful. This is exactly what you need in order to define d-dimensional holidays. So, in fact, the G-dimensional volume of X-dimensional volume X Is so we'll denote it the exact same way as before, but now it's going to be defined in a somewhat funny way. We're going to take the limit as n goes to infinity of the number of points, you know, the number of reduced solutions behind p and power m divided by p to the power md. Okay. So. So it turns out that when, so proposition was zero, right, pretty much exactly the thing you expect to happen does. If x is d-dimensional, right, then this limit exists in this finan. All right, so we now have like some well-defined notion of g-dimensional volume of at least of algebraic sub-varieties. Now, what I'll point out is that this thing is actually a tube volume, right? To the surprise of no one, is it the same thing? This is the same thing as the limit as m goes to infinity of e to the power of m. So that ambient sort of some factor coming from the ambient space times the full-dimensional measure of the tube volume. What you'll notice is one divided by the volume of the cross ratio, which is to say the volume of some ball of radius sort of some n minus a dimensional ball of radius p to the minus n. Okay. So with all of these things in place, With all of these things in place, we can now write down the pi at a version of the integral geometry. All we needed were these three ingredients. So, this first part was sort of joint work with Antonio Lurario. The statement is as follows. So, we let. So we'll let A be an A-dimensional algebraic set. Of PPM over QP and will let B the B-dimensional B-dimensional algebraic set of complementary co-adventure codement All right, What we get is that the integral now, before there was an orthogonal group here. Now, orthogonal groups over QP are the wrong A log. So, what we're going to do is put in our standard G L N plus 1 Z P. Okay. And the zero dimensional volume of the intersection. Of course, there's a version of this formula that works without assuming complementary codimension. without assuming complementary co-dimension, you can replace that with generic intersection of dimension K. I'll state it with zero for now. So the volume of A intersect GB with respect to the Harrow measure on GLN plus 1Z divided by some explicit normalization constant, the volume of level of point. This thing is just equal to one, is equal to the a-dimensional volume of A times the B-dimensional volume of B divided by the explicit normalization constants that you would have expected, right? The A-dimensional volume of an A-dimensional projector space times the B-dimensional volume of a B-dimensional projective space. All right. Now, the way that we first proved this formula, first of all, this is basically exactly the same formula that we had in the real case. The only thing that got changed here was an orthogonal group for this thing. But really, if you think about what those two things are, they're really maximum compact subgroups of GLN plus one of your field. So really, Field. So, really, it's the same object down here, too. And then, just everything is exactly the same. The proof is totally different. Here, you have to do some sort of weird approximation by each of your algebraic varieties, by your changing spaces, and small enough neighborhoods. You use the fact that locally, varieties over QP are really isometric, like isometric to their tag spaces. And then you just do the And then you just do this integral geometry formula for like small open subsets of tangent states. And then once you put everything back together and with some careful error estimates, this formula just falls out. Right? And in particular, we get the same kinds of consequences where I took B to be a hyperplane. I can measure the A-dimensional volume of A just by sort of looking at the expected number of intersection points of some random hyper. Points of some random hyperplane of a complementary codimension with my original objects. And this gives you some entirely new invariants of piotic algebraic directions. Okay. So let me detect the time. Five minutes. Okay, wonderful. So I'll go into some consequences of this integral geometry formula. One of my favorite ones is the following. So I mentioned that there were sort of probabilities. I mentioned that there were sort of probabilistic applications to this whole thing. So here's a question. Suppose I had a random piano polymer. So I'm going to, so consider the random polynomial. So f of t is equal to psi d x sorry t to the t plus psi or x i d minus one t to the d minus one etc where each of the terms. Each of these psi are independent, identically distributed, uniform random variables on TV. So, if you want to be a little bit fancy, there's a sort of small cloister of researchers who really want to come. Researchers who really want to call these things p-adic functions. All right, so I'll take some random polynomial with respect to this distribution. And I can ask, well, what's the expected number of zeros in this thing? And it turns out that the integral geometry formula gives you an instantaneous answer to this question. All right. So, the trick is that you want to think about this expectation as being the length of a curve. So, what you do is you consider the Veronese. Right, so I'll denote that by new d. So I'm going to take x and y to the sort of standard monomial basis of these guys. All right. So I look at this very lazy curve. In QP. And that lives inside a projective space of dimension D minus. Sorry, dimension D. Sorry. So now we make the following claim. First, picking a random polynomial is the same thing as picking a random hyperplane inside a projective space. Hyperplane inside a projective space of dimension D, right? Well, of course, if I pull back the hyperplane, I just get one of these questions. Picking a random hyperplane is literally just randomly choosing those co-op. So, first, I gotta say, it's equivalent to choosing a random. All right. And the second thing is, well, if I take a random height point and I intersect it with my Veronese curve, the number of QP intersection points is the number of zeros of that holonomic. Every zero gets sent to an intersection of the Veronese and the hyperbolic. So the expected number of zeros The expected number of zeros is equal to the expected number of intersection points of a random hyperplane. But by the integral geometry formula, this is exactly the same thing as the length of x. So it's the one-dimensional volume of x divided by this normalization constant. So the one-dimensional volume. And you can calculate this thing explicitly, and it turns out the expected number of zeros is really just equals one. So I'll stop there. So I'll stop there. Thank you for your attention. Fantastic. Thank you. So, do we have any questions from the audience? Anybody from online either? I said that we do have that all set up again this morning. Straight. Oh, I think it was in like the 80s. The source we found it was like it was Frank. We found it was like it was a French paper on like some results in the terra tariff density. The real version, the real version becomes the fewer. Yeah, it's a really old subject. So the first versions of these formulas, I think, were from Boston. It's pretty classical, so I think it's like late 1800s, early 1900s. And a number of people have built on these things. And a number of people have built on these things since there. So, like, Poincaré has a generalization of that to arbitrary sort of lead group actions on homogeneous spaces. We also have that generalization. So that was the sort of next iteration of this project was the sort of big fancy version similar to Poincaré's display. The this question in the real case, does it have any meaning for polynomial in the real case? For the polynomials. For the polynomials you need. Yeah, so you can instead of taking, okay, well, instead of taking this particular distribution on the coefficients, you could say, oh, put Gaussian random, like standard Gaussian random variables for the coefficients. What's the expected number of zeros? And once again, it's the length of a Bernesium color. But in the real case, that length is actually some weird transcendental color. So I think that was worked out by Kat. By cat, you can also change the distribution slightly to like weight all of things by all of these things by like square roots of binomial coefficients, and then you get a really nice answer for the exact number of squirrels.
