Of new approach to understanding excisive functions from spectrum to spectrum. But because this is not the kind of the main theme of the conference, I thought maybe I should begin with a little bit of background and motivation and remind a little bit what are excise functors and what was the old approach to understanding that kind of stuff compared to the new approach. So let SP be S P D as a category of spectra and I'm interested in homotopy functions and The category of homotopy functors that denote it by functor from spectrum to spectrum. Okay, when I say Okay. When I say category, I mean an infinity category. So, or if you prefer, the mod the queuing model category of those things. For various reasons, to avoid, to keep things under control and to avoid size issues and whatnot, I really want to consider functors which commute with filtered homotopic coding, or which is the same thing, functors from the category of functors defined. The category of functions defined on the category of compact spectra and then extended to all spectra. So if T is any category, then DC is the category of compact objects. Okay, and so let me recall that there is an Uh recall that there is uh an important uh sequence of subcategories, which is sort of filtering the category of functors. So let me begin by uh recalling that um definition a functor let's say F from F P C S P and a homotopy functor is one excision if Uh if it takes push-out squares to push-out squares. Okay, now when I say push-out squares, I really mean homotopy push-out squares. And by and large, when I say limits or collimits, By and large, when I say limits or co-limits, I mean homotopy limits and co-limits. So we say a functor is one excise if it has a property that if you feed it to a push-out square, which is roughly speaking a square of the form x1, well, x12, a push-out square, and you apply a function to it, you still get a homotropic push-out square. And right, as many of you are aware, this is a very important thing. As many of you are aware, this is actually not the standard definition. This is the equivalent of the standard definition because I'm looking at functions with values in spectra, which is a stable category. So in spectra, homotopy push-out and homotopy movement are the same. So this is, in this case, this is equivalent to the standard definition, and it is in some ways. If someone sees it for the first time, it's somehow easier to come to terms with. So obviously, this. So obviously this is a kind of a categorification of the condition that the function takes x1 plus x2 minus x0 to f of x1 plus f of x2 minus f of x0. So this is a reasonable, a natural categorization of a usual characterization of what it means for a function to be polynomial of degree one. One excisive is supposed to stand in for the polynomial of degree. And the E of polynomials of degree one. So these are analog samples which behave like polynomial functions of degree one. And concretely, it is easy to describe the one excise functors. So one can show, for example, a functor of the form f of x equals a plus b smash x. D smash X, where A and B are some spectra, is one excise. Because taking smash product with a fixed spectrum preserves arbitrary homotopic collimits, so it preserves push-out, and it's not hard to show that everyone excites the functions of this form. And of course, it also reminds It also reminds of the familiar form model for a linear function. So, let me now recall the generalization of this definition, which is a categorization of polynomial functions of degree n, which is usually defined in terms of cubical diagrams. So, let's say that Cn be the poset. Of subsets of the set with one and n elements, a cubicle diagram in some category C is a functor. Um, let's say high from PM to C. A cubicle diagram is co-cartesian if it is a push-out cubicle diagram. If it is a push-out, so if it's value as the final object equal to The final object equal to the homotopy collimate of the rest of the diagram is the natural map, let's say, collimate over all proper subsets of 1 up to n, chi of u to chi of n, and then hollimate, okay, I do mean homotopy collimit, is an equivalent. Limit is an equivalence and a cubicle diagram is strongly co-cartesian. If L is two-dimensional phase. So, I'm sure 98% have seen all these definitions before, but in case someone hasn't, so what does it mean for So, what does it mean for a cubical diagram to be strongly co-Cartesian? It really means that it is determined by its initial errors, and it is left an extension from its initial portion. So, a strongly co-cartesian diagram has this form. x of 0 is the initial object, x of 1, x of 2, high of sorry, high of 3, and then the rest of it is built as by pushout. So, this is going to be the homotopic collimate of To be the homotopic collimate of the diagram below it, and this is going to be the homotopic collimate, you know, etc. So that's what it means to be strongly co-cartesian. And we say that, okay, definition, a functor, let's say. Let's say F from the category of finite spectrum to spectrum is an excisive if it takes strongly cocades. n plus one dimensional diadrams n plus one dimensional cubicle diadrons to co-constitution diagrams. So n plus one dimension. So in particular, one excise here is the one which takes two dimensional occupations. States two-dimensional co-partition diagram to co-partition diagram. So it means that if you see a diagram like this, which is built out of push-out, you get a diagram which is not built out of push-out in this transcend, but it's still a push-out diagram. And of course, this definition would be valid for any for functors between any two infinity categories, at least if we assume that the target is that the target is a stable category. Target is a stable category. It's a kind of category like spectrum where homotopy push-out and homotopy pull-back coincide. There is a more, like, in a more general case, at least the standard definition of MX size of functors is not at least. But I will only focus on these case. I will really just focus on endofantors or suspecta. Okay, so examples so for example the functors let's say f of x x smash itself I times where Where I is less or equal to n is n excise n. So, and one other thing is easy to see from the definitions here, if a functor is n excisive, it's also n plus one excise, in the same way as polynomial. So, really x mesh itself I times is i excisive and therefore n excise for any. And therefore, n-excise for any. Moreover, any functor which can be built as a homotopy co-limit or homotopy limit of a diagram of functions of n-excise of this type is again going to be an excise because it is clear that this condition in fact is preserved under homotopical limits and also under homotopy limits because we are in the world of in a stable category world. And in fact, one can show that, okay, let Okay, let X N from S B C S P be the category of n excited centers okay, maybe sometimes I will like later when I get to the main results for a reason. To the main result, for reasons of convenience, I sometimes may restrict myself to considering reduced, what's called reduced functors, which actually means functors which take point to point, or like pointed functors. This makes very little difference, and sometimes I assume they are reduced, sometimes not. I don't think it should cause much confusion. Okay, so the functor, and one can show that That the category of annexized functors and the category of all functors this is the smallest subcategory. Subcategory that contains f of x equals x mesh i with i less or equal to n and is closed under Uh under calling it and finally okay so it's literally true that an excise functors are exactly the functors which can be built out of basic ones by means of limits and coordinates. So, nevertheless, I want to consider So I want to consider the problem. Okay, describe this category of n excited functors. Of course, more generally, one may want to describe the categories and exercise the functors between more general categories, but this is what I focus on. Categories, but this is what I focus on today. I'm wondering, perhaps I should mention, even though this is not playing the role in today's talk much, almost no role, so one motivation for studying an excise functors is that the inclusion I am the inclusion of the category of an excited functor in total functor. Has a left adjoint. So this is a full subcategory and it has a left adjoint. Actually, it has both a left and a right adjoint, but I'm more interested in the left adjoint. So that tells me in particular that this is a Bausie localization of the category, of the category of this. And the composed functor So Pn, let me from the category of all functors to the category of all excisive functors and back to the factor. Okay, so I have the inclusion factor, I have the left join, the composition. Factor, I have the left to join. The composition is an idempotent functor, a Bausi localization. And this is the operation which associates to a functor its best approximation by an annexized functor. So this is F goes to P and F, and this is like the nth Taylor approximation. Questions? Sorry? Yeah. The excise category of excise functors is closed under co-limits and finite limits? In fact, you closed under all limits, but it's enough to get finite. So it's like the category of spectra is generated from the field spectrum by co-limits and finite limits, but it's still close and there are all limits. You answered my question before I even asked it. Okay, so again, this is not going to play a big role in today's talk, but I want to mention it as all one motivation. So this gives a very kind of profound and powerful method for taking the factor and constructing a sequence of approximations by polynomial functions, which, of course, has had a lot of many consequences and applications. But let me go back to the question: describe Back to the question, describe the category of NXISA functor. What does it even mean to describe? You're going to be describing the homotopy category, right? Not the category itself. Sorry? Are you describing the category or its homotopy category? Well, as an infinity category. I mean, ultimately, a homotopy category, but yeah, as an infinity category. So in some sense, I thought you were going to say that I already described it. You could say that I gave a You could say that I gave a bunch of generators, but I didn't say anything about relation, so it's somehow latent. Let's look for inspiration from some classic, from some elementary classification of polynomial functions. So, what is like a polynomial functions Uh let's say from R to R. Um uh well this is isomorphic if you want as a vector space to R n plus one. So a polynomial function is uh determined by uh an n plus one tuple of numbers. Moreover there are many uh ways of course to characterize a polynomial function. Let me bring up a few most commonly used ones which actually happen to have an Which actually happen to have an analog in the world of functors. So, for example, given a functor f, a function f, I can look at its values f of 0, f of 1, f of n, and I can recover a polynomial function from this variable. Or sometimes it is convenient instead of looking at the values of the function, it's convenient to look at the cross effect of the function. So, cross 0 f cross 1. F cross 1 F of 1 cross N F of 1 1 1 1. So when the cross effects, well for example the cross effect, the second, the i cross effect of f is a function of i variables, which is defined as f of x1 plus xi minus summation as j goes from 1 to i. j goes from one to i f of x1 plus xi xj xi plus summation j1 j2 etc. So you are taking the value of f at sum, but you are throwing in, throwing out, you are subtracting some values that come from smaller sum. Anyways, so you can take the cross effects, which is some kind of reduction of the sequence, and that also, of course. Of the sequence, and that also, of course, determines the function. And there is a well-known formula for recovering a polynomial function for all these processes. Another way I could do, another thing I could do, I can associate to a function its sequence of derivatives. So again, f of zero, f prime of zero, f n zero. And I can And I can, that's another way to associate a sequence of numbers from which I can recover a function. So, what can I do about if I give it a functor? Suppose an F is an annexed functor from S, from capital x to capital. From the capital spectrum to capital spectrum. And I can consider its value at the sphere spectrum, at the point, sphere spectrum, wedge of the sphere spectrum, all the way up to wedge of copies, n copies of the sphere spectrum. Okay, so this is n plus 1 spectrum. This is n plus 1 spectra, and obviously this is analogous to taking the values of f at 0, 1, 2, n. Moreover, it is true that if you have a natural transformation between n xi the functors, which is an equivalence on these objects, then it will be an equivalence. So in some sense, the restriction of the functor F to the subcategory given by ratios of up-to-end properties of the field spectrum determines the. Of the sphere spectrum determines the functor. But of course, you can't just recover the functor from just, you can't just recover the functor from this. And touch spectra, you also have to look at some structural maps between them. So there are some natural maps between them associated with, which are induced by map between edges of spectra. So, for example, we can think of this, we get a functor from the category, the category of. Let me reverse the category of finite sets, pointed finite sets of pointed cardinality at most n to spectra, where we send like a set, let's say a set, a point at set I to F of I smash the field standard. Right? So any map between indexing map between indexing any pointed map between indexed sets will give me a map between corresponding vectors of here. So this is some structure that I have on this sequence of spectra. But there is more structure, right? Because since these are spectra and this is a homotopy functor, I also, I could say that this is equivalent, f of f1, f of f h is equivalent to f of f cross s. So finite wages are equivalent to finite products, but then I if I if I replace the sums with products, then I naturally get a contravariant functor. Functor from finite set of cardinality at most n to spectra which stands again I to F of either a wax farm or a product of I quote of F. So you see, so what happens here, given an analog size a functor, we can associate with it both a covariant and a contravariant functors on the category of finite sets, which take the same values on objects. Which takes the same values on objects up to homotopy and presumed to satisfy some relations. So that looks a lot like a Machiafunctor. And indeed, one can define the notion of a spectral Machifantor on a finite category. And it is a theorem of Bluffman, which says that that's exactly the structure that you need in order to recover and analyze a function. There is an equivalence It's an easy to categorize M S B C S B Spectal Macket Functor from Calcutta Finance. Um finite fact. Why are the dashes under the spectra? Sorry. There are dashes under the spectra. Is that just a typo? I'm sorry, I didn't understand the I didn't hear the question. Under the spectra, the dashes, are those just typos? Yeah, yeah, never mind. Okay, well, so I'm avoidant of giving the proper definition of a step and mache functor. So morally speaking, you can mimic a classic definition, like one version of a classic definition is a pair of equivalent, a contravariant functor, which satisfies some sort of version of the double concept formula. But to do it properly, you really have to work with an in, you really have to develop You really have to develop an infinite categorical version of spectral microfunctions. Because, among other things, of this, for example, f of a sum and f of a product, they're not isomorphic, they're only equivalent. There are a lot of relations that have to be satisfied, which will only be satisfied up to coherent homotopies, and you have to somehow check all those higher coherences. Nevertheless, that's something to do. Also, some of you may notice that this doesn't really look. May notice that this doesn't really look that's actually not the theorem that Glassman wrote down. Glassman wrote a version of this where instead of values of the functor, he looked at the cross effects of the functors. So this is equivalent in that to the spectral machifunctors from the category of finite sets and edimorphisms into spectral. So, this is a version of what people sometimes call Pirashville Helmstützler equivalence. So, there is a it is well known that there is an equivalence of categories between like functors from Like functors from finite point at finite sets to an abelian category, and finite sets and subjection to an abelian category. And Henry Stuttler extended it to functor, to a stable and simple category. And I'm saying it also worked for tetramatifactors. Now, what was your question? How does this work maybe like unstably when you don't have also this product structure, like for spaces and spaces, none of this, yeah? Space is completely different. Is completely different. None of this is directly relevant to function from spaces to spaces. So these two versions of Lasman theorem give me a categorical version of this classification of this. So you see, you have something analogous to this classification, except that in the categorical world, you don't just get n plus objects, you get objects with certain structure maps between them, which you hopefully can describe as some kind of functor category or modules of an opera. Category or modulus of an operator or something, and we'll get the classification result. There is also a classification result using derivatives, which is in the similar spirit. And you need to collect the cover call. Maybe I will not write down, but Goodwill has defined a way to associate another sequence of spectra with a functor, which is analogous to the derivatives. And it turns out that the derivatives of a functor, of an excisive functor, also form a certain structure, which you can formalize as write modules over a pro operator. And you have a result saying that excited functors are. Result saying that excisive functors are equivalent. The derivative, the differential derivative functor induces an equivalence between excisive functors and write modules over something like a sphere program. So these are old results. And now I want to show: okay, so that we have the classification results, they tell us something, but they are still fairly common. Something, but they are still fairly complicated. So now I want to talk about a different, a new approach, which is worked specifically for functions on spectra to spectra. And then of Gift came at third as a surprise to the colour of the city. Also, sorry, I forgot to say all this is joint work with Toby Bartel and Duford and Peren Sanders. And parent sounds Okay, so the idea now is to take advantage of another piece of structure that I haven't mentioned yet, which is a symmetric honoidal structure given by date involution. Category of let's say all functors from spectra to spectra have a symmetric monologue Even by driving data convolution. So given two functors, f and g, I can define a new functor, let me denote it this way, which is defined by the formula f star g of f. F star G of X is the collinet over the category of all decompositions, all mapped from a mesh product into X of F of A mesh F of P of E. P of E, right? Sorry? Is that a question? Yeah, look at what you wrote. G, G. G, G, G. G, G. G, G, G. Okay. So this is a, you know, Bacon volition is a well-known thing. It's, in general, can be difficult to figure out the formula, but fortunately, there is an easy formula for representable functors. So if I take a representable functor for me is a function which is given by like map from some finite spectrum. some finite spectrum into. So think of this as a function which stands a spectrum to the state extension spectrum of the space of math and you take another one from S and this is equivalent to the functor represented by the SMESH product. So the category of functors is a symmetric monomital category, symmetric monomital. Infinity category, or if you prefer, you can just take the homotopy category and think of it as a symmetric monologue. Triangulated category, if someone prefers triangulated categories to infinity categories, is a semantic monologue category. The unit, by this formula, it follows from this formula that the unit is the representable The unit is the representable functor represented by the unit is sigma infinity omega infinity, which is the functor of sigma infinity mass from the sphere state of the function. So one thing that came as a bit of a surprise to me is that this monoidal structure actually represents actually interacts very well with the Taylor approximation. With the tailor approximations, with all these Putuino operators. So, from the point of view, we can say that the PM, this localization functor, which takes n-tail approximation, is a smashing localization. So, that tells me that the case is a very good idea. So that tells me that you have a kind of formula for Pn of a functor, which is really Pn of the identity and take convolution with your given functor. Okay. Also, I should have mentioned I forgot, let me add to this. So I say the category of functor is monoidal, but it's more than a it's a close symmetric monoidal category. Closed symmetric honoidal category. You can define an internal home object in the category of functors in a state way, which is right adjoint to the state convolution. And so therefore, you can talk about dualizable objects. You have a symmetric monodal category, we have dualizable, and another observation is lemma. So first of all, let me say, so it follows from here that the category That the category so it's from this formula or from by any other reasoning, it follows that deconvolution of annexized functors is annexcisive. In fact, annexized functors form an ideal. Like a deconvolution of an annexed functor with anything is an excise. So the category of anxiety functors inherits a monoidal structure with the with the unit given by P n of the unit. T n of the unit X N S P C S P inherit the monoidal structure with a unit with With the monoidal structure given just by day convolution, you don't need to localize the deconvolution. The deconvolution of excited functions is excise. But the unit, of course, is the localization of the unit in the big category, which is just the n-scalar approximation of sigma in geometric. It also tells me functors like Pm, DM, etc. are strongly minorital. So for example, the ice derivative of a day convolution. The derivative of a deconvolution is equivalent to the smash product. Okay, another observation, which is very easy to prove, but somehow was in a way a starting point for it all. An object An object uh in the category of any of the control category that we are considering between spectra is compact if and only if it is dualizable. So, this, for example, is definitely false for fantor categories like the category from spaces to spectra. So, basically, it follows from some of these formulas that a representable functor is dualizable precisely if it is represented by dualizing objects. So, in the category of spectra, compact objects are dualizable. In the category of spaces, they are not. So, this has a name. I can never remember what is the standard name for a category which satisfies this object rigid Which satisfies this object? Rigid, rigid, rigid, tensor category? So, anyway, this is a good property. It's called something rigidity. And sorry? All good. Yeah. Yeah. So this is like rigidity. So, this suggests categories, like monoidal infinity categories, which satisfy this kind of rigidity. So, there is a very fruitful approach to studying the global structure of such categories by studying what's called its tensor ideals and the prime, the spectrum of prime ideals. Okay, so let C the symmetric monoidal infinity category, which again, if you want, you can substitute uh tental triangul uh monoidal triangulated category here. Triangulated category temperature. So stable. Do you want stable? So it's tensor? Stable, definitely, definitely stable. Sorry. So fake and fake tender idea. Tensor ideal in C is a full subcategory A that satisfies first of all closed under retract So is that what thick means? Second closed, I guess, under suspension, so it's a triangulated subcategory. Okay, and C is an ideal, which obviously means that A, Tensor, C is contained in A. So the tensor product or the monoidal product of an object A with any other object is again an object. With any other object is again an object in A. And then there is an obvious notion of a prime ideal. If prime is, well, exactly what you're saying. If it satisfies that if I can't. Satisfies that if I cancel problem to talk, this is in T implies that x is in t or y is in t. Okay, so as I said, so one approach is to try to understand the category C by understanding its set of ideas its uh set of ideals. And so what one usually do does, one considers the set of the category of compact objects. Compact objects because this is the problem is much more tractable that way. And it turns out that it is enough to consider just the prime ideals. So if you can understand the prime ideals, then you can recover the rest of ideals in terms of the prime ideals. Let me see the Palmer spectrum. Of C is a set of prime ideals in the category of compact objects C. So, together with this set has. So together with so this set has a kind of topology, which is like an analog of the Zariski topology, but in good cases the topology is determined by the profit structure given by inclusion. So I will not talk this about topology, but just think of it as a postet under inclusion with the topology. Or I believe I don't believe we use the both extract Okay, so for example Consider the category of spectra. So suppose E star is a homologous here. So then the set of all spectra such that E star of X equals zero is an ideal. Correct? So if X has vanished in this star homology, then why then spectrum, the smash product is not great than at least. On the SMESH product, it's not going to be magnetic homology. This is not always going to be a prime ideal, because in general it is, but it is a prime ideal if, for example, if you take E star to be homology with field coefficients. If E star x is homology of x with coefficients with a field, Then it is the prime ideal. So let me define a couple of prime ideals in the category of maybe compact spectra. So to So to simplify the picture, let us pick a prime P and consider P local spectra. So consider let F B C P be P local compact spectra. So define C P one to be the L X Lx such that the rational homology of X is paid L. And define Cp infinity to be all X such that homology with Fp coefficients is traded. So these are two prime ideals in So, these are two prime ideals in the category of compact spectra. And in the category, if you restrict yourself to compact spectra, you have an inclusion of Cp1 contains Cp infinity, right? So if you have a compact, if a rational homology is non-trivial, then what P homology is also not trivial. That's not true for non-compact spectra, but it's true for compact spectra. And as is well known, so these two ideas. So these uh two ideals uh corresponding to the prime p and uh to the rub prime t and the prime zero have a refinement in the stable homotopy world given by one of a case evaluation. This can be refined. Let me K so HQ with K0 K1 K K H K infinity this is given by H F P B is a pillow commoraba theories. So K0 is just rational homology, K1 is mod P K theory, and so on and so forth. So a classic theorem in stable homotopy theory says that each one of these defines the prime ideal and these are all the prime ideals. ideas that's the theorem of that's the sixth subcategory theorem of Hopkins and Smith Let C T H be all the spectra such that K H minus 1 star of X equals 0. Then the Bonner spectrum of Of SP C local is given by the picture C P one contains C P two contain C P three Okay, so the point here is that of the prime So the point is that all the prime ideals are exactly the ones given by Morava K-theories. They have these inclusions and that's the whole that's all there is that determines the topology and in principle determines the ideal structure on the category of compact spectra. And if you want to extend it from p-local spectra to all spectra, well you just get a copy of this picture for every prime t, except that the largest part is the same for all. The largest part is the same for all prime. This is the part which came from rational homology and that doesn't depend on p. So you have a copy of this picture for every prime: prime 2, 3, 5, and so on. All right, so now I have three minutes to say our result. So our result is a description of the Baumer spectrum of the compact objects in the category of functors from spectrum to spectrum.  Remember, I already said that di from the functor, the Goodwill derivative functor, thought of as just a functor to spectrum, is monoidal. So that tells me that the image of the prime ideal. The pre-image of the prime ideal under this functor is again a prime ideal. So I can get a bunch of prime ideals by pulling back a copy of the spectrum of the stable chromatopy category. So the define P I P H be all functors in Xn. Let me just write it Xn such that and such that the i the i th derivative of f belongs in c p h, which means that the h minus 1 or other k theories equals 0. So I can define for every derivative between For every derivative, between, so here I is between 1 and n, p is a prime, and h is the hormonic height, so h is at least 1. For every choice, I have a prime ideal. So, first of all, these are exactly all the prime ideals in the catalog of this. So, M P I D. The H M are exactly distinct and are all the prime ideal of the particle of annexizer functions. So this determines the Bounder spectrum as a set and partially determines the topology. So the information that I wrote on the board is not the end of the full result. It tells you some of the relations. So that tells me that, so for example, so let me fix a prime P, let's localize at P. Then, so if I look at functors into P localize, Functors into p-local spectra, or which is the same thing as p-localization of the category of functors. And the picture that I get, I get a copy of and so if this is the layer, um I get a copy of of the Balmer spectrum of the stable homophobic category for each layer between one and n. For each layer between 1 and n. So I have the first layer, the second layer, all the way up to nth layer. So this is, for example, going to be C B M B one B M B two, etcetera. To etc. Okay? And certain inclusions are forced because you have a map. But there may be further inclusions between these one. And what happens is that there is further interaction between various between layers whose indexing is divisible by p minus 1. So, for example, if I'm going to So, for example, if I'm going to have a so there are going to be no included if p is some prime greater than two, the next layer that is going to have an interaction with the first layer is going to be layer number p minus one and then layer number two p minus two and so on and so forth. And uh the second layer is going to have some interaction with layer p and so on and so forth. Let me maybe write down try to write down the result. Down, try to write down, write it out. There is no interaction, that is no inclusion relation between Like P J E H one and P I P H two unless greater or equal to J is greater than I and T minus one. And p minus 1 divides j minus i. If p minus 1 divides j minus i, there exists a number alpha and B J. P J P M H plus alpha is contained in P I P H for all H and alpha is a minimal maximum, a minimal such number. Furthermore, the number alpha Furthermore, the number alpha equals one if i is greater or equal than the sum of digits of j in expansion to base p or to digits to base and also equals two. And alpha equals two if i is less than signature. So there is what's called like an example of a blue shift. So for any like for between two layers which differ by a multiple of p minus one, there is going to be a blue shift which is determined by the distance. So if this number, if the smaller number is greater than, greater than equal to the sum of the digital. Greater or equal to the sum of the detailed number, the shift is one, otherwise the shift is two. So, for example, in the prime two, two, three, so in two addic to the phase two, this is layer one, this is one zero, this is one one, there is a there is a um Maybe let's start right here. Okay, so we have time for one or two quick questions, and in the meantime, while we'll be setting up the next topic.
