The validation of yes, I was planning to talk about neural networks in AI for in using CFD, but since I'm at the beginning of this project, I prefer to move on a subject that is a bit more simpler, but that might be of interest for some of you. This is actually a follow-up of the This is actually a follow-up of the work I have been presenting last time on the numerical modeling of catalytic particle edge filters. And with Igor Below, who is the former PhD candidate, he has no graduated, we have been devised a 3D additive manufacturing approach for validating such kind of flow in complex provision media. Media okay, so this is his work I'm going to be reporting today, and this is a collaborative work with the company Umicore or manufacturing such kind of catalytic particulate filters. So, Martin Volksmajor here. So, just to give you a bit of context, do you see the top of my screen? I see that there is the somehow the bar here is not getting away from my screen. Getting away from my screen. I hope he is not cutting my screen on your side. So let me check if I can remove it and put it somewhere else, I guess. Do you see my screen or do you see the bar in the middle of the screen? Because on my side, I'm not able to get the bar away. It's okay. It's absolutely fine at our end. Absolutely fine at our end. So we see your screen with slide and everything. Yep. So it's, and you could go on the Zoom setting and you can hide the settings bar. Let's see. It's okay at our end. Let me confirm that on the Zoom if everybody else is okay. What do they see? Yeah, because it's a bit annoying for my side because it's hiding my slides. Hiding my slides. Well, I try to manage with that. If it can be removed, it would be nice. So the context of this research is that we have been, you know, the industry have been developing during the past 15 years those integrated catalytic functionality into gasoline particle adventures. Before we had two devices for treating the exhaust gas of a Gas of an engine, we had the catalytic converter that you see here, and we had the particulate filters here that were supposed to remove the subparticles. And of course, the catalytic converter was supposed to remove the noxious gases, like carbon monoxide, anox, and unburned hydrocarbons. So, for the past 20 to 15 years, there have been 15 years they have been combining those two devices into one for many several motivations. As you can see here, reduce the total numbers of devices, reduce the packaging complexity, lower the overall system costs, and to better remove the small soot particles particularly because gasoline direct engine actually creates more dangerous soot particles than actually diesel engine and this is not really. And this is not really well known. Okay. So we have devised this basically model. And the question that our industrial opponents wanted us to answer was, well, do they need to actually deposit the catalyst in a uniform way into the catalytic poros wall? So you see here a device, and then you have a dispos. And then you have this onicum structure here. And then you see here inside the onicum structure, you have the ceramic porous wall that you can see here at the cross-section here. And then we're forcing basically the gas to go through this ceramic porous wall and eventually capture the soots and also treat the noxious gases. And so the catalyst is deposits within this small wall, which usually is in the scale of around 300 microns. Of around 300 microns. So it's relatively small. So the industrial partners basically wanted to know whether it was important for them to invest money to get a process that was eventually getting more uniform profiles, or there was little to gain into getting a more uniform profile of deposit of the catalyst. And then the criteria. And then the criteria that we usually look at is pressure drop. We want to minimize pressure drop. We want to improve as much as possible soot capture efficiency and improve also catalyst cutting effectiveness. So we devised this four-step numerical methodology to predict basically the gasoline particle, the catalytic particolate features performance. So in the first step, we actually So, in the first step, we actually reconstruct forest walls from initially from a tomographic image. So, as I'm going to explain in the next few slides, we treat this image in different ways to increase the catalyst amounts or eventually change the uniformity of the catalytic profile. Then, the second step is to calculate the flow through this reconstructed media using the lattice-Boss method. So, today I won't. The lattice-Boss method. So, today I won't go into the details of this. I already have been through that last time. And then, from this calculation, you can get the pressure drop or the permeability information. The third step is to compute the aerosol capture through the catalytic produce wall by solving a Langevin equation. And this will give you the capture efficiency of your filter. And from those information, And from those information here, you can get then the filter quality factor. And then in the end, we can also compute using Lattice-Boltzmann the species concentration. So we can solve an advection diffusion reaction problem to determine the conversion of a certain gas going through the structure. And this can give us an information about the catalyst cutting effectiveness. So in terms of So, in terms of for the first step, so I won't recall the second to the full step. I will just recall here the first step what we did and what I presented last time. So, reconstructs from tomographic images here. This is just a small cross-section that I'm presenting here to illustrate. So the real polycolate features has this non-uniform deposition as you can see here. In white, you see the catalyst. In white, you see the catalyst, and then in dark gray, you see the substrates, and eventually the bore space. And from this image, we can actually create or increase or decrease the non-uniformity of the profiles by digitally treating the image. So you see here, if I move, let me try to animate that, I can put more non-uniform amounts of catalysts in a non-uniform way. In a non-uniform way, and we actually created nine different structures out of this tomographic image. And then what you can also do is that you take the tomographic image, you remove all the catalyst that was in the original image, and then you can redeposit this catalyst in a uniform way, as you can see here on this image. And so we have generated in such a way four different uniform structures. Different uniform structures. So, this gives you an idea here about the 3D reconstructed media that we have looked at. So, from the bare wall, ceramic wall without any catalysts, up to this sample here, which is highly loaded with non-uniform catalysts. And here, from the bare porous structure. A porous structure to a highly loaded uniform catalyst structure. And then you can compute using Lattice-Boltzmann, as I said, the flow field, as you can see here. So here you have an example of uniform distribution of the catalysts and then the resulting velocity field. And you see here the amount of catalyst that has been put into this structure was around 26.5. Structure was around 26 percent of the pore space that was filled with these catalysts. And here, you see the same thing here for the non-uniform distribution with relatively similar amount of catalyst that has been deposited into the structure, but in a non-uniform way. And you see that the flow patterns are quite different. Note that here the bare wall is exactly the same. It's just the distribution of the catalyst that has changed. And you see that the flow distribution is quite different. That the flow distribution is quite different. And you can also compute the concentration field, as you can see here, for those same structures. And you can see that the conversion of the gas is significantly, as we expected, of course, significantly affected by the way the catalyst has been deposited. But the question is how much those fields are affected by the catalyst's deposition. Its deposition. So here, basically, this is an example of a result that we got. Okay, so you see here we looked at the quality factor. The quality factor is a material property of a particle or any filter, actually. It's simply the ratio between here, a function, a logarithmic function of the capture efficiency of capturing soot particles into the structure divided by the pressure drop. The pressure drop that has been occurring through the structure as the flow of air is going through or our exhaust gas is going through. So the higher the quality factor, the better usually the more efficient is the control. And you see that in red here, you have the non-uniform distribution. So here you have the fraction of pore volume filled by the catalysts. So it means that if we're going in this direction, we have more catalysts. This direction, we have more catalysts. You see that if you, for example, if you want to deposit 20% of catalyst into the pore space, eventually a uniform distribution will provide you with a 30% better filtration performance overall than a non-uniform distribution. But if you move, if you add more catalysts, in the end, you can see here there is a crossover between the curves, and basically there is no more difference than. No more difference than, or it's not really advantageous to go to more uniform distribution if you go to higher content of catalyst. And then you can look also here, as you can see here, on the conversions. So here, as an assumption, we took a first-order reaction, for example, the conversion of carbon monoxide. And you see here that there is a gain of 20% in conversion to get if you. To get if you were able to improve the uniformity of your catalyst. So things here looks relatively as we would expect, but not necessarily all the results follow what we could expect. An example of this here is if you look at the capture efficiency itself, okay, so the efficiency of capturing the soup particles, you see that if we You see that if we increase uniformly the amount of catalysts within the structure, we of course we fill in the poor space. So, of course, the capture efficiency is increasing as we would expect. If you do it in a non-uniform way, you would think that it will also go, you know, it will also increase, but actually, this is counterintuitive. The capture efficiencies decreases as you can see here. Okay. And what I explained to you last time actually already showed. You last time actually already shown these results. It's just due to what we call, you know, I mean, this is just due to flow channeling. When you deposit the catalyst in a non-uniform way, as you can see on those images here, you see that basically you get less flow pathways in the non-uniform structure, and then you get channeling, and then eventually the capture is less efficient because of this channeling. So the results, so I presented. Results, so I presented you with a quality factor, permeability, conversion, and another result that we can get is the permeability of permeability varies. As you can see here, as we increase the amount of catalyst within the structure in a non-uniform way, we're getting, of course, a decrease in permeability. But the decrease is more important with a uniform distribution than in a non-uniform distribution. That could be expected, again, because... Could be expected, again, because of channeling effects. So, a non-uniform distribution will provide preferential pathways to the flow than a uniform one. But then I challenged Igor at that step. This is where I'm getting into my validation technique. I challenged Igor. I said, okay, how good are those results? How valid are those results? Can we validate it? And I told him, well, we need to find. And I told him, well, we need to find a relatively cheap way, a cost-efficient way to validate those results. And that's where we came up with this methodology here that I'm going to be proposing to you or explaining to you. So first we looked, you know, of course, we have artificially generated structures, but we don't have the structures in real life. So we cannot simply take the particle at filters. Particle at filters, okay, and then measure all the properties that we're interested in through those structures because they are artificially generated only on computers. So, the first thing is that we thought, well, we can probably print them. So, if we would print them, can we first print a purse material using the classical 3D printer? And then, after that, can we measure permeability out of those printed samples? So, we looked at the literature. So we looked at the literature, some people did verify that printing prose material in a relatively accurate way was possible, especially the thesis from Yushutov. And then he was able to create 3D print proxies, as he called them. Some people call them analogs or replicates or twins. And then other more. Although, more recently, in 2019, people started to print different types of porous material, like sandstone or artificial porous materials or foams, using quite not so cheap printing technologies, such as binder jetting in silica sand, laser centering, stereolithography, and getting more or less. And getting, you know, more or less, well, some of them were not conclusive when they were trying to measure, you know, for example, permeability. Some of them are quite large disagreements. One order of magnitude difference between the permeability measured on their artificially recreated samples with regard to the simulation. And some other we're getting starting to get more interesting results, like with a mean error lower than 30%. 30%. But still, the equipment required was quite, you know, I wouldn't say very expensive, but more expensive than what I was planning to spend on these validation cakes. So they use well-equipped rigs with nanometers or pressure transducers or mass flow controllers and so on. So the idea was to try to find: is there a cheaper way to do in an accurate way, of course, to do those validation? To do those validations. So we came up with this strategy here, where basically what we do is that from the reconstructed image, we generate those kind of cylinders, cylindrical shaped samples and make STLs out of those binary files. And then we send them to printing after having scaled those structures to a certain factor. And I will come back in the next few slides. Back in the next few slides, what you know scaling factor should be used. We have set up several criteria to find an appropriate scaling factor. Okay, so here, what we wanted to use is a simple, you know, affordable out-of-the-shelf fuse filament printer. So, not sterol lithography, all those kinds of expensive 3D printers. So, we said, can we use a simple fuse filament printer to print those structures? To print those structures. So, and using PLA, as you can see here. And then, once we have those samples, we had some colleagues at Polytechnic Montreal developing this modified falling head permeability. And the idea was basically to place those cylindrical shaped samples into this falling head permea to evaluate permeability. And then, in the end, you get a permeability. A permeability from those experiments, and then you need to scale it back to the real dimensions that you're interested in. Since permeability is the dimension of length squared, you need to multiply by one over the scaling factors, a factor raised to the power two. Then you're getting the experimental permeability, and then eventually you can compare that to the numerical permeability. So, in choosing the scaling factor, we devise basically four criterias. The first one is simply based on principle of kinematic similarity. So, basically, you want your setup, that is, you know, that you have scaled up to be in the same throw regime. So, you don't need exactly to have the same Reynolds number, but to be at least in the same To be at least in the same flow regime here, in this case, is the creeping flow. So basically, we have to be able to have a poor Reynolds number lower than 10. Here you recognize, well, the Reynolds number, and here we have the diameter, the poor diameter of the printed samples, DWS. And then using Darcy law and having in mind that And having in mind that the printed pore diameter has to be equal to the pore diameter of the real sample or the scale, the real sample times the scaling factor, and that the proboscis needs to be the same. Well, you can come up to the first scaling factor. So here, basically, this implies the sample thickness here, the initial heights, because this falling head permeameter. You know, permeamer, we'll have basically a free surface, well, a column of fluid, which is silicon oil, that is drained through the sample. And of course, the height of these drained samples of this liquid that is drained is changing over time. So the initial fluid heights and then the pore diameter of the well structure. And then we ended up with this first criterion to have a scaling factor around. To have a scaling factor around 103. Of course, if you want to change that, you could change the silicon oil that you want to use here, because you have the viscosity and the density of the silicon oil that is represented here in this formula here. So, the second criterion, of course, is to have a sufficient printer resolution. So, it implies that the pole diameter of the printed cell. That the pole diameter of the printed sample needs to be much greater than the printer resolution. And basically, this ends up into getting a criterion where the scaling factor needs to be much greater than four in our case, because the real diameter of the four of our structures were around 30 microns, and the resolution of the printer we used was around 100 microns. So, the search criterion is the Brinkman screening lens criterion that's prescribed that's basically the domain characteristic length scale, which is here the sample diameter, the diameter or the cylinder that we put into the permeamer, needs to be much greater than the square root of the permeability. So, this gives us a criterion where the scaling factor needs to be much lower than 30,000. And then the last parameter is based on the perm criterion, is based on the permeability sensitivity of the permeter. So the sensitivity of the modified falling edge permiter that we used was 10 to the power minus 10 squared meter and up to 10 to the power minus 7 square meters. And based on those. And based on those numbers here, we were able to get basically after some algebraic manipulation this criteria where the scaling factor needs to be between six and 140. So having all those criteria here, basically we were able to determine a window of scaling factor that were appropriate to do our experiments. And so this window was. Experiments and so this window was between six and 103. And for practical reasons, we choose a scaling factor of 100, as you can see here. So in terms of, well, I'm going to go fast through those slides here. So because I already explained, so you have the tomographic images or the reconstructed tomographic images with different distribution of catalysts can be printed and you can prepare STL files as you can see here that are. Files, as you can see here, that are made of 10 million cells. And then you can, after that, generate the G-code that is required for any printer to print. And then, in the end, you can print, and we used here a Ultimaker 3 printer using PLA to form those samples, or magnified twins, as we call them. And here are all the samples that we have printed. So you see here we have four non-uniform samples. So here they look a bit similar, but you see that the probosity is significantly changing. So the bare wall is the same, but there are, or we don't deposit catalyst here. The catalyst phase and the seronic phase are fused, because we're just looking at the moments on our Just looking at the moment on the permeability, but these are basically the structure that we have printed. And as you can see on the next slide, you see that the porosity of the digital samples and the porosity of the printed samples were, as expected, very, very good. And then the modified folding add parameter. I'm going to go a bit fast here because I think I'm running out of time. Basically, it's simply. Time. Basically, it's simply a cylinder here in which you put silicon oil. You put your printed samples here, and then you drain the silicon oil through the samples and you measure over time basically the amount of silicon oil that is gathered. And basically, this can be built from home improvement store materials. It's very cheap to build this piece of equipment. It's less than a few hundred dollars. You can build this and put that in your lab. And put that in your lab. Okay, so I will go a bit quick now on the details here. You need to do a baseline test, of course, to determine the inherent pressure drop of the setup itself. And then from Darcy law, you can come up to this basically equation which relates the height of the fluid in the head or in the column to time through here this factor here. And you see that in this. This factor here. And you see that in this factor, actually, everything, the only unknown that it is in this equation is actually the permeability. We have all the other variables, such as the thickness here of the sample. Those constants have been determined by this C1 and C0 by the baseline tests. And then in the end, you're getting, you know, the amount of mass of silicon already gathered, and then is the setup over time. Step over time, you can convert that into height of drain fluids or remaining fluid into the column over time. And then the only factor that you need to fit is the permeability. And fitting the permeability through those data gives you what you're interested in, the permeability itself. And this is basically the result that we got. So again, in green and red, these are the anomalical results. Are the neuromatical results? The error bolt, as you see here, is that we is because we tested different structures or sections of the tomographic image. So we have some variability, as you can see here, on the numerical data. And here, the gray squares here are basically the experiments that we were able to do with this technique that I'm presenting here for here. Presenting here for the non-uniform distribution samples that we have printed. And here in dark, the diamond dark gray are here, here, and here are for the uniform distribution, as you can see here. And overall, the mean relative error that we measured was basically lower than 20 percent. And as you can see here, I hope you agree with me, we can recover pretty nicely basically the trend. Nicely, basically, the trends here are the variation of the permeability as we fill in the pore space uniformly or non-uniformly with an amount of catalyst. Okay, and so we were very satisfied by this result because permeability is very sensitive material property, depends on the pore diameter to the square. So, getting this level of accuracy with this kind of low-tech methodology, we were quite happy. And this is why actually I And this is why actually to represent you this kind of result to take. So we devised a novel validation procedure for flow modeling through micro-scale pro-media that relies on kinematic similarity and scale up procedure of the prostructures. They're eventually reconstructed or from tomographic images. Makes use of affordable off-the-shelf additive manufacturing in permeamer. Permiometer, it relies on the four criteria methodology to select the appropriate scaling factor. And I hope I convinced you that we apply this to the permeability of particulate feeders for wall, and we were successfully able to recover the impact of wash coat distribution and the amount of wash coats on the permeability. And we had overall a relative error lower than 20%. Okay, so this concludes my presentation. So, this concludes my presentation. I'd like to thank InSearch, the funding agency in Canada, Compute Canada, and Calcute Kebay that made possible the numerical parts. I'd like to thank BRC and CMO for organizing the conference, and particularly Mayank and Kumar for organizing this conference. My name, I've been cited as a co-organizer, but I can tell you that everything has been done by Mayank and Kumar. I have not done so much. Kumar, I have not done so much. And here you have a QR code if you are interested by this technique to get to this article. So, thank you. And if you have any question, please feel free. Thanks, David. Really, really cool work. Let's take some questions before we head out for lunch. Seems like there is something on Zoom. Nope. Okay, so let's take some. So let's take some questions from the audience over here. Any questions? Let me take, because I think I'm going to be presenting on Thursday, you might want to kind of attend several talks. They're going to be Lattice-Boltzmann methods on Porus Media. The resolution limits of these 3D printers, how low you have been able to go to get into. able to go to get into your permeability what is the lowest level of permeability you have been able to get into with your 3d printers reliably like if your pore's porosity is a quick down like say if I go into milliDARC range would you be able to 3D print that yeah well the the issue was that at the beginning we saw can we print the real structure at the real scale okay and this is why we use this magnified you know with this scaling factor You know, with this scaling factor, uh, yes, I don't think at the current moment you can have an affordable printer that can print at the, you know, we have the pole size of 30 microns. So I think it's kind of limit to print at that scale. This is why we're using the scaling factor to scale up everything. So that's the 100 microns resolution of the printer we used was sufficient to recover nicely the poor space. Okay, no, that's also, you don't need to have. No, that's also, you don't need to have a very final resolution of the pore space because, in the end, even if you have some kind of roughness on the pores themselves, you know, most of the flow goes through channeling, through preferential pathways. So, as long as you nicely recover those large pores, eventually you're going to get a very accurate permeability. Are you doing any multi-phase experiments to retrieve relative permeabilities out of it? Because if you do the scaling of the poor throat, how do you ensure that the leveret function maintains that? Because you have with wetting and non-wetting phase. Yeah, I mean, this is what we add as a conclusion. I should have added that here, you know, on our. That here on our article. It's not clear how you can extend that to multi-phase flow. Because of course, you won't be able necessarily to scale that up. The free surface, the surface tension, sorry, the surface tension, the contact angle, and so on. It's not clear how you can scale that up, especially because here you're printing with. Especially because here you're printing with PLA, so the contact angle might not be the same. So it's not clear for multi-phase flow. Sorry. Okay. All right. Well, thank you. Let's see if there is more questions. If not, then we'll be taking a lunch break and we are going to be missing all of you Zoom attendees because the next item on our list is the group photo. So you guys are all missing. We have only the in-person attendees that will be taking the group photo and then we'll head out for lunch. Thank you all. We'll resume at 3 p.m. U.S. Central Time. At 3 p.m. US Central Time with the keynote talk from Professor Steve Brunton. Thank you. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
