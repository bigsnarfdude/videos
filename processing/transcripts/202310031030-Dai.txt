It's really a great pleasure to come to Benf every time. This is a very nice season. I never been here in October. It's really pretty. Okay, I'm going to speak post-minute results for fleeting questions. Um so uh just a quick overview I'll be focusing on the non-unique is problem for of course weak solutions of fluid equations and if I have And if I have time, I'll mention a little bit of finite time singularity formations of models of relative functions. Okay. The equations I I'm interested in, say uh it has a general form. Um I'll put it this way. Okay, um, so here uh uh the omega can be a vector field or a scalar, okay. or a scalar okay and we have this Laplace to the negative alpha power so it generates normal cooperator here and alpha is one we have Euler so here only gets its vorticity and and this is the bill support So long. And on our half, we have SGG and we identify the omega as a scalar. So that's the theta. And really here it's possibly and th then we would take here as a divergence and here just uh elect okay. Just correct. And when RF is zero, we have, so here we don't have this moco operator, instead we have this so-called electron magnetohydropylmics. And you notice that when you increase and decrease the value of R4, the equation is getting Uh the equation is getting more singular. Okay. And in this regime, the electron MHD also referred as the whole equation is the most singular one. So this family of equations of course have been studied a lot for Euler and for SQG and in between recently I think it's in G Dong Hong. I think it's in G, D, I think, acts so nice without. So in general, when the R plus is from half to one, we have a bit better understanding. Doesn't mean we know everything. And in a more singular region, In a more singular region, we have much less understanding, it's much less understood. Okay, so this is just a very general overview here. So, next I want to actually move on to talk about the The weakness problem of weak solutions for fluid equations. And here the method involved is the comics integration, as mentioned by Jamuka, and often that's regarded Often, that's regarded such weak solutions constructed by complex integration are regarded non-physical. So I have to apologize, I'll be non-physical for my stop of time for this lecture. Okay, so I'll start by mentioning the very important work of Baker Master and Bait Po. And we go to us around this time. We considered the 3D Mary Stocks equation corresponding to this general form of alpha equal to 1 and we add a diffusion of both. So they construct unique or infinitely many. In the space in time, C0 or space H beta forms some small beta. So the regularity. So the regularity, the spatial regularity is a very small. Although that's the case, the result itself, it was a big breakthrough. So they used the method derivation and then the And then the development of Comex integration goes back all the way to an isometric embedding problem in geometry. So just a road map. And it was brought to the PDE assigned by the lovers, basically. To start here from geometry to the PD, the application is highly long-trivial. And in the very beginning, the development is mostly for only invasive. And then Bakumaski and Vico, they took it to the to Nemi stores. So now they can trade the They can change the equation with the dissipation. So here in those numbers. So each here error, it has a lot of contributions in the literature. So I want to tell you all the works here. That's the disadvantage of a given talk. But anyway, I just mentioned a very important point. Point. So, from Euler to Pinemi-Stokes equation, when you apply Comex integration, the diffusion is a big obstacle. This is the real reason they cannot get very high spatial regularity. And I explained very quickly why. So, the principle of convex integration is that Convex integrations that you start with the approximating solution of your equation and then you add a high frequency correction to approximation. Solutions, and you do this iteratively. So it means you have So it means you have to add higher and higher frequency to the approximation in the process. However, when you add high frequency, you know the lack of in frequency space I'm used to the harmonic analysis notion. So anyway, so that's the frequency corresponding to Laplace. So if you notice that it cannot If you notice that you cannot really treat the blood class as an error or perturbation, or at least not by too much. But the main ingredient here, they were actually able to include Laplace, although get very limited spatial regularities not here. Regularities that here they introduce this intermittency building blocks in their scheme. So that was kind of a big development in the comics integration scheme scheme. Okay, so this is For the Lemmi-Stokes equation without forcing. And this is what you can get for the wild solutions you construct. Another result I want to mention is the algorithm and column. So they look at the So they look at the 3D Memory Sox equation and with the forces, okay? And they are able to construct unique solutions means the solutions are in the space. space L infinity L2 L2 H1 so this is standard of priority space on every stock and also there is energy inequality okay so with the forcing this result of course it goes much further right so this regularity Right, so this regularity is far from very open regularity class. And the idea here, they also it's interesting that the method they use was inspired by the work of Riesuk for Euler, so for invent first Euler. So you can So to continue with the method, it's different from convex integration. I use an instability mechanism. And that comes from the TD Euler equivalent with the force. This is the market. Michelle Bishop. So now you wonder what did they do to extend such a method from 2D Euler to a 3D Nami-Stokes equation? They also treat the Laplace U as a perturbation. And so this is the one sort of perturbation. And also they arrange the domain. So from 2D to 3D, they use the vortex realm construction. So means they extend their 2D space to 3D. 2D space to 3D, so that's 2D, that's the third direction, and then they put their construction here very far from zero. So that's also can be thought as a perturbation in the space, in the geometric sense. So here I want to mention that when they go from inviscid oiler to nevistox, they treat this light vessel as They treat this love value as a perturbation. And that did not give them trouble. So they successfully applied this method for Euler to nemistox. But for convex integration, the block plus U is a very bad perturbation. That's a very difference, a big difference between the two models. A big difference between the two methods. So, here, next, I want to mention a result for a fluid equation called Hall MHD. So, it's magnetohydrodynamics with the Hall effect. Mix with the whole effect. If I just write out the equation quickly, you'll notice that there is some kind of a connection in a stoic. And of course incompressible here. Okay, so in this system if I don't have the if I don't have this term, I have the Euro MHD which has a lot of similar Lot of similar properties with the Navier Stokes equation. So it's a calculation of the Navier Stokes equation with the magnetic field equation. But this term, what is this? So here, this is the whole term. You might remember in this very general form, it's when the alpha equal to zero. Okay, so that's the whole term. And it's the most singular nominal. The most singular non-linear chart in this system. And for such a system, we can construct non-unique weak solutions and now in the space of L infinity, L2, L2, H1. This is This is the Larry Hook regularity class for the system, for the standard MHD and for this MHD with hook as well. So here we are able to construct solutions wild but with a higher regularity compared to the wild solutions for Navistok situation. But it was not a a big deal because here we really Here we really took advantage of this very similar term in the equation. So this one again is much simpler than a never-spokes nominal term or nominal structure. Okay, so this is one small result here. And one question we are very curious is whether it's possible. Whether it's possible to actually reproduce the APC result using COMEX integration. So, as I said earlier, both places, Laplace U treated as perturbation, but in one way that is okay, in another way it's not good enough. So, now I'm going to move on to fourth equations. And here I want to start with a simple result for Nautic models. So let me see it with the Susan. We are look at actually Daudic imaging model and with the four seven to give you just the season how it looks like and I'll just write it out. So dialogue models again there was a time it was very popular. There was a lab which was very popular and lots of important results were obtained for diatic models. So here, let's take the projections, little depending projections, uj2, or you can think of as the Fourier coefficients. That's okay too. We'll take uj as the momentum field. So ages, VGS are functions of time and only time. And we have the ODE system, it's implemented many dimensions. So here we have a parameter beta here. And for the magnetic field and that's time during the T. Okay, and for BJ, time drawer T file. Okay, so here this is a dietic model for MHD and we add a forceman to the velocity equation. So here we prove that we can construct when the beta is a parameter which Parameter which is related to intermittency dimension. I won't get into details how it's related, but it's related to the intermittency dimension. And here we show that when beta is greater than 2, we can construct non-unique hope solutions. Okay. And when beta is less than two, we have uniqueness. Two, we have unique roles of the rail. So here the ideas we construct sort of a discrete solve similar solutions that satisfy the BG equation. And then for whatever you construct there, you put it back to the first equation, to the AJ's, and then naturally you would get a force. Naturally, you would get a force in it. So that's why you get a force here. So the result you have is for the forced system. And here, this was not new. This was a result by So this was uh actually should have put it before I asked. So this was inspired by a result of new moth and cooking mothers. So I think it's about this time. So they actually first So they actually first construct landlining solutions for dialogic nerve stocks within forcing. So we what we did was based on the method the the impact The inventory. So, anyway, the point here is: I'm trying to understand the question. Can we actually apply convergence integration to forced equations and to get now you make it? Vietnam unique learn hope solutions like to recover the missing site okay and how to take the advantage of the forcing so at the moment like how to take it the answer is yes we of course we can apply convex integration to force equations but how to fully Equations, but how to fully take advantage of the four step? At the moment, I do not have a very good answer yet, so I'll show you. So, a general scheme say I'll use Mary Stokes equation as an example. So, for example, we have two solutions for the forced memory stokes. So, they are solutions 3D memory stokes, plus the forcing. And I'm going to take the sum of the Sum of the two and I want to take the difference of the two then this pair satisfy the equation and the pressure, now I use a pi to denote pressure. Hide in blood pressure okay, uh a small fact. A small fact. This looks like MHD, but it's not. There's a sign difference. Okay. So, anyway, so here for the PM system, there are forcing in each one in general. So, this system, say if you don't require here being zeros, you allow forcing in both equations, then the system's Then the system is very much relaxed. You can find a mutual pair such that U1 and U2 are not the same, but you don't require F1, F2 are the same, right? So you have this flexibility. And then you look at this forced system with forcing in both equations, and you think about what convex integration does. It reduces force, right? The iteration process of Canvax integration is to reduce the force or error, we call it, in the system. So for instance, the goal is that we apply convex integration to the M equation, and you try to reduce this force and the initial force if it's not zero, such that eventually. Such that eventually this one goes to zero. And then in the limiting process, you get a system Km with only forcing here goes back to the nemistocks, you get two distinct solutions with the same forcing. So that's just a very general scheme here, but how to actually But how to actually design this iteration process? How to make corrections for the M, for the P, such that you can actually treat the difficulty from the lock-wise. So that's a question we try to understand, but at the moment, we don't have a good answer. But nevertheless, we're able to get Nevertheless, we're able to get some small result here because of this flexibility of allowing forcing here in the equation. So let me just speak a result or application of this for SQG So we are look at say I'll start from the station. I'll start from the stationary SKG because there we don't have to deal with the temporal intermediency and I'll get there at a certain time. So stationary SQG with forcing. Okay, so we uh just uh apply the Comex integration to such a forced equation. Um Equation so that we write it out. I've seen this one in Januca's talk. Here we it's a stationary so we actually add a dissipation here to make it not that simple, but stupid. So we add this diffusion here, okay. And the U, it's the this transformer. So here the result we have on that with a student was quite recent. So we showed that we are able to construct non-unique or say non-trivial solutions in the space. Solutions in the space for theta. Okay, so if you have theta in the alpha with alpha less than a negative quarter, and the fourth is in C2 alpha minus one, and the four gamma in the range of uh two minus alpha, bigger than zero. Okay, so Okay, so this is the result with the force, but previously there is a result for stationary SQG without force sensor. That's why JMAN and I think it was around this time. Around this time. So they don't have forcing, okay? And without forcing, they construct a non-unique solutions in the C alpha are for less than a negative one-third, and also the gamma has to be here. Has to be here. So you see, the presence of the force, it does relax the equation a bit. So you are able to construct wild solutions with slightly higher regularity. Okay, so just a bit higher. And you might wonder why it's so low, right? And that is because SQG is very special. So now actually back to the Actually, back to the evolutionary head asking she. So, just as QG, okay, time-dependent without forcing. It was studied by McMaster. McMaster Steve Scholar and Wicko they so here no forcing okay so they prove that they can construct non-unique um are weak solutions in CR against for theta in CR for and are for less than negative fifth. So this was even for time dependent SQG it was quite low so the wild solutions the regularity is quite low Quite okay. I'll explain to you why, but I want to mention is that they give a different proof for this. So this was more recent. The same result, but different proof. So here they both apply comics integration. Here comics integration is at the level. At the level theta directly. But here it's a complex equation at the level of momentum equation, in particular, at this level. But this one, the presentation is much shorter. Okay, so now the reason why for SKG you can't get You can't get higher regularity. So, first of all, we might want to know for SQG what is the threshold or expected threshold, right? So for SQG, there are two quantities: conserved quantities. Quantities, conserved quantities in general. There is this so-called energy and there is an which is defined as theta negative theta negative la plus I'm always in the middle Theta La plus to negative half. To negative half theta. So that's Hamiltonian. For smooth solutions, both quantities are conserved. However, the rigorous proof for conservation for this energy has to be in the regularity space, in terms of visible space. It's B one-third regularity for energy. And the for Harmatonians will be. And the for Harmatonium will be zero. So here, those solutions, the wild solutions, they give you a non-uniqueness, but also they don't conserve either of them. So the expected threshold, say, for amatomines, it's zero here, say one-third, and this is really low. Okay, it's negative. So there's a gap here. And why is that? Because SQG has Because SKG has uh they have non-local operators very special. So the U is given by this T theta, and the T sub the operator here, it's a zero order. Here, it's a zero order and it's odd. Okay, so the T is odd. That is the obstacle for comics integration because here that gives you some consolations in the construction of comics integration. You have to move to higher. uh you have to move to a higher level of uh uh the the regularity for building blocks or in another word you lose derivative here okay however um that's a crucial point for the regularity uh for the positive side uh result Result. Regularity problem. So here, like more than a decade ago now, there is this regularity proof for critical SQG by different people using different methods. So here there's the work of the currently uh Alexis and there's also the And there's also the WorldCab massage and collaborators and also a slight more recently constant and they colour give a different proof. So they are all the methods are different, but this special structure Special structure is crucial in all of these proofs. So that's for the positive side. And of course, when we are trying to construct counter examples, that's difficult for us. Okay, um so now um we want to actually move on to something again. On to something again, not very physical. Say, okay, now we're going to apply this convex integration for the forced SQG. Say how much relaxation can we get by using the forced equation? So now it's the SQG with the force. Time dependent, okay? So we try to see how far we can go beyond here with a force in. So this is the So basically I just write out the entire equation. So here we don't need to include the dissipation to avoid being dissipated. So just consider invisit and with the forcing. The result is begins with the same student. The result is that for the first SQG, we can construct non-unique solutions in the regularity space. See alpha and alpha just lesser than zero. That's this one for the conservation of For the conservation of homotomy and the force and so here solution here and the forcing against one. So here we do actually see relaxation, okay, but uh uh we are able to reach this uh uh conservation threshold for homotopy, but For Hamiltonian, but for the energy one, still there is the gamma. Okay, but again, this is, you can see that it's kind of a bit artificial, maybe. So the real interesting question, of course, is for SQG without forcing. And just is there any room to improve the To improve this regularity for the wild solutions construct. And that's a project we are working on right now. So we can see that it's hopeful, but we agreed with the collaborators, we don't speak details, but it's a hopeful. So to improve this. Say, improve this alpha to at least get to the Hamiltonian conservation threshold zero. So it's a hopeful. And the new ingredients here is that we have to choose temporal intermittency or the time. You take into account the time, the one-dimensional time, and you play with. time and you play with the intermittency feature of time in the equation. And that was an idea. So here we use temporal intermittency and then that was originally used by Chessky Plaza. And a lot more for memory stocks. So they take advantage of the temporary intermittency in the gut by solutions for memory stocks which touch the touch the predispan criterion. And here we are using the And here we are using the same like idea and trying to actually at least make the gap close and closer for SHA, not forced. So hopefully I am able to speak about in detail in the near future, but now I just say it's hopeful. And in particular if we consider active scalar equation with even with an even operator. With an even operator here, we are very confident you can actually close the gap. But for SKG, we just it's hopeful for now. Okay, and so now I do have some time for the regularity. Oh, I don't, that clock is not right. Oh, one minute, then, yeah, okay, so the actual. Yeah, okay, so actually I don't. But I do want to mention some point in general form the Vt, so the whole equation. So here it has sort of a connection with the Euler. If you replace here by the current, the curl of wheel. The curl of B, then it's exactly Euler, but it's not. So, unfortunately, it's not. And that also makes this equation very interesting. In particular, the problem of singularity formation. So, we're able to do something for the reduced model, like dimension is 1D, but not for 2.5D or 3D. So, but anyway, I'm not going to speak it today. Today. And for this man uniquely, you can see there are still some open problems for those interesting fluid equations, in particular SQG or everything in between Euler and SQG. Or even below, so from SQG to the E average D. So there is a whole range and many things we don't know yet. Know yet. Okay, I'll stop here. Thank you.
