Thanks for committing to me this opportunity to give a talk here. My topic is the geoculture merits and all these Mikoski problems. So it's related to Mikoski problems. So first we see the background, is the definition of convex body. The definition of convex bodies. We have two types of convex bodies. The first one is the origin in the interior. The second type is a more general one. It's only contained the origin. The origin may on the boundary. So when the origin on the boundary is the structure is totally different. We have the unisphere, and for any convex bodies, we have some functions to describe the Functions to describe the convex body. There are basic definitions: the support function, radio function defined on the unit sphere. So, support function is a projection distance for any direction on the unit sphere. And radial function is radial distance on the direction u. And we also have the polar body corresponding for all uh conversible decay. Uh it's one-to-one uh relation. One-to-one related to each other. So for if k is with orange in exterior, we have its polar is also with orange exterior. And here we have its like this basic graph. So if u is this direction, so this projection, the support function is a radial function. So for any function u, locate your time so that the pole pulls to the origin or goes to the boundary. All goes to the boundary, that is from the original goes to the boundary. And we also have these graphs for the polar body. One case is a ball, the polar body is also a ball. And one case ellipsoid is probably ellipsoid. One case cube, so it's probably a coarse polyto. And for polygu continuous function, we also have corresponding corresponding convex body. So it's called a standard body. So in particular, the convex body case, the standard body of support function. So the graph is like this. So the standard body is intersection of the half space determined by the module continuous function f. So we go back to see this graph here. We see that Here, we see that for any boundary point, we have a hyperplane insect this point and with its own normal vector. So, there's a Gauss map from one boundary point from this other normal vector. So, that is for this boundary point, we find this out-normal vector. So, this Gauss map. So, the reverse Gauss map is that if we have offset on the unisphere, we can't find it. sphere we can find it or set the reverse cross map of this eta on the boundary which is a minus one dimensional. If we calculate the minus one dimensional mirror, the hostile mirror of this set, so we obtain the self-zero mirror of the eta. So they will have the mirror defined on this sphere. So in fact the surface So in fact the surface mirror act as the base of base on the direction U. The support function, the projection distance acts like the height of on a direction u. So integral on each direction obtains a volume, the basic function for convex volume. And for the radial functions like the polar coordinates to calculate the volume, so we have two systems of To a system of Brahmika theory. So, Brahmika theory and the dual Brahmika theory. So, support function, video function, two-base function. So, we have, so we know that mirror defines a unit sphere. So, one general question is how to characterize this mirror. So, this leads to the classical Minkowski problem. If we are given a general mirror, mu1 units. a general mirror mu on the unisphere. So on what condition for this mu can we reconstruct a convex body K whose subsidiary mirror is just this mu? So here the oranging is in the interior of this K. So for the system Minkowski problem all the oranging within the interior. So the solution is that the mu satisfies that Satisfies that the centroid, the centroid is at the origin and not constructed on the great hemisphere. If and only if the mu satisfies two conditions, we can reconstruct a convex body K. So we have, so this problem is originally solved by the this crack case, this polytop case. So this case is that this m mu have only finite support directions. We can find a polytop We can find a polytop such that the surface area mirror of the polytop is equal to the mirror mu, the finite directions. And the general mirror is solved by Alexander van Moffischer and Johnson. The discrete is solved by Mikoski. So the classic Mikoski problem have a lot of applications, can be used to establish the affine sublime quality. Uh for the LP extension can also have the LP affine sublimin quality. P of find some living equality, which is used by the solution of this Mikosky problem. So you can see that this formula, mu equal to SK, that's the equation. So we know the discrete case is that the boundary is very bad. So if the boundary is very good with smooth support function, so if there is we know all very we know the density We know the density of this mu, and we know the support. So, what condition for this F can we find or can we find or H satisfy this equation? This is a multi-app period type equation for this classical Mikovsky problem. So, the condition that μ is not concrete on any closed claim sphere is that for any direction V, the dark product of the U and V. Product of the U and V with a positive part integral with this mirror μ is strictly positive. So, this μ is not concentrated on any Colossians sphere. So, this condition necessarily to the classical Mikosky problem is tensions. So, LP, Mikhail, all its Mikoski problems. So, this is a very basic condition. So, from this part, we can see the left, the support is, we have four different. The support is we have four directions, U12U4. So this is not concrete on any close constitution sphere. However, on the right-hand side, we can see the support, if only have three directions concrete on the half-sphere. So the corresponding set is not closed. So this condition is necessary. So the non-homogeneous tension of the Mikoski problem is that. The Mikoski problem is that it's called always Mikoski problem. That we add one non-homogeneous positive function phi. This one variable case. This phi is straight positive. So under one condition for this mu and this new pyramid phi, can we find a complex body satisfy this equation? So here this phi. This equation. So here this feed related to the support function. So because it's related to the support function and non-homogeneous function, so this called all is mikazi problem. So when this phi equals to special homogeneous case, the t to the power 1 minus v with this parameter p, this recovers the LP-Mikovsky problem by Lutowak in 1993. And to solve this To solve this Alex-Mikosky problem, we have to find the convex body K, which is the optimization problem this formula. So with the volume spheres, and the parameters of mu and phi, so here this phi is related to this phi. So there is Find one complex body. So this comes body k is the integral is a minimum. And the origin and this O origin is in the integer of this k. So to solve this problem, one person says that that because to solve the optimization problem, we have to use a language multiplier. So the the derivative is used to solve. Is used to solve on the right hand side. It's related to the Euler's sum. So here is we give this original function and one perturbation function g. This g is arbitrary. So if we have this all these sum, we have this series of functions, parameters, if not, and we can construct this as central bodies. These are all three the politics. These are all three positives. So these are extended body with origin each year. You will take the derivative of the volume of the extended body of this all the sum. So we can obtain the right hand side, this called all the surface area. So when we take so so here we take the derivative, this side is mu, on the right hand side it says the surface area mirror. So that is mu equal to uh the right hand side. To the right-hand side. So there are a lot of people do created convulsions. So to talk about the delf mirrors, one important map, which is called the reverse radiography image, is very important. So when the origin is in in the interior and the origin in it also uh is on the boundaries, the for this map uh so have very uh different pieces. Okay. Different pieces. So we know that we know that for all direction vector u, e w times the radial map, radial function, so we compose this direction, goes to the boundary of this k, we compose it to the Gauss map, the auto-normal vector. So from u to the v, there to the inside direction vector goes to the outside normal vector, we construct this radio Gauss image. Radio Gauss image. So on the other hand, from this V to U, then from the outknome vector to the inside direction vector, this map is called the reverse radio Gauss image. Since the R n is in the interior, so it means for any direction, I can always find a point on the boundary of this k. So for this reverse radio Gauss image, I can always find a boundary point, I can always find the radio, the direction vector. The direction vector. So the general dual coverage matter is that because for all these cases we know we add one non-homogeneous parameter phi. So for the general dual coverage matter, we have two positive functions. One is one variable, g is the two variable. So this gt is two variable case. So it's the on the g is the So it's the on the general dual curvature mirror is also a mirror defined on the unisphere. So that is for any eta on the unit sphere, the general dual curvature mirror of this convex body K is this integral on the reverse gauss map of this eta. So this integral is very important. So this mirror, this newly defined mirror has very good properties. The first one is that it's the Borrer mirror. Barrier metal and it's also weakly converging to the hostile metric for this ki. If we have sequence Ki is converging to K. So this related to this general curvature of Ki is weakly converging to the general curvature of K. Another thing is that this general curvature mirror is not concrete on any closed gamma sphere, just like the surface theory mirror. Just like the surface area mirror. So, this is also based on the last property. This general duality profit mirror is actually continuous to SK to the surface area mirror. So, if our G and C satisfy certain conditions, we can see that the K and the G and 2 complex matter is 1 to 1. This is the matter under the complex body. So this parallel derivative for G is a positive case G and C satisfy this condition, but negative with just reverse inequality. So to characterize this generally olives curve mirror just like the surface area mirror, so that is we propose the general dual olise-Mikosky problem. And one conditions for these three parameters, mirror mu. parameters mirror mu and two variable function g and one variable function phi can find of comma body k here is always orange in the terior satisfy this equation so when this g we have several cases when this g is equal to this integral this phi is an unvariable case we have the general dualis mikowski problem and when this when this is equal to phi of t When this is equal to phi of t, here is one variable case. We have our one variable case. In fact, we do just the other way around. So when these parameters, TCT is equal to with a parameter and C equal to the parameter with Q and V, we recovered the CPQ. There is a homogeneous case, which is the Lu Hua Nian Zhang's work in 2019. 292. And especially, this also contains the Mikonski problem, and all these Mikonski in fact, also LT Mikonski problem, if we choose appropriate parameter for T G T and C. And if we choose this parameter, T G T equal to 1, C equal to T to the power P, this recovers the Alexander problem, the RP case. So it means up to now, this curvature mirror. Up to now, this curvature mirror contained surface mirror, LP surface mirror, and Alexander integral curvature, LP integral Alexander LP integral, LP Alexander integral curvature. In fact, I just see there's this is also contains all its all its case of this Alexander cur uh problem case. So the corresponding Mount Gamper type equation is that if we know the density, so it's also if we know the density for this mu, so and we have this convex body case where we put a boundary, the smooth boundary, so we can have the corresponding support function h, and we have the parameter dn plus c. So the dn plus c is just respect to this. Yeah, C is just respect to this C, with this P. So we have the Munger type equation. To solve the general dualism, Mikoski problem is equivalent. So we have to there are some methods that are using this Mongolia type equation. So one thing I mentioned that here, we just see that Lu and Lu use the curvature flow method. So this is non-homogeneous. Law method, so this is not homogeneous to all the problem. So, similar to the variational formula of the eyes of body of the Ellis sum of the Euli sum to derive the surface area mirror, only subsequent mirror. Here we also have the instead of the original uh volume, we have the general dual volume. The early star is the same. The earliest time is the same. We take the derivative of this general dual volume. We derive the integral, integral respect to the general dual cover mirror. So this is like the derivative for the volume. So in spectral case, here, in fact, in spectral case, when this g equal to 1 over t to the power n, we also obtain the right hand side, the soft zero mirror here. So this also includes So the uh this also includes the special case of the n-dimensional general duality corn mass integral, one-dimensional and homogeneous case and the volume. So this all take derivative goes back to the series of curvature mirrors, homogeneous and non-homogeneous case. So first we have the when this G with the power derivative is decreasing, we have the conditions, we found the condition for three parameters, mu g and st. Parameter μG and C. And under these conditions, we can find a convex body with origin here that satisfies this equation. So for mu, it's not contributing any closed frame sphere because although this is a dual coffee chain mirror, however, it's actually continuous to the surface area matter. So for G, this is one part. This is when the power divergence is negative and satisfied t goes to 0, this integral infinity. T go to infinity, this integral is 0. So for C satisfies this integral infinity. And especially, when we go, we have a special case of the homogeneous case by J. So the main step is that we need to solve this optimization problem with the generative volume fix. With the general volume fixed to be a constant, okay with only integer and satisfy this target integral with the parameter mu and g, the restricted condition with parameter g. So based on the restricted condition, if we have a sequence of ki, which goes to the 0 frame of the integral, so this ki must be, the polar body of this ki must be formally bounded. So if it's not Bounded. So if it's not uniformly bonded, so this Ki, if there is a sequence of Ki was go to infinity, the right-hand side is a constant, so it's a contradiction. So this is the baseline condition for G, we can find a sequence which forms bounded. So by Black Sea's Laction theorem, we can find a sub-sequence which is convergent to the polar body of K0. And but we don't know whether it's the origins in the interior or not. So we have to, based on the condition for this mu and phi, in this formula, if the origin is not in the integer of this k0, so this part also blow up based on condition mu and phi. So next step use the variational formula. That is take derivative on left hand side of t mu. On the left-hand side, obtain mu, on the right-hand side, is the curvature mirror. The perturbation function is arbitrary, so you can see that this equation holds. So, this was origin in the interior case, this optimization problem. So, for the origin not in the interior, at least on the boundary, so we first extend our three, our functions phi and g to contain the end point zero. Contain the end point zero. And the general view curvature mirror, so now the right hand side for this case, in a more general case, so this reverse radio gauss map of this E for any E on the unisphere now, E is original, only for E is not reasonable. So we have to minus the normal column. So that is for this model. So uh that is for this more general case and the integral uh more general case and uh when we move the normal colon, so this new general uh oli-curved mirror satisfies similar properties uh as its originator. It's absolutely conlinear to surface their mirror and weakly convergence and so on. So, what is the normal column? So, if so we can So if so we can see here the convex body, if this orange is on the boundary, so normal cone is all, is a cone of elements y satisfy the dark product of x, y or less than 0 for all x in k. So from this picture we can see that this part is normal cone. And the support colon is the dual colon of the normal cone. So this is what So this is for any X in Rn, the dot product less than 0 for all Y in the normal coin. So this support coin is just the smallest coin contain our K here. So you can see here on the right hand side, we can see that if U is outside this support is outside this support colon, the radio function on the outside are O0. And so the reverse, in fact the reverse radio gauss image of this E moves this normal colon, so this all goes back to this left hand side of this case. So we find this boundary point, boundary point on this on the left side and we can find this due to On the left side, and we can find its direction vector. That is that if the origin in the interior, we can find for this u, we can find its boundary point, we can find the inside direction vector, the reverse radio goes map. However, for this one if u is in the normal colon, this uh radial function goes to zero. So the boundary point is zero. We can't find the direction vector. So we have to move this part. Okay. Have to move this part. The main method for this case, we talk about when the G and C are increasing and this more general definition that is removed. This nomenclature case is different to the decreasing case for the optimization problem with a general volume fixed to find the targeting group parameter v and mu. V and mu. So this proof is based on approximation. So we first solved the discrete matter. For any matter, we can find these matters weakly converging to this mu. And for this discrete matter, we can find a polytop with the origin here, which is a solution of the general due curvature mirror. So then we use approximation. So approximation here, this k is a solution related to the general mirror. Related to the general male, but we can't guarantee the origin in it here. So this origin male on the boundary. So when the DSL case, we only have finite directions, we only need to solve this multivariable optimization problem, this m direction. So that's we construct. So original we give us that m with a parameter, this lambda is just mu. This phi is the parameter. So Uh the parameter. So we restricted uh the condition instead of the original generative volume with parameter g. So here we restricted the condition of mu and phi. And we want to find the target integral that with the generative volume of this quarter. All these kinds of here. So we assume that because the because our phi are continuous, so this set is continuous. So this set is a compact set. Generative volume is a so this so this F is a compact set. So this maximum value must exist because continuous function on our compact set. We have the maximum value. So we assume this as a P0. So it's just here this is P0. However, because our solution is Because our solution is that we want to show for this discrete case origin mass in the interior. So we give by contradiction, if the origin is on the boundary of this P0, that's assumed maximum, we can move, we have these two directions, the scale function zero. So we can move a little where what we move is based on the this. based on the reconstruct with parameter phi here. So that is we first for this original polytop we give a transaction for this P1 and then add another part. So we will find this P2 and this P2 is still in the domain that is in the ZM. However, we calculate this P2 and P1, this part of the generative volume. This part of the generative volume is more than this part based on the parameter G and this phi we construct it here. So this is strict strict larger than the we assume the maximum based on the condition origin on the boundary. So it means that for this case origin mass in the interior. And uh the the the main point is this height. We have to construct this uh uh this head phi with uh This height phi with our parameter. So the dissequent solution is that when μ with m directions and g satisfies, this is the increasing case and the condition for 3 is here. So we can find a polytope. So polytope satisfy this. We can find satisfy this. So by approximation, we find that the general solution that we give we find the tau and separate on the left and right hand side. So considering mu to be discrete have the advantages to construct counter example of the original interior. And with special case screens, And with Spanish case goes back to Borsky and Folder's result. And we also have the even case. So when for even, the merit is even, and we have to be the paradigmity respect to U is symmetric. And so we can find a symmetric convex body. So for here, the only inner tier is much easier because it's symmetric. So we only need to show Show only to show that it's four-dimensional, the interior is not empty. So that's four of my thank you. Questions?
