The next speaker is Jacob Fox. So off you go, Jacob. Okay, great. You can all hear me well? Great. Okay. So I'm going to be giving a talk on clique minors and graphs with a forbidden subgraph. This is being This is being live streamed from my bedroom, given the current circumstances. So please bear with me on this. So this is the online edition of this talk and conference. I want to thank the organizers for putting this together on short notice. And hopefully we don't have too many technical difficulties. Okay, great. Okay, great. So, as we saw in Luke's talk earlier, there's been some progress recently around Hadrigger's conjecture and finding large clique minors under certain circumstances. With a forbidden subgraph, we'll show that we can get a much bigger clique minor than what we normally should expect from Hadwiger's conjecture. So, Hadwiger's conjecture is this. Conjecture is this famous conjecture, it's very old, says that every graph with no KT minor is T minus one colorable. And there has been over the last almost 80 years a lot of work toward this says Hayosh. I apologize, it's supposed to say Hadriger. So this is Hadriger's conjecture, not Hayosh's. This is Hadrigger's conjecture, not Hayosch's conjecture. Every graph with no kt minor is t minus one colorable. Hadeger's conjecture was shown by Wagner in the case t equals five to be equivalent to the four color theorem. So it's going to be a hard thing to prove. And a well-known result of Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas, which is quite difficult. Thomas, which is quite difficult, is that Hadberger's conjecture also holds for t equals 6. So we know it for some small values. One approach to getting large clique minors in a graph is through average degree. So if we're trying to show that a graph of chromatic number chi of g has a large clique minor, we can start by observing that every graph G has a subgraph. G has a subgraph of minimum degree, at least chi of g minus one. And so therefore, there's going to be a subgraph of large minimum degree and therefore of large average degree. And what does average degree tell us? Well, there's a well-known result of Sasha Kostochka and Andrew Thomason from the 1980s that every graph with no KT minor has average. KT minor has average degree at most big O of t times root log T. So if the average degree is D, you get a clique minor of size at least some constant times D divided by root log D. And this is best possible up to the constant factor. The constant factor even is understood by work later of Thomason. To see that it's tied up to a constant factor, Bolobosh cat. Bolobosh, Catlin, and Erdős gave the following example about 40 years ago. If you consider the Erdős-Ranny random graph, Gn1/2, that's the graph on n vertices where every edge is picked with probability of half independently of the other edges, it almost surely has average degree around n over 2, and the clique minor number will be asymptotically n divided by root log n. And so this shows that the Kostochka-Thomason result is tight. Stochka-Thomason result is tight. And this is an exercise in random graphs to show this. Now, up until recently, very recently, this was the best we knew how to do to get a large clique minor given the chromatic number of a graph. So if we have a graph of chromatic number k, we know it has to have a clique minor of size at least, k divided by root log k. By root log k by this work of Kostochka and Thomason, and this was the best we knew. And then very recently, Sergei Norin and San they proved that a better result. If G is KT minor free, then the chromatic number is at most t times log t to the 0.354, which is an exponent smaller than a half, which we got before from the Kostochka-Thomasin. Before from the Kostochka-Thomasin result. And as Luke explained in his talk, he pushed it even further to the constant and the exponent to a quarter. And so this is the state of the art toward Haveger's conjecture in this form. Okay, so a general thing is that it's helpful to get a large average degree subgraph because then you can get a large clique. Graph because then you can get a large clique minor in a graph. So that's a very general useful tool. This result of Konstochka and Thomason to get large clique minors, you just have to present a large average degree minor of your graph. And up to this root log t factor, this is a very useful tool. Okay, what about instead of chromatic number, we look at independence number? So if we have a graph G with n vertical. Have a graph g with n vertices, independence number alpha, and clique minor number h, Hadrigger's conjecture. So, the clique minor number is the size of the largest clique, which is a minor of our graph. Hadriger's conjecture implies G contains a clique minor of order n divided by alpha because the chromatic number is at least n divided by alpha. This conjecture, we're a little. This conjecture, we're a little bit closer to in some sense than Haveger's conjecture. So it's still open. This is still open whether a graph on n vertices and independence number alpha necessarily contains a clique minor of order n over alpha, but Duchet and Meniel proved almost 40 years ago that it's correct up to a factor of a half. So they get a click minor of not n over alpha, but n over 2 alpha minus 1. And over the years, there's been a lot of progress toward improving this bound. There were many follow-up works over the years, which improved on the constant there. Improved on the constant there. And during my PhD, I improved on the constant factor. This was the first improvement on the constant factor. So instead of a half, we get something slightly bigger than a half. And then soon after, Balog and Kostochka had a follow-up work. Had a follow-up work pushing on these techniques and got a better constant. There's both of these works that improve the constant factor use a result of Sasha Ovetsky-Fratkin. She proved that the clique minor number is going to be at least n over alpha if g is an induced claw-free graph. So if your graph has no induced clause, Has no induced clause, then it's going to have a large clique minor, the size guarantee that we would get guaranteed by Hadwiger's conjecture. And so both of these results really rely on this and plus you some additional ideas. Pushing this constant to above two-thirds runs into a serious difficulty already because of the case alpha equals two. And this is a problem I learned about from Paul. A problem I learned about from Paul Seymour when I was a graduate student. It's a question that's attributed to Paul and Paul Seymour and Wolfgang Mater. Is there an epsilon greater than zero such that every graph on n vertices with independence number two contains a kt minor with t at least a third plus epsilon times n. It's very simple to show. It's a nice exercise to show that you'll get a kt minor with To show that you'll get a kt minor with t being n over 3, and pushing it to any constant bigger than a third is very hard, it seems. Of course, Habiger's conjecture would imply that you should have a KT minor of order n over 2. So it's surprising that we're fairly stuck here. And what Paul Seymour told me when I was a student is that this would be a good place to look for possible counter. A good place to look for possible counterexamples of Hadrigger's conjecture. Look at the case of independence number two graphs. And I completely agree with him. I think this is a great place to be looking if there is such a counterexample. And improving on earlier results in this line of work, when I was a student, I proved a bound. So there were earlier results of Duchet-Menial. So, there were earlier results of Duchet-Meniel, Plumer, Steve, Toft, Ferretti, Geyerfosch, and Simoni, and then Blasiak. The best current known bound for this problem is that we're going to have a KT minor with T at least n over 3 plus some lower order term, which is some constant times n to the 4 fifths times log to the 1 5th times n. So, this is not answering this question, but this is the best we know at this time. Okay. Okay. Okay, so this is what happens in general. And in this talk, we want to talk about what happens if we have a forbidden subgraph. For example, what if the graph is triangle-free? Can we get a better bound? So let G be a graph on n vertices with independence number alpha. There's a There's work of Kunanosthis and Krivilevich and Sudikov, which implies the following. If G has a forbidden bipartite subgraph H, and here H is a fixed graph, bipartite graph, then G contains a KT minor with T bigger than some C times N over alpha to the 1 plus C, where C is some constant depending on H, which is greater than 0. So instead of getting N over alpha, we get a power bigger than 1 here. Bigger than one here. Jacob. Yes. This is not an induced subgraph, right? This is just a subgraph. That's right. So here, this is all as a subgraph and not necessarily induced. And their work is a bit stronger. It refers in terms of the degree of a minor. So they get a large average degree minor. Degree minor in their work. Okay, more recently, Dvorak and Yapremium, answering a question of Sergei Noreen, showed that if G is triangle-free, then G contains a KT minor with T at least the same sort of bound where C times N over alpha to the one plus C. So they get this extra constant in the Extra constant in the exponent. And their C is roughly 1 over 26, the exponent they get in their work. We're going to show a simpler proof of this later, where we're going to get the exponent to be anything smaller than a quarter will work for this result. And they asked: do we get a similar power improvement over what Hadwiger's conjecture? Over what Hadberger's conjecture implies for H-free graphs for any H. So we know for triangles and bipartite graphs from the previous work. And the main result I want to tell you about is that the answer is yes, we do get such a power improvement. And this is joint work with Matia Buchik and Benny Sudakov. Matia is Benny's student at Eteha. He's a Eteha. He's a brilliant graduate student, and I'm sure you'll see his name more in the future. So the result says that for every graph H, there is some C only depending on H, such that the following holds. So C is positive. Every H-free graph with N vertices and independence number alpha contains a KT minor with T at least C times N over alpha to the 1 plus C. times n over alpha to the one plus c. And here, importantly, H free is as a subgraph, not necessarily induced. So we're forbidding H as a subgraph. And so it suffices to assume that H is a clique on, say, S vertices. So in the case that H is a clique on S vertices and S is at least three. And s is at least 3, we may take the exponent in the proof to be 1 over 10s minus 2. And it's easy to use random graphs to show that this is tight up to an absolute constant factor, that the best possible exponent is going to be look of a similar form. So the constant C is tight up to, and the exponent is tight up to an absolute constant factor. So this is the main result. So, this is the main result I want to tell you about. And I want to tell you about the proof ideas. We're going to make a simplifying assumption that H is a triangle, and then I'm going to tell you how to get around this idea without full details because it's a bit involved. Okay, so what's our general strategy here? Strategy here. So, a general strategy for finding large average degree minors. We start off with a graph G, and then we're going to color independently every vertex of G red with probability P and blue otherwise. So it's going to be blue with probability P 1 minus P. So every vertex either gets a color red or blue in this setup. Then we're going to delete. Then we're going to delete the blue vertices with no red neighbors. Each remaining blue vertex, so they each have a red neighbor, picks one of its red neighbors uniformly at random. For each red vertex v, we're going to contract the edges of the star centered at V with blue leaves that picked V. And we're going to let this. And we're going to let this random minor of our graph that we just constructed call, we're going to call it MgP. So this is a random minor of our original graph G. And I want to, before getting to this lemma, I want to try to draw for you what this is doing. So we have We have our graph, and then some vertices in our graph will be with probability P, they'll be picked to be red. So I drew three red vertices. There's going to be some vertices potentially that are blue that don't have any red neighbor, and some vertices that are blue might have. Vertices that are blue might have more than one red neighbor or have one red neighbor. And for each of the blue vertices, it's going to pick one of its red neighbors. And then we're going to make a star for each blue vertex that picked a red neighbor. We have for that red vertex, we pick all those edges where the blue vertex picked it. So here's. So here's a drawing of this. Okay, and then we're going to contract all of these stars. So in this example, we have three stars and we're going to contract them. And And we'll see what minor we get in the end. Now, how are we going to get edges in this random minor? Well, if there's an edge between two blue vertices from different stars, like this one here, between these two blue vertices, then when we contract those stars, we would get an edge in the random. In the random minor, we so here's another example where this edge here, we would get an edge in the minor. Notice that this corresponds to a path of length three, so three edges between two red vertices. And the internal vertices are going to be blue. So if this is a vertex V that's colored red. A vertex v that's colored red, and this is a vertex u that's colored red, and this is x and y, then the path u, x, y, v gives rise to an edge in a random minor. Okay? And as a lemma, if p is between 4 over d and a half, and the maximum degree of our original graph is at most d, the probability that a three-path The probability that a three-path uxyv gives an edge of the minor is at least some constant times d to the minus two. And the way to see this is that u and v will each have probability p independently of each other, that they're colored red. So that gives us a probability p squared that u and v are both red. There's a probability of 1 minus p for each of x and y that they're colored blue. Colored blue. And then with high probability, with some very good probability, X and Y won't have too many red neighbors, at most, say, 2 times P times D red neighbors each. And so there'll be at least a probability 1 over P times D all squared, probability that X picks U and Y picks V. And y picks v. And then we get an edge between the stars centered at u and v in our random minor. So that's what this lemma says, and it's not difficult to show. And I sort of sketched the idea for the proof of this. What are you doing about parallel edges? So that's the part I'm about to get to. Is that the real challenge in this problem is that these paths of Is that these paths of length three? There could be a lot of them. And so we can't simply just add this up over the three paths. We have to be very careful to bound that it doesn't happen too often between our stars that we get many of these three paths. So this is the whole challenge in this argument is doing. This argument is doing this. So, what we end up doing is we pick a collection of three paths which have some nice properties, and then we can use those to bound these probabilities. So, we're going to look at the expected average degree a little bit more carefully using the fact that the graph is triangle-free that we're going to use later. So, in this setup, the graph G we have is not necessarily triangle-free. This is just an arbitrary setup. Triangle-free. This is just an arbitrary strategy, but to actually analyze it and get good results, we're going to use the fact that neighborhoods of vertices are independent sets. And then I'll explain how to get around this issue for general h free graphs. Is this okay? Okay. Great question. Okay. So this is the general strategy. This is the general strategy. The next slide, which is also fairly dense, discusses the proof for triangle-free graphs. And so we'll go over that shortly. So that it's going to be entirely in the next slide. There's a few claims that require proof that we'll go through briefly, but won't go in full detail. Okay. So. So, what's our setup? We have a triangle-free graph G with n vertices and independence number alpha. And our goal is to show G contains a KT minor with T being much bigger than N over alpha, N over alpha to the five quarters minus little O1. Okay? So here's a very useful definition that's going to come up in the proof. Going to come up in the proof. G is our independent set expanding if, whenever we have an independent set S, the neighborhood of S is at least R times larger. So the number of vertices that are adjacent to this, at least one vertex in the independent set is at least R times larger. So that's it. That is, we have an independent set at S, so empty. And then this was supposed This was supposed to be r times bigger. We have n of s here, which is much larger. Okay. Okay, so we're going to make a couple simplifying assumptions which we can make. The first assumption is that the maximum degree of the graph is at most big O of t root log t. So we're trying to get a t, a k t. Trying to get a t, a kt minor. If half the vertices in the graph have at least a constant, a big constant times t root log t edges coming out of them, their degree is at least some big constant times t root log t, then the graph has enough edges that already the result of Kostochka and Thomason implies that we have a Kt minor. So we can throw away these at most half of the number of vertices and get that the maximum degree is not too large. Maximum degree is not too large. So we still have at least n over 2 of our vertices that we started with. So that's the first simplifying assumption that we can make. The second simplifying assumption is that G is R independent set expanding with R being omega of N over alpha. And here, this constant we can pick in the omega could be, we can pick to be a quarter. And that would be good enough. And the reason is if we have an independent set that violates. Independent set that violates this R-independent set expanding condition, we can pull that independent set and its neighborhood out of the graph and continue pulling these things out until there's no more. And we have to stop after with still a constant fraction of our vertices remaining because. remaining because otherwise we would have picked, we would have built an independent set of size alpha through pulling out these independent sets and deleting their neighborhood. So these independent sets we pulled out would amount to at least alpha vertices that make an independent, more than alpha vertices that would make an independent set. So we can assume this is our independent set expanding. So we have a max degree the condition and we have this expansion condition which is quite useful. Quite useful. Okay, one of the things that this independent set expanding condition already implies is that the minimum degree of this graph is at least r. And that's because every vertex is itself an independent set. And so therefore it has to have at least r neighbors. So we know that the delta of g now we can assume is at least r, the minimum degree. The minimum degree. Okay, so now from each vertex V in our graph, we're going to build a set of three paths as follows. And let me write a few things down below. You don't need to look at those yet. Let's see how we're going to do this. So I'm going to explain out loud what we're going to do. Out loud, what we're going to do, we have a vertex v and we're going to build a bunch of three paths that end at v as follows. We're going to call this p of v. So v has a neighborhood, n of v. And because the minimum degree is at least r, there's going to be at least r vertices in this neighborhood. Okay, now. Okay, now we also have a second neighborhood and two of V, a vertices of distance two from V. Now, here we're using the, we're going to use the fact that G is triangle free. So we know the neighborhood of V is an independent set. So N of V is an independent set. And then because of its R independent expanding, we know that this has more than R squared. Than our squared vertices inside the second neighborhood. So this is a lot larger than the first neighborhood. And for each vertex x from the second neighborhood, we're going to pick only one of its neighbors in N of V. And so when we do this, we'll get that between N of V and N. Between N of V and N2 of V, we have a star forest with centers in N of V. Okay, so that's what our, and we're about to build these paths from V that are of length three. So we still only went out to the second neighborhood. Now for any vertex that's That's for which there's a path of length three to V. We're going to look and so we'll call that N3 of V. We're going to pick for each vertex Y for which so Y has a star coming from N of V to N 2 of V. From n of v to n two of v, for each vertex u in the second neighborhood, we'll pick exactly one, if there is one, edge to the star, the leaves of the star centered at Y. So we'll pick exactly one of those. And this would give us a path UX Y V, which is going to be a path. V, which is going to be a path of P V. Okay. So is it clear how we're constructing these paths? Does anybody have any questions about this? So if your vertex V had another neighbor on the left that belonged to the second star that you've drawn, you'd pick another edge for it as well? You're wondering if there's edges inside N2 of V? No. Okay. You said for each, for the You said for each, for the vertex V, you pick an edge to each vertex Y, if there is one, to the neighbors of each vertex Y that you can. So for each vertex U, for which there's this path of length 3, we look at that, so it'll have a neighbor in the second neighborhood. You look for each star centered at a vertex in n of v, so like you look at y, and y has this star. And why has the star, and you'll only pick one of the edges from you to the leaves of the star. There may be many. You pick one for each possible star? For each possible star. So for some stars, there may be none, but for each possible star, there's at least you'll pick exactly one. Yes. Okay. And then using the fact that The fact that we have this R-independent set expanding, we know that these stars that we get out of vertices from N of V, these are independent sets. So we'll get at least the size of the number of leaves times our vertices in N3 of V, for which we can pick an edge to. And in total, the number of paths we constructed is at least a Paths we constructed is at least a constant times r cubed in doing this. So when we add up over everything, we get at least a constant times r cubed and that come from any given vertex v in this way. And in particular, we're only going to pick r vertices from n of v to work with so that we it'll that'll be helpful later. So we're not going to use all of n of v. Remember, n of v is somewhere between r and Somewhere between r and d because the minimum degree is at least r and the maximum degree is at most this little d. And we'll only pick r of those vertices to build these paths in n of v. And in total, we'll get at least a constant times r cubed of these paths. Okay, another thing to observe is based on how we picked these paths that each u only picked one edge to these stars centered. Edge to the stars centered in n of v that the middle edges of the path, those middle edges being of the form xy, for any given vertex u, the middle edges of the three paths, of the set of three paths, PvU, so those are the three paths in Pv that begin at V and end at U. They form a matching between N of V and N to V. Between N of V and N2 of V. So, what we have in this graph between N of V and N2 of V in general was a star forest with centers in N of V. But if we pick a U, these paths that contain U form a matching, and that's a helpful fact. And the next claim, which is not, is elementary, but is a bit more subtle and require some very And requires some very careful conditioning is that if we pick p to be square root of r divided by d, then the probability that pbu activates, which means that there's going to be an edge xy, so that u and v both are red, and there's going to be an edge between the stars centered at u and v. That's what we mean by PVU activates. That probability. That probability is going to be large, at least the size of PVU divided by d squared. And this is not simply adding up the probability for each edge. This is some very careful conditioning on the coloring of red and blues, and then arguing related to that. So I'm not going to go into the full details of that. It's not too hard, but it does take about a half of a page to do. Does take about a half of a page to do that and to do that carefully. So I'm not going to cover that given the length of this talk. And what we get in the end is that the expected average degree of this minor we make, well, the total number of edges. So when we add up the number of edges we expect based on these sizes of the PVUs, when we add them all up, because there's going, we're going to get R cubed n of these, the sum of the PVs that we get, the size of the PVs, if we sum it up. And each of the, based on adding these all up, we get r cubed over times n over d squared, expected number of edges we get in this random minor. Now, the number of vertices we expect is very simple. It's p times n. It's just the number of red vertices, and it's going to be highly concentrated around p. Going to be highly concentrated around p times n. And so, if you're careful with this argument, you'll end up getting that the average degree of MGP will be, through concentration, at least the total number of edges we expect divided by the number of vertices. And this will be bigger than some constant times t root log t, which then by the result of Kostochka and Thomason implies that we have a kt minor. So, the key claim here that we didn't go into full detail is this line here. But it's all elementary. It's simple, but it's just careful, very careful conditioning. Are there any questions about this argument for triangle-free graphs? Okay, so this works nicely for triangle-free graphs. How do we make this idea work for general graphs? Well, it is harder, but the key thing was this independent set expanding idea. And it's not the case that neighborhoods are independent sets if we are a general H-free graph. However, we do know. We do know that at least half the vertices of the neighborhood can be covered by a small number of disjoint independent sets, given the so using off-diagonal Ramsey's theorem, we get that the neighborhood can be covered by a relatively small number of independent sets compared to the degree. And we use And we use that instead of using up the whole neighborhoods in a dependent set. And then, some very careful argument allows us to extend this proof in that case. So, the key thing is that independent sets expand and that we have these big independent sets that cover most of any neighborhood if we forbid a subgraph. So, we're applying Ramsey's theorem inside these neighborhoods. These neighborhoods, and that works for general H-free graphs. Okay, so to finish, I wanted to mention a couple of open problems that come from this work, unless there's any questions about this. Yeah, sorry, Jacob, it's me again. Paul, would you say that again about how you do general graphs instead of triangles? I didn't really understand. Yeah, so in triangles, when you look at the neighborhood. So, in triangles, when you look at the neighborhood of a vertex, it's an independent set. And say a vertex has degree D, we get one independent set. If we know that the graph is H-free for some fixed H, we're going to not get one independent set, but we're going to get D to the one minus some epsilon, where epsilon is some constant depending on H, independent sets which cover half of the vertices of the neighborhood. Of the vertices of the neighborhood. And we're saving on the trivial bound of D here. And you can then cut up essentially the neighborhood, throw out half the vertices in this sort of argument, and very carefully do an analysis that works. So there's some points here in this argument for triangle three that you have to very carefully extend. It's not the most trivial thing here, but it does work. This idea works. It does work. This idea works that you take the random minor and you're cutting up the neighborhood into these sets and carefully expanding into these using these independent sets inside the neighborhood. Does that clarify the question? Yes, thank you. To some degree. Okay, great. So let me quickly finish with a couple open problems. One question, now that we know that we can get this power improvement, is what is the best power improvement we can get? The best power improvement we can get. We showed for triangles in this talk a quarter as an exponent that we can improve on. And we don't know what the right exponent is. And for general H, we don't know. We know it up to an absolute constant factor. And we think it's an interesting question to estimate this better. Another nice question is: for which H? Is for which h does there exist a c such that every h-free graph of chromatic number k contains a kt minor with t at least c times k to the one plus c. So you can ask the same question for extending Hadriger's conjecture for H-free graphs and trying to get an improvement. There's a positive answer to this question. If H is bipartite, by this argument, the result I mentioned earlier of Kunostis and Krivalevich Sudakov, there were Their work implies that you get a power improvement for this problem if H is bipartite graph. However, it's not true if H is triangle, if H is a triangle. So Dvorak and Karubayashi showed that there are triangle-free graphs with no KT minor and chromatic number larger than T minus 2 over 2. So you can't gain a power. So, you can't gain a power improvement for triangle-free graphs. At most, you'll be able to get a constant factor at most by their example. And so, we think it's an interesting question to characterize for which graphs do you get a power improvement. For example, if H is C5, do you get a power improvement? We haven't really explored this yet. This work with Buchuk and Matika. And Matia Buchik and Beni Sudikov was very recent. And so we haven't had that much time to look further. We think this is an interesting question to explore. And I've run out of time. So I'll finish by saying thank you. All right, thank you very much. Are there any questions? Questions? Yeah, let me ask. Jacob, you mentioned the result on when alpha equals two, and this was your old result. And was that published at all or not? Yes, that was published. That was in the same paper as this other result. This other result. So, this paper from 2010 contains both that constant factor improvement. And then a later section includes the result that I mentioned from here. So this is from 2010. And it's a paper called, I think it's called Click Miners an Independence Number or something along these lines. There's several results in there, and it's only And it's only a small improvement on the work of Blasiac. Blasiac's result gives the same bound except the log one-fifth n power. So we came up with the same argument, but I came up with it afterwards. And then I realized how to add an additional twist that gave this logarithmic factor. So the earlier results had a lower exponent than four-fifths, these earlier results. Forfeits these earlier results. Okay, thank you. All right, thank you. Any other questions? All right. So thank you again. Great. Thanks, everybody.
