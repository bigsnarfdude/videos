So, well, thank you for giving me this chance to talk. And I'm going to talk about the scattering of vorticity into sound at a leading edge. Now, the distinctive feature of this talk is that it includes a fluid flow. So, it's not just a problem with a single wave speed, the speed of sound, there's also another flow. There is also another flow speed, another speed, which is the speed of flow. And these give a very different character to the types of problems that you have to address and solve. And that's what I'm going to talk about today. So I think this is a very good audience because, with the advanced mathematics you have already, even though probably most of you haven't looked at such problems before, I think there'd be a great deal of scope for new work. And I'm very pleased that my New work, and I'm very pleased that my talks come after Ben's talk earlier in the week because his work gave a very, very good introduction to what I'm going to talk about. So, what I'll do first of all is show you a schematic diagram of an aircraft engine. And the prototype problem is that you have a fluid flow past an object, which here, in particular, is the aircraft engine, and it's rotating. Aircraft engine and its rotating fan blades. And within that flow, you have guss or turbulence, which is just what we saw in Ben's diagram yesterday, where we saw a diagram of an aerofoil with turbulence and guss being convected towards the leading edge. Now, Ben was talking primarily about the noise from the trailing edge, but also there is also very great noise from the leading edge when the gust strikes it, and that's what I'm going to talk about today. I'm going to talk about today. And in fact, the leading edge is a very, very potent source of sound when it's struck by a gust. Now, I'm going to look at a particular idealized problem which corresponds to the leading edge of a blade. So, what I thought I'd do is I might be able to indicate it most readily by using a kind of props here. So, let's imagine. Props here. So let's imagine that this is an aircraft, part of an aircraft blade, and this is the leading edge. So we have flow coming in. I'm going to take the simplified case where the blade itself is flat and at no angle of attack. So it's just sitting there in the flow. And we're going to ignore viscosity. So in that base case, absolutely nothing happens. There's a flow coming in, it's parallel to the blade itself. Parallel to the blade itself, and it just passes the leading edge, and absolutely nothing happens. But now we consider what happens when there is a gust or any vorticity in the fluid flow that's coming towards the leading edge. So let's imagine my fist is some localized area of vorticity. And I'll come back to that in a moment. That what counts is the vorticity, the swirling aspect in the flow. And what's basic here is that vorticity. And what's basic here is that vorticity is convected with the flow, as an object that moves with the mean flow. And that's a matter of common observation because if you're in a boat and the flow is going past you relative to the boat, if you stick a paddle in, you'll see a vortex simply swirling along that the blade has generated. So, absolutely basic fact that vorticity is convected with the flow. So, in the flow, this This region of vorticity comes in and it strikes the leading edge. Now, as soon as it is convected past the blade, you can see it's blocked. And because it's blocked, that produces sound. So the blockage gives you a boundary value problem in which the boundary values for the wave propagation, the acoustic wave propagation, are the negative of the blocked velocity. Negative of the blocked velocity that's been striking the blade itself. Now, there's a very, very surprising fact about noise generation by a leading edge in the linear theory. And that is, you might imagine that as this gust is convected past, there'd be a kind of convected source of sound moving along the blade. But in fact, all the sound in the linear theory is generated at the leading edge. Now, this is very At the leading edge. Now, this is a very, very surprising fact, but it emerges in a direct way from the mathematical analysis. So, that means when this gust comes along and strikes the leading edge, it is only the leading edge that produces sound. And you can see this in a Schlieren photographs. You see the sound coming off with convected wavefronts with their centers at the leading edge itself. Now, there's an Edge itself. Now, there's another feature of this problem which is very, very different from scattering problems of a sound wave into a different directive, differently directed sound. And that is that vorticity is localized and it has sharp edges. So if we imagine this is my, this fist then is the vorticity. There's a finite width here in this band direction. So it's only a certain finite part. Certain finite part of the span which is cut by the vorticity. So the actual source region is bounded here. So when you do the exact mathematical problem for the linear theory, the sources are in a bounded region of the leading edge. And that has no real analogy with the acoustic problem or any elastic problem, because then the wave coming in. Coming in, it simply does not have a sharp edge. And what's more, because the vorticity has sharp edges, there are certain fundamental problems which are exact and are basic to the general solution. So, one is the following: I can imagine the vorticity as localized in a sheet. So, let's imagine now that this sheet of This sheet of paper represents a kind of infinitely thin layer of upwash. So, within this sheet, this is the region, just the region where there's flow coming up. And then, when this sheet then it strikes this leading edge here and it goes by, as it were, the source is at a single point. So, there's a canonical problem here where the source region is just a single point on the leading edge. On the leading edge. And then, if you can solve that problem by integration, you can solve a more general problem. And another canonical problem you can solve is if you think of upwash as being convected, being in this plane, you can imagine a sinusoidal upwash. You can imagine kind of up here, down here, up here, with a sinusoidal variation of velocity. So you can consider a canonical problem then, where in this span direction, if this says. If this say was Z, you could consider delta of Z as being the read describing the region where you have the sources, and then you could multiply that by a convected sound wave. So you can see you get a whole family here of very basic canonical problems involving delta functions, sine waves, and various other combinations. And also, you can have a very sudden start. Have a very sudden starting point, our very sudden finishing point. So, just to mention one more canonical problem, you can have a jet. So, within this mean flow, you can imagine an upwash field, which is just within a very narrow cylinder. So, this flow coming up there. And then that flow then is convected past here. And then, if you think of this as having infinitely thin radius, then you only have a point. Then you only have a point source for an instant of time. So that gives you another kind of canonical problem where the source is localized both in space and time. So what I want to emphasize then, there are these fundamental problems to be solved, which have no relation whatever to the kind of problems you would get in the scattering of an elastic wave or a sound wave. And these are very, very A sound wave, and these are very, very important in aeroacoustics, and they've been looked at for many years. But what I did some years ago, I tackled very directly these canonical problems, because you'll appreciate in the engineering world, there are more practical concerns at any given time. And then the luxury of tackling the fully canonical problems, which are idealized, will naturally often fall to other people. So let's just press on then. Let's just press on then. So, really, I'm just said there, that's everything I've just said. So, really, what a basic fact is there are two fundamental speeds. There's the wave speed and the incident sound speed. Now, I've just made a couple of other points here. You might wonder what is, if you have, say, a point source here, what is the essential nature of the sound field? Well, we know about monopoles, dipoles, and... Know about monopoles, dipoles, and quadrupoles. Well, when you do the mathematical analysis, what you find is that, in effect, it's a one and a half pole. That's just how it comes out of the analysis. Now, you think of that as relating to an angular aspect of the field, but it also has a very profound effect on the scaling of the amplitude. And there is a very definite scaling law between the amplitude of the sound produced by a gust and the incidence. And the incident sound speed as measured by the Mach number. And the scaling law is that for subsonic flow, the acoustic pressure that's radiated is m to the 3 over 2. Now, that might mean very little to you if you don't work in aeroacoustics, but what that means in fact is that is a very, very loud noise because the actual magnitude of the noise is greatest for a monopole, it's less for a dipole and less still for a quadrupole. And less still for a quadrupole. And within that scheme, a one and a half pole between the monopole and the dipole is very, very noisy. So, this m to the three over two, really, that's why it's so important in real air acoustics to have a full analysis of this vortex scattering problem. So, that's the underlying motivation for the subject. Well, I'll just say something about the solution of the problem. In the subsonic case, you have to use. In the subsonic case, you have to use the best method to solve it is Vene-Hof, and I've just introduced some coordinate systems there. We obviously need both the original Cartesian system and the polar system to describe the propagation away from a point. And the main thing to remember is X is the stream direction and Z is the span direction as used by Ben yesterday. And I'm going to Y, I'm going to call that the vertical direction. Ben called it the blade normal. Ben called it the blade normal direction, but I'll think of that as the vertical direction. And that's just what I've shown you already with the notation put in. Now, if I was going to derive all this, I would simply present you with the analysis of VNOC, but we all know that already. So what I'm going to do is simply give you the answer for one of the canonical problems. So let's just look at that up wash. I've given the upwash as delta Z over A. Wash as delta z over a times the that exponential function. So that is this example. This is the example where this is the blade, the flow's coming in this way. The delta z over a means the upwash is confined just to the single plane here. Z is zero. And it's a sign that exponential. That means in here, it's a kind of oscillating upwash. And that strikes this leading edge. So you need to solve the problem. What you solve. Solve the problem? Well, you solve it by Wienerhof, and what is the answer? Well, you get a completely definite analytical answer, which I obtained some years ago. And I think this was the first time this had been spelt out. And as you might imagine, the answer involves a contour integral involving a complex angle. So there is the answer. The answer is pressure. It involves all these quantities at the beginning, which are just parameters of the problem. And you'll see there's m to the. The problem, and you'll see there's m to the three oh three over two. You'll see there's these angular factors cos half phi bar and sine half theta. Now, I should say something about this problem because there's a mean flow, there's mach factors everywhere, like root one minus m squared. So it's very convenient to change the variables to put bars. So behind the scenes here, with those angles, there are Doppler factors involving powers of one minus m squared. So we have. minus m squared. So we have this one over root r bar there as a spreading factor. And what's really important is there's this quantity E1 at the end, which is a contour integral involving R bar, which is the distance from this wetted point on the blade, and it involves an angle, a theta bar and m bar. So this is the final Is the final answer involving a contour integral involving chi, and I call this e1 an exlet function, so that's a kind of irreducible function that you come down to when you solve the problem. So now the big question is, what does that integral look like? Well, there's a topological structure to that because you'll see we've got root one plus m sine chi at the bottom there, so it's periodic. At the bottom, there, so it's periodic in chi with period 2π, and you have branch points. So, if you put it in the chi plane, um, then that would be on the right. You get a diagram like that, which repeats at intervals. That's the basic period there. So, that gives you the Riemann structure there with the two branch points, with branch points here. But what you can do, because that's periodic, you can wrap it round, and what you actually find. And what you actually find is that the basic Riemann surface done in a more transparent way has this form here. This is in the complex angle where you have a kind of doughnut in the middle with two cylinders coming out at either side. And what I've done there is I've on this doughnut with the two cylinders, I've simply labelled it with various special points and lines. Special points and lines, and the wavy lines there correspond to the branch lines when I put it in this planar representation, where you'd have one surface on top of the other in the plane. Now, of course, once you've got that integral E1, you can work out the far-field approximation. And that is the answer. Now, I should say there, when I originally tackled this problem, there was a matter of enormous interest to me where I simply did not know the answer. Me, where I simply did not know the answer, and I felt the only way I could find the answer was actually to do the calculation. So, let me tell you what these factors are. You'll see that the solution to this problem, the wave field, is very, very anisotropic in that there are two special directions. You have the flow field coming in this way. So, one special direction is just the downstream direction of the flow, which is within the blade. But the other special direction. But the other special direction is along the leading edge, either way. And there was one question that I was very much wanted to know the answer to: what is the nature of the field along the leading edge? Because once the acoustic field is generated, it's purely acoustic. So you have an acoustic field propagating along the leading edge. So something is going to be a little bit different there, even involving the power of R. So what. So, what was the field like in that direction along near the leading edge? Well, I had absolutely no idea. The only way I felt I could get any answer was to solve the problem. And there it is, you see, in these two terms here, you'll see that when you're going along the leading edge, that corresponds actually to theta bar being zero or pi. So, along the leading edge, this you've all This um, you've all you're left there's a sine theta here in the denominator, so perhaps not quite clear from the way I've written it, but along the leading edge, the only term you have is this term with the sine theta cancelled out because this first term multiplied by sine theta has vanished. So, what you actually find is that along the leading edge, the decay rate is more rapid. So, in particular, that means you do not get a trapped wave propagating along. A trapped wave propagating along the edge. And once you know the answer, the explanation is obvious. Although it's a kind of singular line, it's also a kind of pressure release. So if you have high pressure underneath and low pressure on top, that will tend to be relieved by the fluid flowing around. So this gives a definite answer to what the field is along the direction of the leading edge. Now, that's very, very important for the following reason, and this relates to a Reason, and this relates to a topic which Rafal and I have discussed many times, but not yet got to the stage of doing any work. But let's just discuss it a little bit further, also without doing any work. Now let's now let's suppose that this is the actual blade of finite span. So this is the actual blade, the fluids flowing this way, and this is the, you know, the port left and right of the blade here. Now, I said. Here. Now, I said that for the problem we're looking at, the sound generation is only at a single point. So you then have a sound field propagating along the edge. But of course, when it reaches the end, this corner, it will then be scattered. So you have a problem here of sound scattering of a field going along the leading edge, hitting the corner, and then being scattered. Now, what's distinctive about this problem is the field propagating. The field propagating along the leading edge is exact. See, this integral I wrote down E1 gives you exactly within the linear theory a propagating acoustic wave along an edge. And then the way that field is scattered is of basic importance to the directivity of the overall sound field. Now, I mentioned that there's a more rapid decay of the sound, but in reality, you see, with an aircraft wing or a blade, this this... Aircraft wing or a blade, this distance is not very great, so there might not be all that much attenuation before you've got to the corner. So, this canonical sound field of a conical of a corner problem is potentially of very great interest because you have an exact formula for the incident sound field being scattered by a corner. So, how much longer have I got? About five minutes? Okay, thank you, yes. Okay, thank you. Yes. Now, all I've done there is give you the answers. So, let me say just a little bit about how one obtains the answer by Vener Hawk. So, there is the aeroacoustic equation. Hang on, let's go back a bit. You'll see that it's just like the ordinary wave equation, but instead of d by dt here, you've got d by dt plus u d by dx squared. And in fact, in Ben's talk, we saw a factor in, and that just A factor in, and that just corresponds exactly to terms which come from this u d by dx. Now, on the right, you can imagine there being a source which will have a certain spectrum in just ordinary Fourier space. And likewise, the solution here has a spectrum. So, schematically, as we've all seen many, many times before, schematically in Fourier space, the spectrum of phi is just the spectrum of the source term divided by. Term divided by the what I've written as a dispersion relation, okay, just arising from a denominator. Now, the point here is that because we're doing a Vener Hof arising from a half plane, this function d has a slightly different structure from most other dispersion curves. And the point here is that in the original problem, there's an edge, and perhaps surprisingly, when you're in Fourier space, When you're in Fourier space, there's an edge. So if you look here, you'll see, oops, sorry, you'll see that we have an ellipse here, which is to be expected. There's a plane here among, this is in KLM space, wave number space. There's also a plane here just corresponding to the flow itself at speed u. But what you also find is that there is this half a cylinder. This half a cylinder which is tangential to this ellipse, and this has an edge. Now, as it happens, we've seen something a bit like this in earlier talks, especially in Andre's yesterday, where we had a kind of section of this and we saw with what we saw was a circle with some tangents coming towards it, but only going as far as contact point, and then no more tangent beyond that. So, this actually is quite a close. So, this actually is quite a close resemblance, in my opinion, to what we've seen in other talks by Andrei Khorkov. Well, I've just made a few general remarks there. Oh, that particular surface, that is derived actually in an EUTAM paper, which is a conference organized by David and others in 2000. So, that actually is written up in the EUTAM proceedings. And I've said it. Proceedings, and I've said here just what I've just said. It's similar to a diagram we see in Andre Shannon's work, as well as Andre, who's here. So, I probably a point where I could stop pretty soon. I'm stop anywhere now, probably, but let me just show you something. Let me just go forwards. There's another singular case where it's now instantaneous in the x direction, and you just get other integrals. So, this is similar, but you get a slightly different form here. But you get a slightly different form here. And this is now time domain. So, what you have to do is integrate over the omega. In the previous case, omega was fixed, and we had E1. And the great advantage of having this E1 as a standard function is that you can then solve time domain problems where you have E1 here, and this is what you multiply. And I did some of these integrals exactly. And yeah, with that integral I just showed you, you can do various deformations, and you can write it in this. Deformations, and you can write it in this form here, and that's more natural for numerical integration. And then I did a number of examples that what you find is once you start considering the various combinations, you find there's nine possible combinations because you can have various shapes, top hat, Gaussian, or sinusoidal, and that can be either in the streamwise direction or cross-hair. So there's nine canonical problems. And in those days, I was a good boy, I did some. those days I was a good boy, I did some work and I do every single one and they're all published. But I should say I made a very bad error in the titles of the papers. I'll just, oh, I should say as well, you can do this for the supersonic case, but then you don't need Vener Hoff. That's a very interesting point. And I had a research student, Chris Powell, very, very able, and he did all the cases for the supersonic case, though the answers look very different. And this is the, you get very, very interesting results. You get very, very interesting results, do all analytically, and you can plot it. So, these were some plots that Chris Powers produced as part of his thesis, and they're published. He was a slow writer up, so in the end, I had to write the blooming stuff for him. But it came out in 2019, I think. But I wanted it to appear in print. And I've just said, oh, this is a highly idealized problem, but there are many, many people who tackle realistic problems, especially a group at Cambridge. So, for example, Lorna A. So, for example, Lorna Ayton and Nigel Peake, they do much more advanced analyses where they do a proper analysis of what's happening near the leading edge, where it's not really a flat plate. It has a non-zero radius of curvature, and you get all sorts of transition regions. And for the trailing edge, obviously there was a trailing edge noise that we heard about yesterday. But in addition, you see any noise can propagate here and be scattered, and you get all sorts. Be scattered, and you get all sorts of transition regions. And this normally requires a change to different variables to make it a canonical problem. So, I think I'm just about done there. And I've given some references here. And I just, oh, there's more I won't say. But I've given some references here regarding the papers. If you want to look at these canonical solutions, they're in those three papers, 2003, 2004, 2007. 2004, 2007, but the second two, unfortunately, I didn't put trail leading-edge noise in the title, which was a mistake. And then there are polls. So, in those five papers, you'll see lots of canonical solutions all worked out in great detail. And then there are these more general papers relating to other people's works and also to Zun Huang's works, which is actually closely related to this as well. So, that's where I'll stop. So, thank you very much. That's where I'll stop. So, thank you very much for that. Thank you. Thank you very much, John. Yeah, okay. Very, very interesting talk. We have now time for questions, please. Oh, okay. Thank you, John. So, what experimental work is there about the corner singularity and the scattering into found radiation? Because you alluded to its importance, but we don't know how big it is. We don't know how big it is. The actual corner problem. Well, the corner problem in general has been looked at, but not from this point of view. It is very important. But the point about this problem is that you can consider a particular case exactly with a known incident field coming from the vorticity itself. You see, a great deal of the existing work for corners is simply about an incident sound field being. Incident sound field being scattered, and that's very, very important. Massive stuff, lots of experts on that here. But the incident field, you see, is then a plane wave. In real life, where you have the vorticity coming in and it's sound produced by that vorticity, which is propagating towards the corner, what actually happens in that case? And I don't think there's anything known explicitly about that. Certainly not exactly. There are many, many approximate methods, but Many approximate methods, but most of them involve an approximation of unknown accuracy. It's very hard, though. I mean, I don't underestimate the difficulty of it, but you've suggested it's important. Oh, I see, I see, yeah. Yeah, all right. You've got to give a greater justification for that. I'd like to answer a question from David. Actually, in aerocoustics, there are many experiments about this one. So, usually, in any chamber, and we place Usually in any chamber, and we placed an airfoil in the in the wind tunnel and placed a turbulence grid. So we are going to design different types of turbulence grid to induce different turbulence and vorticity in front of the airfoil. And then use the camera microphone array. So it's also being known as acoustic camera. And then the results actually we can see that the noise source are dominant at the leading edge. So maybe John, just Uh, maybe John just mentioned that this you can see it, yeah, yeah. We can see the wave noise source located at uh at the leading edge, yeah, yeah. We can see a line, so all this noise source acted as a line at the leading edge. Yeah, in fact, that's very interesting personally, because many years ago, I did see such a photograph taken by a German group. I happened to come across it, and like you say, I could see the wave fronts coming off the lead. And before that, I never really believed it. I thought it was some rough and ready approximation. Some rough and ready approximation, a kind of bodge. But once you see the wavefronts and you can see they're convected, they're spherical, because once they're in this uniform field, they're just convected as expanding spheres. And you can see that they're centered on the leading edge, which is amazing. So it's amazing how accurate this theory is, even though it's linear.
