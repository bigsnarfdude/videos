Thank you very much to the organizers for allowing me to give this talk today. I will talk about the joint work with Sergei and Pavel. And well, Sergei has largely announced it before, so I hope it didn't create too much expectation. I feel the stress now. But it's very nice to see many of our friends and colleagues here around. So it's good to see you. So it's good to see you, everyone. So, okay, I will not give you very many examples because we provided many of these examples in the paper, which is on the archives. So, let me first give you an outline of what is going to happen. So, you know, there exists an invariance of three manifolds. One is called, well, Sergei called it CGP. I will try to. I will try to call it NR, and another invariant is Z hat. He talked about it. And we conjecture that there is a relation between the two. They both are defined by surgery on invariance of links in the sphere. For the NR, you use the ADO polynomials and basically you do some Basically, you do some linear combination of those to get the invariance of three manifolds, and for the Z hats, you use rather the series F L or F K Sege already talked about. So what I will try to do is to first recall the definition of the ADO polynomials and of F L and state some conjectures which relate the two. Then I will pass to the three minutes. Then I will pass to the three-manifold invariants, talk about the definition of NR and of Z hat, and then state the conjecture which relates them. And in the last part of the talk, I will really be speculative. I mean, I don't have a concrete result to state, but some constructions which seem to hint at a possible extension of this relation between The relation between the NR invariant and Z hat also at the level of a TQFT because NR exists. I mean, the TQFT for NR does exist. It was called BCGP TQFT in Sege's talk. And the TQFT for ZHAT, well, doesn't exist yet, but of course, one would hope it does. Okay, so I should. Okay, so I should recall what ADO polynomial is. So, in order to do that, I should tell you that it is defined via the standard machinery of quantum groups. But actually, with a slight difference with respect to the very standard one, namely, we consider in all the talk, I will consider a fix an integer r greater than. I fix an integer r greater than or equal to two, and I will consider psi to be a root of unity of order two r. There it is. And we let u psi SL2 big H to be the so-called unrolled version of quantum SL2, which is basically the standard quantum SL2 you know. The first line just tells you that, at Q being this root of unity, but there is also. But there is also some new generator, one new generator, which is called big H, which is morally the logarithm of K. So indeed, it commutes with K and it commutes with E and F exactly as in the standard SL2. And of course, this thing is not just an algebra, it's a Hopf algebra, and here I'm providing explicitly the full structure. Now, this thing has a nice category of modules. Of modules, namely, I shall call the finite, I shall look at the category C of finite-dimensional weight modules. By weight modules, I mean that H, the new generator, acts diagonally on those modules. So it's a requirement I impose. And I consider the modules on which ER, FR, and K minus C power H act as zero. So this last condition is exactly. So, this last condition is exactly imposing what I was saying informally. I was saying that k should act as the exponential of h, and now I formalize this on the level of the category. And why one looks at this category is because it is a ribbon category. This was basically proved by Otsuki and well, and reproved in many other papers. So, you might guess that when you have a ribbon category, you can use it to build invariants of links in the sphere. So, let's have a look, a closer look at what are the objects of this category. There is a full list of the simple modules and of the projective modules of this category, namely there are the SIs, which are the standard simple modules you would think of. Standard simple modules you would think of, namely they are highest weight, simple modules, where highest weight i, the dimension is i plus one. And actually, I only consider the s i for i going from zero to r minus one, not the remaining ones, because actually it turns out that they still exist those modules you would call s i for bigger i, but they are no longer simple at the root of unity. So I'm making for you the list of simple modules. Making for you the list of simple modules. The second class of more interesting modules at the remote ability here is those which we call V alpha. V alpha, now alpha is any complex number. Actually, not exactly any. You should avoid integer numbers which are not multiple of r. So multiple of r are still okay. These are still highest weight modules of highest weight. Um, of highest weight alpha plus r minus one. So basically, this alpha, so and the dimension is r. So basically, this alpha is exactly the middle weight, not the highest weight of those modules. And these are simple modules, and it turns out that they are projective. And well, I should mention that here, this notation is redundant for some modules, namely, the module which is called V0 in this list is actually the same. V0 in this list is actually the same as the module which is called SR minus one in the previous list. And actually, this module is a remarkable one. It's called the Steinberg module or sometimes Cache F module because it's used in the formulation of the Cache F volume conjecture. There is also another family of simple modules which are just one-dimensional. One-dimensional. They will not show up in this talk very much, but just for completeness, let me mention them because they actually play an important role in theory. They are one-dimensional. So E and F act as zero. And H acts as a multiple of R on those modules. And of course, K acts as Q power H. So these modules are basically all the simple modules. Actually, I should add in this list all the tensor product of these guys with these guys. Product of these guys with these guys, but that's it. And then, if you want to know what are the projective modules, basically, these guys are projectives. I already said that. The typical modules are projectives. And then you should add the projective covers of those SIs. We call them PIs. And they are basically two R-dimensional modules. I will not use them today, just in order to give you a full picture of the category here. Give you a full picture of the category here. So, one thing you remark here is that the category is graded, and this is something which was shown in Sergei's slide. You have a category C and you can consider all the modules where the weight is alpha, a complex number alpha. Actually, this is not properly said because the complex number alpha is the middle weight of those V. Middle weight of those V alphas, for instance. But if you act by E or F, the weight changes by two or minus two. So actually what is well defined is the weight modulo two. So as it's a complex number, modulo twice the integers as an abelian group. And then if you look at this, now this is really a grading for your category. It is graded by C modulo 2z. And it turns out that And it turns out that the subcategories, the full subcategories, whose degree is a complex number, which is not zero nor one, modulo two, are simple. I mean, they contain just finitely many simple objects, actually R of them. And they are all of this form. So they are very easy to grasp, those categories. And then there are the singular parts, which are the C, Z. Which are the C0 and C1. So, considering the modules where the weights are congruent to zero or congruent to one module two, and this part is where the non-semi-simplicity of the category C is mainly sitting. And it contains all those SIs, all the projectives, PIs, and so on and so on. So, in a sense, this category is pretty much semi-simple, except for some singularities. Now, it turns out that the category is a very simple Um, now it turns out that this category is endowed with what Gere and Patiromiron defined to be a modified trace. So the ideal of projective modules of the category, which I already described, is endowed, can be endowed with a trace. A trace is basically a way of associating to any endomorphism of any projective module a number. A number and this way should have good properties. Sorry, I have a question for you guys. Do we have 30 minutes or 45 minutes? Just to make sure. Actually, neither. You have 50 minutes plus 10 minutes questions. Okay, fine, because in one program I read 30 minutes and I was confused. Fine, perfect. Okay, so this function should enjoy some properties. One is cyclicity, which is the thing you would expect from a trace. And it's written here, so I didn't even draw anything about it. The second property is what is called the right trace, a partial trace property. And let me maybe draw some picture. Draw some picture, it means basically that if you that if you again that if you have a morphism from P tensor V to itself, you can consider the trace of this guy, the partial trace, the full trace of this, or you might decide to first partially. Partially trace and consider then the partial trace and the modified trace of the morphism, the endomorphism of P you would get by operating the partial trace. And the requirement is that the two procedures will give you the same invariant. Okay, so that's what is written here. That's what is written here, and then you have a similar condition on the left. Here, I closed on the right, I think I closed on the left, and you have a similar condition on the left. So, it turns out it's a theorem by Nathan and Bertrand that such a trace, it does exist on the projective ideal, on the idea of projective objects, and actually turns out to be unique up to a scholar. In particular, when you apply the trace to the identity endomorphism, To the identity endomorphism, you get a number which is called the modified quantum dimension of the module. So, what is it good for? Well, it is good to define the idea of polynomials. The idea is that if you have a link, a framed-oriented link L in the sphere, you might try to do just the standard construction in the Rashstick interrupt theory. Rescue-in-time theory. Just take the Reschkitt interrupt functor and compute the endomorphism of the empty of C, the empty object in the category. And it will turn out to be zero as soon as your link is colored by those typical modules V alpha, because it turns out that the standard quantum dimension of the V alphas is zero. So that's a bad news that the standard machinery doesn't work, but actually. It doesn't work, but actually, a modification of it, which is not that difficult, does work. Namely, you cut open L on one strand of one of those components of the link, you call it L prime, and you cut it open, you make it in a longer knot form or longer link, I should say. And so you get a one-one tangle. And now, suppose that your link is followed by some V alphas, then the Rashstick interval functor applies. Rashtikin Tural functor applied to this tangle provides morphism from V alpha 1 to V alpha 1, let's say if you opened up the component number 1. Now, V alpha 1 being a simple module, this thing is going to be a scalar by Schurz Lemma, and well, which I know tastes this way. Now, you would like to say, okay, this color is an invariant of L. Well, it's not on the nose. Well, it's not on the nose in general, because if you cut open along a different component, you will get a different number a priori. But it turns out, and that's a theorem, that if you multiply this L prime by the modified dimension of V alpha 1, which by the way, I didn't provide explicitly, here it is. So it's, as you see, it's a very nice Meromorphic function of alpha one, which has poles at in. Which has poles at integers. Actually, it has poles at all integers except the multiples of R. Now, if you multiply by this function, then what you get turns out not to depend on where you cut. So it's an invariant of your framed-oriented colored link. This invariant is basically what is called the Akutsu-Deguchi Otsuki polynomial ADO. Well, I say it's basically because it's not exactly, it does contain some framing dependence. In the original paper, there was no such thing. But the framing dependence is not an important part of the invariant. Indeed, it can be completely destroyed if you just renormalize or multiply your invariant by this factor. Lk here is the linking matrix of the link, yes. And alpha here, it's And alpha here, it's a vector of the alpha i's. So it's just a that's just a quadratic form in the colors. And so up to dividing by this factor, what you get is a Laurent polynomial in some variables xi, which are, you can think of the xi as just xi power alpha j or two alpha j here. So here you see the dependence. Here you see the dependence was on complex parameters, but actually it turns out that you have a single polynomial governing all the results, and it does depend this way on the complex parameters. So it turns out that, for instance, when r is 2, this invariant is actually known as the convey, it's actually the conway polynomial. Conway polynomial up to again change a variable and renormalizing correctly in order to drop this dependence on the framing and changing the variable suitably. So for r equals two, you get the convoy polynomial. This is the reason why June Murakami, who is one of the people who mainly worked on this invariant and defined it, called it the generalized Alexander polynomial or caller Alexander polynomial. Alexander polynomial or colored Alexander polynomial. Because basically, for r equals two, you get back the convoy polynomial, and for our bigger r, you do get a more general thing, the ADO invariant. Oh, one thing I didn't mention is that because of this factor, actually in general, it is a polynomial for a link. As soon as you have two components or more, it is a polynomial. Components or more, it is a polynomial. If you have a not because of this factor which has poles, turns out that it's not a polynomial, it has just a denominator of this form. But magically, in a sense, well, it can be proved, of course, when you have more than one component, actually, this denominator disappears. It simplifies. So it is indeed a Laurent polynomial. This phenomenon is very reminiscent. This phenomenon is very reminiscent of a similar phenomenon for the Cohenweight polynomial, by the way. So, on the other side of the story, there is this FK invariant of which Sege already talked about. And it was defined in the, well, here I'm citing in a sparse way many people who collaborated to define those invariants. And by the way, I realized that I didn't write the name of Kumbrumbafa, and my apologies on this. And I'm not sure. On this, and I'm not sure. I'm definitely sure I'm not completing this list of people I'm naming. My apologies. So basically, for physical reasons, there is an expectation that there should be an invariant called Z hat for three manifolds with values in formal power series. This was Segier's previous talk. In particular, in the case of knots in the sphere, this invariance should manifest itself by Variance should manifest itself by the existence of a suitable series. And this conjecture is basically taken from the paper by Manolescu and Gukov. The series should look like this. So given a knot, it should be a two-parameter series, X and Q, with values in this ring. Now, these are just shift factors, but besides this shift factor, which I will basically disregard everywhere, you see the series should be bound. The series should be bounded in powers of q inverse and now and not necessarily bounded in powers of q and form a power series in x and x inverse. And well the series should be a Borel resumation basically of the loop expansion of the Jones Kohler-Jones polynomial. So you know that from Rosansky's work, there should exist a way A way of writing the Jones polynomial, Corolla-Jones polynomial in a compact form this way. And the conjecture is that if you Borel resume this stuff, you get this series where Q, sorry, here's cut, sorry, Q is e power h and x is e power nh in this correspondence. But actually, this is not. But actually, this is not the conjecture which I'm interested in for today's talk. Rather, there is a second relation which is a conjecture again. And it is expected that this very same series should have the following property. If you take the limit when Q goes to psi square, psi is the root of unity I fixed from the beginning of the talk. If you take this limit, then you should see appearing the ADO polynomial at that root of unity, of course, or ADOR, I should say. Course, so ADOR, I should say, of the knot evaluated in the variable x over xi and divided by the Alexander polynomial of the knot in x power r. Furthermore, this series should satisfy a suitable recursion relation, which is given by the quantum A polynomial of the not K. Now, this conjecture, actually, I want to mention one, I want to make some advertisements. One, I want to make some advertisements for a student of mine and of Bertrand Patyroz, Sonny Willet, who will defend his PhD thesis in December. And he proved basically this conjecture, except that he proved it for a different invariant, in a sense. So he basically showed that there exists an invariant which I would like to call Fk, but this invariant does not live in what I said before, does not live in. Live in what I said before, does not live in this ring. It does live in a suitable completion of the Laurent polynomial. Sorry, it's a typo, it should be Laurent polynomials in X and Q, in a suitable completion of this ring. And this ring is such that you can actually set Q, you don't have to talk about limits, you can actually set Q to be a root of unity. And if you do, and you look at that invariant he defines, then you And he defines, then you do really get this. And he can also prove that his version of the invariant does satisfy these recursion relations. By the way, this existence of these recursions for the ideopolynomals was also proved by Nathan, Gere and Tudor Dimofte and collaborators last year. So this actually So, this is actually just an advertisement for Sony's paper, but it's actually not, I'm not going to use anything of these results in today's talk. It turns out that all I said in these two slides was about not, and it's not randomly so. It turns out that for links, the story is much harder. The problem is here in this denominator. Indeed, you know, the Alexander polynomial of a naught is non-zero. Is non-zero, uh, is never zero, but for a link it can be zero. Actually, the natural candidate for a link there should be the Conway polynomial, but the Conway polynomial of a link can be zero. So you cannot just state these conjectures as is for a link. So we came up with a conjecture. I must confess that, well, it's a conjecture. I'm not sure it's the good one. How does it How does it look like? Well, for a frame link, there should exist a non-zero FOMO power series as before. Now you have, of course, n variables, one per component of the link, besides the Q. And the conjecture is that when you tend, let's q tend, go to the root of unity, thus this series divided by the series in the variables power r. In the variables power r should go to the ideal polynomial. That's what's written in the box, although it doesn't look so. Let me explain so what I mean. Here, first of all, forget for a moment this limit when t goes to one and forget this ft. Then here you see just the limit when q goes to root infinity of your series divided by the same series, except that in the variable the x i's are not just x i's they are Just x i's, they are q power alpha i's and in the denominator the x i's are q power r alpha i's so they are power r if q is going to e to pi i over r, then q r is going to one. So actually, in this thing, it's well we do not expect that on the nose such a limit when q knows such a limit when Q goes to root to infinity will exist. So we expect that if you T regularize this series, then you can talk about this limit. More precisely, we expect by T regularizing, I mean that in the series you replace each occurrence of xi power n by t times q power alpha i and the inverse powers of xi by t power q power minus alpha. T power q power minus alpha it's not a typo here. Um, so this way you you force convergence in the theatric sense for this series, and of course, it does converge locally around zero, at least in the theodic sense. So the general radius convergence of this series might be less than one. You would like to set t to be one, but in general, the radius of convergence of f tl might be less than one. But we expect, we conjecture, it's part of. Expect, we conjecture, it's part of the conjecture, that when q goes to root of unity, this ratio converges to a rational function. So in a certain radius of convergence, which might be less than one. But as soon as you have a series which is giving you a rational function, then you can, of course, extend it analytically anywhere, and in particular evaluate it at t equals one, where the conjecture is that you should get. The conjecture is that you should get the adio polynomial. This is just the adio polynomial, according to what I discussed previously. So why did I say that I'm not, I mean, I'm stating a conjecture, but I'm not that confident in it. It's just that the first links for which the Conway polynomial is zero are the, I have 10 crossing, or there's one. I have 10 crossing, or there's one 927 and 9 crossing, so we couldn't test this conjecture for those links. So, and why this conjecture should be related to the previous one for nots, actually, this is a point which I didn't discuss. It comes from the following fact. We conjecture a second relation. Suppose that you have a friendlink whose convey polynomial is non-zero. Then we expect that if you take the limit of this formal series or This formal series, or when the parameter, the regularization parameter goes to one and q goes to one, two, then you basically get the inverse of the Alexander-Conway polynomial. So if you think about it now, if you believe in this conjecture, then and you combine it with the previous one, then you will get actually the first conjecture about AEO. First conjecture about AEO and the serious four-naught case. Indeed, in the case of a knot, you would be looking in this conjecture, you would be looking at the simpler formula here. You would be taking the limit when t goes to one of the limit when q goes to rotuinity of the series divided by the same series in q power r alpha and q power r. But now q power r goes to one, so you are here, and this tells you that this goes to one over the Alexander polynomial. The Alexander polynomial. So that's it. And now, if you just divide this by the Alexander polynomial, you get exactly the initial conjecture for the nodes. So hopefully this version of the conjecture might help to get rid of the problem that the Conway polynomial might be zero. Because here you see you're not evaluating, not dividing directly by the Alexander polynomial or multiplying by it. You're dividing or multiplying by something. Dividing or multiplying by something which tends to it when Q goes to the root of unity. Conjecturally tends to it. Okay, so does this conjecture hold in any case? Yes, it does, fortunately. And let me give you an example. If you go back at Sergei's talk, he provided a very nice picture of what a plumbing link is. So it's a link whose components are just unknots and they are linked. Components are just unknots and they are linked one to the other as hoplinks, and they follow a structure which is a tree. So I will index. Um, so they are typically encoded by a tree whose vertices v are in one-to-one correspondence with the components of L. And suppose that these components are called by some complex number, mu i, and let's call b the linking matrix of the link, then it Then it turns out, it's not a difficult computation with the ADO polynomial in its properties, that the NR, the invariant, is, okay, again, this quadratic part coming from the framing, which is the uninteresting part, and then this expression, which is a product over all the components of your link, of this expression, well, xi is this xi power mu i. Okay, in particular, when r is two. In particular, when r is 2, we get that the Conway polynomial. You can compute it explicitly, and it is just the product over all the components of your link of xi minus xi inverse power, the degree of the corresponding vertex minus one. Oh, sorry, here I didn't mention the degree of a vertex in the tree encoding your link is just the number of edges containing the vertex. And it turns out And it turns out, and Sergei explained this in his talk, that if you compute the invariant F L, the series F L, it should be this guy. So it's basically, if you compare the formula, in this very case, should be the inverse of the convoy polynomial. And now it does match, of course, the conjecture, because as I said, these two formulas were in the previous slide. Slide and this one too. But now, if you plug these formulas in the conjecture, so you actually don't even have to regularize, you just take limit when q goes to the root of unity of that formula divided by the other one when we put xi power 2r and power r, sorry. And what you get is exactly the formula you would have for. The formula you would have for the NR. So the conjecture is verified straight away for plumbing links. So, okay, so the conjecture has at least an infinite list of cases where it does hold. I convene that it is of an easy list of case, but still it's, I guess, interesting and useful for later computation. Now let's go to the three-manifold invariants. manifold invariants. Both ADO and FL can be upgraded and extended to three manifold invariants. For ADO you get what is called what I will call an R and Sega's people with the talk was called CGP and FL should correspond to Z hat. Once again, for Z hat and FL, the status of these things they are rather These things are rather conjectural invariants. They are not yet fully rigorously defined. For ADO and NR, there are, of course, mathematical definitions. And both such invariants should depend or do depend on additional structures. They are not invariants of just three manifolds, as for Rushtick interrupted invariants. They are actually invariants of pairs. A manifold. Invariants of pairs, a manifold, comma, something else. So for the NR, it's an invariant of a manifold endowed with a homology class omega. And the homology class should belong to this group, which is the upper H1 of M with coefficients in the abelian group C modulo 2Z. And here you might recognize that C modulo 2Z was the degrees, the abelian group governing the degrees of your category. Of your category. And actually, there is a technical condition which I will completely sweep under the rug today. It's actually, we need the omega to be non-integral homology class, else there are some troubles. But I mean, it can be dealt with, but it's more complicated. I don't want to talk about this case today. Similarly, the invariant Z. Similarly, the invariant Z hat should depend on the spin C structure, as Sage said. The difference here is that NR is just defined in roots of unities, and Z hat should be defined for Q in less than one, so in the unit disk. So let me recall how NR is defined. So again, you pick your favorite manifold, you present it as a surgery of a link with the linking matrix B. And as I said, the invariant is defined only for a manifold. Invariant is defined only for a manifold endowed with a cohomology class. So you are given this thing, it's part of a datum. And once you have such a cohomology class, you can evaluate this cohomology class on some one-homology classes. In particular, I can evaluate it on the meridians of the link. Indeed, the meridians of the link sit outside the link. So there are really closed loops, oriented loops, in the three-manifold M. And they represent some. manifold m and they represent some homology class and it's easy to see that they do represent generators for the h1 of m so when you consider the periods of omega on these meridians you get by definition you get complex numbers modulo 2z i denote them alpha i bar but those alpha i bar well i will need them to be lifted to complex numbers alpha i arbitrarily so you fix any lift of alpha Fix any lift of alpha i bar to C. And the theorem we proved now, I guess, 10 years ago, even more, is that with Nathan Geer and Patromion, Bertrand Patriarch, it's that if you compute the following linear combination of video invariants, then you get an invariant of the pair m omega. The linear combination is the following: you pick your, you you, you have your link. Sorry, here the letter is different from here. Here, the letter is different from here, it's the same link. Um, you pick your link, you color it by those alpha i's shifted by ki's. And ki's can range in this finite set. Every ki can range in this finite set. This is the set of numbers between minus r minus one and r minus one by two. So you see a jumped r minus r minus two, for instance. So there are r values for these numbers. R values for these numbers. So I shift the colors by these Ki's. I sum over all these possible Ki's on each component the Adio invariant of the link with those colors times, this is a product of modified dimensions, those sine of alpha i's over r divided by sine of alpha i, something like that, like that. The product is over all the components of the link. Components of the link. And finally, there is a normalization factor which is customary. I mean, something you have already seen in the Rushtip interrupt case. It's something which depends only on the signature of the linking matrix, and it doesn't depend, depends on R, but it doesn't depend on omega, it doesn't depend on M. So it turns out that this is an invariant of the pair, the three-manifold, the homology class. And by this, I mean, I mean, when you consider diffeomorphism. I mean, when you consider diffeomorphism, you should pull homology classes back and forth. Just a word of warning here. To state as is the theorem, you would need the further hypothesis that all the alpha i's should be non-integral here. And then this way the statement is perfectly fine. If some of the alpha i's is integer. Of the alpha i's is integer, actually, you have to you can still define the invariant, but you have to choose another link. Basically, the morale is that you chose a bad link, you should find a different presentation of your manifold when there is a case where the invariant is not defined, and I was already mentioned before, and it's when the omega is an integral class. So, in that case, the invariant is not defined itself. That case, the invariant is not defined itself, but it's related conjecturally, and almost, I mean, the conjecture has been partly proved to the Witten-Russikin to rive invariance, the SON and SO3 homology-refined version of those. So, this was to recap on the construction and definition of the CGP invariant or NR invariant. Now, I Now, I should try and explain how to define the Z-hat invariant. And in order to do that, I have to just remind some combinatorial encoding of Spincy structures in particular. So once again, if you have your manifold, which is a surgery over a link, L, and the linking matrix is B, then you can encode via B lots of structures. Particularly, you can encode the lower H1, which is the same by point-correlated duality as the other. Which is the same by point correct duality as the upper H2 as the lattice z power v, the number of vertices. Yeah, I called it vertices because I'm still thinking of the plumbing link, but what I'm saying here is completely general. Z power, the number of components of the link, modulo, the sub-lattice, which is the major of the action of the linking matrix. Then the upper H1 is just. Then the upper h1 is just the vectors in z module 2z power v, which are the kernel of the linking form. And then the set of spin structures on the manifold, which I remind it's it's well I will not remind it. There are lift lifts of the equivalence classes of the lifts of the SO3 structure on the tangent but the L of M2 spin three. Tangent bubble of them to spin three structures. They can be combinatorily encoded by vectors in Z module to Z power the number of components of the links, which satisfy these conditions. So it's similar to the previous one, except that you want the values to be congruent to the self-linking of the ith component for every i. Similarly, the spincy structures, which are The spin C structures, which are lifts of the SO3 structure of the tangent bundle to spin C, which is a suitable twisted product of spin 3 with S1. Those spin C structure can be encoded combinatorially by some vectors which are called characteristic vectors, which are still elements of z power number of vertices modulo 2bz. 2bZ with a condition which is similar to the one we had before for the spin structures. And well, you can easily realize that spin C is, well, it's known that spin C is an affine space over H2, upper H2 of M. And here, combinatorially, you can easily see this affine action. If you want to add a comology class to a characteristic vector representing a spin-c structure, Vector representing a SPNC structure, you just have to add twice the vector representing your homology class. Comology class will belong to this, so it's going to be something like belonging to this. And if you add twice such a homology class, you will be well defined here. And also, another remark I want to make here is that there is a canonical map associating to a spin structure, a spin C structure, which goes like this. You can see it in combinatorial terms. In combinatorial terms, as follows: if you have a spin structure, which is again a vector in Z to power V satisfying this condition, you can lift it to a vector in Z power V by just imposing, I called it S tilde, by imposing that it is congruent to S modulo 2. And then take the image by the linking form of this, and you can verify that this indeed will be a characteristic vector. It will be a characteristic vector, so we'll encode a spin C structure. Okay, so with all this machinery set up and notation stuff, well, let me recall how to define FK, sorry, Z hat from FK, it is basically a kind of Laplace transform of FK, and that's how it should go. This is as before, and now you suppose you have your series F L and you see you multiply. And you see, you multiply it by some factors of this kind. And this is what you should think of as the quantum dimension you multiply typically with when we're doing some surgery. And you have one such quantum dimension per component of your link. This is going to be a series in XIs, and that's the expression, the general expression of the series. So these FL are just expressions. Uh expressions in Q and now if the if you're talking about a rational homology sphere, so B1 is zero, B1 of M is zero, then Z hat can be defined as a kind of Laplace transform as follows. Well, as it was already said, Z hat depends on the spin C structure. So here the spin C structure is denoted sigma of Bs. And what do I mean by that? I mean the following. I mean, the following: any spin C structure can be obtained from a spin structure S by taking I of S, which I was saying is a canonical spin C structure associated to the spin structure S, up to shifting it by a two homology class, because the set of spin C structures are is a comology affine space over the H upper H2. And here, P D of And here, Pd of B is a point redual of a one homology class B. So overall, I of S plus P D of B, which is what I denoted, sigma of Bs, is a spincy structure. And for that spincy structure, the conjectural shape you should use for Z hat is this formula here, where you see that basically the Xi power L are replaced by some suitable powers of Q. Replaced by some suitable powers of Q, and there is the inverse of the linking matrix showing up. There exists a general formula for the case where B1 is positive. It's a bit more complicated, and I will not be talking about it today. You can see in our paper for more information about it. And so, the main conjectural relation we formulated is the following. Formulated is the following: the CGP invariant or NR invariant of M. Let's talk about the rational Moji sphere because today I'm refraining to talk about the general case, but a similar conjecture does exist for the general case. It's still in the paper. So the CGP invariant for M with the homology class omega at the root of unity R should be root of unity r should be a suitable recombination of the z hat when q goes to root of unity and the suitable combination is a summation over all the spin c structure with some coefficients okay stated like this it looks nice but it looks less nice when i write down the coefficients and my apologies for this i cannot do better than this um so what are these coefficients so These coefficients. So I invite you to look. Sorry, here. Yeah, it's cut. I'm sorry. So there are three cases to distinguish here according to whether R is congruent to one modulo four, to two modulo four, or to three modulo four. I invite you to just look at the modulo, two modulo four, which is the nicest of the three formulas, just for simplicity. So the So the invariance for a spin C structure, which is encoded via sigma of B S, as I explained before, and the homology class omega, which is given, is the coefficient is given by, well, here it's just the order of the H1. I'm talking about the rational Moji sphere again. Here, it is a kind of Reidemaster torsion, suitable adjustment of it. And here, you have a And here you have a summation over all A, which are elements in the H1 of M, lower H1, and you have a kind of a quadratic form up here. The quadratic form is associated to the linking form of the three manifold and to the spin structure. Here, this is the linking form, and Qs is a quadratic refinement of it. So, well, in the R. Well, in the R1 or 3 modulo 4 case, there are also some Brockling invariants showing up. So let me just recall you rapidly what is this link in form. It's just a map from the torsion part of the H1 to tensor itself to Q modulo 2Z. And you can explicitly, in the notation I was giving you before. I was giving you before, you can explicitly compute it for two classes as just the product through the matrix, which is the inverse of the linking form. Again, I'm talking about the case of rational homologous field. A quadratic refinement for a linking form is a quadratic form. So it's a map from the torsion of the H1 into Q module 2Z, which satisfies. Which satisfies this condition. That's what it means to be a quadratic form over the linking form. And it does depend in general on the spin structure. And the dependence on the spin structure is of this kind. So when you add, I remind you that the spin structure is spin structures are an affine space over the upper H1 over the coefficients Z module 2. So when you shift a spin So, when you shift the spin structure, it changes by this linear part. And explicitly, it will look like this if you have a spin structure which is encoded by a vector of one or zeros for all the components of the link, explicitly will look like this. And then, okay, you can also compute the Rockling invariant in the previous notation as here. As here, where sigma is the signature of the linking metrics. So, this was just to recall this stuff. And then there was another ingredient in this story, which was Radimeister Tossion. And actually, it's a suitable version of it. It's not exactly the Radimeister torsion you would think of. Here it is. So, you know, the Radiumas detortion, actually, the refined Turaier's refined Redimas detortion is defined for a three-upo MA. Defined for a three-upo MAS, where A is a morphism from the pi one of M to C star, for instance, and S is a spin C structure. So Turive defined for such a three-ruple an invariant, which is called a refined Redemeister torsion. Here, we suppose having a spin structure. So again, it's a vector in this space satisfying this condition. Condition and suppose that you have one homology class so that you can encode your spin C structure as sigma of s b. So it's again I of s, the spin c structure associated with s plus the Poincaré dual of b then and suppose that you're given yourself a homology class omega here, then you can immediately concoct out of omega a morphism like this just by setting Just by setting basically exponential of 2π omega. Exponential of 2π omega will give you exactly a morphism from the pi one at your manifold to c star. So you have a and concerning the spin c structure you take sigma of b s. And now this is standard derived refined torsion and you multiply by this factor. And it turns out that actually this thing depends only on s and not on b and so And so you can compute it, and in invariant turns out to be explicitly related to the torsion and the convoy polynomial. So the theorem is that actually now the conjecture, this ugly formula here, turns out to be true for infinitely many cases, namely for the plumbing graphs, which are obtained by a single central component. Central central component and many three actually three chains starting from there. This is as is, but actually, in the proof, there is some problem in taking limits when q goes to root of unity and limit when the regularization parameter goes to one. And up to checking those limits, it seems that this should be true also for all the negative surgeries over plumping links, and even for integral surgeries over trifold, not. Seranger is over trifold, not which are not in this previous setting. So, Christophe, I see you. So, I guess that I don't have much time. Just tell me. Well, if you take the appropriate definition of not much, then your statement is correct. Well, I guess I have to close. I just want to rapidly mention one thing. Mention one thing. So there for NR, for the CGP invariant, there exists a TQFT. And this TQFT is graded by a homology. Sorry, this TQFT takes values in graded vector spaces and it starts from the category of combordisms where surfaces are endowed with a super. Are endowed with a suitable homology class as those we already saw. So we tried to concoct, we tried to translate the conjecture into a list of operations to be done on TQFTs, which would relate a conjectural TQFT for ZHAT into the BCGP TQFT for NR. And we came up with two operations. And we came up with two operations. One of them is kind of Fourier transform on TQFTs. I just want to show you just how it looks basically. So the idea is that instead of talking of Fincy structure, think of upper H2 cohomology classes. So suppose that you have invariance of closed three manifolds with upper H2 cohomology classes, then you might want to relate it to an invariant. You might want to relate it to an invariant of manifolds with lower H1 homology classes as the CGP invariant. And a natural way to match the two is to, through a kind of Fourier transform of this kind. Well, here the action is just the integral over the three manifold of the pairing of the one homology class over here and the two comology class over here. Well, this isn't the level of new invariance, but actually we could work out. We could work out if we had such a TQFT, what the transformation should be in order to perform the full Fourier transform on the level of the TQFT, on the vector spaces, and on the level of the cobordisms. And it turns out that it would behave well. So in a sense, this is a block which could be used if one could produce the Z hat TQFT. And then there is a second operation which works. And then there is a second operation which works less well, which basically says, okay, suppose now you turn your conjectural TQFT for Z hat into an H2 graded TPFT, from an H2 graded TQFT, sorry, into an H1 graded one through this kind of free transform, then you still have to put in place something which translates the conjecture I just told you into a TQFT conjecture. And there is an operation in And there is an operation in the formula which relates the Z hat and the CGP invariant, which hints us at a kind of taking the rth root of a vector space, which is basically the hint is the following, but it's purely a hint for future work if anyone is interested. If you have a TQFT on the ZHAT side and you're On the Z hat side, and you're transformed it to have it degraded by upper H1, then the CGP1 should be related to that by considering shifts of the Z hat one by discrete numbers, basically, in this set. Okay, and my time is over, so let me just conclude. There is plenty of work to do, in particular, in formalizing the existence. Are informalizing the existence both of FL or FZ hat, improving the relation with the IDO links for links already, improving the relation for NR and Z hat in general. And this is about Renat's question, what about convergence of the sum in general and so on and so on. And finally, extend everything to a TQFT conjecture. Thank you very much. Conjecture. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much for this nice talk. Let's unmute ourselves and thank Francesco. We've time for some questions, I think, and then at least the bench participants will have a coffee break. Yeah. Francesco, were you saying there is a you have a method of proving that conjecture in two ways, or you need both of those relations? I couldn't quite understand that conclusion there. You mean, sorry, you mean here. Yes. No, not there. Yes, hold on there. No, sorry. Uh, which conjecture? So, the last conjecture you said there was a way that you could try to say something about Z to possibly prove that it's CGP. Well, so sorry. Do I understand this? This is the conjecture about the relation between Z hat and R? And R and C G so
