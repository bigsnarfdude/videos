We have a lot of activities here and some concerns. And I would like also to thank you for inviting me to give a talk. And today I would like to share with you some of our works with two of my collaborators around some inverse problem related to shape optimization. And we are going to emphasize only on To emphasize only on the numerical part a little bit, but it is already published and I'm going to give you the references or the link. This work is published in a book, in a proceedings edited by Birkhauser and distributed by Stringer Nature. And right now, I would like to share. I would like to share with you the outline, introduction, and example: some useful tools we are going to overview and how do work some numerical method we have tried to experiment. And here, to ease the talk, we are going to consider a problem in a domain. In a domain omega, a subset, a bounded subset where one part of the behavior is known or accessible and another part have to be recognized. And we can consider this simple example. In the paper, we have considered another little bit more. Another little bit more complicated parabolic one with non-linearity, and we suppose that we have some information about the measure on the accessible boundary gamma zero, gamma zero, where we have a data H and this is the measure of This is the measure of the derivative of u with respect to the outgoing unit norm. And to try to see how it is possible to underline, to recognize the unknown boundary is gamma. We are going to use some shape optimization techniques. And what is the shape optimization? Most of the time is formulated as a problem of minimization and where the main unknown is not the function but a set, the domain in which a partial differential equation is satisfied. Differential equation is satisfied. And right now, the question one often deal with is, does problem two have a solution? The problem of minimization? And the answer depends, of course, both on how J depends on omega and on the class of admissible set. And it is important to underline that there are two main steps to prove the existence of minimum under the following equations. It is to find a topology tau such that one get the Lao semi-continuity of J and the compassity with respect to the topology chosen. Chosen. And among shape optimization, we can specify in three types. Okay, the parametric shape optimization, the optimization of the geometric shape and the optimization of topological shape, it is the most difficult among all these three families. Three families. And I share with you some reference quickly because we have a very rich reference where you can learn for someone who are not familiar to this theory, or only for those who have already studied these types of problems, they can also. They can also share all these preferences. And I would like only to insist on the fact that in topological shape optimization, it is more difficult because for the classical shape optimization, we have the differentiability, but for topological. But for topological one, we have not the differentiability, we have a semi-differential. And after trying to find existence of the minimum, it is important most of the time to try to give some characterization like optimal condition. And if as you And if, as you know, or as you remark, you can see that the set capital theta is not a vector space. And we have to see how it is possible to compute in order to get an optimality condition by defining a differential. And you can find interesting results. Interesting result since Micheletti, okay, and a book written by Michel Delfoux and Jean-Paul Zol√©jou. And here is an example where you can get a structure, a framework in order to compute the shape derivative. And how to do some And how to do some numerical work right now. Here, we have studies the problem we have already introduced, and we are going to introduce a shape optimization program. And after the introducing of the functional The functional, we introduce also the partial differential equation, the boundary value problem as a constraint. And here you can see that we have to look for omega. U omega, q is a data, okay? Gamma zero is accessible, is known, but the complementary is not accessible. It is not accessible, it is not unknown, and our aim is to identify, is to see how it is possible to identify this part of the bundle. And I tried to simplify a lot of things because we have not enough time in order to present all the things, but one of the idea is to introduce the notion of augmented Lagrangian. And where we are going to introduce two terms of penalization. And H of omega is related to the volume of Omega and minus a constant. Okay. That is G. That is given, okay, is a target. Okay, it is considered as a target because you can find an infinite types of set getting the same volume. And this is our algorithm. Okay, I would like to summarize. To summarize, but here we inert, we give an initialization and we compute the solution of the state equation. We compute the solution of the advanced state question equation and we give initial value for the coefficient L0 and D zero and after And after we compute also the shape derivative, I have not presented here how to compute it because it is a little bit a technical task. And after we introduce a quantity which is important to try to see how it is possible to get a clear. To get a criterion in order to stop. This quantity comes from the data H, but we are going only to do this transformation. Okay. This integral, okay, this boundary value problem. Okay, if you put integral, you You use a green formula and you split into two parts. You will get H and the other expression on the non-accessible boundary. And we would like to have. To have some quantity to be controlled, and here, if only this quantity is less than one precision epsilon stock. Okay, we are sure, almost sure that we are not so far from. Not so far from a good solution, but we don't know in general if we have uniqueness for the solution. And we have done some tests, okay, some numerical tests for Q equals one for H equals Y square plus the constant and for epsilon sub for the criterion criterion epsilon. criterion epsilon sub equal six power ten times ten power minus two and some other arbitrary coefficient b that we are going to to set okay and we can see see is that if here is is a accessible domain Accessible domain, okay, is an accessible part of the boundary. Okay, by running the program, we are going to get these last pictures. Okay, and here we can say that this is an approximate, okay, domain in the case. In the case where we have particular data. And for this case, also, we have only information here and we put here the Schrodinger equation plus boundary condition. And we use a shape optimization problem plus the numerical. The numerical solution for the bandwidth problem to get after some iteration interesting shapes for the appropriate estimation of the domain that we have not known exactly. And this is a last example. Last example, and I would like to thank you for your attention. Are there any questions? Have you done any examples with the topological changes for main? For instance, you will begin with, you have an initial guess, right? But eventually the two. Eventually, the tube might be like a composed of multiple components. I think there are some measures by using level sets. So if you want also technical by using an incorporated level set, that can be used to deal with the topological change of the domain. Now, my question is: have you done any of the examples with the multiple components of the domain? Components of the domain. So multiple disconnected products. Did you hear the question? Can you hear the question? Can you hear the question? Do you hear the question? Can't hear you, so but you're not muted. Maybe write in the chat.  Oh, can you can you guys I can't I kind of hear your microphone, but I don't hear what you're saying. So if you can hear us, can you type something in the chat? That is just we can definitely hear the room, but maybe his audio is just off or something like that, unfortunately. Unfortunately. Oh, okay. So maybe we can take the questions via email. So if you have some questions, I can post his email address and you can try and contact him offline. All right, let's say the speaker again. Okay, so we have 10 minutes until next stop. Let's take a very short break and then we'll take Alvin and chat. Yes, yeah, yeah, it's not here.
