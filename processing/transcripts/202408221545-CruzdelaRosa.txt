This first of all, I want to thank the organizer again. This toll is doing work with Fernando Guerro. So, comments and suggestions are welcome. So, let's start. So let's start. I'm gonna talk about the jump in intellectual graph of a Markov generator of weak copying limit type. So first of all, I start with the description of macro generation or with limit type. Then I shall define the interactive graph associated. interactive graph associated to Markov generator then we I show the incident metric and finally we I finally finally I show you some invariance invariant state so the generator is the is of this form is a Is of this form. It's a weak copy limit time. Roberto has already explained it better than I could, but so I'm going to go quickly in this part. This H is the Hamiltonian, where epsilon n are the agent vectors. Agent vector aging values and p epsilon are the projection. So the born frequencies are defined by the difference between them and B plus are the born frequency positive. Okay, B omega is the pair associated with each borrower. Each bore frequency be omega plus this. And the Markov generator of weak complete time associated with the H and B, where B is a beta, is a function. Okay. Is this generator is This generator is of this form. Okay. These gammas are defined on this form as a question and beta hat is this B hat is is this true and beta is a positive model. And beta is a positive borderless point. So we have a theorem for each frequency born and consider a state rho be a function of the Hamiltonian. In the Frederick representation of the semigroup, we have the action of the generator over row. Generator over row is in this form. Okay. The case spectrum of H, of the Hamiltonian, that is if all the projection or the spectral decomposition of H are one dimensional. And as a corollary of the above theorem, we have this equation. We have this equation. We are looking for invariant state. So we want to solve this equation equals zero. Okay, this is important. H is not the generated spectrum. Okay. So in the In the case when the spectrum is given by these values of finite case-dimensional, the equation has this form. It's a double sum on this on this difference. So So, our assumption are the following. H has a generic spectrum. That means that non-degenerate spectrum. And for each frequency born, positive frequency burn, there is a unique pair, epsilon n and epsilon m, such that the difference is the frequency. From now on, the spec. From now on, the spectrum of H will be N, and these terms, these terms that appear in this equation, we establish none equal to zero. Why? We want to drop the detailed variant condition. If you watch this structure, when this difference is When this difference is equal to zero, we have detailed balance. So we want to drop the detailed balance condition. So we assume this. Okay, this is a picture about the three level sample. So we have a sign for each. For each pair NM one vertices in this picture. This current that we call J N M can be interpreted as microcurrent of quanta from level epsilon m to level epsilon n. All these currents have All these currents have the same intensity. Yeah. Okay. In order to give the incident matrix associated with the equation, I write L in this form. Observe that. Observe the difference. Yeah. Here in this in this case, we are allowed all We are above all transition from level higher to lower. 2-1, 3-1, etc. All the transition in this equation are allowed. Okay, this is the same, but with metrics and notation. So So we identify the above matrices with this set. This set, well, okay, this matrix gamma is called the incident matrix associated to the question L. Observe that L equals zero if only if the product If the product gamma with j in this form is zero, yeah. Okay, this matrix can be associated with a graph, as I say. So let's go to the definition, the interaction graph. Let L be a Markon generator or we copy type. Its interaction graph is defined by this graph. This graph, yeah, where the vertices are the spectrum and the edges are the bore frequency associated to board frequency. The order of the graph is the number of vertices. Here is n, and the side is the number of the edge. The definition of the edge, the coupling operator, the t does not play. Operator, the T does not play only for yeah, again, please. You have this mod square for the matrix element of G where? Okay, in this case, in your case, you take everything one. The matrix element, no, the interaction you say the this. You say the inter this is the interaction graph. The interaction matrix. No, no. Incident matrix. What's the gamma? Right? The gamma. The coupling, the full microchiometer does not involve only gamma, but also the matrix element of the coupling operator, which appears in the interaction of Minton. In the interaction of Minton. I think you absorb this interaction in the definition of J because you are considered a special class. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You absorb into J. Yeah, we end in this case. The last last term. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah, okay. This term should be not zero. No? None to you. Non-zero non-zero this and book. Okay, this is the standard notation for graph. So consider the following function. This function gives a Gives a measure between the vertex in this form. If we have epsilon n and epsilon m, p of these terms is the minimum of two terms. And this function satisfies this. This inequality, where this is the floor function or integer part. Yeah. We want to define the chi-jump interaction graph. So we want to jump to make jumps of length. So, for each k in n, the cashium interaction graph is defined by this way, where the set of the edges is this. The distance in some sense, in the sense of the function p, is equal to As an example, for n equals 4, we have the G L1 and GL2 jump interaction graph in this way. Observe that the jumps in this case are one side in the center of the function field. And here the jumps are. Here, the jumps are of size two in this sense. So, in both cases, there are forbidden example: the n equals five, observe that. Observe that these interaction graphs are connected. And okay, this is the G1 chi interaction job, and this is the two chi interrupt two job interaction graph. So a graph is connected. Okay, a graph is connected if for each pair of vectors. For each pair of vertices, there is an edge which joins them. We know this. The proposition. For the key jump interaction graph, the graph, if the greatest common divisor between E and N is one, then the connected graph, the graph is connected. graph the graph is connected and the and the size of the vertices and edges are are the same it's the same yeah uh okay it's it's followed by by noted that the the the this set join with this operation this is the operation modular modular n Yeah, a well-known fact in number theory is says that in this set, the question of this set is a generator of the group if only if E and N are co-prime. Okay, we we will define the degree of the vertex epsilon j in the graph in this form. The degree of the vertex is in a usual form. So we have the following lemma, the degree of each vertex in the Kajum interaction graph. Interaction graph are bounded by two and here. In a general way, we say that the interaction graph, that an interaction graph G L is complete if G L is the onion of this chi interaction jump graph. Definition as Definition, a signal is called Eulerian if each one of the each edge is probably exactly once. In the same saying, a graph is called Eulerian if it has a Eulerian cycle. It is well known that a graph connected is Eublerian if only if one of its vertices have even degree. So for each graph G. graph GL K with this condition and N are co-prime, there is exist an Eulerian cycle. Another theorem, this is a well-known theorem in graph theory, the rank of an incident matrix associated with a graph, graph, with n vertices. With n vertices and is n minus p, where p is the number of connected components. As observed, the kernel of the incident matrix of this interaction graph is given by this dip. No. So let's denote as gamma. Yeah, yeah, the dimension. Let's denote as gamma key the incident matrix of the catchum interaction graph GLK. As a corollary and iteration graph, Markov generator with limit time and gamma key is incident matrix. The graph is connected. If the graph is connected, then the If the graph is connected, then the dimension of kernel equals one. This is due to the above observation. We say that the diagonal invariant state is a cadjum detailed balance state if all m n touch the difference between them is in the sense of the In the sense of the function phi is equal to p. If this condition is satisfied then for all key, this is here should be the floor function on integer part. Yeah. In this case, we simply say that the state is cache on detail. The state is casion detail value variant. Okay. Given the presual generator of a finite dimensional Markov generator with limit type, we say that a diagonal invariant state is uniform and completely non-equilibrium if all these currents have the same type. Has the same size for all is the spectrum, is the size of the spec. Observe that in the case when d equals zero, this definition corresponds to usual detailed balance condition. This case corresponds with a complete graph when all the transitions are allowed. We had already done something about this for the for a complete graph with spectrum. Odd or in this form. Yeah, the diagonal uniform and completely non-equilibrium invariant state. That means that all the all the all these currents are allowed. For this case, the invariant state, diagonal invariant state, non-equilibrium. Non-oh, in non-equilibrium, is of this form. Okay, this beautiful form. As an example, in the case n equals 3, we have the following. The currents are related in this form. For the simplest case. Simplest case. Okay, so in another case, in general, the detailed condition can be computed as follows. Suppose that we have n equals to m plus 1. That means that the difference between levels of energy is 1. In this case, In this case, we can compute the age value of the diagonal state in this form. After some computations, we have this. So, for each intellection graph associated. Interrection graph associated to a Markov generator of weak of limit type. The TACOL Mogram conditions, okay, we have the follow the this TACOMogodon condition. The proof is easy, I think. And given And giving a Markov generator we cop limit type with one job integration graph this integration graph. Then the unique non-equilibrium state for each end has the aging value or agent values of this way. Yeah? Okay, as I as I said, this is As I said, this is a work in progress, but it's not finished yet. And that's all. Do you have any questions? Sorry, in one of your last results, you had an explicit form for the invariant state. For the invariant state, yeah, exactly here. One before, I haven't read the whole complete. I just focused on here. One of the assumptions is that the graph is complete. Yeah, yeah. I was wondering what are the cases in which it's not, because all the possible frequencies are allowed, and you ask for no data balance. Uh, no detail balance if I understood correctly. So, how can this graph not be complete? Complete in the sense that all transitions are allowed. For example, this graph is not complete because the two three because the this, for example, yeah, yeah, yeah, like that isn't GL just a collection of the possible uh power frequencies? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah, positive for frequencies and the spectrum. This is essential. This assumption is essential. The spectrum must be the size of the spectrum must be of to give this result. Well, I can answer the question. You find the non-equilibrium. Can you say that is local equilibrium in the sense that it is defined because you start from local equilibrium path because beta depends on omega in your model. So is local equilibrium in the In the sense that the equilibrium beta, depending on the current currents are not in equilibrium. You you call this local equilibrium? Real notion of local equilibrium. Of local equilibrium. You obtain from the stochastic limit when you start from a non-equilibrium state of the field. The property to be connected so Which the kernel one where the disconnected then the kernel the dimension of the kernel is equal to one depends I think di d depends on the size of the On the size of the the converse of the wasp the converse of this project I think no I think no, but I'm not sure. Another question. I think you have unique invariant state because you allow all transitions. That in your case, I just see. I think you have a unique invariance. Is it true? Or the state that you consider is not unique. You give a specific form, so it should be unique. Yeah. In this case, you are asking in this case? I think that from the experience of quantum optics, the most interesting case should be when there are Should be when there are some forbidden trans in that case, so you have some degenerate. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's that's why you have a much richer landscape of existence. Yeah, that's why we study the kind interaction job. So, this is unique, and the semi-group converges to dynamical equilibrium to this. So, the next okay. So we finished
