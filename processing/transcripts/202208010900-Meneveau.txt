Very much, Mayang, for the invitation. Also, to Burst and the entire organization, very grateful to be here. To those who are participating remotely, sorry you're not here. It's a wonderful place. It's really beautiful. So we're quite fortunate to be here. Let me click on a few things here. I might have to click. Okay. And probably what I will do. And probably what I will do is, I will try to use the, if I need to use the pointer, I'll use this thing on the screen so people can see. So in terms of what to present today, I thought with a theme of mathematics and multiphysics, multi-scale, multi-phase flows, I would describe to you a work on Lagrangian modeling of Modeling of fine-scale structure of turbulence. And in that regard, what I will be presenting mostly is prior work that was done by former student Perry Johnson, who's now assistant professor at UC Irvine, and more recent contributions by Yuan Luo, who was visiting from Beijing University and has now graduated. So those are the two people who've really done the work that I will be describing here today. Describing here today. So the ultimate objective really is to be able to perform Large Eddy simulations of turbulence. And of course, most in the audience will not need any introduction of the topic. It's essentially the idea is to be able to do simulations of high-Reynolds number flows in a more affordable fashion with grids that are much larger, let's say, than the Comogen. Much larger, let's say, than the Kolmogorov scale. And the traditional formalism is to take the descriptions of the flow, for example, velocity fields, do a spatial filtering at some scale that's far above the Komogorov scale, and therefore having affordable grid sizes. And then we need effective equations, which end up being the filtered Navier-Stokes equations, in which, of course, we have an additional divergence of a stress. Divergence of a stress tensor, which is a subgrid-scale stress tensor. And that, of course, is a very well-known material. Probably, as is well known, the most important part of a subgrid model is to dissipate the energy, to replace the remaining steps of the energy cascade that are missing because we don't have fine grids, to replace them with some expression for the subgrid scale stress test. Expression for the subgrid scale stress tensor. But in terms of what statistical feature of the flow that model is expected to reproduce, it's essentially the flow of energy, the rate of the cascade to small scales, so that ultimately the actual dissipation of energy can occur at the Kolmogorov scale and below. And this is the expression, of course, for the energy dissipation. That's essentially missing in the representation. And I put this up. And I put this up so to kind of already for the first time, perhaps to write down the strain rate, which is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor. And we'll talk a lot about the velocity gradient tensor today. So I'm going to use the following letters. So Aij is just a partial UI, partial XJ. It's a matrix with nine terms, nine elements, has a symmetric and an anti-symmetric part. And an anti-symmetric part. The symmetric part tells us about the deformation rate of a fluid. And of course, omega is the same as the vorticity vector. So that's the usual thing. And we'll be talking quite a bit about this Aij. And notice here that this is unfiltered. So this is the original velocity field, and that's the one that's required to really represent the epsilon, the energy dissipation. Now, in LES, one might sometimes be interested. One might sometimes be interested in doing simulations with phenomena that are dominated, where the interesting physics are actually happening at scales smaller than the grit that we're able to reproduce using the LES grid. And so, for example, and I'll talk just later, much later, I'll talk a bit about this, is, for example, you might be interested in droplet deformations where the droplets are much smaller features than the grid scale. Than the grid scale. This happens a lot. And I would say maybe the classic approach to model the rate, for example, of deformation of these droplets is to have some information about the strain rates, the gradients, the velocity gradients at scales, at the Kolmogorov scale, even though we are only reproducing the grid scale of the LES. And so how do we do that? Well, the classic approach is essentially. The classic approach is essentially to realize that the statistical, in a statistical sense, the order of magnitude of the velocity gradient, all of its elements, is inversely proportional to the Kolmogorov time scale. That's a turnover of the smallest eddies in the turbulence, which in terms of the dissipation is simply square root of epsilon over the fluid viscosity. So here's where the actual fluid viscosity, not the eddy viscosity, but the actual fluid viscosity comes in. And of course, the higher the Reynolds number in some sense, Course, the higher the Reynolds number in some sense, the lower this viscosity. So the strain rate can be quite large. And so in LES, the default approach is to use whatever we know about the energy dissipation rate and then use the true viscosity and then get an estimate of this velocity gradient. And that provides time scales and so on that can be put in models for these smaller scale features. So the, and then again, the traditional approach has been, what do we know about epsilon? Has been what do we know about epsilon at LES? Well, we are using, let's say, an eddy viscosity model. And it turns out then that you can take that model of the eddy viscosity times the strain rate, and then another strain rate square, and then you get essentially an estimate of the rate of energy dissipation from this. I believe there's probably one power too many here. This should be square, not cube. That's a typo. So now, what does this epsilon represent? This is not. This epsilon represents? This is not the actual epsilon, it's not the actual effects of this gradient at every point inside one of these meshes. This really does represent the average in one of the mesh sizes here. So if I put here the strain rate, again, square, times the eddy viscosity, that will be the characteristic gradient occurring over a box on the order of size delta, but it's the average in that. It's not the pointwise instantaneous value. And so it's likely. Value. And so it's likely that we're missing relevant information that might be occurring at smaller scales. So, more on that now, because of course, it's been known for a long time that the actual rate of dissipation is highly intermittent in both space and time. So, this is, for example, an example of calculating the local dissipation rate as a function of position on a plane. This is just a little subset of a thousand cube direct numerical simulation of isotropic. Simulation of isotropic turbulence at the Re lambda of about 400. And as you can see, the average, I believe, in these units, I don't know, might be a few thousand, maybe two, three thousand. And you can see there are these spikes every so often where the deviation from the average is huge. It's just tremendously intermittent and tremendously variable. And so averages of epsilon might not tell the entire story. One is also familiar with the Familiar with the rotation rate. So, what before I showed was the square of the strain rate. So, that's the symmetric part. So, that's the rate at which the fluid is being deformed locally, instantaneously. And of course, these are the worms of isotropic turbulence, where you can see that also the rate of rotation is highly intermittent in space and has some non-trivial spatial structure as well. Again, very localized flow structures, even in isotropic flows. And isotropic flows. Here's one more. This is an animation that I show a lot of times showing a bit the multi-scale nature of the vorticity field. So what you're seeing here is, again, from isotropic turbulence, this is a filtered version. So the gray envelope is an iso-vorticity surface of filtered velocity. And then everything that's outside of it has been not visible. Been not visualized so that you can look at what's going on inside this vortex. And the red here are the real vorticity field unfiltered. And so you can see there's a lot of very complicated small-scale structure that resides inside the large-scale structures. And so it's very complicated, again, highly intermittent and spatially kind of distributed in a very non-trivial way. So again, so small-scale intermittency generally. So, small-scale intermittency generates these very infrequent extreme events that are hard to characterize based on local averages. And, of course, in practice, this affects a lot of things. I mentioned droplet and bubble deformation. I believe Ray will talk about bubbles later on today. It affects combustion. For example, you might have localized flame quenching events. If the straining is very large locally, you can have extinction of flamelets, for example. Of flamelets, for example. Microorganisms moving around in a turbulent flow might localize, find localized regions where the conditions are just very far from what they might be expecting from an average point of view. Polymer stretching and relaxation dynamics, these are things that are dependent on these much higher rates or smaller time scales than what would be reproducible in LES. So let me tell you a little bit about the kind of the basic. Little bit about the kind of the basic phenomenology more quantitatively that one uses to characterize intermittency, so the small-scale intermittency. And it's this sort of things that we'll try to reproduce with the kind of class of models that I'll be talking about. So for example, the classic, one of the kind of well-known features is that probably density distributions of the gradients are far from Gaussian. They have long tails, meaning that extreme events are much more. Meaning that extreme events are much more likely than they would be if they were Gaussians. And so, for example, here's shown from a direct numerical simulation, the PDF of longitudinal velocity gradients. So A11, for example, is an example. So this would be du1 dx1, du1, dx1. So the change of one component in the same direction. And you can see the long tails. But in this particular case, you also see skewness. So these PDFs are skewness. These PDFs are skewed to the left. And then A12 is a transverse gradient, the change in the one direction as a function of the x2, so in the perpendicular direction, those by isotropy have to be symmetric, but also are actually slightly more intermittent. The tails are slightly more elevated. And then this kind of behavior has been known for a long time, and it actually becomes more pronounced as the Reynolds number goes up. So as you add more and more possible scales. More and more possible scales, as you add them to the multi-scale range of available scales, these PDFs kind of get broader and things get even more intermittent. So for geophysical phenomena, for example, the rate of intermittency is much, much higher than for small Reynolds numbers. So this is a graph from Ishihara in JFM. These are all from DNS between Reynolds number 170 to about 1100. And nowadays, To about 1100. And nowadays, this can extend even more, but it just keeps on growing. This does not converge. This isn't a converging thing, keeps on, keeps on going. A way of showing this, and these are, again, mostly experimental data from Srini, Vasan, and Antonio, an old review paper. If you calculate, for example, the skewness coefficient or the flatness, another manifestation of intermittencies, that you have a power law increase. A power law increase with Reynolds number. So it's somewhat slow for the skewness. It's negative because of this asymmetry, but it also increases as Reynolds number goes up. And here's a plot of the flatness. There's some DNS shown here. So you can clearly see there's kind of a power law increase of these parameters that show that the more, the higher the Reynolds number, the more intermittent, the less Gaussian these quantities are. Also interesting, there are some geometric Also, interesting, there are some geometric things that are of interest characterizing the fine scales. So, for example, this has been known again from the late 80s from analysis of DNS, really, because for this you really need the full three-dimensional picture of what's going on. People have been looking at the alignment of the vorticity with the eigenvectors of the strain rate tensor, for example, and have found maybe a little surprisingly that the vorticity is mostly aligned with the intermediate. Is mostly aligned with the intermediate eigenvector, not the most stretching one. And then later studies have shown that if you allow for a time delay, the vorticity then is aligned with the most stretching direction, but then the stretching changes, those directions change, and the vorticity takes some time to rotate towards the most stretching direction. So there's some interesting geometric features of fine-scale structure that are interesting to look at. This is a PDF of the cosine angle between vorticity and these eigenvectors. Between vorticity and these eigenvectors, showing that there's really a distinct peak of this intermediate vector. So, in a way, this is what happens if you had a shear layer. The vorticity, of course, is in the direction of the plane where one of the intermediate eigen direction would occur. So it's consistent with that picture. Maybe more in detail, I'm not going to talk about much of this, but another characterization of small-scale non-true. Of small-scale non-trivial behavior is this joint PDF of the invariance of the velocity gradient tensor. There's a second and third invariant that somehow combines stretching and rotation. And then you have this characteristic teardro drop shape that has elucidated quite a bit of literature. For a Gaussian random field, this would be perfectly symmetric, whereas a lot of conditions now sort of accumulate on this lower right quadrant and the upper left quadrant. The upper left quadrant. So that's another quality, essentially, quantitatively determined feature. So let me just tell how do we go about modeling this sort of thing? So let me go back to this notion that, for example, the longitudinal gradient is highly intermittent. And as a way of motivating the kind of modeling that we have in mind, let me start with the simplest possible model. So this is going to be really trivial, but it tells quite a lot of the story. Tells quite a lot of the story already. So I kind of like to show this often. So just consider the most trivial case. This is 1D. Oh, I forgot I can actually take this off. Ha, very good. So the 1D Berger's equation, the inviscid, so it doesn't contain a viscous term. And essentially what it says is if you're moving with the fluid, if there are no forces on the right-hand side, the velocity just stays constant. So you just have constant. Just stays constant. So you just have constant velocity, zero acceleration, Lagrangian acceleration, just that. And of course, this is very well known. If you started out with a sinusoid where the gradient is initially negative, this tip here will move more faster to the right. The bottom will move to the left, and you'll be generating these shocks. Now, let me look at this from the point of view of gradient. So you just take the gradient of that equation, the ddx, just take the ddx, and what you end up with is the, you know, the up with is the you know the the non-linear term u d u d x you take a derivative one of them just becomes the gradient squared a which here is not a matrix it's just a scalar and and of course the other term gives you the advective derivative of a so ultimately you simply get dA dt so if you follow fluid material is equal to minus a squared and what that does is if a initially is positive then it decreases and as a function of time you know irrevocably it just continues decreasing to It just continues decreasing to zero. But if A is initially negative, then the rate of change is also negative and bigger. So it becomes even more big and generates. And so that's what generates this cliff. And of course, the analytic solution shows you that there's a finite time singularity for the gradient. And so depending on the initial condition A0, there's going to be a time where this blows up to infinity. So in very, you know, in very simple terms, you can understand how just the advective derivative in How just the advective derivative in the, in this case, the Berger's equation will generate this tendency of accumulating very large gradients, generating negative skewness, and sort of condensing this large gradient in a very small subset of space. So it's all there, and it's kind of trivial in some sense. This is kind of very easy. So we thought this might be a good place to start for a model of what's going on in turbulence. And so this is essentially the And so this is essentially the maybe this is really the only mathematics that I describe is essentially to take the gradient of the whole Navier-Stokes equations. And now you end up essentially not one, but with nine differential equations that can be written separately for each of the elements of this matrix. And so we're going to be talking about a system of nine ordinary differential equations at first. Differential equations at first, and then we're going to model it, and then it becomes stochastic differential equations. And again, the idea will be that we'll follow particles in a Lagrangian frame, so we'll go with a fluid, and we'll follow the evolution of this, of each of these tensor elements, Aij, in time. And we'll see what we can do. Let's see what we can do with that. So, if there are questions, maybe this would be good. Just let me know. Just drop me. Let me know. Just drop me. And I don't know how it works with online virtual people, but I don't see a chat or anything. But anyway, just figure out a way to ask questions if that's appropriate. So again, let me now show you what this looks like in more detail. So now I'm showing you here the equation. So this is the d dt is a material derivative. So we're following a fluid particle. And on the right-hand side, you have various terms that now come in. Various terms that now come into play. The first one is what's called the self-stretching term, and it's essentially the analog of the a square but for matrix in 3D. So in 3D, again, there's a lot of elements here. And it has the, you know, has the form of minus a square. So if you imagine a, if it was symmetric and diagonalized, then this would look very much similar to the early equation, minus a square for each of the elements. However, it turns out that It turns out that because AI, if we, and I'm going to just talk about incompressible divergence-free velocity fields, so the trace of A has to remain zero, and that is, of course, accomplished through the isotropic part of the pressure Hessian. So the pressure, of course, intervenes. And we can rewrite this equation by essentially just subtracting the trace of the A squared there. And so that's the full self-stretching term, which includes this kind of zeroing out of the trace of A squared. And then the pressure gradient. And then the pressure gradient, the Hessian of the pressure has been, you know, we've added and subtracted the Poisson, the Laplacian of pressure here to take, it's the same term. So this term being equal to that is just the Poisson, the familiar Poisson equation. So that's reorganized in this way. And then we have the viscous term that is just another gradient. That is just another gradient. So that's just the Laplacian of the velocity gradient times viscosity. And then we add to, you know, to force the system, we add a forcing term to it. So the first part, self-stretching and then unclosed and forcing, that's kind of the structure of this very simple equation. Now it turns out there's some really interesting research that was done mainly by VFOS and Cantwell in the early 80s and 90s, which was to 80s and 90s, which was to say, what do we get when we let's start from the simplest possibility, which is to kind of set to zero these unclosed terms. So no forcing, no pressure, Hessian, no viscous term, just the minus A square. So this is now the analog of, if you will, that 1D problem that I looked at for burgers. Okay, that's the analog. And it has this structure. And then very interestingly, if you take that equation, so here's the equation. So, here's the equation I have with all the terms neglected. And I remember these two invariants, a square and a cubed, as a matrix, but then contracted so that it's a scalar. You can just pre-multiply these equations once by a and the other one by a square and rewrite it and realize that actually this a square term, when you multiply by a square, gives you a to the fourth. And then you use Cayley-Hamilton theorem to write it in terms of squares. And so, this is an exact. Of squares. And so this is an exact closure, if you will. And then for these two invariants, it turns out that you can just write a two-dimensional dynamical system that is very easy to solve analytically and has, if you plot its phase space trajectories, they look like this. And so this is very nice. Now, interestingly enough, unless you start exactly on this line, in which case you will end up at the origin in infinite time, all the other initial conditions on this plane. Conditions on this plane will go, you will go along these trajectories and in finite time go to, again, a singularity. So, this also has a finite time singularity, and things blow up, essentially. If you solve this after some time, things go to infinity. However, on the way to the singularity, a lot of physically observed phenomena already take place. For example, it can be shown that in this lower right quadrant, in fact, the vorticity that's consistent with the vorticity being aligned. That's consistent with the vorticity being aligned with the intermediate eigenvector, and so on. So, this seems like containing already quite a bit of interesting phenomena that are actually observed in turbulence. However, we don't have a workable model if things keep blowing up. So now the game starts. Okay, so now we start the modeling game based on physical insights we might have. And of course, the simplest one is to add some kind of damping relics. add some kind of damping relaxation term. And so one starts with a linear damping. So you introduce a time scale and here's a so this is a relaxation to zero for each of the tensor elements and the hope might be oh this might this might provide help and things might not blow up. As it turns out now you have a different dynamical system with another fixed point here, which is unstable. And so some initial conditions that are here in this kind of domain of attraction Of domain of attraction, everything goes to zero. So not everything blows up now, but a lot of initial conditions that are outside of this basin of attraction will still blow up. So essentially, you know, half the initial conditions you might end up with might go to zero and the other half will blow up. And that's it. So that, again, is not sufficient. In other words, this linear damping doesn't provide enough damping to make this singularity disappear. So this is a short, probably incomplete. Short, probably incomplete table of the various approaches that have been, people have worked on to try to remedy this problem and come to improved models. So Steve Pope, for example, with Giru Maji and Chen and so on, worked on this for a while. There's a Tetrans model. Then we've worked on, and I'll summarize some of this, on something called the recent fluid deformation closure. You can combine You can combine with shell models, which I won't describe here, and then some further insights onto Gaussian models. And then, what I'll spend most of the time is again the work that Perry did some time ago on something we call the recently deformed Gaussian field model. It's a handful, I guess, an acronym, and I'll describe what that means. But again, we're working on trying to come up with ways to model the physics of this pressure Hessian. Of this pressure Hessian and the viscous term, such that when you plug it into a Lagrangian time derivative of this matrix, things behave as physically realistic as possible and don't blow up to infinity ever. So as real turbulence, of course, doesn't. So let me, this is perhaps the most succin description of this idea of the recent fluid deformation map that I could come up with as a sort of a simple way of describing it. And so, again, Describing it. And so, again, we're interested in a model for the pressure Hessian, so second derivative of the pressure. Now, let's imagine that the pressure, we say, is going to be maybe a large scale quantity. It's not really dominated by small scale phenomena. So pressure gradients will be small scale, but the pressure itself might be large scale. So let's assume that as we're following a fluid particle, let's assume that the rate of change of pressure is zero. So let's approximate the Lagrangian. Let's approximate the Lagrangian time derivative of pressure along a food element. So that's going to be a modeling assumption, but that is zero. Somebody needs to mute their phone, I believe, session here. That doesn't sound like a question. It sounds more like background noise.  I think the speaker is muted. Please unmute. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but there's echo now. Yeah, you'll have to have it back to back. Does that work? No. So, I need to be unmuted. Okay, so here I'm unmuted from this one. So, okay, all right. Well, I think I've not. Well, I think I've now erroneously clicked on the wrong on the advancement of slides, which is excessive now. Yeah, so this is where this is where we were. So yeah, so now we simply, you know, you take the PDT, you take two derivatives, dxi, dx, j, for example, and then you get two terms, which is the time derivative of this pressure Hessian, and then these derivatives operate on the Derivatives operate on the U that is part of the Lagrangian pressure, and then you get gradient of U times this pressure Hessian and then time and then plus the transpose of the velocity gradient tensor times the Hessian. This is a very nice kind of a trick. And then it turns out that so now we have essentially the time derivative of the pressure Hessian is not zero, but the pressure Hessian is being modulated by the velocity gradient. So this is very much like the Oleroid type upper convective. Type upper convective derivative that happens in viscoelastic type descriptions. So, in other words, the gradients of the pressure get additionally deformed by the velocity gradient because nearby material is being deformed. And then it turns out that there's just like, you know, if this was a vector, this was a matrix, there's an analytic solution to it. But if you have two terms that are now for a matrix, the analytic solution is to be a very simple. Now, for a matrix, the analytic solution is simply e to the tau grad u times the pressure Hessian times the initial con at the initial condition. So, this is at time t, this is at the initial condition, and then multiplied on the other side by the transpose of that matrix exponential. So, these are matrix exponentials now, e to the tau t, and then tau here is really t. So, this is the time that has transcurved. Again, another typo here, this should be time here, t in the in the matrix exponential. In the matrix exponential. So, the idea is if we have some information about the initial value of the pressure Hessian, and we'll take some generic term, so we'll assume some generic value for features of that initial pressure Hessian. To get it at a later time, you have to multiply on both sides by these matrix exponentials. And at first, some years ago, what we assumed was the simplest one is to just say, oh, let's assume that the conditional average of this initial condition statistically is just the average. Is just the identity, so just an isotropic test. So that's kind of the simplest assumption you can make about the initial condition: it's isotropic. And then we ended up with this recent fluid deformation map. Then, sort of in parallel, it turns out that if you instead, if you assume that this initial condition is coming from a Gaussian field, so if you assume a Gaussian velocity field, it turns out that even for Gaussian isotropic. Even for Gaussian isotropic turbulent field, the pressure is not exactly isotropic. The pressure Hessian turns out because it's quadratic in velocities. And once you start squaring things, you get other types of PDFs rather than Gaussian. So it turns out that the conditional average of this initial pressure Hessian, given a configuration of a velocity gradient, is, yeah, it's not the isotropic tensor. It's something that can be written as S squared, omega squared. As s squared, omega squared, and omega s. These are modeling terms that are familiar, of course, from the Rance modeling literature. You know, you have a second-rank tensor, this is what this is, the pressure Hessian, which we don't know. It'll depend somehow on the velocity gradient tensor. So S squared, omega square, S omega are the kind of terms that you will have in this case. And then notice, I guess this is really the deviatoric part of it. So things, the traces here are subtracted everywhere. And then it turns out. Attracted everywhere. And then it turns out, and Michael Wilcek, who's now in Germany, he worked out, this was quite a bit of a sort of analytical work, is to essentially write down, you know, evaluate these pre-factors, assuming that it's a Gaussian distribution. So if you have a Gaussian distribution, everything, all the multi-point statistics are described by the correlation function, which is this f. And then you can write down in terms of these correlation functions and actually evaluate these prefactors exactly. Actually, evaluate these prefactors exactly. Minus, you get nice numbers like minus two sevenths, minus two fifths, and so on and so forth. So, this could be done exactly. And it turns out that if you take that for the pressure Hessian, things also blow up and don't work at all. So, it's not good to just say things are Gaussian and then take the implications for the pressure field. That was not good. So, what turned out to work out quite well is a combination of the two. In other words, is to say, yes, the initial condition. is to say, yes, the initial condition, we're going to take it, we're going to take this initial condition to be Gaussian. So you assume that you start with an initial condition that's a Gaussian field. And then you assume that over a short period of time, the A, the velocity gradient tensor, let's assume it's constant in time, then you can evaluate these matrix exponentials from the rapid fluid deformation. And then you end up with a model that contains both this pre-factor from the matrix exponential, the Gaussian initial condition, and then you have a model for the pressure. Condition, and then you have a model for the pressure Hessian. So that's what we, that's why we call it a recent fluid deformation, but with a Gaussian initial condition. So now you put it all together and well, I guess this has been rewritten slightly. It looks awfully complicated, but you will see some terms that might be familiar. Again, there's an S squared, omega squared, S omega from the Gaussian description. Then there are these D to minus one, D to minus one. These are essentially the One. These are essentially the d here is the this comes from this matrix exponential, which is here. So d ij inverse is essentially the matrix exponential after a time tau. So that pre-multiplies on both sides this tensor. And then similar ideas for the viscous term gives rise to this. And then if you simply run this with some initial condition, even though it's a non-linear with a quadratic non-linearity system. Quadratic nonlinearity system, things typically will tend to zero. So you need to add stochastic forcings. You need to provide, you need to shake this system, otherwise things end up going to zero. And so here's a Gaussian noise type term, DFIJ, which also has some parameters that is added to keep these dynamics alive. So that's in a nutshell the kind of model we have. There is this time scale that needs to be prescribed for this material deformation, tau, and so one expects it'll be proportional to the Kolmogorov time scale. It has a pre-factor, which is set to a value 0.13, such that there's a consistency between the long-time integration of a system like this. And so you're going to get essentially time histories of Aij, which you can then get the symmetric part and average the inverse. Part and average the inverse square root of the square of it. And that should be equal to the Komogorov time scale. That's the definition of the Komogorov time scale. So that should be equal. And from that condition, you can fit what this coefficient needs to be. So there's a sort of internal consistency conditions for the system. So that's one of them. And then there's two parameters for the forcing. We force separately the symmetric and the anti-symmetric part. And those parameters, the forcing strengths are set such that we have for isotropic. Such that we have for isotropic homogeneous turbulence the condition that we know that the average of Q and the average of R has to be identically zero. So that gives the other two parameters. So they're not fitted by, you know, comparing with data, they're fitted by internal self-consistency for the model. So I would say the following. This looks a little bit complicated, right? A lot of terms and so on. And it gives you an impression how hard it has been to get a stochastic differential equation for the velocity grade. Differential equation for the velocity gradient turbulence to behave sensibly and reasonably. Things that are much simpler might look okay at first glance, but when you test them and so on, it always gives very bad results. So it turns out to be quite tricky. It's not an easy thing. So this, to us, at least for me, this has been sort of maybe the simplest model that really has worked so far. So here's kind of a sample. So these are sort of time histories of these different. These are sort of time histories of these different elements. And then you can now you can analyze things, right? So if I have a time history of Aij, I can get time histories of S, of omega. I can look at alignments of vorticity with the eigenvectors. So the dashed line here is from DNS. And then this RDGF model. So a recent fluid deformation Gaussian field model, the symbol. So very good alignment statistics, very realistic. On the left is the teardrop shape. On the left is the teardrop shape from the model. On the right is from the DNS. As you can see, there are some differences for the outer contours. So at very low probabilities, there are still deviations, but the most likely inner core works very nicely. This is the PDFs of the gradients. On the top is the, I think the top is. I think the top is the longitudinal one with askewness, and the bottom is the transverse one. And so, good agreement with Reynolds numbers that are on the order of 150, Re lambda, 160 or so. Good agreement with skewness alignments, the joint PDFs. However, if you go to higher Reynolds numbers, we started observing deviations again. So, this worked well for Reynolds. This worked well for Reynolds numbers, RE Landa, about 60 to about 150 or 120. But as you go to higher and higher Reynolds numbers, the true PDFs kept growing in tails, whereas if we applied this model, you start getting nonsensical and very, very poor results. So I'll leave that thought there to motivate ultimately the model that I think really works now under any conditions, which is Under any conditions, which is something that was a bit more recent and then we further developed with Luo in this FISREF fluids paper this year. So, here the idea is essentially the problem with the previous version that was limited to moderate Reynolds numbers was that as you go to higher and higher Reynolds numbers, that model is simply incapable of generating the level of intermittency that the real physics denotes. You just need more, it seems like one needs more degrees of freedom. Like one needs more degrees of freedom. So, the model we've ended up with is one where we add additional shells, we add additional levels, and have now a truly multi-scale description of these gradients. Okay, so I guess again, with the theme of the conference, talking about multi-scale, imagine that you now have a sequence of these velocity gradients where one level might represent. One level might represent the gradients at some scale, and some and then represent things in an environment, let's say at some particular scale. And that generates a local environment in which the smaller scale eddies are still moving and evolving at much smaller scales, and they have their associated velocity gradients, and then they provide a local environment for even smaller scales. So, kind of a cascade, sort of a shell model picture, but with a Picture, but with a very distinct property that makes it very different from other shell models. And so essentially, what we found, I don't know if it says here anywhere, but yeah, so the idea is you just take the same model we had before, the one that I had described before, where there was this tau, that time scale, which was the Kolmogorov scale before. Now that time scale is going to be replaced by the time scale of this. Scale of this localized environment that comes from the description of the bigger scales. So instead of the overall Komogorov scale, which is the smallest one, I'll take the one that is implied by the eddies that are at a bigger scale. And so here it is. So I will have a time scale Tn, which is obtained from the strain rate of the previous shell. So I would say this formula here tells kind of the story, wherefore the tau at level The tau at level n, I'm going to use the sij of the previous, of the larger scale. Okay, so that seems to make sense. And then you can, and then you can sort of cascade that to any arbitrarily high level and high Reynolds number. Now, what was interesting, some of you might have followed the old literature on shell models, where it's known that in turbulence, the cascade is local. So the energy goes mostly from scales half. Mostly from scales half as big to half as small, kind of a factor of two. So, all these shell models always had factors of two and a scale ratio. It turns out in this count, the way to get it to work was to take a scale ratio of 10. So this is a time scale ratio of 10. So this is distant interactions. So we really view now the cascade as the local interactions are actually represented by this thing from the Navier-Stokes equations. And then the non-local interactions are distributed from this. So I'm going to flash. Are from this. So I'm going to flash through some results from this maybe a little more quickly now, if I can get this to advance, which maybe I need to use this one. Yeah, so that's this notion that we have the local interactions and then the non-local interactions are described by this cascade. And so this is now what you get. So you get some level of intermittency in one, then after two, after three. So the intermittency now builds up because the clock that you're using, the time scale, You're using the time scale is also accelerating and becoming more intermittent. And so it generates this accumulation of intermittency. But now, of course, we have a stochastic differential equation at each scale. So there's nine equations at each level, zero trace. So it's really eight independent ones. And then if you have n levels, then it's going to be n times that. Now, so on the left are signals of velocity gradients at five up to five levels. And now you can really see the PDFs of the gradients kind of flaring out at. Kind of flaring out at arbitrary Reynolds numbers, which we can now do. Power law increase of skewness and flatness, very, very realistic results, the transverse flatness being higher than the longitudinal one, but the power law agrees quite well with the Ramos number. Now, I should say that factor of 10 is associated with the slope. So, if you change that factor of 10, that slope will change. So, in some sense, that is a bit like an That is a bit like an adjustable, fittable parameter. If we had chosen a time scale of six, then the slope would be very different. So, with time scale 10 ratio, it works out well. And then here is a very detailed comparison at two Reynolds numbers for which we have DNS. So, we have the 1,000 cube DNS from the database and an 8,000 cube also from the database. And you can see PDFs from the model as lines and the data as dots. Quite good agreement. Quite a good agreement tool very far along the tails. So, with that machinery now for the Lagrangian evolution of velocity gradients, let me show you the application that, and this is Perry's PhD thesis work from some years ago, how we applied this to drop studying droplet deformations and put that in LES. So we are only going to consider small To consider small drops that are smaller than the Kolmogorov scale. The distortion is caused by the velocity gradient that I've talked about a lot. It's resisted by surface tension. And of course, there's a lot of literature. And if the drops are bigger than the Kolmogorov scale, then of course there's classic work by Kolmogorov, Hinze, and so on. By the way, I guess Ray was going to talk about a much more complicated case when the drops are bubbles are bigger than the Kolmogorov scale. Than the Kolmogorov scale, then you get very complicated shapes. This is from a recent paper of theirs, and you have to take into account not just the smallest scales, eddies, but simultaneously other eddy sizes and so on. So again, keep this in mind that what I'm going to talk about is heavily simplified in some sense. Even more simplified, we're going to describe the droplet shape as ellipsoids, three-dimensional ellipsoids, so tri-axial ellipsoids, which is okay in the sort of a first for small deformation. Sort of a first for small deformations. And then we're going to rely on the Mafetone-Minale model, which essentially describes the shape of these ellipsoids by means of a second-rank conformation tensor, which again has eigenvectors, which tells you about the directions and has eigenvalues telling you about the semi-axis. This kind of equation is very nice because, again, it's the rate of change of this conformation tensor as you follow. Of this conformation tensor as you follow fluid particles on the right-hand side of this equation are terms that depend directly on the strain rate, on the fluid strain rate that deforms it, the fluid rotation rate that moves and rotates the particle around. And then there's a relaxation to isotropic shape that depends on the surface tension, or in this case, the capillary number when written non-dimensionally. And they cleverly found a way. And they cleverly found a way of writing this relaxation to sphere, but volume-preserving because the drop cannot change volume. And so, this particular description takes that into account. So, it's very nice. And then, so this is essentially from literature. So, what we're doing is we're so the idea is now to take, let me see if I have this. Yeah, so the idea is we do an LES at high Reynolds numbers. We want to keep track of deformation and orientation of each of these particles. And the orientation of each of these particles, and we consider that sort of microstructure, it's far unresolved in LES. We use a hybrid Euler-Lagrangian approach, so the fluid is Eulerian, and each of these particles is Lagrangian. We follow each of the particles with the Mafetone-Minale model. We need the unfiltered velocity gradient tensor to put in here, right? And so, for that, we use the model that I just described for the velocity gradient tensor following for the part. Velocity gradient tensor following fluid particles. Again, remember, it has both strain and vorticity. And then we're going to test and apply this to LES of channel flow. So we're going to take a standard LES of channel flow. We're going to assume one-way coupling. So of course, there's no LES is not going to be affected by this. So essentially, low loading. And we're going to have three cases. We're going to have a DNS. So we have the DNS from the database. So here we have the whole time evolution of the three-dimensional. Time evolution of the three-dimensional field. So it's very convenient for us to place drops in there and follow them using the Mafetoni-Minal equation, but not needing the model for the gradient that I just described. So we're going to take that as truth. So we're going to assume that that is physically relevant. Then we have filtered DNS where we filter the DNS and use that and apply the model. But I'll mostly focus on results where we simultaneously, we then, or instead we run an LES of a channel flow. We run an LES of a channel flow with Wall model with a dynamics Magrinski model, and then place the particles that are on our sub-grid scale in that channel flow and see how the drops will both move, rotate, strain, and deform, and so on. So again, standard comparison, these are mean velocity variances from the LES that we have. And then again, this is, we essentially use representative particle. Essentially, we use representative particle for the deformation. We don't quite use the Mafetone equation. We use this better so that the M for Mafetone is just the square of D. It's the same. It's an equivalent equation for D. And then you need to use the singular value of D. It's simpler. It's a better, numerically better behaved equation. Then we need one more thing, which is to take into account the stochastic. The stochastic when we run LES for particles, we need additionally we move the particles with a filtered velocity, but we need to some stochastic for the subgrid velocity. So we use this existing model by Feder, which has essentially noise and some terms. And things come from the LES. So the subgrid kinetic energy comes from the LES and so on and so forth. So that's fairly standard. So we use a standard approach. And I guess here's a typical zoom. Typical zoom-delayed animation where things are more unsmooth. So, let's imagine this as a smooth time evolution. But we place the particles in the center line of the channel. So in this case, we try to stay away from the wall. So this is really more representing what might happen at the central part of the channel. When things got closer to about 100 wall units from the wall, we stopped looking. While we stopped looking, those particles were disappeared. Turns out mainly also because of remaining drawbacks and missing physics from the model. For example, as the particles get very close to the wall, you'd expect them to start kind of rolling almost, because now they start seeing, let's say, the viscous sublayer and they would start rolling only. So we need a model that takes this highly non-isotropic. So now it's now that even the subgrid is highly anisotropic. Remember, the stochastic model. Remember, the stochastic model I showed you was for isotropic turbulence. So, no good very near the wall. So, a lot of things that are still missing. Now, this is peculiar because the particles are moving backward. Oh, no, they're not. They're not, I guess, because the frame is, you can see these lines are the channel, so we're sort of moving with a mean flow. So the particles close to the walls are moving backward, but the ones in the center are moving forward. Now, what's interesting here is you can see how deformed, you know, how the particles have deformed. You know, how the particles have deformed. We call this the MM plot. So some are disks, others have become more cigar shapes, but they're all ellipsoids, of course. But they're seeing a much more intermittent environment than what the LES predicts. So let me now go maybe more on, tell you about the quantitative comparisons. And for that, I need to be able to get out of this, which it seems like I cannot. Like, I cannot. Okay, well, good. So, there's a few more slides left, as you can probably see. So, yeah, so sample signal. So, the particles start at the center, they oscillate. And we're going to talk about this D, which is this level of anisotropy of the deformation of each of the particles. So, it's the difference of the singular values divided by the sum. This is a quantity that's A quantity that's one if it's the most anisotropic drop, you know, like a thin sheet or a stick, and it's zero when you have spheres. And so you can see you can get for each of the particles, you get these signals and so highly intermittent again. This is the position. So this shows that, again, the DNS, I believe, are the, I forget which one is which does it say from DNS. Yeah, so for DNS is the, is. So for DNS is when we place the particles in the DNS, so no subgrid modeling, and the symbols are from this LES with a stochastic subgrid model. So if you didn't add the stochastic subgrid model, these things would not agree well. And this is now the first sort of non-trivial result from this, which this is a PDF of the dissipation rate from the fluid, PDFs, but from the particle trajectories. And this is the And this is the these dotted lines are the PDF from the LES. So, if you didn't have a subgrid model for the small-scale gradients, so just calculating the dissipation rate as if the LES was a DNS. And this other PDF here, which are both dashed line and solid line, one is from the DNS. So, this is the true epsilon. So, you can see, right, so the LES has given you far less intermittent behavior for epsilon than the DNS. Behavior for epsilon than the DNS. And this model is the let's see, the dotted line, the dashed line is the, let's see, what is the solid line, dashed line. Yeah, so sorry, the dashed lines are the DNS and the solid line are the LES plus the model. So where we incremented the dissipation intermittency by this stochastic model. And then this is the similar PDF for the rotation. PDF for the rotation. So, this is the anstrophy. So, again, LES and then OR DNS, which is the truth in this case, and this model. So, very good reproduction of this. Again, a cosine of angles and asymmetry, the model does a good job as can be seen. Now, in terms of the deformation of the particles, this one is maybe a really nice result. So, if you look at the statistics of how the particles have been deformed, so this parameter d, again, it's one. Parameter D, again, it's one when it's very deformed and it's zero when it remains sphere. So, again, very strong surface tension, that just be more spherical. And the dotted line is when we advance the model without a subgrid model for this velocity gradient tensor. So, just getting the velocity gradient from the LES with the surface tension, and then you get this dotted line, whereas the DNS has the, I guess in this case, again, the baseline, the red dashed line is the DNS, which is the truth in this case. DNS, which is the truth in this case. Again, moving the particles in the DNS. And then the model in this case, running the LES plus this plus this subgrid model for the gradients is the solid line. So much more deformed, significantly more deformed particles from this model. Again, this is a conditional average of this parameter as a function of wall distance. So you can see that the level of intermittency and the turbulence intensity and everything goes up as you approach the wall. So it's a certain level far. Wall, so it says it's a certain level far from the wall, and then you it keeps going up as you as you go closer to the wall. And again, if you only if you if we hadn't used this subgrid model, we would get from LES the dotted line, but with this model, we get this. And then here's changing the capillary number, so changing the surface tension, where the capillary number, the higher capillary number, the particles get more deformable more easily to squish them essentially. And again, we get very good agreement between the DNS and LES. DNS and LES RDGF approach. So that I believe is where I wanted to end. So, what we've been able to do is to enrich Largetti simulations with a physics-based or physics-inspired Lagrangian stochastic model for the velocity gradient tensor. Unlike many other models of small-scale intermittency, this one has a wealth of geometric information also. Wealth of geometric information, also, because we have information about eigen directions, vorticity directions, and so on. So, it's quite rich. It had to, the model has to be somewhat sophisticated, as you could see. So that's interesting by itself, I think. And then we've managed to apply it in a more applied sense in conjunction with LES in a kind of a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. And there are some references. If you're interested, I can provide more information about that. Can provide more information about that. And with that, let me see if there's any questions. Thank you. If there are questions from the room, then we speak in the microphone. Right, yeah. Oh, you need uh he needs this. That's fine. Hello. Is this working? Yeah. Very interesting work, Charles. I haven't heard of food out before, so it's kind of nice. So, just a quick, I have a couple of questions. Maybe the first one I wanted to start is: I'm not, I understand. I understand how the model works, but how do you implement it? I mean, if you have an LES simulation that starts, you still only get the coarse-grained velocity gradient tensor. Then you get, I understand you add a dispersion to get the Lagrangian trajectory, make sure it's also driven by some kind of small scale fluctuations. But then the governing equation on the left side, you have a dA/dt term. On the right side, you sort of have S and omega. Have S and omega, but do they come from the LES simulation or do they? Yeah, that's an excellent question. Of course, I skipped over that. That's actually very important. So the LES, so you're running the LES, and as you said, you have information about the filtered velocity gradient tensor. And in this vision of a multi-level model for the gradients, Model for the gradients, we take the time history. So we are also following these fluid particles, so that's a separate set of or you know differential equations for the positions. For each one of the particles, we know the filtered strain rate, for example. We get a tau time history, that parameter tau that entered into the stochastic differential equation model for the small scale gradient. We take it from there. So the LES is informing the time scale parameter that is needed. Parameter that is needed in the first level of that modeling. So that's how, so then for each particle, and then everything else that you just run then the equation for Aij for that particle. But at every instant in time, the largest scale time scale is coming from the Elias. So that's the coupling with the Elias. Now, that's good if the small scales are isotropic. If the small scales are anisotropic, like what happens very close to the wall, then we would need to add on the right-hand side. To add on the right-hand side additional terms that tell you about this anisotropy. So, Sharad, Girimaji, and co-workers, they have looked at this recently to see if you have anisotropy, if you have a forcing that is an AIJ that might be anisotropic. And it's not quite clear how to couple it with this, but that's probably the direction that this needs to be extended. I would say we've tried the most easy approaches, and things blow up again. You add some bad terms. Again, you add some bad term to this equation and things don't work. But anyway, you had another question. Maybe I can first solve that. Yeah. So let's ask the question on the chat. The question on the chat is: is there a basis for the scale ratio for this to? Basis for the scale ratio for the stochastic model, or is it empirical based on the experience? Is there a missing coupling term that is preventing from small-scale resolution that leads to long-range interactions? Yes, very, very good question. So, the parameter beta in some sense is the one, if somebody can find a Somebody can find a first principles justification for fixing that scale ratio, I would be very happy. So, we have not succeeded. So, you're quite right. It is right now an adjustable parameter. It has been adjusted to get that the growth of skewness as a function of Reynolds number, to get that to be the correct slope, that parameter has to be adjusted. So, it's right now an empirically determined parameter. What's interesting about it is that 10 is a big, big number, so it's a big scale ratio. So, it's a big scale ratio. And so, that in some sense, you were talking about long-range or distant interactions. We believe that really does represent those distant interactions. And the more local interactions are represented exactly through the A squared term that comes from Navier-Stokes equation. So, I think we come, we're sort of first principles on the local interactions now. And then the distant interactions, there's still this one fittable parameter. If it wasn't for that, I think everything else would be sort of self-consistently determined. So, yeah, very good question. Determined, so yeah, very good question. Not on the chat, so let me ask one, Charles. You mentioned a little bit about near-wall effect on your pressure Hessian. Is there any simpler approach you think trying to include the kind of terms you're including? Include the kind of terms you're putting in your AIJ equations, would there be an advantage to go following a tetrad or something in the vicinity of the wall? Do those kinds of models have any advantage of writing this thing simpler? So, as far as I understand, the information that's contained in the Tetrad model, at least the one Model, at least the one that Alain Pumir and co-workers and Mike Chetkoff and others have. I think the information content is very similar to the AIJ plus this recent deformation, this confirmation tensor. So I think one would have to go even beyond that. I don't see, just with the Tetrad model, that it would buy you anything in particular close to walls. But I may be mistaken about that. I think that's worth looking into. That's worth looking into. One more question on the chat. I can repeat the question if you want this. Tell me what it is. Is it due to some sort of coupling between short-scale interactions? Oh, I see. Yeah. Possibly. I guess, you know, I don't know, I guess is the honest answer. Yeah. Well, let's thank our first speaker for extending the talk.
