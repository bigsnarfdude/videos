Thank you very much for organizing such a wonderful conference and the innovation. I'm going to talk about regular projection and And this is Joe's work with Thomas and Papa. But we we had this result a couple of years ago, but I think it's a But I think it's a good introduction for several talks in this pretty value. So the setup is X visit point radio production high X from the point exact point X through the unit circle. To the unit circle is defined as a y-max to the direction between x and y. So the unit vector. The question is, if P is a subset of the pi, what is the so frequency for any S? And the house will be managing. So, in other words, if we find a point E and look at how many directions do we see. So, first of all, you notice that there is a key difference between E inside E inside a line and not in a line. So if E is contained in a line, then all we can see is the direction of the line. So here we need to add E is not contained any line. So also another, just to digest this question, another simpler thing is Simple thing is when say most of the E is contained in the line, and then we have a point that's outside of the line, then just from this point, we can see that the direction, household dimension of the radio projection image is the same as the house of dimension of ET. A large portion of E is contained. The main theorem is under this condition we have. We can always find a point E such that the Hausoop dimension of the radio projection image is the same as the minimum of the Hausoop dimension of E at one. So, this is a generalization of Maastricht's projection, two radio projection. Later we'll discuss. To radium projection. Later, we'll discuss the connection between radio projection and alphabet projection. And then last year, this result was generalized by Kevin Rin who's two higher dimensions. So it says if E is a subset of R D. A subset of R D and the positive dimension of E is less than or equal than K. So King. And the E is not contained in any shape lane than also dimension of art. Of the radio projection image is equal to the house dimension of. So, those are the two main theorems. And today I will mostly talk about this one, but I thought it might be good to know that such a generalization exists. Now, let's talk about applications because in this way, then we can confirm. Way then we can conduct many of the talks in this video. I won't discuss the problems in details, but distance set problem. So for this prop the connection to this problem, you can see Pablo's talk later in the week, and also I think she'll. So, I think she'll miss talk. And then we also have the personbird set of so we can see um Thomas Living House. And then I think so the some product problem that if we have three sets A B C contained in a line and what is the subframe of P and C? Note of P inside capital P, A plus P times the household dimension. So this set means so A times A C times C. I think there is the I think there is the help of triangle problem. So we can see Alice Cohen's talk. I think oh, I forgot. The Kakia problem. I'm not sure if Joshua mentioned it, but it's related to his talk. So those are the applications that I won't discuss in detail. So first of all, so this radio projection might, so I think people have been studied it intensively for the last few years, but it's it's closely related to orthogonal production. So So it's suppose you change this problem to a bilinear setting. Let's see, you have E1 and E2 in R2 and then you ask what is the supremum of, say, like the, we look at from a point in E2, the household dimension. And the projection to what is so in this case, the orthogonal projection is a special case because suppose we put our point x, so suppose e2 is contained in the line, but e1 is not contained. But E1 is not contained in this line. Then we can perform a projected transformation that maps E2 to the infinity by greater projection. So if E2 is continuing then radio reproduction Radio projection becomes under projective transformation this becomes automotive projection. So I'm going to erase the application. And then the first result. The first result that I know of at this time is due to a comment saying that we can show that if E is not contained in any line, then the supremum of the household dimension of E is greater or equal than The house is dimension V over 2. Well, this result is perhaps easier if you think about it in terms of orthogonal projection because if you have two directions and your points are here, then at least in one direction you can see about half the point. You can see half-dimensional points. But for radio projection, this is much more difficult. A point result is the first result of this kind. I also learned about radio projection from this paper for the first time. But there is the subtlety. Example. Suppose E is R2 and is contained in C2. So what it means is that suppose we replace the end space by C2 and E is now like subset of C2. And then now we have for any X in E, X and E house of dimensions. Pi E pi X of E is just the real circle. So then the household dimension of E equals to the half of the household the household dimension of the rated projection equals to the half of half household dimension of E. So, this is the kind of example that says that if one wants to improve upon this result, we really need to do something that distinguishes the two ways. Are there any questions so far? Okay. And then he said that orthogonal projection is a special case of radar projection, then radar projection is a s a special case of the first input set. Of the first inverse fact. And this is. Why did you mention C2? I'm not sure about this example. So this example is because if the NBS space is C2 instead, and then we take E to the R2, then this example is sharp as the. Example is a sharp estimate for a clonest result. So it's a sharp example for a constant result. Is this the definition of projection different than if you consider C2 or also? It's the same. So it's pi x is, if you're in C2, it's also we can define a complex vector. So So, I'm going to go ahead and do a little bit of a test. So, the first of the set has made size of A. So, if P is a subset of R T, and then for any X, there is There is a set T and then let's say the household of P equals to T And then for any x in P, there exists an S-dimensional set of lines through X, and let T be the union of all those. Then we call T and S T principle set as so the house of dimension of T is greater or equal than the minimum of S plus T, S plus one and three S plus T over the two. That's the conjecture. And so here the setup is that through x, through every point in P, we have a set of lines. Let's see how this is. We claim that. We claim that radio production is a special case for prison books and that's So this claim is not super straightforward if in fact to prove our theorem is like sort of like a realization of that personal like visual projector is a special case. But it is okay in terms of the heuristic In terms of the heuristic level, so that's what I'm going to do. Okay, so heuristic calculation. So, to make the argument rigorous, one needs to pass. To make the argument rigorous, one need to pass to our delta discretization, and then it takes a lot of setup and technical details. So for now, I'm just presenting veracity calculations. Now suppose of set E has dimension T and then suppose X and E, the supremum of the real projection dimension is Dimension is s, strictly less than t. So if s equals to t, then we are done. Suppose also now in this case, let's say t has dimension less than 1. Because when the set has dimension larger than 1, you can just apply the result for dimension in each. And then now What are we going to do is put each point x, so we draw all the lines that feel other points, x. And now we have an S-dimensional set of lines. So TX. Let's, for simplicity, because this is just heuristic, let's assume that. Let's assume that for any x, the dimension is x. And now the dimension of t x is s, and t x divides as another point in. Thank you. And then on each line, so because it's still heuristic, so this is not quite rigorous, but that the positive measure of L in the sector P is T minus R C. So So that's very heuristic. And we have that. And now we can calculate the incidence um P um say sorry X L into T X. Now the dimension of the incidence is so one can think of this as a subset of R4. If one pass from the each line is given, we assign it to a parameter in R2. This more it makes sense than the household dimension of incidents. Of dimensional incidence is the following. So we calculate in two ways. One way is that for each point x in P, and S dimensional set, so this equals S plus T plus S because for each point X and E, the num the set of lines The set of lines through X has S dimension. This is the dimension of P, and this is the dimension of T x. And on the other hand, we know that through each line, yes, and for any x in P, so that means for any line in T, So that means for any line in T, the dimension of the intersection of a line and the set has dimension T minus S. And so this is plus T minus S. But this tells you that the dimension of T equals to 2s. But then we have a contradiction, not yet. But I will say it was. Not yet, but I will say it was good about this. This means that the relation between the radial projection and the Fursenberg set estimate is the following. For any point X in T, we have an S dimensional set, but now the T is an S T Fersenberg set. So this set S T Personberg set. So if T So if t is greater than s, has household dimension equal to 2s. But this is not true by a result of our condon schmerkin. So So for any t greater than s, there exists an epsilon greater than zero, such that any stposimble that has house dimension are 2s plus epsilon. And this epsilon improvement suffices to show that there is a contradiction if the a radio projection The radial projection, the dimension of the radio projection is strictly smaller than the dimension of a set. Thank you for that talk. We have a quick question, which seems to be on a slightly from us. Do you think I can prevent a sharper version of the radio technique here on this sharp alpha? Yes. Yes, I do think so. I mentioned before this joint work for Hornet American with the mention of the one. Is there something more than just energy? So you had an analog of uh material? Yeah. Yeah, that's what we used. And this is That's what we used. And this is more than that because we need this epsilon improvement, which in terms which uses projection theorem that gets rid of the example that I wrote here about C2. Is it this epsilon improvement that distinguishes the real case from the complex case? Yeah. Otherwise, Thomas Reza is sure. Otherwise uh thomas result is shocked because thank you. Uh home again.
