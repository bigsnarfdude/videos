So today I'm going to talk about elucidating genetic etiology of complex traits through population scale functional genomic study, which is basically QTL studies. This is not directly relevant right now, I space, to Baoba, because I don't really work. Studies to Baobank because I don't really work directly on Baobank data. But I believe this is very much complementary to Baobank studies, and it's probably going to be where also the Baobank study, like one potential direction where a lot of Baobank study can go in the future. So thanks to the excellent introduction from Xiang and Dai Xia, I don't think I need to introduce too much. We also talked about this yesterday to some degree, the challenges about this post-GWAS analysis, where there are so many post-GWAS analysis. Analysis where there are so many post-GWAS analysis, but relevant to QTL studies. It's more like the QTL-GWAS integration, where we talk about the so-called missing regulation challenge. And here's just a quick list of what might be contributing to this kind of complexity with the context dependencies of QTLs, the boundary versus linkage, and LD, you know, that's always a big paddock, and causality, and lastly, but now we're data computational challenges. Data computational challenges, and lots of it have to be not only this data availability, the NAT scalability, but also the statistical methods for doing executive integration. So my goal or our goal here is to try to start a QTL project that can systematically discover and detail the QTL in all the disease violent cells and tissues, and not restricted to just one type of QTL, but multiple of it. One type of QTML, multiple of it, and to elucidate the non-coding region, genetic region, through the chemical and setup programs, and especially generating resources and methods for QTLG also integration. And here, you know, because I come from the neurology department, and I think it's also, but not just that, because, you know, of course I get my genetics and the so ideas, but I think it's still very useful to focus on just one seed. To focus on just one disease as a flagship disease, because you know, sometimes you can get carried away with mental development being applied to many diseases. But if we take Alzheimer's disease as our flagship disease, it will allow us to really look into some of the genes that are really of interest and many people study repeatedly. And also, as we know, for Alzheimer's disease, genome-wide the signals are not that abundant, so almost polygogenic. So, then we think there's an advantage to focusing on flexible. To focusing on flagship disease, so we can dig a little deeper than typically people might do in population studies if it's not disease-oriented. So, we started this project called the FunGen XQTL, which is part of the LSAN's disease sequencing project, ADSP Functional Genomics Consortium. So, we decided that the PI in the Fengen AD decides that we should kind of collaborate and contribute our resources and do it in a very much. And do it in a very much unified and harmonized way to kind of generate the different types of QTL data from the brain, from CSF, and from blood, because those are all relevant tissues or organs to dementia and Alzheimer's disease. And also we want to leverage also publicly available data sets and to put together multiple tracks of QTL from methylation, hastemification, all the way to metabolites. To metabolites. Here is a summary of, as of now, the collection that we have in our repository. So there's two components roughly in the study. One is to harvest and collect all these resources and reprocessing, harmonizing them. It's a lot of tedious work and trying to get informatics and the basic stuff correctly. And the other is how do we go about integrating them. So I'm leading the NASA working group in this project. Not working in this project. It's a multi-institutional effort. But today, during the past couple of years, we work on this project, we think of it, and there are many things we think is a new challenge from the XQTR integration. So we do have to develop different methods for it. But today, and we did make, I think, good discoveries. But today, considering the audience, I'm going to go from slightly more technical highlights of what we have been doing. Of what we have been doing, like to generate new molecular phenotypes in a computational way, and also define new types of QTL in a computational way. And of course, different methods and inference structure. So actually, I changed my slides quite a bit before I came here. So instead of showing, so we do develop new methods, but instead of showing nice results from the new methods, especially from simulations, of course, there's some really nice results. I think I want to show here. Know, I want to show here, I guess, strike a balance between convincing you what we do is useful, but also there's like challenges and room for improvements. And especially, I want to pick your brains for smart people to what we do. So, here, you know, showing something, I guess, with some twists as far as not everything is super nice. Okay. So, to start with, I want to clarify on something, because every time I run into my department chair who is a neurologist, and he's like, Where's your target? Maybe you need some targets. Where's your target? Maybe some target, but I don't care about your methods. So then it's a question: it's like, you know, now instead of starting to talk, okay, so what kind of analysis do we do? Do we do polarization, T-Walls, those kind of things? Or rather, versus, you know, we ask the question, what kind of targets are we trying to identify? So for the sake of, you know, I guess, you know, easy for organization, it's very arbitrary organized things this way. As you can see, it's actually kind of method-oriented mind. But then, so we're talking about four categories. But then, so we're talking about four categories of targets. Because, again, I focus on the AD GWAS. So, we know lots of the GWAS loci from AD. We just want to understand what's going on here, right? So, for some of those, there's no AD loci, and other studies already show it kind of have a clear T-Tail target. So, that's probably most dispersed category one. But then also, there's the same gene target, but then there's different loci from different contexts contributing from the same target. So, I just roughly quote. So I just roughly call it category number two. And number three is you've got a known GWAS low size, but then it actually links to some gene that you typically don't expect, but it's actually still nearby in a cis section. Or sometimes it links to multiple genes, it's hard to distinguish which is which. And the last one is like you got a GWAS low site, it can link completely to somewhere else, which you know you can only possibly link that with approaches in here, it's like trust. Approaches in here is like trust QT analysis. So, in the next 15 minutes or so, I'm going to share some stories from each of the categories. So, the first category is actually, you know, we are quite familiar with, you know, if you think of you've got 80 locals and you've got multiple QTL, just align it and see what's the overlap or co-localization with them. So, two kind of new things I want to emphasize here is that when you've got multiple XQTL contexts, you can find them all. You can find them off and ask the question: you know, how do the effects propagate across the central dogma? You know, like actually, you know, everything from the epigenetic all the way to microbomics. So we are well able to do that. And also, there can be new QTL types and new QTL context that might be interesting that kind of could be the missing link, right? Because there's a long way to go from epigenetic all the way to complex traits. So there are going to be a lot of missing links that we don't even observe, but can we kind of fill up? Observe, we can fill up the missing links computationally at least. So we have a method called colloc boost to do the multi-straight politization. We have started with a few methods. We don't find them satisfactory. It's with an Aptonian version of our own. It's quite nice. So we identify, for example, here's a summary of just running the polarization with ADGWAS for the cell type specific expression and also SPICEQTL, PQTL, and EQTL. And you can see that. EQTL. And you can see that in here, of course, lots of the signals are still coalizing with EQTL, but quite a bit also with biceqtl. And if you look at the cell-specific results, actually you can see the microglion is actually a not very abundant cell type. So in principle, it's only 5% in the brain. So the way we measure it, it's not very precise. But still, you see that it actually has the most relevance to Alzheimer's disease. And in fact, quite a few of them only has a unique globalization. Unique globalization with microglia, and so that's kind of part of this kind of interesting. And if you go back there, you can see lots of the macroglia-specific effects also kind of propagate through, like, you know, all the, some of share with the other QTL cell types, some of don't, but they also propagate through the expression and the bottom expression, the pQTL SQTL. So for the SQTL here, I just want to point out a specific tip. I just want to point out a specific type of ICQT we're talking about. So, in collaboration with Yandi and my postdoc and Yan student, we work on a version of the Leaf Clutter. For people who know the Leaf Clutter, it's about detecting a splicing event in a very powerful way by using the intron usage as the phenotype and then do QTL mapping. So, we develop a version of the clutter number 2, or 2.0, which specifically targets on a type of splicing event where normal Of splicing event where normally you got a splicing here, right? And it just becomes a different isoform. That's it. But then sometimes you got a splicing event here, which gives you an isoform like that, but unfortunately, it got a premature stopping code over here. So then it triggers the process called the non-sense mediated cutting, because it's a non-sense variant. So essentially, what happened is that you're able to generate this critical transcript, but it got degraded. So it will appear. Degradated. So it won't appear as if it's an expression difference, but actually it's triggered by a mechanism called non-sensitive D2K, and it's a splicing detail. So we've got quite a bit of unique co-localization with splicing, non-sensitive D2K splicing with Alzheimer's disease. Some of those actually, even you can look into literature, they have the third generation sequencing evidence to support events. I'm going to show particularly this event, which is kind of useful, also puzzling. You know, useful also puzzling is that you've got this gene, right? So it got a signal. So this is from the callocrine. So everything is kind of co-localized to draw into. And you got a same triple set marked in yellow. And that says, you know, here is an ADGR signal on this gene. And you got a microglia-specific EQTL here. But then you got an unprotective QTL in the anterior cortex, which actually doesn't show up in the Don't show up in the regular anterior portens in EQTL, but it does colloclyize with the microglia, and you also see that's an EQTL in PCC as well. So those are different brain agents. Now, if you stop right here, you can think, okay, so maybe it's going to be an unpredictable spice in QTL across the board. We just don't have enough power to detect that in the LPFC and HD box data, which is actually kind of true because we have some power. We have some power, it's not the greatest power. Actually, our single data right now has a larger data set than our bulk, the way we design it. However, if you actually look, that's not the case, because we do see some signal in ELPFC and in AC as well. Those are the EQTEL signals. The problem is they don't collocalize to the same set of variants. So you actually got two separate signals from your collocalization results. And then, actually, if you look at... Actually, if you look at, so you'll be like, oh, yeah, so maybe you've got two very correlated privileges, and they might just be one. But if you actually go about fitting it, then your model tells you, no, no, you got to accept them, right? And the correlation between the two private sites are like, you know, 1,18. And those sites are actually going like this. Probably people see that in practice as well. You know, the variants are going to overlap like this, but they just don't end up at the same participant. So I guess still the conclusion is probably, you know, this whole area is of interest. Area is of interest, and there's probably some mediation effects across the board. But if you talk about fun mapping to the causal variance, you have some still challenges with LGBT. Even if your model suggested very strongly that you've got to separate them, but still, this might be a tricky case to resolve. Now we move on to category number two, where we talk mostly about T-Walls and MR. So I think we have lots of So, I think we have lots of thoughts on TWAS previously and them today, you know, next. But here, I just want to mention a specific aspect when you do the multi-tweight or multi-context T-WALS. It's that even for one T-WAS, we know that we're looking at the direction of effects. They've got to be consistent with G-Walls, that's fine. And then otherwise, you don't have any kind of flavor in G-Walls, which suggests you've got to be unified, otherwise, you don't have a signal. Otherwise, you don't have a signal. But if you look at one QTL at a spine, yes, that's probably going to work. However, just imagine if you're talking about different QTL, let's say here is the nonsense Nikki decay QTL, and here's the EQTL next here is yours. Then you know in principle, if you really believe in a causal change, then it's actually going to be, if you've got positive effects on the nonsense V decay, you got to get a negative effect in expression, and then you got an increase in the AD in the chain. Increase in AD in the GLOS risk. So, in that setting, this configuration would make sense, but this configuration will not. Even if you actually get something. So, yeah, I think we probably still need a principle way to model this kind of cross-modality challenges and take into consideration some of the causal directions. But what we do is something kind of exploratory, so it's not rough. But as people know, TWAS has lots of methods. We just do it for the sake of. We just did for the sake of informatics convenience, we put everything into one package and has lots of it's an R package very easy to use and put some of the methods there that are not typically designed for like, you know, T-Walls. And we put a bunch of the, there's a couple of new methods we developed and put Parser over there in this package. Especially for the multi-variable MR, it's incorporation is phone value. And my student Angian, Professor Yongpang, drive this kind of effort to develop the package there, so we apply this. So, we apply this to our data. So, the story I'm going to show is on the PCOM region, which for some reason is very interesting in our, but it's a very important LSN species gene, and it has to do with the cell membrane structures. And then it's also very highly interested in the fungen AD conforming. So, we were asked to look into this gene in particular. So, if you do the multivariate fun mapping, taking different cell types of fashion, and then do file mapping that way. You know, do farm up in that way, supposedly control follicularity and everything. You see something quite interesting here. If you gotta look into the sign-off effect, remember I said that, right? So if you look at the sign-off effect, you see the oligodendrocyte, actually, so you got, first of all, you got three credible sites. And for these two credible sites over here, so consistently for oligodendrocyte, it has a positive effect. And for microglia and astrocyte, it got a negative effect. And then for some neurons, you got... You know, some neurons you got also causal effects. So, even after counting for LD, actually for one variant, it can have different direction of effects from different cell types. However, as you can see, these cell types are still consistent in effect size, right? So imagine doing TWAS. It's going to be significant. So that's what we did. So we did TWAS, we saw it's actually significant in astrocyte, in some microglia, in oligodendrocyte, and also in etc. neurons. Etc. neurons. But then, you know, as you know, Xiang and Xin, they probably earlier this year, you got to consider the LDH hacking in the TWAS problem. So you got a multi-context to see T-WAST where you're not only looking into, you basically put a bunch of genes in the same region in the same model with the companion SNAPs across multiple contexts, and you do large variables like model value. It actually highlights the estrocytes and microglia TOOS results. Microglia TOOS results as pullative of causal, and the other ones are like a sub-threshold. So, yeah, so in a sense, I mean, it kind of makes sense, but if you only look at the marginal association, you'll probably conclude that it's going to have an effect across the board. You've got to keep in mind that the effect size directions are also opposite. So, this is when you look and zoom into this, you find something like that. It's hard to completely comprehend that at this point right now. At this point, right now. But at least if you take these two cell types, the effect size direction and everything, they seem to have made sense from the biological perspective. But these quality effects is kind of like puzzling. So yeah, so that's that story for category number two. So for category number three, you talk about known GWAS level side, but you can have multiple gene targets, right? And usually people do QTL, they focus Do QTL, they focus on one gene, they look at sys window around it, they don't really look into like multi-gene scenarios. So, what we do is we kind of design a sys window with the database for topological association domains tag for brains and blood, and kind of creates a much larger window. We try to ask the question, you know, what's going on in the large window with multiple genes if you try to analyze them jointly. So, we got two approaches for that. One is to simply apply our fundamental approach, MBCUC. Our final approach. I mean, we since you got to do some tweaks there, but bottom line is that you will be able to apply that to analyze multiple genes at the same time. And we can take a look at, you know, this is kind of the prevalence given by the local results. And you can see that we got four preval sets near the MACT region, which is very important for Household's disease, right? And you got a predile set. The other three are pretty small and clean, right? Two of them, you get just one sneak. And one of them, you got a One SNP. On one of them, you got four SNPs, but the minimum correlation is 95%. But for the other one, it's tricky, you got 20 SNPs, and the minimum correlation is 97%. So it's hard to distinguish. But actually, you know, we were doing this type window-based approach. We went a little aggressive in practice by using a sliding type window. So we consider three type windows at a time, just in case I'm missing something. Actually, it's a type window with type one, and we consider three of them. It's a large region. So this results, actually, you know, this variant belongs to the Actually, you know, this variant belongs to the other type of field, and this one all belongs to the same type of node. So you have a reason to think that these genes might do something with each other. And if you double-check the correlation of the prevalence, well, this is R, not R squared. So yeah, those still have some low correlation, but relatively small. And the sign of the correlation of matches, what you see. Now, what's puzzling is really, you know, for MAC T, you got a netting fact. And for all the other genes, And for all the other genes, the effect size are positive. So that's actually quite interesting. And if you look into the univariate results in this region, just do fine mapping and align the results together. We simply can't map the MAPT. However, if you do like co-localization with multiple traits, you'll be able to get it. But the problem is that you have to analyze multiple traits. So the argument here is that even if you just have one PTS study, by taking a multi-gene approach, they may increase your power. However, you need more However, it will be a little difficult if you want to study what's going on with these genes, how they interact with each other. It's going to be follow-up studies. I think I still have a few minutes for another story, which kind of like, you know, also challenged a winning. Okay, then okay, so I think that's probably it. We got some fun stories as well, but I'm going to Paul stop here and see if you like questions. I think we've got questions. Take away from your trans analysis. Okay, so I think the more is another scheme that I think is interesting is that, you know, because we're AD-oriented, we're able to do the transfer lots of context for all the genes, but 4% are satisfied. For all the genes, but 4% of sites are variants. So the variance has to be 80 significant in some locations, or some has some cis underpinning in here. It's a new method called trans CC, so we're able to detect the trans programs. So it's a program of genes. So the heat map I was showing is that the program of genes, we got a list of problems of genes, and we got the enrichment in different pathways, and lots of them actually, you know, we can tell they make sense for brain disorders. The typical message is we got nine genes. Message is: We got nine genes for trans that's never been associated with AD in a GWAS setting, but they were actually pointing to because they are so far away, right? But if you look at the literature and for those genes, you can see different functional studies with AUD, but never linked to the ADG boss. So, I think, yeah, so it probably goes within this of nine genes, but maybe some of them can help. Thank you very much. Uh, we'll come back after We come back so we're sorry.
