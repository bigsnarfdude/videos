Okay, thank you for the introduction and thank you to the organizer for the kind invitation. It's a pleasure to be here. This is a joint work with Guillier Gresh from the University of Savoy in Mont Blanc and Pierre Manuel Javan from the Pennsylvania University of Montague. It's a a very recent result A very recent result that achieves an important challenge because it's the first time that the mean field limit of the Foketland equation has been justified rigorously. Although it has been an open problem for many years. And a second interesting And a second interesting thing is that once we have introduced some new ideas and how to deal with the problem, the final result has been obtained in a very simple manner. Then, the good. Then the idea is to deal with a system of n stochastic particles and to And to well, this these stochastic particles are governed by the Newton laws, the second order Newton law, with some singular interaction. And the idea is to study the behavior of this system of particles when the number of particles is very large. In fact, when you try to obtain some limit, you obtain some kinetic. Obtain some limit, you obtain some kinetic equation, the plus of Poisson Fokerplan equation. And to do that, one of the new ingredients is to propose a new hierarchy of equations that allow to gradually incorporate new particles in the system. And the problem is how to transport some norm, some LP norm, wait in an LP. In order to have some compactness with compactness at the end, and part of the that we do is really to obtain some weighted Lp north or the marginal of the system. We define what is the marginal of the system. And this hierarchy allows to consider singular interaction kernels, in particular. Singular interaction kernel, in particular Colombian international kernel via Poisson kernel. Okay, this is the system. The system under consideration is a system, a second-order system where the variables are the position of the particle and the velocity of the particles. The usual derivative of the velocity, the position is the velocity and the dynamic. The position is the velocity, and the dynamics of the velocity is given by the interaction, the piways interaction between the particles, plus some stochastic VNR process, which are independent for each particle, independent VNR process, and K is the interaction curve. Then the Then we are interested in kernels that are the minus the gradient of a potential, and this potential will be repulsive and non-negative. Okay, we comment how to eliminate some of these hypotheses later. And then we have interest in Colombian interaction, which you know very well. In dimension two is something like the logarithm. Something like the logarithmic, and in dimension 3 is 1 over x to the power t minus 3. Then, for simplicity, we consider that the particle move in a torus. The only difference between a torus and in our calculus and The only difference is that you consider Rd, then you also must control the decay of the solution at infinity. But the proof is also valid. And the idea to consider Coulomb interaction is that correct. Long interaction is that correspond to point charge, which is the natural model for plasmas. That is the idea, the motivation of our study. And the diffusion here is given only, as you see, in velocity. And that means the collision in velocity with the background. A background with a given background. We can even consider, as you see later, that the diffusion is zero, the system without diffusion. Then, in the model that we are in mind, this plasma, the number of particles, the usual, the typical number of particles is of order 10 to the 20 or 10 to the 25. Then a natural question is, natural question is what happens in the continuum limits for the system, the dynamical system for the n particles. And then that we expect is to in the limit we have this Blasso-Poisson-Fouquet Pran equation, which is the evolution of one particle distribution function f which represents the probability to find a particle in position. find a particle in position x with velocity d in time t. This is a transport equation, this is a transport in position, this is the transport in velocity and this is the diffusion in velocity. The transport in velocity here give the non-linear and non-local relation because this is the convolution of the Kerner K with ρ and ρ is the density which is nothing but the integral of F. That the integral of f with respect to v. And then the idea of the work is to try to rigorously prove that the limit of this system of equations converges to this one when you have a Colombian type interaction. Okay, some remarks that the first one is the That the first one is that there is no real differences between the repulsive and attractive interaction kernel in our proof. We have select repulsive kernel only in one of the points that we show you in the proof is necessary that the kernel is remote, okay? But to Okay, but I will comment how to even include the attractive case. The second is that it's more difficult in general to obtain estimate in the stochastic case. The only thing that help in the stochasticity is that in the in the the final in the limit case in the blasphem for care plan, you have some extra regularity. Some extra regularity, but for the estimate is more difficult in the stochastic case. The third remark is that we know a lot of things about the limiting equation. In fact, the limiting equation has been studied for many years ago and there is a s uh result, for example, with respect to the system of classical solution by the classical war for Pardos, Foucault. Of Pardos, Fukay, the government, and the seminal work of Illeon Alpertan and many other people. But also, for example, our group are interested in a weak commercial solution. Also, Francois Bouchou and many people study the asymptotic behavior of different regimes in of the solution. For example, Honor Strauss and our group with Vasquez and Conides. The fourth remark is that first order system is much better understood than the second order system in order to pass to the limits. The first order system, you have here the evolution of the position in terms of the interaction of the position with the kernel k if you want to add some stochasticity possible. And then in this case, that you expect is this. That you expect is this equation, and this equation now depends on the time and the position. And this equation, remember many of the equations what we are interested in, or many people are interested in, for example, Keller-Segel, the Keller-Segel system, when you choose K as the Colombian. As the Colombian interaction kernel, then you have Keller Seger and people like Ceteko, Juan Yu, Pickel, or Press, Javan, and one has been recently interested in the limit from this system to this system. But also, for example, Euler-Unavier-Stock equation. Because if F is the vorticity, here U. The vorticity here U could be represented by the convolution of the K with the vorticity, then you have our Navier-Stokes or Euler equation. And the limit of the relation between these two systems has been in the 80s or 90s involved in the relation between vortex methods and and the earlier equation by the classical war of Chorin, Maida, Goldman, Cote, etc. And recently, from a new perspective, many people like Vassimo Beyev, Dueric Javan Wong, and more recently Serfati tried to connect these two systems. In the case of Serfati, for example, She needs that u, u here is represented the the velocity in the is represented by k convolution of f must be leaches. A leaches, for example, that does not include the vortex patch. We recently extended that to a space where vortex patch is is included, uh in with some hardy with hardy space. Hardy with hardy space. And then it's possible to include voltage patch. And the measure support, well, we will see measure supported online to define the voltage patch. Okay. In fact, a second-order model and first-order model are related to Blasso, Poisson, and Euler or Navier-Stokes in 2D. And the difficulty is from that second order that you work in four dimensions, and the second difficulty is that the regularity of rho. To have regularity of rho, you must have important decay properties of F with respect to B. In order that rho should be in some good space in order to define the In order to define the potential here. Okay? Even this relation between plasma-poisson or so-poisson Foucault-Klan, Euler and Navier-Stok have been used, for example, here I omit the physical constant, but if you introduce the physical constant, for example, to reprove the system of vortex uh Q through the so-called Through the so-called geokinetic limit by a very nio geokinetic limit from Bloisson to Euler equation or the word of Brenier about the so-called monokinetic data, well-prepared data where the data can be like a product of the arc mass in velocity and Position. And for example, in Blasso-Poisson-Foker plan, we can take the limit here, and that you obtain, for example, is the Auler equation without pressure. Okay, we return to our case, which is the limit of From here, from here, for example, the geokinetic limit, well, that depends on the constant that I omit here. Okay, I omit the constant here. The geokinetic is appear some exylon, well, I don't remember exactly, one over xylon here, I think. Okay? And other, well, for example, I do this in the plastic question-focused plat, the Plus of Poisson-Foker plan, the physical constant was a relation between the mean field path and the mean feed and the mean path and the mean velocity. This is a relation between these two that allow to to obtain the Aubier equation. And you have more text patch solutions in the Lazon also? In the Blaso-Poissons? Well, in the Blaso-Poisson case, in 1D, for example, this is you see that now you have four dimensions. And then it's necessary to define what is a vortex pass here because it's in the two variables or one variable. Sure. Okay? And then there is work about that. But it's not, I think it's an open. I think it's an an open problem. Okay, we return to this, which is our subject, the reverse ability from the system of particles to Plasma Foker plan. And let us comment some literature about this is not a big Not a big literature. For example, I think David comment on Monday the case in which K is leaches. If K is leaches, in the case of viscosity, then McKin proved the ribros limit and then in toprossing. In Tobrosin, Noinster, Braun and Help, and other people prove that the distance, for example, here in negative solar space, between the solution of the Blasso-Poisson with respect to the empirical measure, the empirical measure is nothing but the transport, the delta on the evolution of the of the dynamical system, okay, x of uh y of t of a of t. Of y of t, of a of t, the distance in this negative solid space is controlled by the distance of the initial data times the exponential of t times and the norm of the leaches of the kernel k. When you try to weaken this Weak to weak at this hypothesis, then the best result that I know is a result of Maximo Ray and El Emmanuel Javain, that they are able to, with that, in my opinion, very complicated way, to deal with this kind of kernel. And this kind of kernel is just in the limit of the Coulombian interaction. of the Coulombian interaction. And this was done in the deterministic case. In the stochastic case, in dimension one, recently also Massimo A and Salem proved in 1D that the this limit can be possible to do erosion. But note that in 1D the kernel is leached. Then this And that people do when d is uh greater than one is the so-called truncated kernel. In fact, that they do is introduce some epsilon here that depends on the number of particles and this epsilon here depends on the number of particles and this theta here there is a critical value is 1 over d and this critical value D and this critical value is the limit in which the potential energy of the kinetic energy don't blow up. And then the most recent paper result in this framework was done by Pickel and collaborators in the last two years, and the result is the following. Following, they are able to prove not arrive to the critical case, all it for theta less than one. That means that the data must be well prepared, not for all the data they are able to prove the limit. And then they prove with the probability that there is some positive constant, that the probability is the basis basis the distance between the solution or the. Solution of the Blasso Poisson with respect to the empirical measure, then this probability that this is less than some constant at the benefit of n is nearly zero when you pass to the limit. But that is the history until now. And then what we do is, first of all, is to introduce a new hierarchy of equations. A new hierarchy of equations that allows to introduce new particles. For that, first of all, you can deduce a full Jungi law for a system of particles, that is, the probability to find a particle x1, xn, could already be v1, vn. And if you put here the solution of the dynamical system and you take the derivative. Dynamical system, and you take the derivative in time, then you obtain this equation. Okay? Then we need a notion of solution for this one, and this notion of solution also requires a velocity decay control for rho to define rho n, like in the continuous case. And this is one of the differences with the first-of-the-system. Of the system. Then, what is the marginal? The marginal we define like when you have the marginal for the k, you have is only the integral of the fn we reconstruct before, the integral between the particle, say, k plus 1 and tn. Okay? And then the concept of solution now is given all this. Now is given all these marginals. It's a concept of solution that implies a kind of entropy solution, the natural one in this case. Okay, to do that it's necessary to propagate some velocity in order to well define the density. How to propagate the density? If you try to propagate, for example, Gaussian E to the power E squared Gaussian moments that is not well defined in the discrete level. And you need to incorporate the potential to the Gaussian to well propagate this moment. How to do that? We define some reduced energy. Some reduced energy for to the order k, which is the sum of the kinetic energy plus the potential energy. And that is possible to prove that it's the reduced operator here. You see that this reduced operator is nothing that is nothing that uh this operator reduced to to k, okay, the sound to k then that is a nice property that the L K over E K is zero. Okay, then we can define the solution and the solution Solution and the solution, netro B solution, are solution, in principle, bounded, and the marginal of this solution must verify this inequality. Observe that this inequality is nothing that multiply the equation formally by E to the power this energy. Okay, here you contain the kinetic energy plus the potential energy times some power of. Times some power of energy. And this must be positive. That's what it means. That is nothing that is verified, for example, for classical solutions. You multiply, you integrate by part, and you assume that you have some singularity. At the end, you need some hypothesis that is the same that appears in conservation law, and this is the And this is the condition that we would give it. And we are able to prove that renormalized solution or my solution associated to this equation also verify this property. Then this is the framework where we work, the framework of solution where we work. Okay, this is our result. This is the in-dimensional two. The hypotheses are: okay, you have a kernel and You have a kernel, and this kernel is in LP for P greater than 1. That is true, for example, for Colombian interaction 1 over X. That will be it. Also, this property is important, and this is the difference between dimension 2 or dimension 3, because in dimension 2, 5 is the minus. Phi is the minus the logarithm, and the logarithmic is integrated over here. Then the second hypothesis is that the initial data can be tensorized in the sense that F0 is the initial data of the Blasso Poisson that you want to obtain the limit, and then this converts weakly, in L1 for example, to the tensorized solution. to add uh the tensorized solution here in zero k for t equal to zero also the marginal uh must be uh bounded but not bounded uniformly the bounded depending on the okay and okay the initial data must be must have this momentum Gaussian momentum bound then if you have Then, if you have all these hypotheses, then there exists a time star, it's a small time, at the end of this constant m, this b, which is given previously, okay, and the norm of k. And then the marginal converts to the tensor product of this. This F is the solution of the plasma possible. And this converges weakly in LP. That means that, in the language of physical language, probably, that this is a strong propagation of cows. Note that this propagation of cows, usually, in the classical books or some classical books of physics, are assumed. Are assumed is not a proof. Here is a proof. And what happened in the first order? Because our proof is also valid for first order. In the first order, we need to, the hypothesis are the same, but we need additional hypothesis that this is one. The negative part of the divergence of k must be bounded. Must be bound. Okay? And then if you have that, you have the same result. You have the propagation of curves. Note that this hypothesis is not in the model that we have in mind, like Euler equation, it's zero or even Keller-Seger, works. But we are trying to eliminate these hypotheses, and for the moment, if we try to eliminate these hypotheses, There, we have a problem, a partial result, and the partial result is that we need to increase here until 2. Then we are not able to consider Colombian or singular, but until 2. That means that 1 over X is not included. Well, in general, case for dimension 2 and 3, okay, the Okay, the fact of this is a little more the hypothesis are the following. Do you need that initial marginals with respect to this exponential of the reduced energy are bounded for if zero, if this if zero plays an important role and also F n which is bounded by With this mounted by dust, and then we are able to propagate and we can try to propagate this for all time. And this is without assume that the initial data are factorized. So then, if you assume that. Then, if you assume that that factorizes, also you are able to prove that the result is chaotic. Well, some remarks. The result is valid only for finite time. Our result is qualitative, not quantitative. We are not able to prove the able to prove the exact rate of decay. If we want to prove that, we need more. We need k in L2, then we avoid, but we have the limit. And well, this result can be extended to other, for example, in statistically in probability, mild singular kernel of type K is in L P and Is in LP and phi is this bound. Okay, another one. And the proof that I have no time to do, but we have in mind to do, does not apply directly to dimension 3 because this hypothesis that we need that is finite here is infinite when you have in dimension 3. Okay. Then we are working on that. And in the proof, the only point that we use the positivity of the repulsive character of the potential is in one moment where we need to bound the kinetic energy for the reduced energy. And then with this positive, then it's positive. And then, with this positive, then it's easier. What happens with this negative? It is attractive. And that we do is once you have an initial energy, we can valve the potential energy in terms of the kinetic energy. And a maximum and a minimum. And the initial energy. And then with that, you are able to also introduce the attractive chemistry. This is the well this is the the the this is the the the the hierarchy of equation okay and the only thing is to try to to to control this part the proof okay but and we are able to propagate the L P norm and it's it's it's important to propagate the L P norm it's To propagate the LP norm, it's a weighted LP norm because at the contrary, you must use this mixture norm LP in space, L1 in velocity. And it is not good for the propagation. And the result is this one. This is the LP weighted norm that we propagate. Okay, and this is that gives that gives R the O. Can give us the opportunity to have some compactness and to pass to the limit. Thank you. So I have two questions. Thank you for the work on this. So the first question comes. So the first question, how generic is your assumption about factorized time of initial paper? How generic is? Yeah. Well, you have some, well, the only thing is that you have some initial data in the Blassov equation. The property of the initial data you see is that some momentum are bounded, etc. And then the you you Uh you you you can uh it is quite generic once you have this this this F F zero done, okay. But it's it's it's so generic as the property of this F0 you have. Can you explain again this the kinetic energy models the idea? The kinetic energy, but what's the idea? This one? Yeah. Know that. Oh, sorry. But we can see here. Know that here you have this is positive. Okay, this is the kinetic remember thus that Remember that this is positive and now this is positive. Okay? Because you are in the torus, then you have minus logarithmic, then it is positive. Okay? And then the idea is that you put Is that you control you control section you control with this hypothesis where here you control for the you control all the moments here okay from the initial configuration and then Configuration and then you control that then that you have is that you can obtain any norm in the density and that help you. Well, this is uh a part of the proof uh and the other private you ma you And the other project, you need to use this one with the propagation of the control of the evolution of the position. You see this control in terms of the initial value of the data. And then you must control this. These at the same time with the other estimation. General lines, the proof. So I don't see exactly the proof where or how you overcome the the the attractive case, so if the text positive the same Coulombian uh interaction dimension. Action dimension. Well, here and it's here in the here, and the paper is not done. We eliminate that, but now we have a new result. And then when you have an initial energy, because you have an initial energy, okay, then you must relate the kinetic energy, the potential energy, with the initial mass and the And the energy. There is our relation. We obtain a relation, and we did a relation. In fact, it's inspired by our paper that I do with Jan Tolboa for the attractive case, then you can power the potential energy in terms of upper and lower power. And with some constant in front of this. In front of this kinetic energy, then you try, then you obtain, and then you can add the potential thermal positive. So you give me a negative that you can control with some constant in front of the you see that you have one plus d squared. Okay, you can control this one or some constant there with the negative part. But then do you have? But then do you have mm theta small enough to com control the the negative part? Like to theta what is theta? Theta is the strength. You need theta small enough, no? Or hey, what theta or takes the parameter that you use for for Or indicating whether there is attractive or cohesive interactions? No, no, ah. So you can control that with the with the with the with the
