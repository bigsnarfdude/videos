Thank you very much. I will tell you a little story today about something we developed. The author of this talk, like Paul and Ron and myself. I think Paul is in the audience, probably, right? Anyway. Yes, please. Yeah, hi, Paul. So we recently published this book upon which I will. Upon which I will base my talk. I don't know if you can see it in the camera. Kind of, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So this book here has just appeared a few months ago this year, and it has been, as I said, co-authored by Paul and Ron. It made total sense, Charles Goulson's moto back then. However, this moto However, this motto has been recently revised by Frank Nies, who is a distinguished quantum chemistry contemporary, a distinguished quantum chemist of contemporary with us. And he was very kind to contribute the preface of this book, the foreword of the book. And he revised the motto of Charles Goulson by saying, we need to have insight. We need to have insights and numbers, not one or the other. So, I hope this little story I'm going to tell you shows you how we can get a little bit of both and how can one lead to the other without having the elegant connection that we as theoreticians would like to see. So, as maybe you have seen in Shubin's Seen in Shubin's talk, there is many, many descriptors, and the gap between descriptors between quantum chemistry results, like the results of solving the Schrodinger equation and the chemical space and the descriptor space. There are several big gaps in between values that separate these domains. Here is one of these books that they're here in. One of these books that they're here in my library back. And I put here an item just to show you the size of the book, you know, a regular item here and a scale here to see how thick this thing is. Number two here, volume two is just the reference. So it's enormous. There are many, many descriptors. So why do we need another descriptor? And these localization, the localization matrices I am about to describe are essentially a descriptor. Do we need one more? Do we need 3,300 and 300? More we need 3301 and why? Well, in this case, you will see that this descriptor that I'm about to show you depends or is extracted, is based on the electron density and the pair density. It is applicable to a very wide diversity of molecular types, including series that have similar effects and/or activities and properties, yet have. Properties yet have very diverse molecular structure, not even a common skeleton. And that's a big difficulty in the molecular descriptor realm. And hence, it is one of the advantages that these LDMs, as we call them, offer. And maybe this LDM has an inherent type of mathematical elegance, but this is, of course, in the eyes of the beholder. Of the beholder. The origin of the work is rooted in this paper back then in 2014, where the concept of the electron localization and delocalization matrices has been introduced. And of course, it was developed much further from that because of the work of Paul Ayers and Ismat Sumar, his student, and subsequently our shared master. Our shared master's student at St. Mary's University in his thesis, and ISMAT takes a lot of credit for developing this area, including the programming aspects. Now, networks are everywhere around us. Your cell phone is connected to a network, your biochemical reaction in your body or in your cell are a network, and the plan of the metro is a network, the Facebook connections. The Facebook connections, the pandemics, networks are everywhere, and molecules are not an exception. A molecule is also a network, and by a network, we mean simply, of course, there is a whole field of mathematics that describes networks mathematically, but in two words, a network is just a connection between points and vertices linking these points. So, of course, we have molecules, which are basically a network of atoms and bonds. So, the question now is how to represent a network mathematically. And you may remember from simple graph theory that you can abstract, let's say, a very simple molecular skeleton here, where you condense the hydrogen into the carbons. So, you see only carbons, and you can. Carbons and you can have here triple bond, you have single bond, double bond here, and you can number these numbers, these atoms, and then you place a bond order here in the connectivity matrix, as they do in chemical graph theory. And this is one of the very basic network representations of a network. There are several, several of those by the dozens of different types of representation, but this is one of the simplest one. Of course, it depends on the numbering. One of course, it depends on the numbering because if I change the numbering here, the shape of the matrix will you will interchange rows and columns, and hence the matrix will change. So, you eventually you will have to extract some matrix invariants out of this. So, there is, before I go on, I want to contrast two types vertex is connected by an edge like this one, like number one has a connection to. Like number one has a connection to three, two, four, five, et cetera, and one that where only subsets of vertices are connected by edges, such as this one. So, of course, this one is much richer in connectivity information than this one. So, here is the regular ball and stick model of a molecule, acetic acid. Contrast this view with this one. This one includes. This one includes what other workers have called in the literature electron delocalization channels. And this is basically the pathways through which electrons are delocalized between different atoms and not because two atoms do not share a bond or better say a bond path. They do not interact. Of course, they do. And of course, the Oviedo group came up with all sorts. Yedo group came up with all sorts of method to analyze molecular energy to decompose it into self and interacting term, as you all know, the so-called IQA or interacting quantum atoms of Angel Martin Pendas and co-workers. So this is a contrasting view whereby you can actually define a quantity between every pair of atoms that correlates. Pair of atoms that correlate with what the chemist, the organic chemist, would call electron delocalization or electron sharing. And Bader has defined that index as the index of delocalization. So the matrices, the LDMs, are based, as I just happened to mention, on the quantum theory of atoms in molecules developed by Vader. And as you all know as well, that And as you all know as well, that if you look at the slice in the electron density, let's say in the plane of the nuclei of a base pair here, cytosine-guanine, then you have, of course, the cusps at the position of the nuclei. And in between, you have the bond path here that you can see between every pair of bonded atoms. And the bond path defines the chemical structure or the chemical graph in Q-Tame. And you can have. And you can have the subtle points here. And if you look at the gradient vector field, you partition the space into different atoms, and all this is well known. So, here is the same plot showing the different atoms in the same base pair, cytoxingoanine, where it is color-coded by both atomic nature, like oxygen is more red, and also by the contour of the density. So, you see both the contours of the density and the gradient vector field here. The gradient vector field here that goes to the attractor, which is the nuclear critical point. And you can see the bond path here, and you can see the surfaces, the zero flux surfaces that separate the atom from each other. Now you can integrate the correlation, the total correlation of the electrons of a given spin between any basin, let's say this nitrogen and this oxygen. And you get the total correlation between the alpha electrons and an equivalent expression for the beta electrons. Expression for the beta electrons, sum them up, sum their magnitudes, because these are negative numbers, you get the. I apologize, I said I jumped ahead here. If you integrate both space variable on one atomic basin, you get the total number of electrons that are on average exchanging within the same basin. And hence, you count the number of electrons that are localized on average in this basin. Are localized on average in this basin. In contrast, I can, instead of doing both integrals on the same volume, I can do it on the two volumes here, green and yellow. And in this case, Bader also define a delocalization index whereby you have where it counts the number of electrons that are shared between these two basins. Now, these numbers are not independent. Numbers are not independent. There is a conservation principle at work. The number of electrons, the population of a basin, an atom in a molecule, is given by the number of localized electron and half of its total delocalization indices to all the other atoms in the molecule. And of course, the atomic charge is just simply related to that number, the total population, by taking it off. By taking it off the atomic number. And since the atomic population can be obtained by, by the way, these of course come from the pair density and the integrals that you've seen in the previous slide. But this one comes from the integral of the electron density, the simple electron density. And hence, you can have an equation equating the number of electrons. Equating the number of electrons for a certain atom, given as a sum of number of localized electrons and number of delocalized electrons, half of the number of total delocalized electron of that atom was every other atom in the molecule. And this can be directly calculated by a simple integral of the electron density. And we call this the Bader summation rule. Here is an example, extreme example. We have a localized ion. Ionic system, lithium fluoride, whereby the electrons are pretty much localized. And what you can see here, these are the isosurfaces of the isosurface that have an electron density equal to the density at the bond critical point that give you more or less a shape of the inner electrons. And you can see it is spherical here in terms of a complete transfer of charge, while it is not spherical, it is hydrogen. It is not spherical. It is highly distorted in the case of covalent bonding here in CH4. And this is reflected well in, and the outer one is the Van der Waal surface here, but this is well reflected in the delocalization index. As you can see here, you have very little delocalization between these two 0.2, while here in the covalent bond, you have almost one shared electron. And the ones that are not speaking to each other, the hydrogens here, have very low delocalization index. Delocalization index, and of course, the number of localized electrons plus half of this number give you the atomic charges as described before. So, given that, given this conservation principle, we can cast this information in matrix form whereby we sum. We have this sum here. I have the localization index along the diagonal, and the delocalization. Along the diagonal, and the delocalization index elsewhere in this symmetric matrix now, whereby you have the delocalization. So, this is atom number one, atom number two, atom number three, the columns and row one, atom number two, atom number three, et cetera. And you have along the diagonal the localization index of every given basin. And off diagonal, which are equal by symmetry, the delocalization index is not sensitive to. Index is not sensitive to which volume you integrate one variable and which volume you integrate the other variable, you have the dirocalization index. And if you sum any column or row, you get the total number of electron the population of the given basin here, basin omega 1. Here is the basin omega 2, etc. And of course, if you sum everything, you get n, the total number of electrons in the molecule, and the same. Electrons in the molecule, and the same here if you sum the rows. So, the chemical information contained in this matrix is enormous because it by construction, of course, it contained information about the localization and the localization of the electrons in the molecule, but also it contained information on electron population, volumes, charges, molecular similarity, as we shall see in a moment, the complete graph of the molecule, molecular. Graph of the molecule molecular geometry because these indices depend on the actual geometry. Bond strength, which also the delocalization index is highly correlated with the bond order, the classical bond order, for example. And to give you just one example, atomic charges here. So here it is. This is the same molecule, the acetic acid. You can see here along the diagonal. Along the diagonal, you have the number of localized electrons in a given basin. Oxygen has like eight electrons, the carbon has, this carbon has about three, etc. This one has four. And these are the half of the delocalization index between that carbon two and that carbon one and here between carbon one and carbon two, etc. And if you sum one colon here, you get the, and you take a negative of it, you get the negative. And you take a negative of it, you get the negative of the population of this carbon here, which is minus 5.98 electrons. Sum with the number of the atomic number, you get the charging atomic unit here of that carbon and so forth. So the charges are somehow coded in this matrix, yet not explicitly. Now, how to extract chemical information, how to use this empirically to predict properties. To predict properties of series of compounds which are highly diverse, as I mentioned at the beginning. Well, the simplest possible thing you can do if you have matrices of same size and if you have, and these are all big ifs, if you have similar size molecules and hence matrices, and if you have a consistent way of labeling the atoms, then you can take the Frobenius distance, which Frobinius distance, which is defined as the Frobenius norm of the difference matrix. So you take every element of one matrix minus the equivalent element in the other matrix, square it, and take the sum of the squares. And that, of course, if the distance is zero, the molecules are identical and if the distance is zero, the molecules are identical and it grows as the dissimilarity of the molecule grows. Of the molecular growth. So it's a measure of molecular similarity. So examples of application of LDMs in quantitative structure to activity relationships. If it doesn't work for this simple case, it won't work. So this is really the beginning. This is the simplest possible thing one can do as a first test. Here you have the substitute of the The substituted acetic acid substituted with fluorine, and you can see here that Frobenius distance from the parent molecule, which is the unsubstituted acetic acid, is related, very strongly correlated with the PKA. This is the simplest thing. It's not very interesting, but it's the first test. Now, this one is more difficult. These are properties that depend on branching of hexenes, let's say. Of hexanes, let's say. So the boiling point, I mean, all of these have been studied. We have tons of examples in the book. I'm just mentioning here two or three in this talk, given the time, but the book is full of examples of predicting properties accurately and when you have a difficult case to model using other descriptors. So here is the example that I just saw. The example that I just said, that I just mentioned, I have the five isomers of hexane. This is the parent compound to be compared with, and these are the distances between the different isomers and that compound. And this is the boiling point. As you can see, the boiling point is highly correlated with the Frobenius distance from the parent compound. And as you go, the parent compound is the most branched. The parent compound is the most branched, and so the localization, delocalization matrix here is capturing something about the branching of the compound. Aromaticity of rings in molecules, a ring in a molecule. So in a study we did with Paul and his student, and Ron, his student Isma Sumar, we have looked at these benzene poly Benzene polycondensed benzene molecules, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, whereby we are going to compare rings within the molecule with benzene. So here we are limiting the matrices to submatrices that describe only one ring at a time. So for instance, in this molecule, for example, finane, this is the submatrix. This is the submatrix that describes only that carbon skeleton within the molecule. So, number carbon number 1, 2, 3, you can see it here, 1, 2, 3, 4. This is the submatrix of that particular carbon skeleton. And the B here is in the white, and the C is in the yellow downstairs. And if you compare this with any number of aromaticity measurements, such as the Measurements, such as the home and the harmonic oscillator model of Krigowski et al., you will find a strong correlation with the distance Fobenius between benzene and the benzene carbon skeleton and any of these rings in this set of molecules. The last point I wanted to show with you. Show with you. I mean, if I have time, because I am Sergei told me that I may have like 15 more minutes, so maybe I will show you one more example. But at least for now, the principal component analysis, and this is an idea that was advanced by Ron Cook in this paper here, and then we used it for other properties, like for example, modeling the stress corrosion cracking inhibitors, the efficiency of stress corrosion cracking. Efficiency of stress corrosion cracking. And they are measured. You put a wire here in a very controlled condition where you adjust the ionic strands, the pH, the temperature, and you put different weights down. And you basically measure the cross-section change versus elongation after a certain time. And you compare with the air test. And you can see here that there is. And you can see here that there is this curve. This is the experimental curve. And we will see how do we reconstruct the experimental curve using the principal component analysis. And I'm sorry, I forgot to mention that here in this modeling approach, the matrix like this is basically considered as a set of numbers. So you look at this, you know, it's like you use. Know is like you use principal component analysis to extract essentially as a tool to extract invariance from this. And why we do that because the molecules that you will see in a moment are highly diverse. You don't have a consistent skeleton where you can basically define the Frobenius distance univocally. So, this is the reason we're doing this modeling here. Like, here are the set Like, here are the set of textbook-type corrosion inhibitors. So, how do I compare these? They are totally different. So, Ron has done the LDM analysis. He has done the calculations, extracted the LDMs, and then he has used the principal component as the tools to model the property. To model the property, the predicted extension under stress corrosion, under a corrosive medium. I apologize, it's too late here. I'm really tired. So you can see here that all the compounds are fitting the line very nicely, yet there are a disaster. There is a disaster going on here. There is this mercaptobenzociazole, mercaptoben-benzimidazole, and phenylthy. And pheninthi urea. All of them, by the way, have SH group or S. You know, here it's like written as S, but it can be like SH here. So these mercapto compounds or thio compounds, according to the hypothesis that was made by Ron, they are liable to be oxidized by the anodic current. By the anodic current into a dimer. So every one of those SH will form a dimer at the anode of the part of the half circuit of the corrosion current. And you form these SS bonds. And now, when he modeled the molecule and take the principal component using these dimers rather than Using these dimers rather than the textbook. This is from the textbook. When you do the dimers, here's what you get: boom, everybody's on the same line, including the thio-mercaptotypes corrosion inhibitor. Everybody is falling in line. Now, maybe I can close here because if there is time after the question, I can show you one more. After the question, I can show you one more very interesting example that I omitted originally because I didn't know I will have time. So, and I say here in lieu of a conclusion, because it's not really a conclusion, a standard conclusion, this is really an informal talk as far as I'm concerned. So the LDM, we view it as a bridge between quantum chemistry because it uses the result of quantum chemistry, then uses some of the concepts from graph. From graph chemical graph theory to extract invariant and try to use it empirically to predict the properties of compounds. I haven't shown you any of that or only two. I touched on very on two very small areas here, but there is tons of examples in the book whereby we have different chapters where we predict mosquito repellency. Repellency, or this is not in the book, but corrosion inhibition, other types of corrosion inhibition, different PKA rate constants, enthalpy of formation, heat of combustion, enthalpy of vaporization, boiling points, and aromaticity. Of course, predicting is not. Here is this book. I highly recommend this book. This is in French. If you read French, it's a really highly recommended book because, and I've heard Professor Rald Hoffman refer it. Professor Rald Hoffman referred to this book many times in his talks about artificial intelligence. Because if I don't want to misquote Professor Hoffman, but to my little understanding or my humble understanding is that he is cautious about the overuse of artificial intelligence in that it is not providing, it may not be sufficient to provide insight. Provide insight, but it's very useful to predict properties. So that's what I understood from Professor Hoffman's talk. But here I am quoting the same book because I showed you an example whereby we have an empirical method here to extract invariance, use it empirically, and by the behavior. And by the behavior of the fitting, it actually shed light on the mechanism of prevention of corrosion inhibition in terms of identifying the active species. It is not the textbook monomer species, but rather these dimers. So that's the importance of the work. So, in other words, as we have seen about an hour ago by About an hour ago, by Professor Shubin Liu, and here's the proof I was in your talk, Shubin: that the jump from the Hamiltonian to property, subspace, and understanding is not always straightforward. Yet I presented to you here a small example of a situation where this has been perhaps accomplished. At the end, I'd like to thank Michael Labor. I'd like to thank my collaborators, of course, in this work, Ron Cook and Paul. And mostly foremost, I mean, of course, Paul and Ron, but first and foremost, Ismat Sumar, because this is the student of Paul and a later of mine with Paul, who has programmed all the work, and without the work of whom this work wouldn't have been possible. And in the end, I'd like to close with a very famous Close with a very famous quote from a very famous writer, Argentinian writer, that I really like, Jorge Luis Borges, who says that all theories are legitimate and none has importance. What is important is what is being done with them. Shishey, thank you very much.
