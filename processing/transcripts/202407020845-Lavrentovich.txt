It's above. Oh, okay. Excellent. So I will present work on the newly discovered type of leaked crystals, the so-called pyroelectric pneumatics. And the work was done primarily by two graduate students who did the experiments. We collaborated with Maxim Lebrin. With Maxim Labrentovich, present here, who did some theory, and with our colleagues in Kiev, Ukraine, who with Natalie Tatsonis perform atomic imaging of thin films of paraelectric magnetic leak crystals. So a little bit of history. The mystery of leak crystal phase was first tackled by Max Born, who in Max Born, who in 1916 published a theoretical work that predicted the existence of orientationally ordered material, which he thought was the leaked crystal at the time. And he assumed that the molecules have strong dipole moments and they align parallel to each other and form a ferroelectric magnetic phase. Later that year, chemist synthesized. That year, chemist synthesized molecules that were without any dipole moments. They were quadrupolar and yet they formed the pneumatic lith crystal. And immediately the theory was proclaimed to be wrong and relegated to the status of the historical footprint. So, what happened since 1916 was, of course, the century, beautiful century of quadrupolar pneumatics that brought us all this. That brought us all these beautiful portable lick crystal displays. And then, very recently, in 2017, there were two papers that not many people paid attention to that stated that there is some interesting transition in some of the materials with a very strong dipole moment. And this paper suggested that probably has. Paper suggested that probably it has something to do with strong polar ordering. And if one looks at the value of the dipole moment, one would realize that this value is satisfying the tentative condition for the existence of the ferroelectric motor. And then in 2020, there was a seminal paper by Noel Clark's group from Colorado, which proven from the first principles. From the first principles, that the new materials show the federal electric magnetic phase. And they did so by observing polar domains in the newly discovered materials and realized that within each domain the polarization field is uniform and changes into its opposite when one crosses the domain wall. So we know that We know that the existence of domains and domain walls is the intrinsic feature of solid ferroelectrics because of the problem with the so-called depolarization field. And in solid ferroelectrics, the domain walls are typically, not always, but typically, controlled by the direction of crystallographic axis. So typically those walls follow the axis in the crystal and In the crystal, and depending on the geometry of polarization change, one distinguishes a number of different balls. So, but in the ferroelectric pneumatic, which is essentially a liquid, there are no crystallographic axes. So, our first inspirational question was how the polarization field would be shaped. It cannot be just a uniform field because, again, The uniform field because, again, as I said, of the depolarization problem, if one has a limited piece of space with the ferroelectric in it, then on this side walls, you would have a strong deposition of a strong charge. And there would be no simple way to cancel this field that occurs because of the charges. Ions can do the charge if you calculate. Can do the job, but if you calculate the amount of ions that you need to cancel this field, you would find that it's extremely high. So in order to explore the patterns that should occur in the ferroelectric pneumatics, we use different surface ampen conditions. In the absence of the crystallographic axis, the surface empiring is the only kind of guiding rail for the polarization field. Polarization field. And I will go through a number of different anchoring conditions. First, we will consider two-dimensional films on the atomically smooth surface of coal. Then, a simple experiment done by Brianna Kakumari here. The Petri disch with glycerol, a fluid, also smooth, on which one overlays the thin film on the ferroelectric pneumatic. We can similarly treat the glass plates with material that doesn't impose any in-plane anchoring direction. Then we will start to kind of impose some restrictions on the direction of polarization by using one substrate that provides a unidirectional polar anchoring. And finally, we will consider the situation when both surfaces provide some. Surfaces provide some anchoring on the polarization field. So, those are the two main materials that we are going to use. One is RM734. RM stands for the Richard Mendel, the initials of the relatively young chemist who synthesized this material. His idea was to develop a switchable explosive that would be switchable as a liquid crystal, but at Switchable as a liquid crystal, but at the same time, have some explosive properties. And as a result, he discovered the ferroelectric magnetic. And the second one is DIO from the group of Kikuchi and colleagues. This is a little bit more complicated liquid crystal because in addition to the nematic phase and the ferroelectric nematic phase that occurs from the normal nematic upon cooling, one has an intermediate anti-ferroelectric. Intermediate anti-ferroelectric magnetic in which the molecules are parallel to the layers and the polarization alternates from one layer to the next. So the first thing is we are using as a substrate the facet of gold and the pneumatic molecules are being absorbed on the substrate from the solution. When the solvent evaporates, you would see the film of The film of the residual. If you are using a regular liquid crystal like this cyanobiphenyl, then you would find that the molecules try to kind of compensate the dipole moments of each other. They are arranged in an anti-parallel fashion. But then you repeat the experiment with the DIO that forms the parolectric pneumatic phase, and surprisingly, you see that the And surprisingly, you see that the entire structure is followed. The dipoles look in the fashion that the head is connected to the tail of the next molecule. And this pattern also has an interesting feature that if you draw the imaginary layers, then you would realize that the molecules are tilted with respect to those layers. It's similar to the space. Similar to the smectic C structure. And the apparent reason is that this arrangement confirms the recent prediction of Matkusudana of the reason of the formation of the ferroelectric pneumatic phase. It's not so simple to explain why the ferroelectric pneumatic phase would form if you consider point-like titles. But if you consider the structure of The structure of each molecule as the alternation of the positive and negative sub-charges, then by shifting one with respect to the other, you enter the situation when the colonic interactions between two identical molecules is attractive rather than repulsive. And we think that what we see in the experiment confirms, gives some confirmation to the what Sudan. Confirmation to the Mate Sudanas model. Because, indeed, if you calculate the distribution of charges in the DI molecule, you will find that it alternates between positive and negative. So with this, we go to more three-dimensional case when the nematic is being spread as the thin film onto the smooth surface of glycerin or confined between. Confined between two degenerate plates. And if you look at the textures, you see something that many people in this audience would think represents a smack texture. You see something that appears like focal conic domains, the famous formations known in smack decay that were discovered by Credel as the signature feature of the layered structure. Structure. So the first thing to think about is whether these forms are really consections. And for example, in this case, by using the definition of the conic sections, Priyamka analyzed the shape of the domain walls and she found that those formations are indeed conic sections. Sometimes the eccentricity. Sometimes the eccentricity would change if you go from the branches toward the tip, but overall, if I take, for example, these two formations, the eccentricity is pretty close to one, which suggests that the main wall is of the parabolic type. So if you come closer to the tip, you often see that the eccentricity grows much smaller and the tips. And the tips represent elliptical or circular domain walls. So you can also find the regions of the textures in which the eccentricity is larger than one, and those are, of course, hyperbolous. And again, you can verify with the fashion for the conic sections that they are hyperbolus and calculate the eccentricity. So the question is: why do we observe? Why do we observe conic sections? We know from the physics of smagged leaked crystals that conic sections represent the frames of the focal conic domains and they do so because the layers can bend but they cannot change easily their thickness. As a result, the normal to the layers is always a field of straight lines and this Lines. And this field of straight lines can afford a splay, but cannot afford bend and twist. And as a result, the layers represent Jupanic cyclids and the singular sets of points that otherwise would be focal surfaces degenerate into the confocal ellipse and hyperbola, or two parabolas. So, in smectic case, we have curl n that must be equal to zero. This is the reason for the conic sections. And as I will show in the next slides, in the case of ferroelectric mimetics, the condition is that the divergence of n must be zero in order to observe the twenty sections. So, the reason is very simple. The physics is such that whenever you have a divergence, That whenever you have a divergence of a polar vector, in this case the polarization, then you create space charge. If my fingers are polar vectors and the bottom of the finger is a negative charge and the top is positive charge, you might see that the negative charge will accumulate at the bottom of my pulp. And this is in the bulk at any surface that separates two different fields of polarization. Fields of polarization. If you require that this separation does not carry any charge and doesn't carry any electrostatic energy, you should request that this quantity, surface charge, is zero, which means that the normal components of polarization are equal to each other and the tangential components compensate for each other. And this bisecting and this leads to the simple statement that the two angles, theta one and theta two, that the polarizations make with the wall, must be equal to each other. And amazingly, Apollonius knew about these bisecting properties of conic sections 23 centuries ago. So in our case, we deal with two situations. We might have the circle of the The circular domain contacting the domain in which the polarization is more or less uniform, and in that case, you would have the parabolic domain wall. Or you might have two circular domains which are separated by a hypergolic domain wall. And as easy to see, the uniform state, of course, doesn't carry much of the elastic energy, but the circular domain is also good because The regular domain is also good because there are no obvious endings of the polarization field. So the polarization doesn't create any space charge. If you look closely at the structure of those walls, I told you that at the tip we have something different from the branches far away from the tip. And if you look closely, using the so-called Polscope that images the special Images the special orientation of the director field, you would notice that near the tip the structure changes, namely, you introduce two disclinations of strengths minus one half each. And as we might realize, disclinations of an integer charge are not supposed to exist in ferroelectric pneumatic because the symmetry of order parameter is a vector. Parameter is a vector rather than the director. Minus one-half is perfectly isolated in the normal quadrupolar pneumatic, but here it's supposed to exist only with an accompanying domain wall. And we indeed observe this domain wall in which the two polarizations are opposite to each other. So the question is why do we have this uh strange configuration? And the answer is simple. And the answer is simple. The angle between two polarizations that approach the domain wall becomes stronger and stronger as we approach the tip. Here it's close to zero, but as we approach the tip, it starts to approach 180 degrees. And of course, such a U-turn is elastically not very good. And because of that, the system. And because of that, the system introduces the minus one-half destination, and after that, it's just an anti-parallel arrangement of the polarization fields. And one can construct a simple elastic model that would show when these destinations will occur on the conic section as a function of their distance from the tip. So you might observe multiple domains that coexist with each other and you Exist with each other, and you can analyze the directionality of polarization curving. And you would realize that there are domain walls in which the polarization fields are anti-parallel, but then there are also walls at which the polarization fields are parallel to each other. And those walls must carry some space charge. And we think that. Charge. And we think that the reason that the system introduces those flows is that, being of a small volume fraction, those regions can be effectively screened by the free ions that are always present in the crystals. So the first part simply tells us that the atomistically flat surfaces show that the monolayers of ferrous That the monolayers of ferroelectric magnetic molecules prefer to arrange in polar fashion, but they are shifted with respect to each other. And probably this supports the recent Moto Sudanese model. The domain walls, in the absence of any crystallographic axis and any surface interactions, would be shaped as conic sections. Parabolic conic sections separate a uniform domain. Separate a uniform domain from a circular domain, and the hyperbolic walls separate two circular domains. And there is an interesting reconstruction of the tip of those quantities associated with the equivalence of minus one heavy disclosations. So now we introduce a little bit stronger control over the polarization field by providing a unidirectional anchoring at one of the bounding plates. The bounding plate. So clearly, this surface entering is not compatible with circular domains because if I have the direction and I want to create a circle, then obviously some polarization directions in this circle would be unhappy to be aligned opposite to the lines of the polarization at the substrate. And when we explore We explore cells like that. In the nematic phase, we observe that the bulk of the crystal is oriented along the rubbing direction. If this is rubbing direction, then in crossed polarizers, the texture looks black, and it's only when you uncross the polarizers you would see some light going through. But then you cool the material down into the ferroelectric material. Into the ferroelectric pneumatic phase, and you see something completely different. And this completely different texture being analyzed by Priyanka tells you that the material splits into left-handed and right-handed domains. I'm not going to discuss in depth how one can prove it. Priyanka will present her work later at this meeting. I would like just to say. And I would like just to say that the possibility of those twisted structures was foreseen by Hachetarian many years ago, who said that a ferroelectric cannot exist as the pneumatic crystal, precisely because of this depolarization field. And his model was that in order to minimize this depolarization field, the ferroelectric pneumatic must twist, and that would kind of twist the depolarization. Would kind of twist the depolarization field, and hopefully, the electrostatic energy would be smaller than in the case of dynamic. And so, the structures that Priyanka observed are kind of illustration of this possibility of this model. Khachatoyan also predicted that if one adds ions that screen the polarization field, then the twist can be eliminated. Unfortunately, Unfortunately, the work that he published contains some error in calculations for in presentation, and the formula that shows how the concentration of ions affects the twist is not correct. And Maxim recalculated and demonstrated that when the concentration of ions is about 10 to 10,000, About 10 to the power of 22 per cubic meter, you can eliminate the twist. And this is what Priyan observed. So the summary number two is that if you have the material of a ferroelectric pneumatic type that is kind of semi-flexible, you might observe the spontaneous formation of chiral domains, left and right twisted. And right twisted. And we observe it in the cells in which one plate is in interaction on the rubber and the other is free. So now we impose both plates with unidirectional anchoring and I will go through some of the experimental evidence that show that these rubbing directions are indeed polar in the case of the ferroelectric magnetic crystal. Federalelectric magnetic crystal. So we observe the cell with a whole scope that shows the optical axis. Optical axis is not polar, so we denote it as these little ticks, but we don't know the polarity of this tick. So what we do to understand the polarity, we apply electric field. If the electric field is applied along the direction anti-parallel to the Rabbin direction, To the radio direction, then we see no changes in the texture. That means that the polarity is happy with the applied electric field. If we change the polarity of the field, then we see some changes in the texture, and after some violent propagate in front, we see a texture that is the same as before, but now apparently the polarity is opposite. Polarity is opposite. And we can confirm that by applying again, by removing the field here and reapplying it later, and seeing that with the down direction of the field, the polarization is heavy, then I don't change it. But if we change the polarity again and direct the field up, then we see some transformation and the material comes back to the original state. One thing to notice is that the values Is that the values, the magnitude of the field that causes reorientation from this state, polarization up, to this state, polarization down, is much larger than the field acting in the opposite direction. So that means that, first of all, you notice that those fields are a thousand times smaller than the similar fields needed to realign a normal pydropole. And normal hydropolar pneumatic. But second thing, you notice that the values of the switchable threshold are different. And that means that you are dealing with the surface anchoring that is polar, in plane form. The azimuth of anchoring can be represented by the classic quadrupolar term shown here, but then you need to add some polar direction to it. And if it were an And if it were an ematic of a normal type, this WP, P stands for polar, will be zero, and you would have the minima of surface entry and get zero and pi and minus pi. So these two states, zero and pi, will be of the same surface entrant energy. But if this polar contribution is non-zero, then you have the absolute ground state and you have a metastable state at phi. Stable state at 5 or minus 5. And we can quantify the difference in polar anchorings by noticing that whenever you apply the electric field to realign the polarization, it is being countered by the surface torques that keep the molecules at the surfaces along the polar direction. And these surface torques are different. In one case, polar In one case, polar anchoring helps the quadrupolar one. In the other case, it works in the opposite direction. And you know the elastic torque that tries to realign the liquid crystal. So by comparing the torques, you realize that the ratio of the surface torques is precisely the squirrel of the two switching threshold fields. And from this estimate, you can estimate that the polar energy. Estimate that the polar anchoring is about 10% of the photopolar anchor. So that leads to an interest in domain structure. When you cool down the well-aligned nematic, which is uniform, homogeneous, because again, zero direction and pi-direction are the same thing. It goes through the smactic Z, which is anti-ferroelectric, and again, there is no problem. But then you pull the system down to the system down to the federal electric nematic and suddenly you see a lot of domains and the next slide hopefully will show the movie how these domains appear they are very quick to appear and we associate them with different directionality of the polarization so the close inspection of their structure reveals that outside of the domain you have the Domain, you have the polarization that is typically anti-parallel with the radium direction. This is most frequently met situation. And in the inside of this structure, the polarization is along the rubbing direction, which is electrostatically not a good orientation. You can try to describe these things analogously. Try to describe these things analytically, and it's possible when you assume that the elastic constants are equal, elastic constants of splay and bend, you get a nice expression that describes the width of the structure and the distance between the two pi rotations. And this distance again is controlled by the polar and quadrupolar anchoring. But it turns out that. Anchoring, but it turns out that this approach is not describing what's going on really well. What happens if you look more closely at the structure of those solitonic formations is that the splay region, which is this middle part of the 2π rotation, is much larger than what you would expect from the point of view of one constant approximation. One constant approximation, when the elastic constants of splay and band are the same. It tells you that apparently the elastic constant of splay, this deformation, is much larger than the elastic constant of pan. And you cannot solve this equation analytically. And Maxim developed a numerical program that allowed to describe these structures. These structures reasonably well, and we obtained the estimate that the elastic constant of splay K1 should be probably at least four times larger than the elastic constant of band. And Maxim will be talking about this in his presentation. So what's the reason of the large K1? The reason is the same, the space charge associated with the divergence of polarization. If I have splay, then If I have splay, then uh the ends of the vectors here create a strong negative charge and that leads to electrostatic energy and things like that. There are estimates in the literature that how precisely this polarization space charge renormalizes the elastic constant and we might expect that the factor of enhancement might be in the range of 10 to 100 but at this stage we are not ready to think. But at this stage, we are not ready to make more precise estimates. So, the bottom line of these observations is that if you have two surfaces rubbed in one direction, you might have solitonic 2π domain walls, which is, by the way, very different from solid ferroelectrics, in which the crystallographic axes are not polar, and the domain walls are typically pi domain walls. Here they are twice as strong. It's a two-pie notation. A two-pipe notation, and also there is an indication that k1 is larger than k3. And now we are moving to the part in which, in addition to the surface anchoring, we also have the electric field that interacts with the crystal. And as I already mentioned, the electro-optics is striking in the case of ferroelectric kinematics. For example, in this geometry. For example, in this geometry, which is well-known twist fredericks effect, the field that causes the realignment of the material is 1,000 times lower than the field in the similar situation of the quadrupole enemy. And the question is: can we extend this electro-optic effect to other geometries, for example, to the display frederick transition, in which we have a planar. In which we have a planar cell, and the electric field is not in the plane of the cell, which is sometimes technologically difficult to achieve, but is applied across the cell by transparent electrodes at the bottom. So, in the normal pneumatic, it's easy, but in the ferroelectric pneumatic, you immediately realize that there might be a problem because when the polarization realizes in the bulb, you Real lines in the bulb, you create divergence at the plates, and that leads to the depolarization field. And in fact, if you read the literature, you find that people who studied this geometry said that they saw no change in the applied electric field. That was for a DC field. So we decided that maybe with an AC field we can do something because AC field, if it's sufficiently high frequency, can talk to the delta. Can talk to the dielectric anisotropy of the material rather than to the polarization. And this is what we observed. First, if the field of relatively high frequency, about 200 kilohertz, is applied and starts to increase, you observe Frederick's transition with a decrease of returbance, optical effective optical biofringence, that is thresholdless. There is no clear threshold in this behavior. Threshold in this behavior. The bifringence of the cell decreases rather dramatically as you increase the field. Then, if you go further with the field, you see the formation of an interesting pattern in which you have the domains separated by some splay deformations. You apply this technique that Priyanka used and will explain later of decrossing polar. Of decrossing polarizers, and you realize that the structure contains not only display but also twist. These yellow domains are twisted. You can see this from the optical activity between two cross-polarizers. So the analysis suggests the following pattern of these wave radar extensions. You have the dipoles of molecules looking down in this Looking down in this clay regions or up in the next clay region, and between them you have the in-plane deformation. If you look carefully at the structure, you might realize that if P polarization is converging in the vertical plane, it is diverging in the horizontal plane. And now you need to recall the definition of divergence. The definition of divergence. It's the derivative of the components along the axis with respect to those axes. And you realize that if you have one derivative that is positive and the other derivative that is negative, they will simply cancel each other. So it's a geometrical way of reducing the space charge without any ions. And we think this is the main reason why the structures work. Then you increase the electric field. When you increase the electric field further, then you observe that the structure dramatically changes. It forms the square lattice of plus one and minus one defects and then you look for the optical activity and you find that those structures do not have any twists, any chirality. They are comprised of pure splay and band regions. Band regions. And again, you can apply the same idea that the in-plane deformation of splay is being reduced by the vertical splay, and that makes the space charge, at least in some regions, reduced. Of course, there are regions where the two directions of divergence, two components, are enhancing each other rather than canceling each other. Canceling each other, and we think that since those regions are of limited fraction in space, they can be screened by the ions. And so the take-home statement is simple, that there are three stages of the Frederick's transition of splay type in the ferroelectric kinetic. First, you have thresholdless realignment, then you have the formation of twisted and splayed domains. Twisted and splayed domains. And finally, you have the square lattice of plus one and minus one defects. And finally, I would like to discuss a slightly more complicated geometry in which the two plates are interdirectionally treated by they form a wedge. And we know from history that this is the so-called classic Ramson Carnot wedge in which people explore choly static leak crystals and found the topological The topological structures of the defects: namely, that as you go from the thinner part to the thicker part, the number of pseudolayers of polystamic needs to be increased, and you must do this through the introduction of dislocations, edge dislocations. And as predicted by Maurice Cleman, and as was kind of confirmed in this work with Ivan Smyr, the course of the edge dislocation. Cores of the edge dislocations is split into the disclination pairs. It's either so-called tau disclination in which the singularity occurs in the director field and the tau direction, which is perpendicular to the director field, is non-singular. And those defects in the thin part, they have Parker's vector equals p over 2, pitch over 2. P over 2, p over 2. But as you move to the thicker part, you realize that the destinations are replaced by the non-singular lambda-lambda pairs and the Burgess vector is pitch. So the experimental observation shows that there is a well-defined critical thickness below which all the edge dislocations are of pH over 2, and above which all the edge of the edge of the Over 2, and above which all these dislocations are of the Burker spectrum pitch. And the reason is very simple. The pitch over 2 dislocations carry essentially only the elastic energy of the singular core, of this tau core. But in the case of non-singular lambda-lamba disconnectations, the only significant energy contributing is the dilation energy. Dilation energy associated with the insertion of the additional pitch in the structure. And as you might see, they depend differently on the thickness. So the balance of the two produces the critical thickness. So now we would like to see what would happen if we go from the cholesterol form by normal nematic to the cholesteric form by the parolectric nematic. And you would see some. Uh you would see some uh you would see that at the point of transition the structure doesn't change continuously. It's a kind of violent reconstruction first because the pitch slightly changes with temperature you see the shift, but then You see the shift, but then at some point when the material forms the ferroelectric polysteric, it's a violent restructuring. And the reason is that edge dislocations with the Berger's vector equal feature 2 cannot exist topologically in the ferrove vectors. All you have are lambda-lambda disconnections. So there is a violent transformation here associated with the fact. Associated with the fact that the tau lines must be accompanied by the singular wall, and the singular ball has to escape somehow, has to be healed, and we have this violent reconstruction. You can apply the magnetic field along the thickness gradient of the wedge, and you would see that in the normal cholesteric, the workers. The Parker's vector equals pitch would experience zigzag instability, but the thin lines would not. And in the chiral ferroelectric cholosteric, you would see that all of them experience this zigzag instability simply because they all have non-singular holes, of course. And the final result is that the structure depends on how you rub the substrates. If you rub the striped substrates, If you rub the striped substrates in the anti-parallel fashion, what happens is that the director must realign by 180 degrees between top and bottom. And that means that it creates a polar wedge. So it's a polar wedge with display, and as we know, it requires some space charge. And so what the system does, it curves the disclination in the opposite direction to create this play cancellation. That's what Display cancellation. That's what we think, why these first disclosation lines near the thin edge are forming zigzags even when there is no magnetic field. And so the last portion of this presentation is that in chiral parallelactric mimetic only one type of edge dislocation is allowed. And in the case of anti-parallel rubber, you see this interesting zigzag disconnect. Disconnections that are most likely associated with this flake cancellation. Thank you very much for your attention. All right, thank you very much. So we do have some minutes for questions. Those online, you're welcome to unmute. I see Ivan already has, so we'll get to the first question. Oh, thank you. Can you hear me now? Yes. Okay, wonderful. So let's talk on the Nice talk on it. In magnetic solids, there are so-called block walls, right? Which, of course, are chiral. And then you can have arrays of such block walls. So therefore, my question to you is why would you call the ground state chiral ferromagnetic just based on observation of some of the arrays of the Of the arrays of the main worlds. Because one can simply interpret these regions, the twisted regions that Lol Clark convert and later also Alan converted as, you know, the twist walls or block walls, right? Oh, thank you. I understand the question. So it's, let's see. So the block walls are indeed high level. Are indeed chiral formations because block walls involve the twist of the polarization. This is the block walls. When we deal with the ferroelectric mematics, in the case when one surface is in given direction of a treated, it's not just the domain wall, it's the interior of the Of the domain that is Kylo. So you place your probe here far away from the domain wall and another domain wall and you measure the optical activity in the region that is separated from the domain walls and you find the optical activity. But this is quite difficult. But let me clarify, I'm talking not about horizontally Horizontally displaced domain walls. I'm talking about the domain walls across the sickness because that trees that you see there is not necessarily so uniformly splat. It can be localized because you actually would be competing between different factors. Some of them benefit from minimizing electrostatic energy, some of them are costly because of energetic Of energetic cost of twist in this kind of system. And so there are exact animals in ferromagnetic solids, you know, where you have such competition and such things arise, and they actually can form a lay. So my kind of interpretation of this would be that you have horizontal domain walls and you have vertical domain walls. Yeah, okay, as you might see from this picture at this stage. From this picture, at this stage, we do not specify the structure of the vertical bolts. I totally agree that the real structure is more complicated than the uniform twist. And of course, these domain walls would impart the elastic torques on the structure. And we have to see what is the exact structure of those domain walls. It's not done yet. Right, I mean, so you know, also in relation to that Moscow group theory, you know, known and I discussed, Noel Clark and I discussed it, you know, it is a very kind of simplistic assumption of some cylindrical geometry, which is not really relevant experimentally. I think not related to your case, but also generally not very experimentally relevant. No, I totally agree, but if you have somebody published a paper in the past that predicted something similar to what you observed, then a good behavior would be to mention this work. And that was an interesting thing. All right. In the interest of time, are there other questions from the room? Vaccine? I'm just wondering for the wedge part. For the wedge part? It's made chiral with a dopant, or would this also work with the spontaneous? No, no, it's a chiral dopant because it's, as you might see, it's the equilibrium pitch that you can measure how it behaves with temperature and how it diverges with the magnetic field. So it's not spontaneous. The spontaneous I have a very quick question for Leg, and it is concerned with the cap number's motion. For the quarter parameter in this case, being polar, one would expect on general different countries with a slope. I wonder whether, in some of your experiences, suddenly, for example, go from one range into another, whether you have Whether I've seen any um clear or a different factory in this domain. Yeah, that's uh we think that the hydrodynamics of ferroelectric pneumatics is an extremely interesting field. And we have some observations that a droplet, let's say, of the ferroelectric pneumatic would behave in some extraordinarily complex, dynamic fashion. Dynamic fashion. People in Neul Thor group and in Lucetti, Valdini group published some interesting observations. We are just at the beginning of understanding these things, so I cannot comment much. We have time for one last quick question, if there is one. Does uh in your Friedrich's uh transition, does something happen if you change the frequency of your applique? Change the frequency of your applied field? Um yeah, if the frequency is uh too low, let's say zero D C, then uh no changes would be observed. So apparently if the field is applied, the small variation in the field of polarization totally cancels the uh applied field. And the crystal doesn't feel anything. Yeah, make crystal doesn't feel like it.
