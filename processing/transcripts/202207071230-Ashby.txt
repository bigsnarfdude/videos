Great, so like John said, I'm Phil Ashby from Scotiabank, and today I want to talk to you a bit about the work we're doing on really modeling transition risk as a real financial risk for the bank. Sorry, I couldn't make it in person, but thank you a lot for giving me an opportunity to speak at the conference. Let's just jump right into it. So we'll proceed in three acts or whatever. First, I want to talk a little bit about First, I want to talk a little bit about what regulators are thinking, the different types of accounting principles we're seeing come out around climate change, and then an actual exercise that we had to do for one of the regulators last year. And then we'll jump into what climate risk modeling is, really trying to start with what the climate scientists are doing and try and show you how we're connecting that to actual bank financial numbers. And that's our third act. And that's our third act. So, regulatory landscape. So, there's a number of different acronyms that are beginning to appear in the world. So, we heard already about the TCFD. So, this is something that Mark Carney had his hand in about five years ago at this point. And this was a task force that was put together to really. Was put together to really look at what the requirements should be for any type of corporation on disclosing their risks to climate change. So a variety of banks, Scotiabank included, have agreed publicly that they're going to try and live up to these climate-related financial disclosures. And so you're seeing more information come out in banks' ESG reports. Those are reports that come out typically once a year on environment, sustainability. On environment, sustainability, and other governance principles. And some banks are actually issuing standalone TCFD reports. Having a standalone report is not part of TCFD, but it's really about the content that you're putting out, especially around environmental risks. And so this has precipitated a huge shift in at least the financial world, where climate change has moved from what we call the non-financial risks, which are the things that banks treat with more of a squishy lens. Squishy lens to actually becoming a financial risk where we're trying to prescribe some sort of numbers to this risk. So it's always been highlighted as a top risk for a number of years, but it's really moving into the light as a financial risk. And we're part of a few different programs. There's a great program run by the UN, this UNEPFI, a program that's been running for three or four years now. And they really bring in experts from all over to bring To bring everyone up to date, bring in different tool providers, run different demos. You have an opportunity to submit some work you might do as part of a pilot or otherwise to share with the community at large. So it's a really great forum that we are able to be a part of. And I've personally learned a lot from that forum. It's been a real pleasure to be a part of that. The last two things here around a bit of a different pillar. So there's something known as a CDP. This is a As a CDP, this is a project that's been going on for a long time, which collects data from different corporations about their carbon emissions, as well as this Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials, PCAF. And this is really looking to become a standard for how banks measure their, the word is, what's it called, financed emissions. So, this is a relatively new concept where you've seen all of these banks, all the Canadian. Seen all of these banks, all the Canadian banks are now part of what we call the Net Zero Banking Alliance, and that is a commitment to by 2050 we all want to be net zero lenders, which is actually much more strict than just net zeroing our own operations. So when you finance something, that something typically has some sort of carbon cost associated with it. It might have carbon costs associated with its construction, decommission, and then the operations of whatever that something is. And roughly, Is and roughly speaking, PCAF is a way of allocating that out to the people who are financing these transactions. So if a bank extends a loan to you and that pays for 10% of some project, we're roughly responsible for something like 10% of those emissions. So there's a new standard that's coming out, and there's lots of questions around how these things should actually be computed and allocated around, but it's really looking to provide a sort of lever to ensure that loans are going to. To ensure that loans are going to green places. On the regulatory side, our regulator, OSPE, they've come out with guidance. I said yesterday here, I didn't update this deck clearly. So that was in May. But this B15 guidance, they're really following in the Bank of England footsteps here. Here, ensuring that banks are trying to do the best in class reports on climate change. And this really stems again from that TCFD recommendation. So, if you look through the OSPE recommendations, you'll see they're very closely aligned to that original TCFD report that came out. OSPE also ran a pilot. OSPI also ran a pilot project with two banks, that was TD and RBC. They partnered with MIT. MIT did some climate modeling for them, really breaking down the climate models into more crunchy economic metrics that banks are used to dealing with, which were passed to modeling teams like mine, who could really crank out some impacts for the Bank of Canada to understand what those are going to look like when they hit a more firm requirement. More firm requirement. So, this is still in the works with OSPI. I think, in probably, OSPI said we're not doing anything this year or next year, so I think the year after that will be the first time we do a regulatory exercise around this. And I'm looking forward to that, actually, to see what their spin on that is going to be like. And the last stuff here, these are some of the uses for what we're calling scenario analysis. And I'll jump into our example here for the Bank of England scenario analysis. For the Bank of England scenario analysis. So, I don't know how well you can see these three scenarios that were provided to us. Every two years, the Bank of England runs its exploratory scenario analysis. And in 2021, the theme of that analysis was climate change. That's the first time climate change has been highlighted as a major theme of the Bank of England's exercise, and it's probably going to be a recurring theme every two years thereafter. And so they provided. And so they provided three scenarios: one in purple here. So the three graphs are carbon price in the top left, emissions in the top right, and then the bottom middle, that's the actual physical temperature change, average surface temperature. And the purple line is a no policy action scenario. So that is the scenario where we just keep our policies as is. You see the temperature continues to rise unhindered, so do emissions. To rise unhindered, so do emissions, and the carbon price stays relatively modest. This is contrasted by an early action policy scenario where we basically begin pricing carbon immediately. This has an effect of reducing emissions, and we're able to hit our temperature target at the time horizon. And then what we have in orange is a late policy action scenario. You see, we kind of wait 10 years before we start pricing carbon into the market. Then we have to price much more aggressively. Price much more aggressively. We end up still meeting our temperature target, as you can see in the third graph, but the way we get there is very different. And these scenarios, the reason they chose these three scenarios is they were designed to bring out two different types of risk channels that people in the climate finance literature have really latched onto. So we'll jump into that next. And these risks are transition risk and physical risk. Are transition risk and physical risk. So, physical risks are a lot of what we've heard about at this conference, actually. So, the things like floods, fires, sea level rise. And they can come in sort of two different flavors, if you want. The chronic kind, which are really these slow changes like temperature change or sea level rise, and then these more acute events, things like a storm blowing through causing massive damage. Damage. Acute risks are probably harder to deal with, and the chronic ones we can probably adapt to more easily. Transition risk is this idea that risk is going to be transmitted indirectly through the economy. And so this is a risk that's really important to banks. It involves things like the poster child of transition risk is really carbon taxation. So that's this emission pricing, as well as general. Emission pricing, as well as general other shifts that will happen in the economy as we move towards more low-carbon processes. So it's not all carbon tax, though that is one of the primary channels. At the bottom here, I'm showing a bit of a graphic that just to show this trade-off between high physical risk and low transition risk and high transition risk and low physical risk. And in those scenarios that the Bank of England showed, they were really meant to try and span this physical transition risk space. So you're no policy action scenario. So, your no-policy action scenario is something like a high physical risk world where we're really just allowing emissions to continue unabated. Whereas the early policy action scenario, it's sitting somewhere in the middle, actually. You'll have a bit more transition risk up front, but much lower physical risk. So it kind of doesn't fit into this two triangle wedges picture. And then the orange graph has a ton of transitory. Has a ton of transition risk in it, and actually, relatively low physical risk as well in the later half of the century because you end up meeting that same temperature target. So it's really a high transition risk, low physical risk scenario. So how do people go about modeling climate change? One of the ways in which this is done is this is kind of the union of two giant fields. These models are extremely. Fields. These models are extremely complicated and involve an enormous number of researchers from all over the globe. And so there are these models called integrated assessment models. These are really models of the joint macroeconomy and the climate policies. So understanding how does the macroeconomy change as we're trying to meet those climate goals going out to our targets. So I specify some climate target, typically out at a year like 2100, and then Like 2100, and then a bunch of policy levers and understanding how that you evolve from today's state of the economy to this future state. And then these are coupled with the global climate models. So these are the actual physical simulations of the climate, and there's a feedback between these two things to ensure that they're consistent. So these integrated assessment models, the way they work is the world is broken up into these regions. Is broken up into these regions. I think here that might be 11. Yeah, it's 11 regions. And trade, transport, supply and demand is modeled between these regions. And in each of these regions, you can have different climate policies. So you can have local carbon prices, you can have different tariffs, you can have nuclear yes-no. And the way that this model works is it's really like a Works is it's really like a big relaxation model. So I specify my carbon budget out at 2100. I know how much CO2 I'm emitting now. And what I end up getting out is two key things, what my land use mixture looks like. So that's how much I'm using for agriculture and urban land, livestock, all of these things. And then my power mix. So where am I getting my energy from? Which Am I getting my energy from? Which sectors am I phasing energy out of? And I get the associated things like food prices, commodity prices, and all of that. So you really have this slew of macroeconomic information that's coming out as part of this giant 100-year forecast. And an example is shown here on the right. This is actually a 1.5-degree consistent world where you see the carbon emissions from the different channels, and you see we have a ton of carbon emissions. We have a ton of carbon emissions up front from fossil fuels. And then, as we move towards the later half of the century, this is a scenario where there's a lot of carbon capture and storage. That's the stuff shown in blue with negative emissions. That's pulling a lot of this excess carbon out that you're generating in the first half of the century. So, this is really the inputs, the outputs of these models are really serving for us as the very inputs to the calculation. Inputs to the calculations that we're going to try and be doing. So I've talked a little bit about how these work, but you can simulate different types of pathways. Again, this is different policies that you're putting in these regions, as well as different target emission levels. And you solve this sort of relaxation problem and end up getting out these emissions and land uses, which then go into these global climate models, which are these circulation and weather models, to then get out the And weather models to then get out the actual physical risks that you see here on the right. And these physical risks then need to go into different physical risk models, like we may be concerned with fires affecting properties or floods affecting properties, these types of things. These figures now are from the NGFS. So the NGFS is the Network for Greening the Financial System. This is an organization that's This is an organization that's formed over the last few years really to try and harmonize all of this information that's coming out of the different climate modeling groups, like these integrated assessment models, and preparing a standard set of information that banks can use to start doing their kind of own in-house climate modeling work. And you can see here that just taking their impacts from transition risk on GDP, so GDP. On GDP. So GDP is usually a good proxy for how we understand the shock to the economy as a whole. And you can see that the difference in an orderly versus a disorderly type climate scenario, you're ending up with something like a 5% to 10% shock by the year 2100. May not seem that large, but a 5% shock to GDP is a really massive thing if you look at comparing that to historical precedent. Comparing that to historical precedent or the kinds of stress and errors we're used to running on our book. Another thing I want to highlight is just the second figure is a really scary one because this is a hot house world scenario and then it's been run for a variety of models here. And you can just see this enormous error in the impact on GDP. So at the optimistic end, you're only getting a few percent reduction in GDP by the year 21. In GDP by the year 2100 from physical risks, but at the pessimistic end, you're getting something like a minus 25%. Then that's gonna add on to whatever you have from the transition risk channel. So physical risk is much harder to quantify. It really depends on if key supply chains get disrupted and things like this. It also depends on the models that are being used for physical risk. There's tons of models, and these things are typically estimated using. Estimated using some model averages is the best thing you can do. But obviously, as we learn more, hopefully, this uncertainty comes down. So, there's this huge amount of money that is actually needed to transform the economy. And what I'm showing on the right here is the sources of carbon dioxide emissions from different industrial sectors and Sectors and the current state of the economy is shown on that leftmost bar. So you see all this carbon emissions. And in the left half of this figure, you're looking at a transition to a net zero world. And we actually end up with negative carbon emissions by the end of the century. And we have some estimates here of just the amount of trillions of dollars required. It's something like half a trillion dollars. Required. It's something like half a trillion dollars US per year required to make this investment. And so, this is a huge opportunity for investors and for lenders to help really drive this transformation. And the right half of this figure, for those wondering, this is a hothouse world where we just continue with policies as normal, continuing to emit as we do, just scaling things up. So, the difference between these two worlds is really striking when you look at the emissions, and it's going to mean a lot when it comes. And it's going to mean a lot when it comes to the physical risks that are generated, especially in the later half of the century. So, how do we actually use the outputs from an integrated assessment model to forecast risk? Well, one of the key things that comes out of the integrated assessment models is really the policies needed to achieve this change in the economy. So, this is a model with a global carbon price under three different scenarios here. Under three different scenarios here. So, NDC, this is nationally determined contributions. So, this is the scenario that will happen if every country lives up to its pledges right now, regardless of the status, the current implementation status of those pledges. It's a relatively pessimistic scenario from a climate change point of view. We have not pledged enough. And you see, the carbon taxes in those scenarios are pretty low, below $200 per ton. Below $200 per ton by the end of the mid-century. This can be compared to this two degrees consistent scenario. This is a scenario consistent with two degrees with really early action. You see the carbon prices starting immediately in 2020 and rising up to $600 a ton by the mid-century. And then you have one of these delayed transitions where we wait for about 10 years before turning on a carbon price, ramps up a lot quicker, and you need higher carbon prices. And you need higher carbon prices in the medium term to really achieve the same climate targets by the end of the century. And you see heading up to $800 a ton. These are absolutely enormous numbers. No one is talking about carbon prices these large right now, except us, I guess. We are people. So these prices are then going to flow into impacts on companies, and that's going to affect their revenue. So I've taken some data from a company. Some data from a company I've called Company A here. So you have a reported emissions of 300 million tons of CO2 a year, and it's something like $150 a ton, which is something around the estimate of what the Canadian government is talking about right now. You're looking at an extra operating cost of $50 million a year. So that's not small. And it's going to impact their ability to generate revenue. And then from a lending institution's point of view, their ability to pay back loans. Of view, their ability to pay back loans. And I should note, this only includes scope one and two emissions, this estimate. So for any, and scope one and two are the more direct emissions that you're doing. Scope three are your downstream emissions. That's the basic way to understand this. So if this was an oil company, all their downstream emissions from people driving their cars and stuff like that, that's not factored in here. Scope three emissions are a bit of a tricky thing. Tricky thing. But more on that later, or not. So, how do we actually build this into the models that we're running at Scotiabank? Well, let's talk about some of these scenarios. So, this, again, is a figure from the Network for Greening and the Financial System. And here, the physical risks and transition risks have been plotted in this kind of abstract 2D space. So, in the bottom left corner, we have low physical risk and low transition risk, and then in the top right corner, Transition risk, and then in the top right corner, we have high physical risk and high transition risk. And you see a bunch of different scenario bubbles here. I'm going to end up showing you some results from two scenarios, which I've highlighted here in not faded out, I don't know, in bluish green. So, those are the net zero 2050 scenario. So, this is a scenario with relatively low transition risk and low physical risks. So, that is an ambitious climate policy. Ambitious climate policy. It's consistent with 1.5 degrees Celsius. So looking at that Paris target. And it really requires policies to become active immediately. And it's kind of everyone gets along type scenario in terms of climate risk. I should also note that this particular scenario has relatively little need for ambitious technology advancements like viable carbon capture and storage. So those are things. Those are things that are also baked into these scenarios. Some of them have much more need for technological breakthroughs than others, and this is not one with that. To contrast that, we'll also look at NDCs. You can see it's over here on the right. Again, NDCs is the nationally determined contributions. So that's if all the governments live up to their pledges, we end up in one of these hothouse world type scenarios. And the estimates for this are something like a two and a half degree world. For this, or something like a two and a half degree world by 2100. I just want to walk through a few of the economic variables that are coming out of the integrated assessment models. You can actually go look at these online if you go to the IIASA, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, EASA. So they have a scenario explorer for all of these scenarios. You can just create an account there and look at the scenarios that are available and see what kind of information is there. And see what kind of information is there. I'd recommend that. And anyone could do that. So here's the NDC scenario versus the net zero 2050 scenario. And these graphs aren't the same until you look at the y-axis. So the NDC scenario has a carbon price of about $40 a ton by the year 2050, whereas the net zero scenario is calling for something like $800 a ton by the year 2050. A ton by the year 2050. So, this is an absolutely enormous difference when you're thinking about passing these costs on to people's revenues and then looking at that impact to the company's profitability. I want to highlight a couple other things, one of which is the energy mix, just to show the differences there. So again, in the NDC scenario, you see a strong use of oil up until 2050 still. Oil is black, coal is this brown line. You see a bit of a phase of. Line, you see a bit of a phase out of coal, and it's difficult to tell from the chart, but a bit of a phase out of gas. And then the phase out from these is upticked by green, which is renewable energy, like solar or wind. That's contrasted with the net zero scenario, where you really see coal phased out by 2030. It's much more clear that gas is getting phased out, and oil is roughly at about 50% use compared to. Use compared to present day. And all the uptick in that energy is picked up by renewables. And this is the impact to the oil price. So $100 is today's value, so just an index value. And you see in that NDC scenario, there's almost no change in the oil price, whereas in the net zero 20-50 scenario, you're looking at a roughly 50% change in the oil price. 50% change in the oil price relative to today. Philip, can you hear me? We think your slides might be frozen on our end. Share and re-share. Share and reshare. Yeah, I'll stop share and share again. Yeah, I don't know how that happened. Yeah. Give it a second. If you're sharing your screen, we don't see it. It's very laggy. Is it happening? It started screen sharing. We're going to wait a second. Like you said, it was lagging. Let me turn off my video and see if that helps. Hopefully, yeah. Yeah, you can kind of. Yeah, you can kinda see the screen right here. Did you submit your slides to the website bill? I can do that. Could you that wouldn't work because it would take a few, like an hour to upload on our end. Wait, let me stop. Stop sharing again. That's good. I will. Can you email them to me and I'll throw it up by downloading from my email? Here. I have faith that it's going to work for me. The staff is going to help you. Thanks, Liam. Still not working? No, sir. It says you've started screen sharing, but we're not actually seeing anything. So let me try and share my entire screen. Let me try and share my entire screen. No. Yeah, do you want to try leaving the meeting and rejoining? I can try that. And I will send these to you as I do that. Sure. I will send my email to you in the chat. Oh, he's going to have it in the chat. Super. If he sends them to me, I'll afford them to you. Let's see them. Or is it? Forth and see what's the number is that you see that skin? Uh no, I'll just type that you can do the colour. I am back. Great, let's give this a shot. So we'll see if turning it off and on again is the canonical solution to all problems. To all problems, we're back. We're back okay, okay. Um, one or two slides we can see what we missed. Okay, this slide. We were good here, right? Yep, we're on 17 then. Okay, um, yeah, so just looking at the energy mix here, again, black is oil, uh, and in the Oil. And in the NDC scenario, you see very little phase-out of oil. You see roughly something like a 30% remaining use of coal by the mid-century and a small downtick in gas. And this is uptaken by the renewables in green. Everything is much easier to see in the bottom graphic where things are actually changing substantially. So coal is phased out, coal in brown is phased out by Coal in brown is phased out by 2030, essentially. And oil, you can see, is much thinner by the half century, roughly by 50%. Gas has also been phased out, again, roughly by 50% or so. And all of the uptick in the energy demand is picked up by renewables, mostly non-biomass renewables, so wind and solar. And then this obviously has an impact on things like commodity prices. So here I've tried On things like commodity prices. So, here I've chosen to show just oil prices representative. It's similar for gas, where really in the NDC scenario, you're seeing relatively little change in oil price. Again, 100 here is just the index value. And then something roughly around 50% decrease in the value of oil by the year at 2050 in the net zero-2050 scenario. So now that we have all of these climate variables, So now that we have all of these climate variables from these integrated assessment models, we need a way to translate these into economic impacts. It turns out that this requires access to tons of data that we don't already have as a bank. So these are things like what are the carbon emissions of our clients and how much revenue are they generating from which type of carbon intense activity? So we've actually partnered with someone from the UK. This is a firm called Planetrics. Called Planetrics, and they've helped us with this in at least the short term. And they're taking in these climate scenarios as input, so really using the outputs from these integrated assessment models and global climate models to come up with changes in the company's valuation. And they are using an economic model for the value of an asset of the company, like a discount dividend model, to understand the impact on. The impact on the value of the equity as these climate scenarios unfold. And I've kind of shown how that works here in this bottom left figure. So they basically have this sum of future expected cash flows, and those you can then discount back to today to get an impact on what the equity price should be. And in their model, they have several transmission channels. Several transmission channels. So they have a transmission channel for physical risk and adaptation, which is negative physical risk. So that's any policies in place to counteract the physical risk. Physical risk in this model is solely a function of the surface temperature, and it's really using an estimate of the average damages over the country that the company is operating in. So it's really a simple model of physical risk. The more sophisticated The more sophisticated part of this model comes with transition risk, where they really have a few channels. So you'll see here a demand destruction and demand creation. Demand destruction, if you're something like an oil company and price for oil is going down, there's a much lower demand. There's also your direct carbon costs. So this is just as an emitter of carbon, I'm going to be hit with my carbon tax times my carbon price. Carbon price, sorry, my carbon tax times my carbon emissions. And then abatement is anything they have in place to counteract those kind of supply side, supply demand side shocks. And there's this important part called competition, which is really where does this company sit in the food chain, so to speak, of other companies similar to it? So if I'm producing something relatively greenly and for a relatively low cost, And for a relatively low cost, I'm actually going to be able to gain more market share up. And so, this is something that's really modeling those market dynamics. And it's a really important aspect of trying to compare companies and see how they're going to perform in the future. Oh, and I should mention it's written here. But so they also have, Planetrics also has a probability default model, which is an Altman Z. Default model, which is an Altman Z type model, is a kind of old school model. It's really derived from different aspects of the balance sheet. And so when they're deriving their changes to the probabilities of default, they're just taking these equity values that they're deriving from their model and changing that one factor in this Altman Z model to come up with a new probability of default of these customers under the scenarios. We're looking at building an in-house problem. probability of default model using a Merton model framework. Merton model is again another one of these classic theories from God about 50 years ago at this point. So Merton noticed that if you assume that the condition for default is where debt comes due and then the company does not have enough assets to pay off that debt, that the Off that debt, that the formulas for this were similar to option pricing, which he had just written the paper on. So, whole Merton model framework basically casts this probability of default question into a option pricing type problem, which financial math people are very familiar with. And then they come up with this distance to default quantity here, which is really one of the Black Scholls model parameters. One of the Black Schools model parameters. And you're really measuring basically like how much assets do I have compared to my debt, compared to the ratio of my volatility. And if that falls too, if this number gets too low, then I'm not going to be able to pay back my debt when the time comes due. So this is a kind of standard model that you can calibrate by just taking financial statements of the company, estimate a few model parameters using. Estimate a few model parameters using your favorite technique, and then we can take the shocks to the assets from the planetrix model to make our own estimates of the probabilities of default. And then something we'll look at in the future is if we can just build the shocks in to this model directly without having to reference the actual planetrics model, a sort of a challenger model to theirs. So here are some results from a few companies in our portfolio. Company A. Company A. And I'm showing a few different noodles here. So the solid lines are our NDC, let's start with the dashed lines. The dashed lines are our NDC scenario and the net zero 2050 scenario. And you see that this is the impact to the company's value, their equity value as a function of time. And under the NDC scenario, there is an impact to this company on the order of 10% or so. On the order of 10% or so. But in this net zero 2050 scenario, as these policies kick in, it's getting just absolutely destroyed in terms of its ability to make money. And by the year 2050, it's lost something like 80% of its value. Now, these things can be translated into PD impacts, and these are additive PD impacts. And Allman Z model is predicting something like point. Predicting something like 0.3 to 0.4 increase in the NDC scenario and something like a 2 or 4 percent in the net zero scenario, which is quite large. Using the Merton model calibration, we're ending up with just slightly higher values in the NDC scenario, something similar at 20, 30 in the net zero scenario. An absolutely huge number, 30% extra probability of default in Probability of default in the net zero scenario. This is because this particular company does not have a large amount of assets compared to their debt. So in the Merton framework, actually the shock, I mean, we're getting rid of 80% of their equity value, right? So if you have almost any debt, you quickly can become sensitive to this in the Merton model framework. Now, the second thing that's being shown here is trying to incorporate information. Trying to incorporate information about the company's net zero pledges. And that's what's shown in the solid lines. So this company does not have very ambitious net zero pledges, but the pledges are giving them some relief. So if this company lives up to its pledges, instead of an 80% shock by the year 2050 under a net zero scenario, it's only going to be something like a 70% shock. If I fold that into the Merton calculation, that Merton calculation that then you know takes this 30% down to something like 13%. 13% annual PD is still absolutely enormous, especially as a marginal. So, you know, not necessarily a great customer. This is another customer that I think was really shocking when I saw it. Like this just screams transition risk to me. So this company has no targets, so there's only two lines. And in the NDC scenario, And in the NDC scenario, they're staying relatively profitable, again, about at the 10% loss level or so. And then in this net zero, 2050 scenario, after 2035, they absolutely just hit rock bottom. And this is one where I really am not trusting the Altman Z model since it's only giving something like an 8% probability. Whereas the Merton model is really able, like 60% is. Able like 60% is seeming like a much more reasonable estimate. And we're actually getting low-ball estimates in the other scenario, which is interesting. So we've computed this for a sample of our customers. These are taken from the Altman Z model. And a couple things to notice here are that there's, so there is more dispersion from this. More dispersion from the scenarios than there is from moving forward 20 years. This is good because it lets you know that we can try and distinguish the green or brownness of our customers more as a function of the scenario rather than of just spreading out in time. And you do see on the, there are some people who are climate change winners here on the left. So these are people with negative change or probability of default. So people who are actually becoming more profitable. Though for this sample, it is a biased sample. It is a biased sample. Many of them have pretty severe increases to their PDs by even 2030 under this net zero scenario. Again, the NDC, you're really not seeing much, and that's kind of no surprise because the policies are more or less the same as today. So the economy is just kind of functioning normally. That's one last thought I just want to leave everyone with, and something, oh no, okay, I have two last thoughts. I have two last thoughts. So, once we have probabilities of defaults, we can turn this into kind of an expected loss. So, our current expected loss for this selection of customers is something like this little blue sliver here. And then, under the NDC scenario, we are seeing an increase in that. So, there is non-zero change in PD. And so, there is an uptick in the credit losses that we're seeing. And in the net-zero scenario, we obviously see. And in the net zero scenario, we obviously see much more. And this I found shocking when I looked at this because it really says to me that physical risks are not being captured correctly in the model. Like even at 2050, you're not seeing a huge uptick in any expected loss here, which is why I want to jump to this last picture. It was from a famous nature paper from 2015 where there was a study done about the impact of temperature on GDP actually. The impact of temperature on GDP, actually. And so, this would be one way in which we could try and capture kind of a broad macroeconomic shock through just the physical channel. And the insight of this paper was that they basically did this huge panel regression of every country versus itself to try and estimate the changes in GDP using, I can't remember how many years of data. And they found that. And they found that basically all the rich countries are sitting at this local maximum in this function that they estimated. And so, if it gets too hot, you lose productivity and crop yields, and these things tend to come out. And similarly, if it gets too cold. So, there's kind of a sweet spot for human habitation from a GDP point of view. And so, if the global temperatures rise, you can then propagate this into some sort of GDP shock. So, this is something we might look at trying to do. So, this is something we might look at trying to do just to try and understand what those numbers look like when we're putting an extra physical risk channel on really a global GDP shock into the model. So, that's where I will leave it. I don't know if there's any questions. I kept it to 45 minutes. So. Philip, that's a record. Can we thank our speaker for? I say that's a record because, unless you want to do another 45 minutes, that seems to be. Minutes. That seems to be the trend, is twice the amount of time for each presentation. So I'm going to open up the floor to anyone who wants to come and ask Phil to give a question. I'd ask you to come up to the front so Phil can see you when you ask your question. I'll turn myself back on as well, so you're not talking to a disembodied set of slides. Tony? So our questions just coming around. Thanks, Phil. I'm Tony Ware from the University of Calgary. But anyway, it's very interesting. And I was just curious, when you got down to the company level scenarios, to what extent you were factoring in their changes to the way they were operating in response, say, to rises in carbon prices. Rises in common because I saw when you did when you incorporated their goals, which is, I guess, one kind of response, the losses changed there for sure. Right. So these figures, we're not incorporating that at all, which is super unrealistic. So that is the thing we're looking at next: is how can, so it's a tricky question, right? Because if I assume they keep their asset to debt structure. Assume they keep their asset-to-debt structure similar to how it is today, then I'm not going to get any impact. So, I can't do that, right? Um, so we need to be a little bit careful about how we do the modeling for that, but we do need to start making some assumptions about how we are having the customers pay down their debt structure as they see that they're running out of assets. Because that's something a real company is going to try and do. They're not just going to keep taking out more debt, right? Or new technology that reduces the. technology that that reduces the the way you know they're that allows them to do the things they're doing but without with less carbon right yeah so those are those are all channels we need to build in yeah yeah right right that's my question thanks awesome yep another one hi Phil great job Paul from Western University. Paul from Western University. You were sharing how you've approached this, which is really informative and educational. I didn't see yet comparing how you think climate risk will affect the bank contrasted with other risks that you have quantified over many, many years. Is climate risk impact on credit risk in the same ballpark or is it not material? Are you getting to that stage? Are you getting to that stage? There's this Carney started by talking about he's the financial system at risk of stability. So maybe even opening the door for systemic risk. Anyway, have you yet, or are you aware of anybody who's published for one of the other banks, been able to reflect on how climate risk compares to the many other risks that you've been modeling and thinking about for a long period of time? So my answer to that can only be within selected portfolios. Only be within selected portfolios, yes? So we've only run these models on a very small set of customers so far. And depending on who you look at, like if I look at, this is kind of obvious, but if I look at a financial company, I'm really not seeing much transmission of financial risks just because financial companies do not have a lot of direct exposure to greenhouse gas emissions, right? They run a relatively greenhouse gas emission scheme, so to speak. Scheme, so to speak. Whereas if I look at something like an oil and gas company, I'm obviously seeing a huge effect because they are the worst customer because they get hit with both a demand shock and they get hit with a huge carbon tax shock. So most industries, and they're pointed in the same direction, right? Both of those shocks are pointed in the same direction. And most industries are not going to behave like that. So something like a construction industry is not going to really get hit with the demand shock. Not going to really get hit with the demand shock, but it is going to get hit with a carbon pricing shock. So cement costs carbon to make, but people still need things made with cement. So yeah, it really depends on the industry you look at. And this is why I'm really interested in starting to see more financial institutions publish numbers on these sorts of things, because then you can turn that into a second round impact. I can look at all my borrowers, look at all their indirect greenhouse gas emissions, and then Direct greenhouse gas emissions, and then kind of cascade that as an impact, which would be really informative. And that's just not data we have right now.
