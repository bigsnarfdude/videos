Solutions to logistic problems. So, thank you, Alberto. Thank you. And good morning or good afternoon, depending on where you are. Do you see my screen? It's okay. Can I? Yes, fantastic. Yes, thank you. Okay, can I start with the full screen? Okay, so just many thanks to the organizer for this invitation. Organizer for this invitation to this nice conference. And I will speak about relativistic Kepler problems, but just to begin with, let me start from the very beginning, which is something which everyone here knows very well because it's the basic equation of celestial mechanics. Okay, the Kepler problem. Here you see the equation. This is just Newton law. Just Newton's law. X is the particle, M is the mass of the particle, and here on the right-hand side, you see the usual gravitational force. Of course, we know everything about this system of ODEs. In particular, we can say that it's a completely integrable Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom. And the two natural first integrals are the energy coming from the fact that the equation is. From the fact that the equation is autonomous, and the angular momentum coming from the fact that the problem is invariant under rotation. Okay, actually, you have more because this is a super integrable system, and as a consequence, the dynamics is very simple because orbits are just a conic section, and the sign of the energy is all you need to know the shape of the orbit. Okay, just a It okay, just let me notice here that all bounded orbits are closed, are a periodic one, and this, of course, is related to Bertrand's theorem, which says that there are only two exceptional cases of a central force field for which this happens, and these are precisely the Kepler problem and the harmonic oscillator, which indeed are related by the the the conformal uh square mapping. Formal square mapping as already explained in previous talks. So now let us come to this relativistic Kepler problem. By this, I mean this equation, you see the right-hand side is unchanged, while on the left-hand side, the usual acceleration of classical mechanics is replaced by the derivative of this relativistic angular momentum. Relativistic angular momentum. You see here that a solution is not allowed to have a velocity which exceeds the speed of light denoted by C. So such an equation is quite known by the physics community. You can find it even in some text books for students. And here I have mentioned some research papers, recent or less. Recent or less recent. Of course, from the point of view of physics, this is a toy model because we are in the framework of special relativity here, while the true theory of relativity nowadays is the general theory of relativity. However, in spite of this, you can still use this toy model to with in some To weave in some concrete example, like in the prototype problem of relativity, the precession of Mercury. And at the end, it gives us something which is not completely unreasonable in the sense that it's one sixth the correct value given by general relativity. Okay, so in spite of being not optimal, this equation is known by the physics community. The physics community, while on the other end, as far as I know, is essentially unexplored from a more mathematical point of view. So, let's say three years ago, I think together with my friends and colleagues, Walter D'Ambrosio from Torino and Guglielmo Feltrin and Ducio Papini from Moudina, we started to play with such an equation using our favorite mathematical tools. So, today I will talk. So today I will talk to you about some results in this direction. But before going into the details, just some more comments about this relativistic version of the Kepler problem. Okay, it is a Neul Lagrange equation. It comes from this Lagrangian. Again, you see that the potential part is the same, while the kinetic. While the kinetic energy is replaced by this expression, which in the limit when c goes to plus infinity gives the usual kinetic energy of classical mechanics. And then, of course, if you have a Lagrangian, you can make the usual procedure of Legend transformation. So you get a corresponding Hamiltonian, which is, of course, a first integral of the system. And then again, The system. And then again, a second first integral is given by the angular momentum because the problem is again invariant under rotation. So there is no problem in this sense. Again, you have a completely integrable Hamiltonian system in two degrees of freedom. But essentially, nothing more. So, in the sense that the relativistic effects breaks the super integrability, so as a consequence, the dynamic. As a consequence, the dynamics is not so simple, it is much richer with respect to classical Kepler, and in particular, you can find a variety of, say, unfamiliar orbits. For instance, here you see a scattering orbit which winds once around the center of attraction, which is here inside this loop. Here, an orbit coming from infinity and going in. And going into the singularity after spiraling infinitely many times. And here are an even more strange orbit which starts and then into with a collision. Okay, so actually we will stay on the more safe side of the dynamics and we will only deal with bounded non-collision orbits, which however here can be periodic. Here can be periodic or quasi-periodic. And as I will show you in a moment, the typical shape of this bounded orbit is the usual, say, rosette shape, which explain the precession effects of the theory of relativity. Okay, for instance, here you have a typical periodic solution. Here is a solution with winding number two around the ocean. Winding number two around the origin. Here is a periodic solution with winding number three around the origin, and here a periodic solution with winding number five around the origin. Okay, so again here a new solution which has again winding number five around the origin, but you see that here there is also something more because while in the previous solution In the previous solution, if you consider the radial, the radial oscillation, the oscillation of the radial part of the solution, you simply see one maximum point and one minimum point. Here, it's very easy to realize that you have three maximum points for the radial component of the solution. So, this is saying you that you can distinguish a solution using essentially two different integer numbers. Different integer numbers. A first one is the number of windings around the origin, and the second one is the number of oscillations of the radial component. Okay, I will come back to this in a few minutes. At the end, this is a typical quasi-periodic solution. Okay, if the solution does not close, as you know, this is the situation and this orbit. This is the situation, and this orbit feels this annular region in the sense that the image is dense. Okay, so with this in mind, what is our contribution? As the title of my talk says, we will always deal with periodic solutions and I will present four different types of results. At first, I will give a complete classic. First, I will give a complete classification of the set of periodic solutions of a fixed period capital T. Okay, this is a kind of preliminary result that we need, which, however, as far as we know, was not emphasized in the literature. Then we will start with our existence results for s for perturbations of the of the problem. Here you see an external uh forcing term. External forcing term of a gradient type, and in front of it, a parameter epsilon, which is going to be small. Okay, we assume that this U is t periodic in time, and we will look for a periodic solution having the same period of the perturbation. And we will do this via, let's say, geometrical methods, dynamical system techniques. Later, we will move to a more global. A more global problem in the sense that the equation is the same, but now you don't see anymore this epsilon, because I mean that this force can be also also large. And we again, we will discuss the existence of t-periodic solution, this time via variational methods. And at the end, if I will have time, I will also give some partial variation a characterization. Partial variation, a characterization of the periodic solution of the problem with no perturbation. Okay, and this will be done with level estimates and Morse index computation. And in particular, for the Morse index computation, we will go to the symplectic side of the story. So again, this will be a combination of variational and geometrical methods. So at least I hope that what I'm going to say can be. Going to say can be in the spirit of the title of this conference because you will see an interplay between geometrical and variational methods. So let me start with the first problem and before giving the result, just this terminology, which essentially I have already mentioned before. We will say that a non-circular t-periodic solution is of type NK. Is of type n k if it has a winding number k and the minimal period of the radial part is t divided by n. So this means that you make n oscillations with respect to the radial part. Okay, here k must be greater or equal than 2 and n must be less or equal to k minus mod. Okay, this is something which I have already explained. I have already explained, you see these examples. Well, the winding number at the end is even more difficult to be understood from a picture, but the number n is very clear because you just count the maximum points. Okay, here you see they are three and here one, two, three, and four, five. Okay, so just a small remark: I am assuming that k is greater than zero. Is greater than zero, but well, the opposite case just means that you make a time inversion, or which is the same, a change of sign of the angular moment. So in some sense, this is not a restriction. From now on, you could double all the number of periodic solutions I will obtain. Okay, and so the first simple preliminary result is this. Result is this existence result for periodic solution of a fixed period t. So let us define these horrible values, which depends on two parameters, k, which is going to be the winding number, and di, which is going to be the number of oscillations of the radial component. And then, together with Dambarosio, Walter, and Guilliamo Filtrin, we prove the following. Okay, assume that K. Okay, assume that k is greater or equal than two and assume that capital T, the period, is between two consecutive of such values consecutive with respect to I. Then you have exactly up to time translation and space rotation i non-circular t-periodic solution with a winding number equal to k and they are of time. And they are of type 1K, 2K, 3K, and so on up to IK. So you see, to have a periodic solution of the winding number K, you need that T is greater than T1K, okay? But then on growing on T, more and more non-circular T-periodic solution with winding number K exist with an increasing With an increasing number of oscillations for the radians. So, as a corollary, we also can say that if you fix a period capital T, well, T-periodic solution, non-circular T-periodic solution, do not always exist, but they exist if and only if T is greater than the infimum with respect to. Infimum with respect to k over t1k. Okay, and since this quantity is decreasing with respect to k, and the infimum is the limit, which is just this constant. Okay, so in such a case, if t is greater than this quantity, you have t periodic solutions of winding number k for any k large enough. Okay, so this is a kind of preliminary result, which is. Preliminary result, which is obtained by direct phase plane analysis. So, how do we use this result? Okay, now we consider our perturbed problem. I repeat, u is a t-periodic in the time variable and epsilon is a small parameter. And now we look for t-periodic solutions which stay near non-circular t-periodic solution of the problem. T-periodic solution of the problem with epsilon equal to zero. Notice that now I must say, if any, because we know that if t is too small, we do not have at all non-circular t-periodic solutions of the problem with no perturbation. And so, what we proved with Dambrosi and Feltrin is the following. If the problem with no perturbation has a t-periodic solution. Is a t-periodic solution, say X star of type NK? Well, if epsilon is small enough, then the perturbed problem has at least three T-periodic solutions, which bifurcates from the manifold of time translation and space rotation of these solutions, in the sense that each of them is near to a suitable time translation and space rotation. translation and space rotation of the solution x star and in particular since since they they are close to this this solution and the winding number is continuous they have a winding number equal to 2k okay so as a corollary if capital t is greater than this lower bound that we have discussed the the unperturbed problem has a periodic solution As a periodic solution, t-periodic solution for any k large enough. And so you can find for the perturbed problem essentially as many solutions as you wish, because you fix a finite number of them, you make the bifurcation, and then you obtain the result. Okay. So just a very brief sketch of the proof, which goes by. Which goes by geometrical methods and dynamical system techniques. So we are in the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics. So here we can regard our perturbed problem as a perturbation of a completely integrable Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom. And we have a periodic solution for epsilon equal to zero, but actually we have a manifold of periodic solution. Manifold of periodic solution, which is made by all the time translation and space rotation of this periodic solution. So you have two independent angles, and this means that you have a torus of periodic solutions. Okay, of course, this is not surprising because you know that completely integrable Hamiltonian system possess invariant torus for the dynamics. And so the point is just to take each one of these. Take each one of these invariant torus and to prove that you can make a perturbation using a higher-dimensional version of the Poincare Birkov fixed point theorem due to Fondo Orena some years ago. So I know that most of you are probably more familiar with Tori filled by quasi-periodic solution, because this is the setting of KM theory. Here we are on the other side. Here we are on the other side of the dynamics, and the periodic tori are a much more delicate object, so they typically do not persist if you add a perturbation, but still you find some trace of these periodic tori as typically isolated periodic solutions which survive to the perturbation. And I said that you can find three of them. This is not an history. Them, this is not an history because three is the category of the two-dimensional torus. Okay, so at a more technical level, what we did is the following and is essentially just an explicit construction of action angle variables for the problem with no perturbation, and then checking that they. and then checking that the usual non-degeneracy condition of Km theory is satisfied for the Hamiltonian in action angle coordinates. And this is enough to apply this version of the Poinkaravierkov theorem in IRT function. Of course, I'm more familiar with periodic solution because I come from non-linear analysis, but you immediately realize that Immediately realize that since we have proved this condition also true also by the methods of KM theorem, you could also directly obtain that many tori filled by quasi-periodic solution instead persist if the perturbation term, say, is small and smooth enough. This is in some sense the other side of the story. Okay, so I will not say anything more about this proof, but Anything more about this proof, but just if you are curious about the explicit formula for the Hamiltonian, okay, this is here it is. And you see this expression, which maybe looks quite complicated, but you see it's fully explicit. So you can make any kind of computation as you want. And in particular, I want to notice that if you take the non-relativistic limit in the sense that Activistic limit in the sense that c goes to plus infinity. Okay, this is not evident, requires some careful computations. But at the end, you end up with this expression, which is the usual Kepler-Hamiltonian in action angle variables, okay, in Delaunay coordinates. Of course, here you see only one action because the Kepler problem is a superintegrable as. A super integrable as we know. Okay, and now I move on the variational side of the story. And again, the equation you can think that is the same, but here we don't put this epsilon in front of the external forcet term because this perturbation can be also large. Okay, and again, we. Okay, and again we look for a t-periodic solution. Now, we of course we do not expect a precise localization, but we again we will be able to distinguish this solution using their winding number around the origin. And precisely, the result that we proved, this time with Walter Dan Bros and Duciopini, is a preprint, is the following. Fix any Fix any t greater than zero, so no lower bound this time, and fix any k different from zero, then the first problem has at least two t-periodic solutions with a winding number equal to k. Okay, and so as a corollary, of course, for any period, the first problem has infinitely many periodic solutions. Many periodic solution. Okay, and I stress that here you don't have assumption on the forcing term apart from the fact that it's t-periodic in time. Of course, you don't expect assumption if you make a perturbation result, but in a more global setting, in principle, you could expect some behavior for these. Some behavior for this perturbation at infinity, but this is not the case. And so, again, some comments about the proof of this result, which I have already mentioned, goes by variation methods. Okay, well, formally, you don't have problems because you have a Lagrangian. A Lagrangian, okay, and then you integrate the Lagrangian and you obtain the usual action function. Action functional, now of course, you have also this extra term which comes from the perturbation. When you have an action functional, you would like to find the solution as critical point of this action functional. Today is action functional. At this level, you have two main difficulties, essentially. So, the first difficulty comes from the fact that the kinetic part of the Lagrangian is not smooth, because of course, here you have a constraint on the velocity, and on the boundary of this constraint, which gives you a convex set, you have the square root, which is not C one. Square root, which is not C1. Okay. So you cannot use tools of usual critical point theory. The second difficulty is very well known to people using variational methods in celestial mechanics and is due to the fact that the potential part, this Keplerian term, is singular near the center of the center. Singular near the center of attraction, which is the origin. So, what to do? What to do? Well, at the end, these are not very serious difficulty because, okay, you don't have a smooth functional, but on suitable domains, and in particular on the sobola space W1 infinity, if you're not familiar with this, just think about. With this, just think about the set of Lipschitz continuous functions. Okay, the kinetic part still has some good convexity and continuity property. So you can easily enter the setting of a suitable version of a non-smooth critical point of theory. And this is something which started several years ago with Schulkin and then other contributions. Then other contributions followed on this line. Okay, so you have a good theory also for this non-smooth function. Still, there is something delicate because you have a boundary and it's not obvious that the critical point, according to the definition by Schulkin, gives you a true solution of the differential equation, because they a priori can can touch the boundary. Can touch the boundary, but actually, due to minimal modification of arguments by Mawen and collaborators, you can prove that this cannot happen. So you are completely safe. If you find a critical point of this non-smooth functional in spite of the existing boundary, okay, you will always find a true solution of the differential equation. And so this solves and ends. Solves and ends the first difficulty. Okay, so as for the second one, well, let me say that actually this is not a difficulty because here you work with a Lipschitz continuous function. So if a Lipschitz continuous function vanishes somewhere, well, you know that the order of vanishing is, of course, at least one. Okay. And this means that. Okay, and this means that this improper integral, then the integral of the potential part, is always plus infinity. And even more, you can prove that if a sequence converges uniformly to a limit function x-bar which has collision, then also the corresponding integrals go to plus integrity. So for those of you who who You who are familiar with variational methods, essentially the situation is the same as the one which you have when the kinetic term is the usual one, but the potential term satisfies the strong force condition of Gordon. So relativistic effects help a lot in finding solutions. In finding a solution. Let me say, you pay the price of working with non-smooth functional, because this is more difficult, but at the end, you can find much more solution essentially with no serious difficulty. And just to be very brief about the arguments, we want to find the solution with any winding number k different from zero. So we consider the same. Also, we consider the set of t-periodic loops with a winding number equal to k. It's easy to see in known that this set is bounded if k is not zero and that this set is connected but not simply connected. So you have some non-trivial topology. And then a first solution can be obtained by globally minimizing the direction function along this set. While the second solution Well, the second solution is obtained by a mean max argument, a kind of mountain pass argument, because you can take all non-noulomotopic loops in lambda k, which we start and end at the minimum solution, at the minimal solution, and you construct the usual min-max level, and you prove that you have a critical point at this level. Critical point at this level. There is maybe a little observation which must be done because, in principle, this critical level could be the same of the minimal solution. So you could say, well, but in this case, I just find one solution. But actually, this is not the case, because in this degenerate case, you find much more and you find a continuum of critical points, actually, a continuum of. Points actually a continuum of local minimum of direction functional and then infinitely many, infinitely many periodic solutions. Okay, this is for instance, this the general case is realized, for instance, when you don't have perturbation at all. Finally, a further technical difficulty, you cannot prove Paris-Mell condition in the strong topology of W1 infinity, but however, But, however, due to the specific form of the functional, you can prove that if a Palace-Mei sequence converges in infinity, you find in the limit a critical point. Okay. And so in say two or three minutes, the final part of the result of the story. And now let us come back to the problem with no perturbation. With no perturbation. Okay. We already know a lot about this, but now we also know that by the variational result, if we fix t and k, let's say greater or equal than one, then you have a t-periodic solution with one number k, which locally minimizes the action functional, which is locally minimal for the action functional. Direction functional. Okay. And so, since you know the set of a periodic solution, the question is: this one: Is this solution a circular solution of minimal period T over K, which regarded as a T-periodic solution as winding number K, or rather is a non-circular solution, namely a Rosetta-type solution? Well, in some cases, we already know that. cases we already know the answers because for instance if k is equal to one you don't have Rosetta solution at all and also if k is greater or equal than two recall that you you need a bound a lower bound that t must be greater than this value t1k okay so what we prove is that in all the other case namely if a non-specific If a non-circular solution of period t and winding number k exist, the minimal solution is non-circular for sure. And more precisely, is a non-circular t-periodic solution of type 1k. So is the simplest one in some sense because it makes exactly one oscillation in the radial component. And the sketch of the proof is sketch of the proof is the following. Okay, so assume that t is greater than t1k, otherwise you don't have a non-circular solution, and precisely assume that t is between such two consecutive values, which I recall ensures that you have high non-circular t-period solution. And then we compute the Morse index of the circular solution of minimal period. Solution of minimal period T over K. And using Morse index theorem and Connlade-Zender index theory, we are able to provide an exact formula. And we know that this Morse index is at least 2i. Okay, so I think this is nice by itself because you see here the circular solution loses more and more the minimality. more the minimality when when on growing on the number of non-circular periodic solution of winding number k so in any case the being non- not zero the the the the circular solution cannot be minimal so uh the the minimal solution must be non-circular and then we we just have to to make some consideration about the the the index n okay if the non-circular solution is If the non-circular solution is of type n k. And again, here we have essentially complete formulas for the action level of this non-circular solution. And we easily see that the one with lowest action is always the one with n equal to one. Okay, and so this concludes the proof of this final result and also my talk. Also, my talk, and many thanks for your attention. Thank you, Alberto. So, is there any question or comment? If not, I have one. I was wondering if so, for the perturbed case, you get two at least periodic orbits, whether At least periodic orbits, whether one could check if they are elliptic or hyperbolic, or I mean, to try to see, I don't know, for instance, if there is cows or things like this, I mean, for a given U, I mean, for a given perturbation. Elliptic or arpeggio, in which sense, sorry, in sense of stability or yes, yes, yes, yes, sorry, yeah, exactly. Ah, yes, I maybe it may be one. maybe one one could try to to to make uh to to to make something but uh i don't know at the moment okay thank you thank you is there any other question yes i have a question so what about mission three oh okay thank you uh i forgot to say all this is in the plane uh by all this is in the plane uh as for the variational result As for the variational result, we have a work in progress with Dombros and Papini, and essentially we are able to prove the existence of infinitely many solutions also in dimension three with some reasonable assumption of the perturbation. While I do not know about the dynamical part of the result, because I'm worried that the situation can be a bit more degenerate because. A bit more degenerate because if you see the problem with no perturbation in the space, I don't know if the correct non-degeneracy condition is satisfied. So maybe it's easier. Well, it's easier because now we are able to do it with valuational methods. Thank you for the question, Larry. Yeah, thanks for the answer. Okay, so are there more questions? Yeah, Andrea. So I would like to ask a question. So if I understand in the variational result, is it really the fact that you have the relativistic term that allows you to work on a Lipschitz Leapsheet loop? If I understand, because otherwise, if you don't have the relativistic term, Relativistic term, the space of flip sheet loop, it seems to be that it is too small to be sure to have a critical point. Is it correct? Or yes, well, the space of lip sheets loops is natural because you have a bound on the velocity. So it's the natural the natural functional space. I would say that the the key point i is that we in in this class you can also avoid the collisions very easily. Avoid the collisions very easily. And indeed, as Vivina said yesterday, if you don't have relativistic effects, the existence of T-periodic solutions for the usual problem is not known. You get generalized periodic solution or you need some symmetry assumption on the perturbation. In some sense, it's much easier to work in this relative. To work in this relativistic regime. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you to you. Thank you. So, are there more questions or remarks? Well, if not, let's thank Alberta again. So, thanks for your talk.
