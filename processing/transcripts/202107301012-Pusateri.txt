And his talk is going to be on internal modes and radiation damping for quite a bit climb boredom in three dimensions. Well, thank you very much, Alex, for the introduction. And thanks a lot to you and all the other organizers, Hao, Jacob, and Sasha, for the invitation. It's been really a wonderful conference and I enjoyed a lot all the time. And I enjoyed a lot all the talk and the variety. And so I'm going to add a little bit of variety, I think, here, talking about something that is not exactly fluids, but I think relevant and hopefully interesting to fluids, problems and people. So this is about credit-line order. So most of it, let me write here, is which is done legisl. I mean, I'll mention the names of the collaborators also later. But the main result about Coen Gordon is. But the main result about Cohen Gordon is with him, was a positive princen. So, as I said, this is not exactly Fruit's talk, but it is related to quantum fluids. So, that should be already interesting. And so, and there's a few things that I think are relevant here. So, one main phenomenon of interest is that we're going to look at the nonlinear interaction between discrete and continuous spectrum in a nonlinear model. In an Enlightened model. And I'm going to describe the long-term dynamics of what happens, and in particular, how the energy moves, in our case, from the discrete to the continuous spectrum. And there's going to be one main analytical tool of interest, which is we're going to use the free transform adapted to the Schrodinger operator, and we're going to use it non-linearly. So this is kind of a classical tool, but I think the way we are kind of developing things is geared towards non-linear problems. Towards nonlinear problems. And this is going to allow us to study oscillations and interaction of localized waves under the influence of external potential. So, a typical scenario you can imagine is you have a localized perturbation of a stationary state, a non-linear PD, and you're going to have to look at localized waves, how they interact in the presence of a large potential. So, that's kind of the motivation. And so, the structure of the dog is as follows. I'll first introduce the problem. Follows. I'll first introduce the problem and some related questions to give a little bit of, so slightly broader perspective, some connected things to what I'm going to talk about, discuss the main result in detail and the statement. And again, this is joint work with Leger Tristan at Princeton. And I'm going to give ideas of the proof. And this is going to be split into two main parts. It's going to be a first part that has to do with the more audio dynamics, something that's a little more classical, called the Fermi-Gondon rule. And there's going to be a second part. And there's going to be a second part, and in between, I'm going to discuss the disorder Fourier transform. So, just give a brief introduction and how we plan to actually use it non-linearly to do multinarharmonic analysis. So, this is kind of the plan. So, now let me just give you, jump right into the problem and then take a slightly broader perspective a little later. So, we're going to look at the Klein-Gordon equations, and here I'm going to write the simplest quadratic perturbation of a linear Klein-Gordon. So, I have dtu squared. Klein-Gordon. So I have dtu squared at the d squared of u, and then I have minus Laplacian plus vu. That is a mass term, which I've normalized to be one, and the quadratic knowing RU squared. And this is going to be in three dimensions. And so the assumptions on the Schoening operator and on V are the following. So V is real, decaying, and generic. So generic, I'll discuss it more later. But here I just mean that the bottom of the spectrum, in this case, is zero energy. Bottom of the spectrum. In this case, zero energy is not an eigenvalue resonance. But again, I'll give the precise definition later. So in particular, V is decaying, so there is continuous spectrum of zero infinity, and then there's going to be one negative eigenvalue for the Schrodinger operator. But the way I want to write it, because we're talking about Klen Gordon, is that I want this negative eigenvalue for the Schrodinger operator H to be such that I have a H to be such that I have an eigenfunction phi, so that h plus m squared, so the massive, if you wish, shrinking operator, has eigenfunction phi and eigenvalue lambda squared. Okay, so I'm going to just draw a picture. So phi will be regular and decaying automatically, and such a phi is called an internal mode of oscillation. Now, let me just get the next point here, and I'll do the picture. So, I'm also going to assume that 2Î» is bigger than m. bigger than m so what we have here is if this is m squared so there is continuous spectrum above here and zero is here and then I'm going to assume that there is a lambda here between zero let me call it lambda squared between zero and m squared right so everything so the spectrum is shifted I'm looking here at the spectrum of the the massive shooting operator so shifted by m squared Shoulding operators also shifted by m squared. And then I'm going to assume that 2 lambda is bigger than m. So if I look at 4 lambda squared, it's going to be inside the continuous spectrum. And there there's going to be an assumption which is also classical called the Fermi, called the null. I'm going to discuss it and see how it comes in. All right, but this is kind of a general situation. So you have one linear operator, there's Operator, there's a bound state here for the Schrodinger operator, and it's just not too negative. Okay, and I look at the Klein-Gordon evolution. So, now because of this, there is a bound state. So, in particular, if you look at the linear equation, there are time periodic and spatially localized solutions to parameter family of this form. So, A cosine lambda t and then phi x. Lambda t and then phi x and so what I'm interested in is to see what happens inside the non-linear flow to these time periodic and spatially localized solutions, these bound states, or sometimes I'm just going to go in internal mode. And so the question is, it's a classical question which has been studied, is do small perturbations so if you take a small, sorry, phi, and then you take a small perturbation of the equation, non-linear perturbation. The equation, non-linear perturbation, do this persist this time-periodic and spatially organized solutions? The answer is under certain conditions such as the Fermi-Wonner rule, the answer will be no. But then you want to know what happens to the internal oscillation, so to something that's close to this, and how does the full solution of the non-linear equation behave? So, short answers is, as I said, no, under some condition, what happens to the internal oscillation is that it will transfer energy to the continuous spectrum. Energy to the continuous spectrum, and it will decay over time at some rate that one can prove. And the whole nonlinear solution of the whole Klein-Gordon with the nonlinearity, say U squared, will also decay, but slowly to equilibrium. So this will be a spoiler. This is a spoiler of the result. I'm going to state everything precisely. But first, very importantly, so in a seminar paper, Sofer and Weinstein answered all these questions for the cubic clinic. For the cubic Klein-order equation. So take exactly the same equation, same setting, the cubic nonlinearity. And so this is a beautiful paper. But it's understood that if you are in a dispersive or wave nonlinear world, lower powers are harder to treat than higher powers when you are in a perturbative setting, such as will be. And I think a good important motivation is that if you look at Motivation is that if you look at a generic physical perturbation or like a physical model, will include quadratic terms. Okay, so this is definitely this was a question that we thought it was interesting to look at. It's kind of classical, but it appears also in other places that I will show. So before I go to some more examples, so this is again a classical problem studied by Siegel. So Siegel is the first one that showed that actually the solutions. One that showed that actually the solutions do not persist inside the non-linear flow, but didn't say how things would behave. And so, for Wines, I did a series of works also on the quantum resonance, which is for embedded eigenvalues inside the continuous spectrum, kind of really the topic, really the tools also. And then in 99 solved this problem for the QBKG. There's very important related work on NLS by Tsai and Yao, and then more improvements on the Sulfur Weinstein by Bamusiku Kanya. There's some one-dimensional work, but I'll talk a bit more maybe about one-dimensional. But I'll talk a bit more, maybe, about one dimension later, and then some refinements more recently about these works. And these types of problems are relevant to a few things. So one is topological defects. So you can imagine you have like a medium with dispersive waves passing through and you have an impurity. So this will be the bound state. And then you can ask whether this is somehow mitigated by the waves, if it kind of will disappear possibly slowly over time. Or you can. Slowly over time, or you can think of a particle-field interaction problem where you have something that evolves like a field with a continuous spectrum, and then you have particles. And so, you look at this kind of interactions, and then you will get similar, similar mathematical models and questions. And if you look also at solitons and topological solids, and I'll give some examples in the next slide. Now, one thing to note before we start is that if you even look at the simpler problem, which is the Klein-Gordon with the potential. Klein-Gordon with the potential, so H here is still minus Laplacian plus V as before, and quadratic nonlinearity and no bound states. So, even for this, there is no strong notion of stability of the trivial solution. So, if you take small solutions localized and you look at the evolution, I don't think it was known that if you have decay and scattering of this solution, and so we're looking at this case also with the bounce hit. But for Schrodinger, we were able about a year ago. We were able about a year ago, a little more than a year ago, to actually do something for Schrodinger together with Abisov. And part of what we do here will also be important for the proof, so I'll discuss it a bit later on. And please interrupt if there's questions, or you can write in the chat, maybe I can see. So, are all of these results in three dimensions or the one? Right, yeah, so all of this here. Three dimension is important, yeah. Yeah, that's right. So, all of these are except the Yeah, that's right. So all of these are except the one where I wrote here in 1D. Right, so all of these that I wrote are, well, you know, some things you can generalize. Yeah, of course. But these are mostly three-dimensional. There are some results also, I guess. Sorry? The results of the bottom of the page are in one dimension or in three dimensions? You mean down here? No, this one is in three dimensions. You know, everything is in 3D except this one in 1D, which is the same scenario, but you take a much larger power. I mean, of course, as you go down. But also, the geometry is different in one and 3D. So as I explained the proof, you'll see that there's differences as you look at localized waves interacting with the potential. Yeah. That answers the question. Yeah, so all of this so far is right, so Trinity. But now let me look at some actually lower dimensional problems also to make the connection. Because some of the analysis is actually, even if you're in 3D, it's kind of connected to the 1D, for example, analysis. So let's see what happens. And some related models. And one thing I will say is that even when you're in 3D, like we will be, some behaviors, like the frequency behavior maybe of the radiation. Of the radiation for this problem, they have some 1D features. So there's connections there. And one famous one-dimensional model that's been studied quite a lot recently is the Phi 4 model. So this is, you take the simple wave equation with a potential energy, which is a double well. And this has a stationary solution called the kink, which connects to vacuum states minus one and one. And this is. And this is called, well, it's the simplest example of a topological solid. It is not localized in space. And the question is whether this is stable. Now, on the next page, I'm going to linearize and we'll get exactly the type of equations that I'm working on, except this will be in 1D. Now, you can ask similar questions about stability of stationary states that are not localized. So not classical solidons, but if you should topological solidons. Soilons, and this would be vortices, for example, for the 2D Gins-Berlandau model. So you can take an energy, which is very similar to the one you get for the Ï.4. Here are vortex solutions. So n is like the essentially the topological degree is the winding number around zero. And this looks as simple as one minus one over rho squared. So they're not localized. And you can ask the same kind of question. Okay, so when you end up taking the evolution here and linearizing, you will get a Klein-Gordon equation. And linearizing, you will get a Klein-Gordon equation with the potential. And in particular, so if you look at the 5-4, just the simplest to write down and the most well-known, you will get exactly a model like the one that we're treating. This is in one dimension, and the potential here as an internal mode. So it's exactly the same picture of the spectrum that I showed. So there's a strong connection, and then you would like to know for these objects. And then you would like to know for these objects, this kink, the question you would like to solve answers the question of asymptotic stability, and that's basically the small data global in time decay and scattering for such a U, which is what we are studying. And ideally, what you would like to get is that your non-linear solution then decomposes into a modulated version of the stationary one, something that has to do with the Do with the internal mode, so with the bound state, a discrete what I call the discrete component, and then a dispersion, dispersing radiation component. So, in our result, we don't have the final, we're kind of starting already at the level of the layerization, if you wish, but we're gonna see like this, these objects, these parts of the solution. So, let me state. Can I ask one more question? So, for the high-order topological solitons, are you still able to for the higher dimension? Are you still able to for the higher dimension ones, are you still able to there there's some hy there's some hypothesis there on the potential T, that specific hypothesis with the with the one with the spectrum and one eigenvalue. Is that still true for the coming for the potentials coming from the higher topological solitons? So it kind of depends. In 3D, it's kind of hard even already to construct like this kind of solid. I think they exist, but I, you know, I haven't. Sort of, I think they exist, but I, you know, I haven't computed it. I don't know if it's been computed exactly. And for 2D, it's a bit more explicit. It kind of depends, I guess, on the problem, but I think you can, you know, under maybe under some maybe even a little more restrictive assumptions, maybe. You can have some real symmetry, then you can compute more precisely. But is this true? So the potentials that arise from there, are they of the type that you are looking at? Oh, you mean for this specific problem? Yes. Yes, for the purpose of applying to topological solitons. Yeah, well, I haven't computed also because it's right, so there's no, I don't have a good example in 3D of a topological soliton, right? And then, well, the 2D already analysis is harder, right? So I couldn't even tell, right? So that would be need to be pushed quite a bit. Yeah. But okay, 1D, for example, everything is explicit. And the big, there's a strong connection. Parts of the analysis are easier. So parts of what I will present. Are easier so parts of what I will present it becomes much easier in 1D, but of course you lose other things, right? You lose decay and so on. But a lot of what I will say actually already applies to the 1D, right? 2D, no, so it doesn't apply to the 2D much. And in 3D, that's a good question. And I've actually a good example of a case where you can compute the spectrum. Also, because, like, you know, the topology of Sony would be much more complicated. Yeah, exactly. Those are pretty complicated to get that information. To get that information, I mean, you go to different limits at infinity, yeah. So, this I don't know, actually, yeah, it's a good question. I mean, I haven't looked at it, maybe this now, yeah. Okay, thank you. Yeah, no problem. Oh, thanks, thanks for the question. So, right, so this is again the same problem I wrote before. I normalize the mass to be one. So, lambda now is between one half and one. And so the way we're going to do, we're going to take the nonlinear solution, decompose it into two parts that are toggle. Into two parts that are orthogonal. One will be along the continuous spectrum, this is V, and one will be in the direction of the internal mode. So sometimes I call it discrete and continuous parts. And if you write down the nonlinear problem in this for these two, for this decomposition, you will get an ODE for the amplitude A of the internal mode, and you will get a PD for the A PD for the continuous and what we call radiation component. So, something for A, amplitude of internal mode, and something for the radiation. So, this is PD. And then you have to study this system. Now, it's quite coupled in the sense that the radiation V, so feeds that leading order into the ODE. So, if you look at the ODE, of course, you have to do some analysis, you have to be able to eventually prove this, but like the leading order. But like the leading order dynamics will come from how V fits into the A equation. And at the same time, and this is, we'll see it, the A forces at leading order the radiation V. Okay, so in some sense, it's quite coupled and each one depends on the other, so you have to study them at the same time. Study them at the same time and quite carefully. Here, I wrote again the same equation. So, both the ODE and PDE, I think they present conceptual and technical difficulties, but the ODE can be analyzed kind of in the classical way. It will be technically harder, but it can be approached in a way that I will explain using normal forms and the assumption of the Fermi-Gordon rule. It will just be a little harder to isolate the leading dynamics, which will give some damping for A from the lower orders. Because now lower orders. Orders because now lower orders are a lower power. So, and for the PDE, you need quite something quite different, I think, from what has been done. Because even if you disregard the forcing from A and just look at the simple quadratic Langordon like this, then for this one, we didn't know if there's a global small solution in the case. All right, so again, same problem. And the theorem is the following: so, under the assumption I gave So, under the assumption I gave above one v plus the Fermi-Golden rule, which I will discuss, and you take a small initial data with some localization in L2, then you have a unique robot solution. Okay, fine, but the most important thing is how does this behave? And so the amplitude of the internal mode is going to decay as such, like epsilon and one over one plus epsilon squared t to the one-half. And v is going to behave more or less like a dispersive component. And what we can say, A dispersive component, and what we can say, we can measure, say, the L6 norm and say, or something slightly below, and say the decay is more or less almost like 1 over t, but not quite. We can say that we have integral decay, for example. And even more precisely, what's the arithmetic behavior? So, if I look at V was my radiation, so the continuous part of the solution, and I take out the linear flow in this way by defining F. In this way, by defining f, my profile. And then, because it's that's the way the proof will go is by using the dissorted Fourier transform. So, let me phrase it like that, because it comes naturally out of the proof. But I will have to define what this is. Of course, I will do it. But for now, let's think just that you can take a Fourier transform, you can invert it. It's an ensemble-journal two on the continuous spectrum. And right, so let me define f tilde to be the Fourier transform of F. And then I can say how F tilde looks like. And then I can say how if tilde looks like. And it will look like, so there will be up to remainders, one part, which is H, which is the one like the dispersive part. So this will be such that I can get some dispersive estimates on it and say that it's small. Maybe this is not exactly accurate, but okay, it's not that small. We have to kind of lose something. And then there will be some part. And then there will be some part, which is the part of the radiation that is forced by the discrete component, which looks a little more complicated, but it's something like this. So if you imagine that you're very close, so if your xi is very close to lambda and distance, so Japanese is one, so one plus c squared is the Japanese bracket. Japanese bracket. If you're very close, so this is negligible, then you have some kind of exponential of v to the i log of s here. Maybe let me highlight it. So e to the i, so you have exponential to the i log s, and y is more or less like one over s. This is so y squared. Y beh is like one over the root. So some expression like that. So it's really after you integrate it, it will be of the form e to the i log of a b. log of maybe one plus epsilon squared s, something like that. Okay, so kind of logarithmic correction for the just the amplitude here of this Fourier transform that's not even small after some time. So that's how it looks like. Okay, but I mean one won't get to all this, but at least I'm going to explain how one has to look at this problem. Has to look at this problem and at least where the two main parts come out without maybe even getting to the final result, but just to give an idea. So what we get is indeed that the amplitude of the internal mode, which for the linear solution is just there, separating in time, this actually will decay slowly and radiate the energy to the continuous spectrum. And it decays at this rate of t to the minus one half, which is kind of the maximum. Minus one half, which is kind of the maximal allowed rate. And this will come from redition dam. This is what I will discuss in the next two slides. Then, after that, I'm going to explain how we approach the question of stability and decay for the radiation. And one important thing will be to split it into two parts. So, one bad part, which is the part that is forced by internal mode, kind of responsible for the first more completely asymptotic part. As first, more completely asymptotic part G in the theorem, and one good part, which is as more dispersive features. So, this is, and then along the argument, you have to propagate different bounds for this. And the way we'll approach V, as I said, is to use the Fourier transform as to the Schrodinger operator. Okay, so let me first discuss then the ODE part, basically. This is the ODE part, and this would be the PDE. And when I discuss the PDE, And when I discuss the PDE, I will have to define and discuss how we use the free transform. So, first, let's look again at the system, pass to first-order variable, because that's more convenient, and filter out the oscillations from the expected oscillation from the internal mode. And so you will get something like this. So, here you have a dot that's equal to some expression. Have a dot as equals some expression, and the most important is say the first one, which is quadratic in A and W here. And then this will be the Klein-Gordon. And I only kept the first order, the leading order term, or at least what I hope and expect to be the leading order term. So the second equation you can solve explicitly. Now, notice that if I write Soduamo's formula here for W, because 2Î» is inside the continuous spectrum, The continuous spectrum, right? So this will be singular. So I have e to the i s to lambda, and then I have s lambda here. Okay, so this will be some singular. Once I integrate by parts, I get something singular, but this can be calculated. And what you will get is at leading order, an expression of this form. That is a delta at the value at the spectral parameter 2 lambda. vector parameter 2 lambda of a squared. And now the idea will be to take this with the oscillations and plug it inside the equation for A. So you do that. And then you'll see that you will get a cubic expression in A. So you get A dot is equal to something cubic in A. And here I only isolated the parts that are relevant. Relevant. And so you see, I have two copies of A, and then I have an A bar. So you get something, and then mod A squared A. And it turns out that, so here you see, you have mod A squared A and single out this first part, which is a negative constant times this expression. And this expression is a square. Right, you see, so we have the integral of phi. The integral of phi, phi was the original eigenfunction. So phi squared, then you have projection onto the mode to lambda, and then again phi squared. And so by Plancharelle, just think of applying Plancharelle like for the Eigerford transform, this will be the square of the transform of phi squared evaluated at 2 lambda. Right? And so now you see that if, so this number is non-negative, and if it's zero, And if it's zero here, then what's left in the equation for A is something Hamiltonian. So A will not decay, it will just rotate, if you wish. Now, if this is not zero, and this was the major realization of Seagal and then Sopher-Weinstein and others, then you will get dumping inside this equation. So if this constant is not zero, then you will get A dot is minus mod of A square. A dot is minus mod of a squared a plus Hamiltonian themes, and this will give you the decay. Okay, so this is the Fermi-Donner rule. That is my understanding of how it works. Now, one important point that I'm not going to discuss much, but it's important to notice that if you want to isolate this ODE for A, we have to remember that there's lots of non-linear terms that have to do also with the radiation. So, you have to be able to isolate. With the radiation, so you have to be able to isolate this dynamic, these dynamics inside the whole ODE, the whole couple of ODE, and for that, you have to estimate remainders. Now, this may or may not be easy, but one of the things, for example, you have to do in the quadratic case is to get some estimate for an expression like this, where you have a quadratic expression in W and get some kind of fast enough decay. And this is already non-trivial even for a regular solution of, you know, without the potential. Of without the potential and just the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation with no bound states. So, this is something you have to do, and you have to do it in this setting. So, this is why I meant, so the main mechanism here for now is classical, but it's technically harder to isolate. Now, as we move to the PDE, then many more things will be non-classical. So, please let me know if there's questions. Right, so now let's move on to the PD, which I write here as a half-Klein Gordon. And then you have terms that are non-linear. So you have quadratic in A, mixed, and quadratic in W. Now, as we saw before, this was the mean forcing in the equation for W. That's the part that I solved explicitly and then plugged into the ODE. So this is kind of like an explicit thing. And what we can see is that it's singular when the frequency is such that the Japanese The frequency is such that the Japanese bracket of the frequency is 2Î». This is something that we saw already before when I solved just for this piece. Then there's things that are mixed. Let's not discuss them, although they're non-trivial. And then there's terms that are quadratic in the radiation. And so these ones I will discuss. Keeping in mind that even if I discuss only Klein-Gordon equal to W squared, I have to think that my W is forced. W, it is forced by the internal mode. But for a large part of the discussion, I just think that maybe this is my equation, right? And not worry about the rest for a while. So what I need to understand is if my W is initially localized, then can I actually control these interactions? That will be the goal for a few more slides. And so let's focus on that. For now, I also keep the leading goal. For now, I also keep the leading order just to show the decomposition into the good and bad parts that the theorem alluded to. So you have one part of W that's forced by the internal mode, and this is the part that you can solve explicitly, and we did before. You kind of take that and think that is your bad part because it's singular at the frequency such that Japanese bracket of the frequency is to lambda. Frequencies to lambda. And then, what you hope is that after you remove that, maybe the rest is good. And the point is that if you calculate what is the contribution of this G and in frequency space, you see that it's quite irregular in the sense that if you take a derivative, which is normally a quantity you would like to control, corresponding to localization on the physical space variable x, this will grow quite fast in time. Okay, so this is this is a Okay, so this is a problem. So, something that is irregular in frequency is not very localized in space. If it's not localized in space, it's harder to control non-linear interactions and then proof decay. But the hope is that, okay, maybe once I have isolated the bad part G, then what is left, the blue part is good, and maybe that I can control a little better. So, this will be one of the main ideas to try to implement. Okay. And so the first question you have to ask is, hoping that all of this is reasonable, how do I actually control localization in space, which is kind of the same as regularity here on the Fourier side, even for this equation, for such a simple equation. So let's concentrate on that for a while. Concentrate on that for a while. Okay, so this is how we got here: kind of reducing, solving the ODE. For now, we disregard it a little bit and then concentrate on the radiation. And so, let's look at a problem like this, where you have Clen-Gordon quadratic, no bound state, small solution. And let me make a general discussion about this type of problems. There's a question maybe in the chat. Problems. There's a question maybe in the chat. Oh no, sorry, was your link to other town? Okay, so loosely speaking, if I want to do a global in-time theory for a dispersive wave equation, I should rely on dispersive and decay properties to control the non-linearities. And the point is that if the power is low or the dimension is low, there is slow decay. If you have slow decay, you can't rely on the linear theory, for example, LP decay or local decay or streakers estimates. And also you. Streakers' estimates, and also you would expect manifestation of more asymptotic phenomena that are non-linear that you have to capture. And now, if there is no potential, this is something that has been studied quite a lot, starting from the 70s and the 80s, and you can use classical non-linear methods. For example, vector fields, normal form theory, multilinear estimates, and free analysis non-linearly. And these are some of the seminal contributions like early on. But then much more has been done recently, and I'll mention. But then much more has been done recently, and I'll mention some more at the end of these slides. Now, as soon as you turn on the potential, which I will call the perturbed or distorted case, as opposed to the free or flat case, then you have lots of issues with all these classical methods. Because first of all, you kill all the invariances of the equation. So you won't have commuting vector fields anymore. You won't have saddle-free analysis because frequencies don't adapt. So if you have two waves interacting, the sum of the frequencies will not be the frequency of the output wave. Will not be the frequency of the output wave. That's an issue when you look at Free methods. And also, because of that, you will have many more coherent and resonant interactions. So, you have to deal with all of that, and we'll see some of this later. Our plan, something that we've been trying to develop for the last four or five years with several collaborators, including notably, most notably Pergimen and others, is to use the distorted free transform adapted to the Schniglerator and try to do multi-harmonic analysis in the distorted frequency speech. Analysis in the distorted frequency space. So I'll show how we set that up. Now, the reason we do this is because when v is equal to zero, free analysis was quite successful. So we said, okay, let's try to see if this can actually be used. And so we're trying to develop kind of these methods in the case where you have large potential with applications, of course, to some of the problems I mentioned also before. Especially in 1D, there's been a lot of work, much less in 3D, because it's a little more complicated. Much less in 3D because it's a little more complicated, and that's what I will explain. So, here there's some references for Fourier-based techniques up to the most recent works of Gustav Nagisch and Tsai, Shermanmas, Mudin Shata, Alex Yonescu and Benoit Pasader, of course, and more Yudeng and other works. And for V not zero, there's been some attempts by Sherman, Han Walsh, and Tristana, some nice work, and then the work I mentioned with Sopher last year. With software last year. But in three-dimensional, there is not much on this kind of analysis. So, non-linear analysis of dispersive PDs or wave equations with the potential. There's a lot in 1D, where the geometry is a little simpler and one can push this more. Although, even there, there's lots of interesting open problems left open. And the solid-free transformer has also been used, but more at the linear level. But more at a linear level, to prove, for example, DK estimates by Krieger Schlag and Schlag and many collaborators, Krieger, Peninger Krieger, and Nakanishi Miao, and also by Genik Mendelssohn recently. So it's something that it's a classical thing, even from the 50s, but it hasn't been used nonlinearly much as far as I know. And that's what we're trying to do. So how does it work? So let me give a brief introduction to the distorted free transform. To the distorted free transform. So you look at solutions of the eigenvalue equations. So you look at generalized eigenfunctions psi. And if mu is mod of k squared, you have bounded solutions that behave like standard plane waves as x goes to infinity. And then under the assumptions, for example, on v that we had, say v is decaying and real, then you have a set of eigenfunctions, phi j with negative eigenvalues. j with negative eigenvalues. And the Saudi-Fourier transform is defined just as the regular one by integrating your function against the generalized eigenfunction here. And if you have discrete spectrum, you project there. And then you can reconstruct exactly in the same way as the regular Free Transform. It's kind of trivializing the way I described it, but it's kind of a brief introduction. And this is kind of a classical references. And now the solid-free transform will diagonalize the operator on the continuous spectrum exactly like the regular transform will do. There's some objects that are relevant that are called wave operators. So these are the limits if you take the free flow or pull back that and then take the distorted flow. And they're related to the distorted free transform. So for example, W plus, you can write it in terms of the regular free transform, which would f. regular free transform chocolate f hat and the nf tilde here and they will conjugate unitarily the schooling growth hv and h0 when v0 and if you have suitable regular ideal decay plus genericity of the potential this will also be bounded on uh on also spaces basically if the potential is not generic this is not true for a range of p but that's not i won't get into that much so genericity That much. So, genericity here means absence of a zero energy resonance. And in particular, so there's no solution that it's in L2, so such that x to the minus one half with a little bit more of phi is in L2 to the equation h of phi is zero. Okay, so the zero energy has no kind of think of like a nice bounded solution, let's say. Or well, not exactly bounded, but okay, this condition. And now these are some references for wave operators and their boundaries. So, this is an important object. What we use is mostly just that they're bounded on a certain range of software species. But this is also like a very classical object, very much studied in the structure. For example, recent works of Bishan Schlag. Shannon's slug. Now, the point is that if you have a generic potential using these wave operators, you can go from the flat flow, the one without the potential, to the one with the potential. And for example, the linear level works very well to give you decay estimates. So the same decay estimates you have without the potential, you also have with the potential. Just by using the bundles of vibrations, for example, you could do that. So this is the L infinity L1, all the one L infinity, and this is. Or the one in infinity, and this is another one you can prove, for example, that's similar to the one you will get with the regular transform, no potential. And now, for the linear analysis, it's always convenient to like base bounds on L2 norms. And so, what we'll try to control, and that's why I wrote this estimate, is we'll try to control, say, one derivative, for example, of the Friedrans form, which kind of how you can think of putting a weight on the physical space side. All right, so let's approach this equation. So, this quadratic equation: L is the half-Klein-Gordon operator, could be something else for this discussion, doesn't really matter. So, what we do is, first of all, we want to write this equation in Fourier space. So, we take the Fourier transform after filtering out the linear flow, we write it out, and what we get, we get an integral in frequency space of the profiles, some oscillating phase. Files, some oscillating phase that accounts for the oscillation of each of these two, and here this mu, which we call non-linear spectral distribution. So this is just the integral over x of two generalized eigenfunctions. So if there was no potential, generalized eigenfunctions would be exponentials. This will be a delta. You will recover the convolution formula for the Fourier transform of the nonlinearity. So this is what I say here. So this would be very familiar. Say here. So, this would be very familiar if you had no potential. This will just be a convolution, which is what you get by transforming that. Now, if you don't have, so if your potential is not zero, then you will not have this property of conservation of momentum of the frequencies. And the same formula after I integrate, what you want to do is you want to try to understand this formula. So, what this mu. understand this formula so what this mu is and how can you actually control this and your goal is to try to get some bounds proper you know functional frameworks for this time and the solid frequency integral of course you'd like to exploit oscillations but of course you'll have several issues because you need to know what mu is if mu is singular then that will prevent you from using and exploiting the oscillations of course your f also will not be necessarily regular Of course, your F also will not be necessarily regular because it's your non-linear solution. So you have to see what happens there. Now, what we'll do is simple observation. So your delta, for example, is regular in the L minus M direction, which means you can integrate by parts in that direction. But this will really be just a normal integration by parts one would do for the convolution. Now, for the mu, it turns out that it will not be regular in any direction, specific direction, but we will decompose it into many simple parts. We will decompose it into many simple parts. Now, each part will have some direction in which it's regular, and then we hope that this will be enough somehow to try to get suitable bounds on this expression. I will show this a little more in detail later. And I think this is, you know, kind of understanding this and the need to extract oscillations, right, for low powers or low dimensions. It's one reason why, like, models like these ones. Models like these ones in 3D, right, were not kind of understood so far. I think they're quite natural, maybe even too simple for the kind of applications we would like to have. But even these simple models were not understood so far, let alone bound states or not. So this is something that we're doing. And maybe, as I mentioned before, in dimension one, the structure of mu is a little simpler. It's a little simpler. So one needs to work quite a bit more in dimension three. And two, we haven't carried it out. But also, that will require some work. Maybe let me mention this result with software just briefly. How much more time do we have? Sorry, Alex, Niro. 10. Okay. All right, so let's just do this briefly and then go to the last part of the proof where we analyze the measure, the spectral distribution mu and see what can be done there. And see what can be done there. So this is the first result we did with the Avi sofer. And so we looked at as really the first basic model, kind of the first non-trivial case where you do need to look at localized norms for your solution, which means on the Fourier side, you need to look at regularity of the mu. So you can't use linear theory for this quadrature. Use linear theory for this quadratic Schrodinger, and then you need to develop this machinery that has to do with the Fourier transform. So here we look at the simplest case. So regular decaying engineering V, nice initial data, no bound states, and then we could prove that small solutions exist globally and decay at a rate that it's integrable. Now the point of this model, why it's non-trivial, is because even if you don't have a V, this is really a quadratic equation. This is really a quadratic equation with some coherent interactions at frequency zero. Or, in other words, you could also say that this model is at the stress exponent. Strutz exponent is kind of what separates where you can use the linear theory and when not. So, above the stress exponent, you can do it. For this one, you cannot. And so you have to do non-linear theory. And there's lots of related works on NLS, but let me maybe just skip this for now. I'd be happy if there's questions to come back to this. If there's questions to come back to this, so this was kind of a first attempt. So now we're looking at something more complicated because, okay, we also have the bound state. But let me discuss how one approaches this problem. So look at the generalized digital functions psi and expand. So we take out the plane wave, and then we have a first scattered wave that b is like one over x at infinity. And so these ones I need to plug in. So I have three copies of these at different frequencies. I will have to plug them in. Frequency, I will have to plug them in the mu. So, first, you can do like more expansions like this of the psi one here. And the first one, so we look like the first order term looks like something like this, like this G0. So, what you need to do is you need to look at, when you look at mu, you will need to look at, for example, here, two plane waves at frequency k and l, and then one of these more complicated scattered waves, if you want. Scattered waves, if you want, of dk1 over x times this expression g0 and the radial wave here. So this will be like the first thing you have to do to study the mu. So look at the leading order will be a delta when everything is a pane wave, and this is the first perturbation. And what is that? So you can do stationary phase argument on the sphere to find out what this kind of phase. To find out what these kind of expressions look like. And the way they look like, a leading order, will be something like the principal value of one over P minus Q, where P and Q are the frequencies of the waves. So here I limited one, so the P was K minus L. And I think one way to see this is that this will, it's a manifestation of the fact that. A manifestation of the fact that the potential causes uncertainty in the way that the frequencies interact, right? So imagine you have, like, okay, one plane wave comes in, you know exactly how it behaves. It's very well determined. And then you have another wave coming here, but this one interacts with the potential. So once it does, you kind of don't know where it's coming out, right? So there's some kind of uncertainty that will change the frequency. Uncertainty that will change the frequency, and so it could come out in any other direction. So, in the end, you shouldn't be able to place very well the interaction of these waves depending on their frequency or on their velocity, if you wish, but just depending on the speed. So, on the absolute value of the frequency, not exactly on the location. So, you have to pay a price of this uncertainty. And the analysis. And at the analysis level, because this comes in as a bilinear multiplier for your interactions, you need to prove binomial bounds for this kind of kernels. All sorts of combinations of frequencies. And you see that if I do these expansions, when I look at plane waves and then perturbations, I get all sorts of combinations. Because depending on which one is the plane wave, if I have one or two, I could get something like principal value of L minus K more than L minus M. So this one has certain. Than n minus m. So this one has a certain set of singularities, but I could get different frequencies. And then as you go higher in the expansion, they could also have different structure, like this one. Right? So each of these, so there's no common smooth direction, but each of them at least has a direction where it's smooth. And you try to exploit that. So now going back to Kleingorden, and then I can finish. So I go back to Kleingorden. I take this machinery, try to put it there, and see if it can work. So if I look And see if it can work. So, if I look at my formula for the nonlinear solution, it looks like this. I have my two profiles, and then here I only wrote the leading order term of the non-linear spectral distribution. You can see that you have a few problems. So this is singular, okay? And then, unlike the case of V equals zero, because these frequencies can be arbitrary, there's a larger set when they can vanish, and so you have no oscillations here. And so you have no oscillations here. As I mentioned already, the kernel is singular. And you can try to integrate by parts in the directions where this kernel is regular, hoping that it will be enough. Now, for Klein-Gordon, there's something even more clever that we can do, which is the following. So I write the same formula, I shifted one variable here, just to make apparent that the kernel is singular, but it will not be singular. But it will not be singular, so it's regular in the direction of this derivative. So, this is one direction which I can try to integrate by parts, because it will not see the singularity of the kernel for this piece. If I have other pieces, I will have other directions. And it turns out that if you are close to the singularity, actually, then the oscillations will resemble the oscillations of the v equals zero. And for Klein-Gordon, The V equals zero. And for Klein-Gordon, it's known that if V is equal to zero, actually, a quadratic linearity is essentially cubic one. So it can be transformed into a cubic one. So this is something that for Klein-Gordon we can use. Then depending on the problem, you might have to do different things. But for Klein-Gordon, this is something we can exploit. So if you're close to the singularity, you're actually a better equation in some sense, if you can exploit that. And away from the singularity, then you're in pretty good shape, because then you have a lot of oscillations to exploit. Solutions to exploit. Now, the point, the last point about the problem of the bound state is that you have the issues with the oscillations, you have the issues with the kernel, you also have the issues with the F itself because it was forced by something that is not very regular. So, that's also an issue. So, you can try to expand oscillations and the regularity of the amplitude. And the regularity of the amplitudes here, but that's not so regular because F had a G part, which was the one coming from the internal mode, which was very irregular in free space. So this you kind of have to treat separately. And even the other part, the good one, is a bit more regular, but not so much, considering that one is in a three-dimensional problem. So the amount of regularity is kind of more that is needed. I think that's right. So just a few final comments I'll make. So, what we can do is, and this hopefully we will put out the paper soon, is we can deal with an internal mode for quadratic language in 3D. It's kind of a simple model, but it's already quite non-trivial and I think physically relevant. And we can show that there is radiation dumping, as in the classical papers, but for this quadratic case. And we can separate the dumping dynamics in the ODE from the rest. Dumping dynamics in the ODE from the rest, which requires quite good control on the radiation, and then we can control the equadratic Langordon through this Fourier. Remember that it's a quadratic Langordan forced by something that is singular in frequency. So that's also not exactly, it's not really just a Klan-Gordon. And more in general, I think that we're hopeful for more applications because now we see that we can do some kind of robust Fourier analysis. Some kind of robust Fourier analysis when you have a large potential. So, we are hoping for more version. We already know that in one dimension there are applications and we can do quite a bit of work. And this is some references to the one-dimensional work, which I haven't discussed, but around questions about, for example, the Phi 4 and one field theories, one-dimensional field theories. For example, if you look at this problem that I just discussed, for the Klein-Gordon with a bound state, you go to one dimension, there's a very long work. A very long work of the Loren Mass Moody proving that you have solutions up to epsilon to the minus four, where epsilon is the size of the radiation, the size of the initial data. So, for example, so here in three dimensions we have infinity, okay? But to say that this is it is an important problem and it's non-trivial, and it has connections also to 1D. I guess, yeah, that's it. Thank you. Thank you, Fabio.
