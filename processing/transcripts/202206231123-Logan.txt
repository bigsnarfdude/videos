Speaking of higher modularity of elliptic curves over function curves. Rachel, thank you for the introduction and thanks also to the organizers, both those who are here and those who unfortunately are not, for organizing this wonderful meeting and giving me the opportunity to speak here. So what I'd like to talk about today is some joint work with Jared Weinstein at Boston University. So in progress here means that I have been spending, well struggling for much of this week to try to keep up with the cancer. Try to keep up with the cancers that he has been making in this project in that time. And we've also had some useful assistance from Noam Elkis and Masato Koata. So first, let me say a little bit about modularity, although in light of recent talks, so perhaps this is not really necessary. So there are for elliptic curves over Q, there are two ways to define it, and so here I've somehow made the conductors. Somehow made the conductor to be part of the definition of modularity, which of course you don't have to do. But one definition is a geometric definition, that is to say that an elliptic curve is modular. If you can get to it by mapping from a modular curve like 0n, then we not, okay, so then as I said, n over d, that's just to make sure that I'm doing this instruction in the best possible way. And then there's an analytic definition as well, which is that. Definition as well, which is that there should be a new form of the appropriate level whose L function coincides with that of the elliptic curve. And this condition on the twists is actually not necessary in this particular context, but in certain other ones it is. And so it was, so these two definitions of modularity were both studied, and they were known to be equivalent for some years, and then Wiles. For some years, and then Wiles and many other people actually proved that all elliptic curves are modular, and this has been extended in many ways since then, as for example we heard about in the last talk. So I want to say a little bit about what's going on over function fields, although I will avoid giving any kind of precise definitions of what's actually going on. So let's take x to be a smooth curve over a finite field. Over a finite field, which if you want to, you can think of as being P1, and let K be its function field, and we take an elliptic curve over the field K. We can think of that as the generic fiber of an elliptic surface over, why should I say over X here? Of course, our dimension is, well, it's E over X, but you could also make it as an elliptic surface over FQ. And we assume that it is not, that it does not have constant J invariant. constant j invariant. And okay, so we know that the l function in this case is always a holomorphic function. It's even, well, it's really a polynomial in e to the minus z to pi i z s. And we can define analytic modularity the same way that you did on the last slide, although the concept of new form in this context is rather different, I think. And likewise, we have sort of an analogy to In analogy to x0 of n, we have these things called Drinfeld modular curves, which again I will not try to define them, but we can say that an elliptic curve over a function field is geometrically modular if it is a quotient of one of these Jenfelt modular curves. And right, so actually, let me say a little bit more about this on this slide first. So, again, in this context, we can ask whether all In this context, we can ask whether all elliptic curves are modular, and I think there is some condition that there has to be a suitable place at infinity, which has also a curve reduction. But once you have that, we do in fact know that all elliptic curves over function fields are modular. And in fact, we knew this, I think, some years before we knew it for elliptic curves over Q. Okay, so what are we trying to do in this talk? So Drunfeld introduced a moduli stack of something called our legislation. Of something called Erlegashtukas of rank two, which depend on certain data here, similar to the ones that you have for drunkal modular curves. And this is something that is of dimension r over x to the r. And for r equals 1, so this is very closely related to Drainfill modular curves, and modularity then basically means that there should be a correspondence between these spaces. Between the space of one Legostukas or stack of one Legus Stukas and the elliptic curve E. Okay, so a curve is in correspondence with an elliptic curve if and only if there is a map from the one to the other. And so we're going to define higher modularity in really the same way. That is to say, there should be a correspondence between this space or stack of our lattice stokes and the rth power of the elliptic curve. The elliptic curve. So let me make clear what I mean by e to the r. So if I have an elliptic curve over a function field, you might think that e to the r means that I take the rth power of e viewed as a curve over the base. That is to say, I look at something of dimension r over p1 or whatever the base happens to be. That is not what I mean. What I mean is that each, you know, I mean the product over the finite field Fq. Over the finite field Fq. So that is to say, you know, if you want to think about it in terms of equations, each copy of E has its own variable for the base. And so that means that E to the R is actually a 2R dimensional thing over the base finite field rather than R plus 1 dimensional thing, which is rather important if I want it to be in correspondence with something of dimension R over X to the R. Okay, so yeah, as I said. So, yeah, as I said, we say that E is R-modular if there is a non-trivial correspondence between this suitable moduli stack of Stuke's, which I will say a little bit about in the next few slides. And so, in other words, there should be some variety which maps with finite degree to both of these things and compatibly with the maps to x to the r. And I will just say, without attempting to justify it, that this would follow from Tate's conjecture. Okay, Tate made lots of conjectures. Made lots of conjectures. The one that I mean is that when you see the same compatible system of LR representations in the atological cosmology, that this fact always comes from a correspondence. Okay, so let me say a little bit about the motivation. Let me also say that since I'm talking about modularity, one might be wondering, can this help us apply the modular method in new situations? Well, if we could prove this modularity, this higher modularity conjecture. This higher modularity conjecture. And as far as I know, the answer is no. One reason for this is just that you don't usually use the modular method for function fields. I mean, in principle, as far as I can see, all the steps should still work, but in practice, there are usually easier things that you can do. So I don't actually know that this would have any applications to diagnose in questions over function fields. It would be nice if it did, but I don't know. So the actual motivation of this project. Motivation of this project was my co-author's study of the paper by Yuhen Chan, where they do something which is analogous to Gross-Saguer for the Rth derivative of the L-series of an elliptic curve at 1 that has rank R. So I don't actually understand this paper. People who do tell me that it's really amazing. But in any case, it is. But in any case, it is not actually necessary to understand these things to work on this project, and I hope that it is not necessary to understand something slot. Right, so let me state our main theorem here, that we start with a tame rational elliptic vibration with n zero. So rational just means that the total space is rational as a surface. Tame is some special condition at the Some special condition at the singular fibers with additive type, which becomes automatic if the prime and characteristic of the base field is not 2 or 3. And rank 0 by rank I mean the geometric rank, that is to say over FQ bar, not just over FQ. And that can be translated by the Geodet Hate formula into a condition about the reducible files. Okay, so the condition, so the theorem says that if the elliptic curve E is unstable, Elliptic curve E is unstable, that is to say, if there is a fiber with additive reduction in addition to these other conditions, then E is too modular. And in some cases where E is semi-stable and the elliptic curve, sorry, the base field is very, very small, E is again too modular. And we certainly expect that in case two, this hypothesis should not be necessary. And I've said in some cases, there are some other. Said, in some cases, there are some other cases that we could prove that we haven't done yet. So far, in this context, each time that we want to prove one of these things, you actually have to prove a theorem. But we are hopeful, as I said, that it should be possible to remove this hypothesis on Q, and then you won't have to do that anymore. So maybe it was sort of necessary for us to work through these examples to see what was going on, but I'm hoping that it's not actually essential. Okay, so let's. Okay, so let me try to sketch what we'll be doing for the rest of this talk. So, okay, so first of all, I'm only going to work with elliptic surfaces over P1, not over other curves. And as indicated in the main theorem on the previous slide, I'm really only going to be working with elliptic curves whose elliptic surfaces with geometric rank zero. So the first thing that I want to do is to say something about. Say something about the construction of these Stuka moduli spaces, maybe not to say what a Stuka is or what a moduli space of them is, but just to describe the ones that we're using concretely in terms of conditions on two by two matrices of polynomials. And second, I want to say a little bit about the geometry of these spaces, although I think that this largely got cut out of the final version of the slides. And then I want to indicate how we relate these things to. To indicate how we relate these things to b squared, which was the definition of two modularity on the previous slide. And finally, I want to describe one example of three modularity if there is time. Okay, so first of all, what is HTUCA? I'm not going to tell you, but it is roughly, it is a map of vector bundles on a scheme that has. Scheme that has certain special properties at certain points of the base. The fiber at a point, of course, is a vector space. And maps of vector spaces are something that we do actually understand somehow. Okay, so first of all, first simplification, vector bundles on general schemes are impossible to understand, or at least impossible to classify. The easy way out of this problem is to take the base to be py. Problem is to take the base to be P1. That's why I do it. So on P1, every vector bundle is just a sum of line bundles, and every line bundle is just O of n for sum n. So that's one problem solving. Maps of vector bundles on general schemes, I also don't really know how to think about. Maps of line bundles are easy to think about. If I have a map from O of D to O of D prime, that is just multiplication by a section of O of D prime minus D. O of d prime minus d. And in particular, you know, if I'm working on p1, well, the map from O of m to O of n is a section of O of n minus m, which is a homogeneous polynomial of degree n minus m in two variables, or if you prefer, a non-homogeneous polynomial in one variable of degree at most n minus m. Okay, so that's a good start. Now, what are these okay, so now this is not really necessary. Not really necessary, but in this talk I'm only going to be considering maps from O plus O to O of 1 plus O of 1. I thought that I would need O of 2 plus O of 2 maybe, but actually I probably don't. So then a map with vector bundles from O plus O to O of 1 plus O of 1 is just a 2 by 2 matrix of polynomials O to P1. Okay, that's something completely concrete that we cannot think about. So if we specialize at a point of If we specialize at a point of P1, we get a 2x2 matrix over the base 50 moment. Now, here are some properties that such a thing can have. So, a 2x2 matrix, we're all used to the idea that a matrix is the same thing as a map of vector spaces. So I've sort of casually changed matrix to map. So such a thing can have a kernel, can have a specified kernel, it can take some vector v to the subspace that is spanned by v. And, well, since we're working over a finite field, we have another thing to work with. A finite field, we have another thing to work with, namely Frobenius. So, a nice condition here is that we can take v to the subspace that is spanned by Frobenius applied to V. And if we impose these conditions at various points, we get some moduli space of maps of vector bundles. So my moduli space is going to parameterize maps that have these properties when I specialize them at some various points. And this moduli space we can study. Space so you can study either concretely or abstractly. So, what do you mean by that? So, those of you who have worked with moduli spaces, so for example, my dissertation was on the moduli space of curves with marked points, such moduli spaces, the way that you study them is by thinking in terms of the functor that they represent. So, rather than trying to think about a curve on mgf bar, for example, you think of a family of curves with nc. Curves with n sections. So that's the abstract point of view where you think of the quantulated space in terms of the functions that it represents. Now, you do not want to think about writing down equations for mg and bar. However, for this kind of moduli space, everything is quite concrete, and you can actually write down equations and learn something by working with your high-magnet, or whatever your favorite computer algebra system happens to be. So that's what I mean by it can be studied either part of your abstract. Eater market the obstruction. Okay, so let's talk a little bit about the semi-stable vibrations. So if you have a semi-stable rational elliptic surface with ang zero, then by shear rotate again, it should have four bad fibers. So the bad fibers look like cycles of rational curves, where one cycle just means a single rational curve with a node. And up to isogeny, there are four possibilities. And up to isogeny, there are four possibilities. So you have to choose your types of bad fiber. So you have four bad fibers which have A, B, C, and D components. So A plus B plus C plus D is 12. The product has to be square because, again, shear dictate. We run a rational surface. So if it becards lattice, it's discrete at the point. And there are actually six solutions to these two equations, up to permutations of BD, C, and D. But there are two pairs that give you exogenous elliptic surfaces. Isogenous elliptic surfaces, and so we sweep such striking distinctions out of the rug. So I'm going to assume for now that the valid fibers are at 0, 1 minus 1 infinity. This is certainly not essential, but I'm going to define one particular Stuka-moduli space related to that condition. So I should say, by the way, that just as in the classical case, where you have not only the modular curves x, 0, of n, Modular curves x0 of n, but also Chi-Wura curves coming from unit groups in quaternion algebras. Likewise, and you can often see the same elliptic curve as being a quotient of different Schimura curves. In the same way, there is certainly no expectation. In fact, it is absolutely not true that you could only see the same elliptic surface as a quotient of as related to one of these truckomoduli spaces. Related to one of these tuber moduli spaces. But this one is quite simple to construct, so I thought that I would go with it. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at the 2 by 2 matrices of polynomials of 2a equals 1. And I'm going to work over this field FQ in two variables. Okay, so here are the conditions that I impose. So at 1 and minus 1, I say that it takes the vector i column 1 into the space spanned by i column 1. Into the space spanned by our column. At the variables t1 and t2, I require that the matrix should be singular, so it should have a curve. And m0, I want to be electrangular, so it takes the vector 1, 0 to 1, 0, or some multiple of 1, 0. And I choose a w such that at infinity, in other words, when I take the leading coefficients, if you want to be an inhomogeneous version of this, it takes w1 to w to q1. So this is that from. To WQ1. So this is that Frobenius condition that I mentioned on a previous slide. Okay, so the first five of these conditions, so the 1 minus 1, T1, T2, and 0, are one condition each. The last condition, well, there are always some number of such w, so that's a cover. A more convenient way to think about it is not like that, but rather to think of three variables, u, v, and w. So I said that mt1. So I said that m t1 and t2 were singular, so that's so generically they're kernels that are one-dimensional. So take those kernels to be generated by u1 and v1. And if you then ignore the condition at infinity, that there is generically a unique matrix that does that up to the given, so it is a codimension one condition in u v and w for such a matrix to exist at all if I specify u v and w. And it's not hard to see that when it does exist, it is generically That when it does exist, it is generically. And so, this gives me one condition in three variables: that's a surface in A3. It turns out that the most sensible way to compactify it, or at least the most sensible that I know of, is into P1 cubed. And when I do that, it has tri-degree 2,2,2, plus 1. And that is nice because it gives me a genus 1 vibration, since a curve of type 2, 2, degree 2, 2 in P1 cross P1 is a genus 1. So projection to Is a genus one. So projection to the last coordinate gives me a fun vibration. And what you would expect is that this is an elliptic surface over P1 with H20 equals Q. Okay, so how do we break this up? So first of all, there's negation, which acts as minus one on H20. On h20, and that's roughly the same thing as saying that if I take the quotient y negation for the vibration, I now have a family of elliptic curves mod plus or minus 1, which means rational curves over p1. So that's a rational surface, and rational surfaces have h20 equals 0. And there are also Atkin-Laner involutions, which again I'm not going to define, but they are quite analogous to those that you have for X0N. And there are basically two independent ones. Two independent ones, and so I get a group which is isomorphic to Z12Z2. Okay, so I don't want to wind up by negation because I lose all of the useful information, but there are four potentially useful subgroups of order, four potentially useful, meaning not containing minus one. And if I mod out by these, I get, well, okay, so I get some quotient surfaces. You can read it, but in each case, the H20 is roughly Q over 4. Okay, so let us look more closely at the case of q equals 3. So this is sort of where we started off. So, regardless of what fields we're working over, finite or infinite, there's always this Legandre family, y squared equals xx minus 1, x minus lambda squared. It's perhaps more familiar with just lambda rather than lambda squared, but I've written it this way because this way it's semi-stable. So this one has I4 fibers, so again a loop of four. So, again, a loop of four rational curves at 0 and infinity, and it has I2 fibers at plus or minus 1. Okay, so what other elliptic surfaces could we find with the same conductor? Well, part of the magic of characteristic 3 is that 1 plus 1 equals minus 1. So, if I translate my lambda goes to lambda plus or minus 1, I get two other surfaces with the same productor, and they are actually not isogenous to this one. So, what we would expect. To this one. So, what we would expect is that the surface that I described on the last slide should be in correspondence with the squares of the elliptic curves, but really it's easier for me to think about the Commerce surface because if I like D3 surfaces, I know how to do various things with them. So that's what I think about all the time. So what we would expect is that the surface that I had before is in correspondence with these Kumar surfaces. Now, you could also say that I can make an elliptic curve. That I can make an elliptic curve with the same conductor that has I2 fibers at 0 and infinity and I4 fibers at plus or minus 1, that is actually related to this one at the top of the screen by a two isogeny. And just as with in the classical situation, you know, if I have two isogenous selected curves over Q, then I don't see them sort of twice as a quotient of the same X0 of n. I only see one of them. So the same, so we would expect the same thing to happen here. Now, this should be all of the surfaces that I find because we have. All of the surfaces that I find because we only had h20 equals 3, and now I've shown you three elliptic curves. So let's look at those quotients, which we'll call k0, k1, and k minus 1. Those are actually not k3 surfaces, because, well, it turns out that if you look at the vibration that comes from the one on the surface that we had before, there are some fibers that are multiple, that are non-induced. So if you're familiar with Enrique's surfaces, With Enrique's surfaces, this situation is quite similar to the one that you have there. So, on an Enrique surface, you have a genus 1 vibration that has some fibers that are not reduced. And so, even though the Hodge diamond of an Enrique surface looks like the Hodge diamond of a rational surface, Enrique's surfaces are not rational. And the same thing is going on here. You can take the Jacobian of the vibration, and that does get you a KT surface. And, okay, you can check that when you specialize to you, You can check that when you specialize t1 and t2 to elements of finite fields of characteristic 3, that you get the same number of points, y3 to the n, and then you at least have a guess as to which quotient is which. That doesn't prove it, of course, because, well, but you know, on the other hand, if you have a map of, a finite degree map of K3 surfaces over a finite field, then the source and the target have the same number of points model q. And so that means that we don't know that the two points are going to be. So that means that we don't know that the two K3 surfaces are isomorphic, but it is at least a positive sign. You can show that they're not isomorphic by checking the Picard lattices and seeing that they're not the same. But it turns out that the Picard lattices when you tensor with Q are actually the same. And in this context, maybe not in general, but that does actually imply that if you extend the base field, that there'll be an actual map. Right, so I said that we were trying to find a correspondence. I said that we were trying to find a correspondence, and we did actually manage to do so in this case. So we found some, you know, took some elliptic vibrations, and when you have an elliptic vibration with torsion, you can find a map by taking out by some of the torsion. And we were able to get from one of these, from one surface to the other by doing this repeating. So that proves that these elliptic curves, the Legendre family, and its transition. The Legendre family and it translates by lambda plus lambda plus or minus one, are actually two modular over F3. And yeah, so we found some general procedures for relating K3 surfaces to Kumar surfaces of products of two elite curves, but I had no sense whatsoever of how to control fields of definition of the maps. So this only really works over an algebraic enclosed field, which I found not really satisfactory. Really satisfactory. Okay, so let me quickly digress to a few general remarks about finding isogenies of K3 surfaces. So for me, an isogeny means that I have some maps. So I have some sequence of K3 surfaces, and between any two of them, I have a map going in one direction or the other. So I don't know that I can just find maps always going in the same direction, but this is enough to match up the point. Enough to match up the point counts, and it certainly implies that there is a correspondence, and it sounds like we introduced before. And correspondences are what you're really interested in. But the problem is, I don't know how to construct any correspondences of K3 surfaces that don't come up in this way. So, you know, I'm really a computational person, so this is what I work with. And yeah, so over a finite field, this implies that up to the cyclotomic factors, the two kg surface. Factors, the two KT surfaces have the same delta function, so it does actually say something rather strong. You know, you can't expect just any pair of KT surfaces to be as such as. Now, one way to look at the problem of finding an isogeny is you say, well, okay, have a K3 surface. If it has large rank, which is what I'm usually interested in, certainly in this talk, then it will have usually lots and lots of rigid. It will have usually lots and lots of relative vibrations, but many of those will have torsion. So I will have many directions that I can go to find a new K3 surface. And, well, okay, if I have two K3 surfaces and they both admit a map to K3 surface with the same Picardy lattice, such as isometry, then we're not done. I mean, there's still some issues to consider about, first of all, the Galois action on the Picard lattice because we want to care about the field of definition. And second, actually, having the same point in the modulator. And second, actually, having the same point in the modulate space, which is not always the case. But we've made some progress. Now, one thing that occurred to me is that this might be a chance to apply the techniques that Avi was describing yesterday. We have, again, we sort of have two things, this is maybe slightly different, but we have sort of a graph of K3 surfaces and an edge in the context that he was describing would be one that joins two that are related by an isotope. Two that are related by misogyny. And how do we walk from one point to another in this graph? And we can't just use Hexter's algorithm because the graph is infinite and we don't really know which way to go. And also some of these isogenies are a bit painful to compute, especially if you allow yourself to extend the number of the field of definition. Okay, so there is a systematic approach in this context, which is we try at every step to reduce the discriminant of Reduce the discriminant of the Picardy lattice of the K surface and also to enlarge the part of the Picard group that is defined over the field that we're. So this is a reasonably systematic procedure, and over C you can always make this work. But over a finite field or a number of fields, you may not be, but at least it gets a place to start. Okay, so let me say something about what happens with q equals 5 and 7. So we have the Lejantra family. We cannot translate lambda to lambda plus 1 because 1 plus 1 is not equal to minus 1. There's also a family with bad fibers at I2, I3, I1 of the types I1, I2, I3, I6. So over Q, the bad fibers of this are at, I think, 0, 4, minus 1 half from infinity. That is not equivalent to 0, 1 minus 1 from infinity over Q, but it is over F5. So we get that family. 5. So we get that family, and then we can actually get another one by changing t to minus t. And the whole thing works very similarly. So we had three quotients with h20 equals 1, and in all three cases, we can relate them to the Coumer surfaces of E cross E. Then there's also a factor with H20 equals 2, and that one, so just as with modularity of elliptic curves, when you try to parametrize elliptic curves, you also get curves, you also get curves. Also, get curves, you also get abelian varieties of GL2 type, and the same sort of thing seems to happen here. The remaining factor appears to be connected to a curve of genus 2 with no multiplication by z adjoint 1 plus root of 17 over 2. Why is that field identical? And for q equals 7, we can try to do the same thing. We get the Legendre family again. And then we get three quotients with H20 equals 2. So two of them, again, have to do with some curve of genus 2. Again, they have to do with some curved genes too, and that's all I have to say about them. The third one appears to have to do with this I1, I2, I3, I6 family, and its base change again. But I don't know how to prove this. We have this elliptic surface with H20 equals 2, and it appears to be, by calculating L functions, it appears to be in correspondence with these two K3 surfaces, but that they don't know what to do. So this, in fact, is a very interesting general. So, this in fact is a very interesting general question, in my opinion. If you have a surface with h20 equals 2, and it appears that the L function factors into L functions coming from two elliptic curves, two K3B surfaces, can you actually find those two K3B surfaces? And even if you're given one of these maps, finding the other one doesn't seem to be easy. There are some examples of this in the literature, and I have a few more. And I have a few more. But you should think of this, I think, as analogous to the question: if you have a curve of genus 2 and you think that it maps to two elliptic curves, how do you find them? Or how do you describe families of curves of genus 2 that map to two elliptic curves? So this is, like everything else in number theory, this goes back in special cases to Gauss. It is certainly, I think it's fair to say, completely worked out for degree 2 and 3 maps. And beyond, you know, And beyond, certainly for a large degree, I think there are still some mysteries here. But anyway, this seems to me to be a very hard to interest and very interesting problem in general of decomposing the surfaces into two K3 surfaces. Okay, so I should say that, as I said, 0, 1, minus 1, infinity are not really special. You can define this Jukomoduloid space for other sets of four points, although for q equals 3 and 5, it makes no difference. equals 3 and 5, it makes no difference. But for example, for q equals 7, we should find something else for 1, 2, 4, and infinity. So for q equals 7, we expect an elliptic curve. Oh yes, right. So that's the elliptic curve that has four I3 fibers. So we haven't quite worked this out, but I am sure that it will be possible to show that that one is too modular over F7 from this quotient. And then there are also surfaces where the graph fiber. Then there are also surfaces where the graph fibers are not above rational points. These are harder, you don't have as many Attic and laner involutions that are rational over the ground field. So instead of saying Q is less than or equal to 7, you have to say something like Q is less than or equal to 3. But if you're willing to make that kind of concession, you can actually work out some examples as well. Okay. So, okay, so I want to talk about something that we have used to prove some of these things. Something which we have used to prove some of these things, especially in the unstable case which I haven't dealt with yet, which we call the magic phase change. Okay, so I fixed an elliptic surface E over P1 as before. So now if I take a double cover of this, well, above each of the bad fibers, above each of the locations of the bad fibers in P1, there are two points. So each bad fiber that we had before appears twice. That means that the generic re-card ranks in P18. Generically hard range in P18, and these things are supposed to be isogenous to Kumar surfaces of products of two elliptic curves. And we want to have some connection between this elliptic surface that we started with and these two elliptic curves. Okay, so in particular, what I would like is to choose my double cover so that the Kumar surface that we are isogenous to is the Kumar surface of E with the variable T1 cross E. With a variable t1 cross e with the variable t2. And okay, so that right, so that is something that, so that is what we call a magic base change. Now, I have a two-parameter family of ways to choose the base points, and I have a two-parameter family of commerce of e plus e prime. So you would expect that a magic base change would exist. And in fact, this is the case. We do actually have a way to construct these changes. It's not quite proved in second. It's not quite proved in some cases. That's to say, having to prove that the Kumar surface looks indistinguishable when you reduce it by a bunch of, when you reduce it to a finite field, to lots of different finite fields in lots of different ways. So I haven't actually checked that it's the same K2B surface, but it is. So we have a way to construct them, which I'll state only for semi-stable vibrations. So let's say that we are looking at families. We are looking at a family where the singular fibers are at p1, p2, p3, and infinity. And they don't actually all have to be rational, but never mind. So you write down this nice 2x2 matrix here. And we would like this to be singular, this matrix to be singular when we substitute capital T equals T1, T2, or T3. So this gives some conditions on A, B, and D. We can symmetric in A and D, so we can solve for A, D and A plus D. D and A plus B, that gives us a quadratic polynomial with coefficients of T1, T2, and T3, whose roots are A and D. And if you look at this equation, this condition, there is nothing about this that distinguishes T1, T2, and T3. So rather surprisingly, perhaps, this is symmetric in T1, T2, and T3. Whereas if you look at this definition that I gave before, well, okay, sure, it's symmetric in T1 and T2, but why on earth would it be symmetric in T2? But why on earth would it be symmetric in T1, T2, and T3? Okay, so again, we conjectured that there is a correspondence between the Stokam modulo space, as we had before, and the fiber product of this magic base change with a Drinfel modular curve. So if we could prove this, then we would have two modularity for all of these rational elliptic vibrations of Ordellway rank zero. So digressing just a little bit, I think. So, digressing just a little bit again, let me say that if we had more delay rank one, then we would have one vector family of such elliptic surfaces for each type, and it would be a codimension one condition to have the magic base change. But, and no, this is true, and there are some cases where this magic base change would actually be rational, but as far as I can see, it doesn't actually help within two modularity in situations. So, it operates. Okay, so the unstable. Okay, so the unstable case is actually easier. One reason is that you can sort of do things once and for all. You know, there's no worry about where the bad fibers are because PGL2 is three transitive. And because the only, actually, sorry, I think this statement here is not correct. Yeah, sorry, this statement is not at all correct. So let's ignore it. The drain-filled modular curve whose conductor is just three points really is rational, but that's not the one we have. You know, we have to have more. We have to have more level structure at the place of find state location. So please ignore the middle paradigm of this one. But in any case, it turns out that we get not just a correspondence, but a birational equivalence, and that is how we can prove two modularity for the unstable case. Okay, so it's now 12 o'clock, but I started late, so I think I still have about three or four minutes. So let me say a little bit about one example of three modularity. Example of three modularity, which would be the Legendre family, since that was the easiest to go with for two modularity. So the analog of the double cover of P1 cubed, in this case the magic phase change, is a family of Luktin curves. And so using this family, we construct a sort of candidate threefold, which is related to the Hookomoduli space. And it is supposed to be related to the analog of the Kumar surface of U1 cross E2, which is E1 cross E2. Which is E1 plus E2 plus E3 mod the client 4 group, which acts by negation on an even number of factors. So I can negate, I can, so I have the group acting by x, y, z goes to minus x minus yz, x minus yz, or x minus y, minus z. Okay, so t prime, this analog of Kumar, I think of as being defined by an equation like this, y squared equals. like this, y squared equals xi z i product of x i minus di z i, excuse me. And this has a K3 surface vibration given by Y, X1, X2, 3, Z1, Z2, Z3. So this is an analog of a familiar model of the Commerce surface of the Cross E-1. Now, on the other side, you can make this the viration equivalent with a quantity P4 containing nine planes, and when you project away from one of those. And when you project away from one of those nine planes, you get a vibration in K surfaces. And so we found when we chose one of these nine families and looked at a bunch of specializations, we got the same point counts. So we guessed, well, okay, maybe these general fibers of these two fibrations are actually isogenous to each other. And sure enough, they are, so T and T prime are birationally equivalent. And that says that the Lagani family is 3 modular over Fq. V module over Fq. And I don't really know why this worked because T and T prime both have just immense numbers of K3 vibrations and somehow I happened to hit the same needle in two different haystacks that allowed me to see that they're actually birationally equivalent to each other. And even if, and this, in fact, not only did we do this once, but we did it twice. This is actually the second proof. Actually, the second proof that we found that this one was three modular, but this one was more symmetrical. And I tried to do this for some of these other families that I described previously, for which we could handle two modularity, and I just brought nowhere whatsoever. And for rank greater than zero, well, let's figure out two modularity first. But anyway, you know, three modularity is completely mysterious, except in this one example. And four modularity, even in this example, I couldn't seem to figure it out. So, there remain lots of mysteries, which had anyway both of my time and my slides have been exhausted, so I was not wonderful. Let's see, any questions? So, now you have some cases of high geometric modularity for these elliptic surfaces. I was wondering These elliptic surfaces. I was wondering if there is some consequence for, I don't know, for instance, looking at higher Heigner cycles in these Stokami spaces and trying to map them through the correspondences. Yeah, it's something that we've tried to do, and I think that the conclusions were somewhat inconclusive. But yeah, it's definitely an interesting and important question, but unfortunately I don't have any results to give you about. I have this uh comment comment about the the thing at the push on the very beginning. I have a small comment about that. Can you go back there? Gotcha. I think you have to be a little more careful when you're stating the equivalents if you're if you're if you want the equivalents to hold between um To hold between for elliptic curves of the width of a fixed conductor and level, I think what can happen is that you can have an elliptic curve that's modular of level M, where M strictly divides N. And there can be some maps from X naught of N to the elliptic curve that do not factor through X naught of N. X not an N max from X not an X not an N. Yeah, but anyway, but I mean it doesn't at first it doesn't affect anything the rest of your talk Yeah, thank you for the question. I invite no meetings next one meetings  Yeah, that's pretty good. There's one underscore p coming all the way. Maybe that's my big game. I think it is like I let it all be. Why do we call it? I only have like one CTV. I was telling people who got excited about two modularity artists they wanted to understand rank two. Would you guys just work on rank zero to make things where you start, I guess? I mean, I think that was the question. I mean, I think that was the content. I think there was somehow, you know, in rank one you have a generator, or in rank two, you have like two generators. There's something like a wedge product that you can do after modularity, but it gives you a thing that you can interpret for any terms. We do do some calculations of that sort of thing. Just be careful with some easy to do. Okay, just to make sure that I was following. At some point these were, I love the, they're matrices and they have polynomials and so that's like I think the first time. Oh, that's what a schnuka is. So thank you. You said they were polynomials over FQ round brackets T1 T2. What does that mean? So the coefficients of the polynomials are elements of FQ T1 T two rational functions and then they're polynomials in another variable? Polynomials in another variable? Yeah, I think. Or they are polynomials in T1 and T2. Oh, okay. They're polynomials in another variable. Polynomials in one variable. So I can specialize in the middle. And I looked at this as a cover. So you looked at this chart. So, what you end up getting is you have these correspondences between P3 surfaces. You find over the function field intervals. You find over FQ1. Or right, or rather, the function field x squared. X is Q, and that's where that coefficient takes us. And wow, and that dislodges another confusion. Usually, when I plug Other confusion. Usually, when I'm plugging in T1, I'm imagining a rational number, and I was worried about denominators of the rational function. And that's just not. It's a polynomial and some other variable. And this is my conjecture. And then you're not worried about the degree of the coefficients of those polynomials. The degree of T1 and T2. So that will be. Yeah, you don't care about the degree of T1 and T2. They're just determined by polynomial equations in. Equations in when you're just thinking about that as being your ambient field, which you're working in. So they have to degree whatever they have. Although, you know, in practice, since it's really looking at what's going on at points like 0, 1 and D1, T2 degrees, a couple of times you said same point counts, but why are birational K3 surfaces have the same point counts? I mean, you can blow up, but same as well. Okay, so you mean the same point counts of the minimal model or something? Well, yeah, so we're going to see when I talk about the point count on K3 and sort of implicitly thinking of this mode. Alright, I mean the dwarf family and its mirror, if you take specializations, they have the same transcendental lattice, but their divisors are defined over time. Their divisors are defined over different fields. Right, so this point counts like over an algebraic extension, but not over a field FQ, even though. Well, so no, okay, but what I'm really is, it's the same point count, modules of the field. No, so that means that the rationale here or otherwise of the device is. So, how A equals B equals mod Q. Oh, wow. Okay. So, you mean like mod Q? In fact, you can make a stronger state if you have. Yeah, that's a theorem then. If you have a Yeah, that's that's a theorem and that's sort of like an identifying property. Okay, right. So think that well it's a more general statement. If you have two data surfaces that are suggesting they're then the transcendental part of the real function is yeah that's the thing I was really happy with. That's in Z. Yeah. Okay, but then who knows what's happened in the card, but then multiple of Q and the reason I thought I thought literally, you know, zeta function of x as an exponential of the point counts. Exponential of the point count. So it's a power series with coefficients in C that happens to be a rational function. I thought same point counts. That's sort of equal. That's not what I'm saying. I'm missing something. Okay, alright, great. Thanks, Adam. And then I realized, is it like specific you see or then you go like beyond uh but the issue is of course you don't know that you haven't got too many tries to warm up.
