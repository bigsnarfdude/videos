 Hans, has everybody kind of at birds wandered back into the lecture hall? It looks like they're doing it right now. So we'll give them a minute or two. I think I'm like $100. Yeah, he's like this. All right. All right, so from what I can tell, maybe people have wandered back into the seminar room. So this might be a good time to get started with our second talk. And again, let me just remind people: once this talk is over, please stick around. We'll be having the group photo for the conference. But with that said, we're very pleased to continue today with a talk by Jake Rasmussen, who will tell us about knot floor homology of knots in the solid torus. All right. So thanks very much for the invitation. Thanks very much for the invitation. Sorry, I can't actually be in Banff. Love to be there. So, yeah, I'm going to talk about knot fluoro homology for knots in the solid torus. And this is an extension of work that I'd done earlier with Liam Watson and Jonathan Hanselman. Some sense, you know, there's no new idea, just the observation that this is an interesting case that you might think about the invariant in. Okay, so maybe. Okay, so maybe let me first just talk a little bit about floor homology and three manifolds with boundary. Okay, so if I have a three-manifold with boundary, there are basically two sorts of things that I can do with that boundary. So one thing is that I can choose to put sutures on the boundary. So for example, if I have a knot complement, I can take two meridinal sutures, and then the sutured floor homology of that manifold. Of that manifold will give me the knot fluoro homology of the original knot. So, for example, if we take this trefoil knot, we get three copies of Z. In general, we get a bigraded group. Its graded Euler characteristic is the Alexander polynomial. And there are two different sets of differentials, which take us to HF hat of S3, which is Z. And those differentials correspond to the operation of ding filling along the Operation of ding filling along the meridian. Okay, so that's one sort of thing that you can do with your boundary. The other interesting thing that you can do in fluoro homology with three manifold with boundaries, you can think about the bordered floor homology due to Lipschitz, Uzhwaf, and Thurston. And so, what does this do? Well, it takes a manifold. You have to choose some extra data on the boundary, which I won't draw here. But one thing that's Here. But one thing that's actually very important to understand is that there's always a little tiny bit of the boundary that's sutured. Okay, so in the standard bordered floor homology setup, there's just a little sutured disc here on the boundary. And so what Lipschitz, Sushwoff, and Thurston tell you is that to a manifold like this, you get a type D structure, whatever that is. And what it is, is it's a And what it is, is it's a twisted chain complex over this case of a manifold with torus boundary, a relatively simple algebra. Okay, so we get an algebra that's, I take a quiver algebra on three generators, that's this, and I divide out by some quadratic relations. And since we're doing bordered floor homology, from now on, I'm always going to work with Z mod 2 coefficients in floor homology. In fluoro homology. So, what does the type D structure look like? Well, it has, it's a chain complex. So it has some objects, which you could draw by these solid and hollow dots here. And then it has some boundary maps between them, which are labeled by algebra elements and shown in this picture by arrows. So, this bordered floor homology, in the case of a manifold with torus boundary, has a nice graphical interpretation, which is this work with Liam and Jonathan that I mentioned. And so what is that? Well, it takes C F D hat and M and reinterprets it as a collection of immersed closed curves, possibly with local systems decorating them, in some covering space. Some covering space of the boundary minus that little sutured region. Okay, so for example, if our manifold is still the complement of the trefoil, we take this twisted complex here, and it turns into a curve in this covering space of the punctured torus that looks like this. And that's the invariant. Okay, so where. Okay, so where did this invariant come from? Well, almost, you know, probably more than a decade now, Aru and Lachilli and Peretz suggested that it should be possible to take a type D structure and turn it into, well, this could be on a manifold, a general boundary, turn it into an object of the Foucault category of the G-symmetric product of the boundary. The boundary minus this sutric region, okay, where now G is the genus of the boundary. Okay, and that's interesting, but maybe it's not so useful unless you have a way of understanding what the Fukaya category is. I mean, in some way, in some sense, you could think of LOT's work as telling you what the Fukaya category of that symmetric product is in a way that you can actually work with it. Okay, but in the special case when the boundary is a torus, right, objects of the Foucaia category are just supposed to be Lagrangian submanifolds. That's just curves in the torus. And you might hope that there's a more concrete way that you can think about those. And indeed, there is. So there's a structure theorem of Hayden, Konsevich, and Katsarkov that tells you that if you have a You that if you have a Riemann surface with some punctures in this case, that the objects of the relevant Fukaya category can actually be represented as direct sums of loops with local systems and chains. So maybe let me just say a word or two about what that means. So a chain in this picture here is a twisted complex that has a very nice form. Complex that has a very nice form in the sense that every vertex of the complex has two arrows coming out of it. And that's, you know, situation with a local system is a little bit more complicated than this, but not much. And the other option is that you could have a chain, and the chain is similar, but now there are two distinguished ends of the chain where there's only one narrow. Chain where there's only one arrow involved. Okay. And so one thing that I proved with Liam and Jonathan, we proved together is that if you have a closed, remanif, not closed, but a manifold with a single torus boundary component like M, then actually the type D structure that you get always correspond to loops, and those give you compact curves in this puncture. In this punctured torus or cover of it. Okay, so it's maybe good to understand a few more things about this picture just for closed manifolds first. So how can we use this? Well, we can take pairings of the invariant of our manifold with other invariants to get Fluorhomologies of closed manifolds are not fluor homologies. So, for example, if I wanted to compute the not-fluorhomology of this trefoil complement, the way I would do it in this picture is I'd pair with these vertical Lagrangians here. Notice that these are non-compact and end at the punctures, these black points. And pairing in this case just amounts to taking inner. Taking intersection points and pulling tight to make sure that we have minimal intersection. Okay, so for example, here we see three intersection points. That corresponds to the three generators in not floor homology. And you see, actually, there are these regions here correspond to the differentials that we see in knopfloor homology. We see in knot floor homology. Okay, another thing that you can do with this knot complement is you can Dane fill to get Dane surgery on the knot. And that's a similarly simple operation. So to do that, what we do is we just take the intersection with a line of slope alpha, where alpha is the Dane filling slope, not passing through the punctures. So here, for example, if I wanted to do minus. If I wanted to do minus one surgery on the trefoil, I'd take the intersection with this line of slope minus one. I'd find that there are three intersection points. That's because, well, I mean, minus one Dane surgery on the trefoil is the Briesborne sphere sigma 237. There are three generators in the floor homology of that, and they come with signs, say, plus, plus, and minus, and those signs. Plus and minus, and those signs are given just by the intersection sign between the red curve here and the black curve. Okay, similarly, if I wanted to do this Dane filling, I could think of the dual knot, the core of the solid torus in the Dane filling. And if I wanted to compute the knot floor homology of that knot, I would just pair with I would just pair with this line of slope minus one passing through the punctures. So here I would see now instead of three intersection points, I see five. Okay, and that corresponds to the knot floor homology of this knot being Z3, two different gradings, and Z again here. Here. Okay. So that's kind of. Jacob. Can I ask you a question? Why do you need to go to the cover of your Taurus? Okay. So excellent question. So you don't need to pass to a cover of the Taurus. If you just wanted to calculate these groups, I could look just in the punctured torus itself, and that would be fine. But what going And that would be fine. But what going to the cover does is it tells me the spin C gratings on the floor homology, or equivalently, the Alexander grating on the not floor homology. You see, for example, here in this picture, these arcs here came at three different heights. There's this height, that's the Alexander Great. That's the Alexander grading zero part of the knot floor homology. Then, this height here, oops, up here is an Alexander grading one, and this height here is an Alexander grading minus one. Okay, so looking at this cover gives us an easy way to think about the spin C gratings on fluoro homology. And it also has the, my opinion, the added bonus that it's a lot easier to draw these pictures in the cover usually. In the cover, usually, than it is down on the punctured torus itself, where the picture will get very busy very quickly. Is that helpful? Thank you. Thank you. Okay, that's a good question. Okay, so the thing I want to talk about here is the situation where we have a not in a solid torus. And so, in fact, it doesn't So, in fact, it doesn't have to be a knot in the solid torus. It could be a knot in any three-manifold with torus boundary, and you could say almost the same things. But having a yeah, I mean, there are lots of interesting examples of knots in the solid torus that we know about. So, this is maybe a good reason to think about this case. And there are lots of things that we can do. Okay, so what are we going to do? We have this knot in the solid torus. We could take its complement here and now it's got two torus boundary components. And what we'd like to do is we're going to suture the interior boundary components. We're going to treat that as sutured. And then on the exterior, we're going to treat the exterior boundary as bordered. Okay. Okay. And so when we do this, actually, we have a choice of what to do. There are two interesting possible options. So one option is that we could actually drill a little tunnel, let me draw that in red, between the interior boundary and the exterior boundary. The exterior boundary. And then we could let the sutured boundary run over that tunnel like this. So a neighborhood of this red core runs through here. The other option is we could say forget the tunnel and we'll just put a little disk. We'll just put a little disc of sutured boundary on the outside and then just suture the interior boundary and not have any connection between them. Okay, and these two options have slightly different properties, both of which are useful at times, so it's worth thinking about both. So, associated to the first option here, where I drilled, we'll attach an invariant which I'll call little. attach an invariant which I'll call little HFK of K. And to this invariant over here, we'll attach an invariant that I'll call big HFK hat of K. And little HFK is smaller than big HFK. That's why they're named that way. Okay, so little HFK hat will give me a non-compact Lagrangian in some cover of the punctured torus. Okay, so the Okay, so the Lagrangian here will have endpoints on the puncture. Okay, whereas big HFK will give me a compact object. There are no endpoints. We just get loops, maybe loops with local systems. Little HFK has the downside that, as it's defined, we had to choose some extra data, which was that red arc from the interior to the exterior boundary. Okay, whereas big HFK is intrinsically defined. Once I give you this complement, I choose the meridianal sutures, and then I just have this sutured manifold and its bordered floor homology, and there are no extra choices. Okay, but an advantage of little HFK is that if we glue on some other manifold where the sutured Where the sutured boundary is just a little sutured disk. So, for example, a manifold with torus boundary with a little sutured disk on it, then the dependence on this choice of arc vanishes. And that's basically because, all right, so if I imagine gluing these two things together, what happens is This disc glues onto this tube and caps it off. Okay, and then I can retract that back down to here. And the isotopy class of the arc doesn't matter because this filling no longer sees it once I've taped this end off. It's like leaving that end loose so I can just suck it back in. Okay. On the other hand, for big HFK, Hand for big HFK, if we glue a manifold like the complement of a knot to this, where we have the sutured boundary as just a little, sutured part of the boundary is just a little disk, then I get a sort of extra factor of H star of S1 in the fluoro homology that I might have been trying to compute. And why is that? Well, it's because here, if I cap this off. It's because here, if I cap this off, I get my manifold with sutured boundary, but I also get a little sutured sphere in the interior. So I've just added in a little, removed a ball from the interior of my manifold and put on a suture that looks like this. And it's just a fact about sutra. And it's just a fact about sutured fluorohomology that every time I do that operation, I pick up an extra factor of H S1. Okay, so maybe it would be good to have an example of what this invariant looks like. And so a good first example to consider is if we just take the knot that's the core of the solid torus. Taurus. Okay, so if we take that knot, little HFK is just a non-compact arc that looks like this. Actually, the covering space is the kind of universal abelian cover of the torus. So we get a lattice of puncture points in this covering space. Corresponding to that, what is big HFK? Well, big HFK is this figure eight that I've drawn in this picture. Drawn in this picture. Okay, so maybe let me talk a little bit more technically about what actually relates these two little HFK and big HFK. Well, so little HFK hat of K, a priori, what that is, is it's an element in the Fukaya category. An element in the Fukaya category of the punctured torus, where I put a single stop on the boundary. Okay, and if you don't know what a stop is, then you can ignore me for three minutes here and I'll never talk about it again. Okay. And that structure theorem of Hayden, Konsevich, and Katsarkov says that I can write every object here as loops and curves. You could also prove that using the variable. You could also prove that using the variant on the structure, the approach that Liam and Jonathan and I took, I think. Okay, and how is this related to big HFK hat? Well, there's actually a functor which goes from this Fukaya category, partially wrapped Fukaya category to itself, which is called applying the tube cutting by module. Okay, so this is. Bimodule. Okay, so this is a bimodule in bordered fluoro homology that was introduced by Lipschitz and Truman and calculated in the genus I case by Hanselman. And basically, what it amounts to doing is sewing in a T2 times I that's sutured like this. Okay. And so essentially what Lipschitz and Truman proved about this is. Lipschitz and Truman proved about this is that the image of anything in this wrap Fukaya category over here is contained in the compactly supported Fukaya category of the punctured torus. Okay, so over here, we always get compact objects. And you could think about the action of this functor as, well, on this little curve here, as it takes this little curve and moves it to this. Curve and moves it to this figure eight. It's a calculation of what this functor does. Okay. So you might very well say that maybe it's always better to work with big HFK hat, but somehow a lot more convenient to draw pictures with little HFK hat and more convenient to think about. So what we'll do to get something that's actually doesn't depend That actually doesn't depend on that arc that we chose, is we'll pass to a quotient of this Fukaya category where we'll declare two objects to be the same if their image under the tube cutting functor is the same. Okay. And in particular, one consequence that that has is that if they're equivalent, then they're pairing with any compact curve in the puncture. Curve in the punctured torus is the same. Okay, so we can safely pair with compact curves, which, for example, are the curves that we get from complements of knots and get the same answer. Okay. All right. So now I'd like to talk a little bit, actually, maybe about the sort of thing that Ko was asking. Of thing that Ko was asking, which is how should you think about these covering spaces and equivalently the spin C structures on fluoro homology in this case. Okay, and what you can say, and this is just sort of a general thing that we already knew with Liam and Jonathan, and sort of just sorting out what it says. Sorting out what it says is that I can do decompose little HFK into a direct sum over spin C structures. And the set of spin C structures is always the co-kernel of the map from H1 of the bordered boundary into H1 of the manifold. And in our particular case, where we have Case where we have a knot in the solid torus, this co-kernel is always isomorphic to Z mod n, where Z n is the homology class of the knot. Okay, and on the other hand, we're supposed to think about this invariant as living in a cover of the punctured porus. Which covering space is it? Well, let's. Space is it? Well, it's the one that corresponds to the kernel of the map that takes pi1 of the bordered boundary and maps it into h1 of n. Okay, and here, if the winding number is non-zero, then there's never any kernel, and we just get the kind of universal abelian. Of universal abelian cover of T2. Okay, so we get Z with a lattice of punctures in it. If the winding number is zero, we get something a little bit different. Then actually, we get a cylinder with a family of punctures on it. So this is the same thing that we would get, for example, if we had a manifold with a single torus boundary component. Boundary component. Put a bordered structure on it. Okay, so to really be specific and think about these invariants, the next thing we should do is we should actually sort of label this space here, which is identified with H1 of the boundary of N. So what we'll do is we'll pick the natural longitude. The natural longitude and meridians on our so if I have a non-less solid torus, there's a naturally associated link inside of S3. Okay, there's a good choice of basis for H1 of M, which is it's the meridians to the two components. To the two components of the link. And then there's a good choice of basis for H1 of boundary M, right? That's spanned by meridian and longitude. And the longitude here is always the winding number times this should be M2, not M1. So Okay. So, for example, in this situation here, where I just take this winding number two link in the solid torus, the natural basis for the covering space that our invariant lives in. Space that our invariant lives in is going to be given by, let's say, this direction is m1 and this direction is l1, which is in this case twice m2. Okay. And so then we could think about what is hfk hat of this curve. Well, it turns out that big HFK hat is just a pair of figure eights. It looks like this. Of figure eights. It looks like this. And little HFK hat is just a pair of arcs like this. And indeed, once you know that you have a pair of figure eights here, according to the definition up to equivalence that I gave, I know that these two arcs give me these figure eights under the tube cutting functor. So they are little HFK. They are a little HFK. Okay. So now I'd like to talk a little bit about some properties of these invariants and things that you can compute with them. So the first thing we should think about is the Euler characteristic. Everyone knows that the Euler characteristic of fluoro homology has something to do with the Alexander. Has something to do with the Alexander polynomial. What is it in this case? Well, I could think of little HFK hat. I could think of that as being a sort of homology class in R2 relative to those punctures at the lattice. And I could take the boundary of that homology class. Or equivalently, I could take big HFK hat and I could just. And I could just think about its homology class in the lattice with punctures. And what's that going to give me? It's going to give me the multivariable Alexander polynomial of my two-component link multiplied by a factor of one minus M2. Okay, where the fact that we get one minus M2 here is just. The fact that we get one minus m2 here is just a general fact about what adding a pair of sutures to a manifold with torus boundary does to the Euler characteristic. Okay, so for example, what does that say in the case of this link here? Well, we've got two spin C structures, S0 and S. S0 and S1, and maybe we'll color S0 like this. So here I see that this curve winds once around this puncture and once around this puncture with the opposite sign. Okay. And if I were to take the multivariable Alexander polynomial of this link, it's 1 plus M1 times M2. Multiplying by 1 minus M2 to give the Euler characteristic gives me. Gives me four terms like this, and these two purple terms correspond to these two things in the middle. Okay, whereas over here, here again, I'll get sort of a non-trivial winding number about this puncture and about this puncture, and those will correspond to these two. Terms in the Euler characteristic over here. And a good way to think about that is to imagine that we can label the columns of this picture with Alexander gratings that jump by n each time. Okay, so then all of the things in Alexander grading zero show up sort of in projection grading zero. Projection grading zero here. Things in Alexander grading minus one show up in grading minus one over here. Things in Alexander grading one show up in grading one over here. Okay, so another standard property of the floor homology that we could think about is the fact that there's a conjugation symmetry. Okay, so conjugation symmetry acts on spin C. Conjugation symmetry acts on spin C structures. In this case, we've got two spin C structures, both of which are fixed under the conjugation symmetry. But then it also acts on the picture. So here, conjugation symmetry flips as indicated by the red arrows. And we can use this invariant to compute various other things that you might be familiar with. Other things that you might be familiar with. So, for example, we can compute the Link floor homology of this knot together with the axis of this axis A. We can use it to compute the knot-floor homology. We can compute the effect of Dane twists. We can take satellites with pattern given by this K. And I'd like to just kind of illustrate how these computations work. Okay, so. Okay, so say for example, I wanted to compute the link floor homology of this link. Well, what I would do is just like before when I was computing the knot floor homology of the knot, I'd pair with the invariant corresponding to actually the T2 times I with a single suturon. With a single suturon. Okay, and what that amounts to doing is pairing with a bunch of blue Lagrangians that look like this. Okay, and when I do that, I'll see generators. Example, here I see four generators. Here I see another four generators, four intersection points. And so, for example, the intersection, intersection points in this column give me something that looks like this. The intersection points in this column. Give me generators here and here, and the intersection points in the middle give me okay, and if you look at this pattern and you're familiar with the link. The link floor homology of the 2,4-taurus knot, this is what it is. Okay, and here, if I'd been better, I would have maybe shown the signs of intersection by blue and red. Okay, so another thing that we can do is we can dame twist. Okay, and here there's, you know, I can just act by this. This diffeomorphism of the solid torus, which gives me a Dane twist on the boundary, that corresponds to taking L1 to L1 and M1 to M1 plus L1. Okay. And so what's the effect on the invariant? Well, I just apply these same translations. Same translations to my coordinate lattice here. So I dane twist here, and I get a picture that looks like this. So the invariant little HFK of this not in the solid torus is given by these two arcs. Okay. Another thing I can do is I can Dane fill. Okay. And so Dane. And so, Dane filling now corresponds to pairing with a line that doesn't pass through the punctures. Okay, so if I Dane fill on the outside to get this knot thought of as a knot in S3, that's the trefoil knot in S3. That corresponds to taking intersections like this. I see these intersections here and this intersection point here. And this intersection point here. And this exactly gives me the knot floor homology of the trefoil with three generators. Okay. So similarly, if I want to take a satellite, what I can do, that amounts to taking the knot in the solid torus and gluing it. In the solid torus, and gluing that in to the complement of the companion knot. Okay, so to compute the floor homology there, what I should do is I should pair with HF hat of that complement. So, for example, if I want to take a cable of the trefoil corresponding to using this pattern and this companion. And this companion. Sorry about that. Okay, what that would correspond to doing is taking the intersection with a curve that looks like this. Like this in both pictures. Okay. And if you look here, you'll see that there are seven intersection points. This is actually the cable of the trefoil whose not fluoro homology looks like the not-fluorhomology of T34. Okay. Okay. So I think what I'd like to do now is talk about an interesting class of knots in the solid torus. So we'll say that a knot is linear if little HFK is just a union of short line segments. So notice that the examples that I showed before were all linear. So for example, this is a short line segment. This is a This is a short line segment. This is a short line segment. This is a short line segment. But for example, this is not right. If I pull this tight, it kind of wants to bump into the puncture. Okay, notice that the property of being linear is clearly preserved by Dane twisting, for example. And so some examples. Some examples of linear knots are if, for example, this link in S3, the associated link in S3, has thin link floor homology, and the knot in S3 is an L-space knot, then that's always linear. Or if K Or if K comes from a one-one pattern. So, this is a situation studied by Wen Zhao Chen. Okay, and so I think actually there are probably some larger classes of knots that are linear. So, for example, we should hopefully be able to drop this condition that K is an L-space knot, which probably just amounts to K being the 2N torus knot. And torus not to K being alternating. Similarly, you could hope that all three strand braids are linear. On the other hand, a good example of something that's not linear can be obtained by using the cabling operations studied by Hanselman and Watson. And maybe since it's Liam saw, this is not a knot in the solid torus, but let me mention. A knot in the solid torus, but let me mention that if I take the twisted eye bundle over the Klein bottle and take the knot, which is one of the exceptional cipher fibers, okay, that gives me actually a knot that's not linear. This is an example I learned from Fanier. Okay, so a theorem is that if we have a knot If we have a knot that's as in one, so the link floor homology of the link L is alternating, and maybe K is a lens-based knot, then actually this invariant HFK of K is determined by classical invariance of the knot in S3 and L in S3, so the multivariable Alexander polynomial and the signatures. Okay, so for example. Okay, so for example, if I took this maser pattern, the Euler characteristic associated to this knot, I get, here's the multivariable Alexander polynomial. I multiply by 1 minus m2. And then out of that, I extract little hfk, which looks like this. Notice that all of the In this case, all of the little arcs are vertical except for this one. That corresponds to the fact that if I were to ding fill here, I get the unknown. So there should just be one intersection point here. And the length of this one interesting arc is determined by the signatures of this link with the two possible orientations. Orientations. So, more specifically, the sum of these two signatures determines this length. Okay. So it's an observation that goes back to the very beginning of studying the knot floor homology of satellite knots, okay, back to work of After Kari and Hedden, that for some patterns, actually you can express the The not fluoro homology of the satellite in terms of, let me say, sutured fluorhomologies of the complements of the knot with some sutures on the complement. Another way to think about that is that it's knot fluor homologies of some, you know, the dual knots and some surgeries on the knot. Okay. On the knob. Okay, so for example, the first observation of this was due to afterquari for the white hit double. Okay, and a theorem, which is really just a reinterpretation of the definition, is that if k is a linear knot, this property is true, right? That I can write the sutured fluor, sorry, I can write the not floor homology of The not fluorohomology of the satellite as a sum of sutured fluorohomologies, where the sutured fluorohomologies run over the arcs in little HFK. Okay, and that's just because pairing with one of these little arcs gives me sutured fluorohomology. Okay, so I'm almost out of time, but I'd like to talk a little bit about two other things that you can do with. Two other things that you can do with this invariant. So, one thing is you can think about differentials. So, if we just have a knot in S3, then we know that the knot floor homology, or maybe CFK hat, is filtered by the Alexander grading, and we get an associated graded, which is the NOT floor homology. Then we get differentials. Then we get differentials on the knot-floor homology coming out of that. Okay, so a similar picture is that if we have a knot inside of S1 times S2, then the bordered floor homology is again going to be filtered. This is already an observation that goes back to LOT's first paper. And the associated graded is going to give me little HFK of K. So for example, if I just So, for example, if I just take the core naught in the solid torus, what does this correspond to saying? Corresponds to saying that the sort of CFD hat of this suture manifold is just a single item potent, whereas here CFD hat of the solid torus looks like this item potent with a row one. With a rho one, two differential on it. And so geometrically, what does that correspond to doing? It corresponds to saying that we could take little hf k hat and push it off to get sort of hf hat of s1 times d2, which is just this arc here. Just this arc here. And just as there were two different ways to do this here, there are two different ways to push off. Okay, so maybe a slightly more elaborate example is if we take the closure of sigma one hat in S1 times S2, that's the example we were looking at before. Again, we've got two different ways to push off, and now what those correspond to doing. Those correspond to doing is something like this. And on the other hand, something like this. And you'll notice that here the arcs were separated by one unit. Here they're separated. If I smooth them out, they're separated by two units. That's a reflection. That's a reflection of the fact that the linking numbers are one and two here. So, do you need if you're not as sort of winding number non-zero, like is it still filtered? I mean, you know, you have this Alexander grading by Spincy evaluation or Chern-class evaluations, but like, doesn't like periodic domains somehow say that you might not have a well-defined filtration? Are you working with twisted coefficients or something? Um, yeah, okay. Um yeah, okay. So if you don't want to talk about it, maybe we can talk about it after. Okay. So for example, in this picture, you know, we can also think about how the differentials, you know, Differentials, you know, how these differentials give me differentials on the floor homology of satellites. Okay. And so, for example, here I'm low on time. So maybe I will just observe that you can draw this picture and find differentials, for example, here and here. That are giving you the differential in this cable of the trefoil. Okay, and so on the other hand, I want to finish by saying how does this relate to the work of Wen Zhao Chen, who gave a, you know, already gave a method for computing these differentials. Differentials. And so his method maybe looks slightly different in the sense that we start with a doubly pointed diagram. Okay, but again, we're considering some sort of pairing of this curve and the curve for the companion plot. Okay. And the answer is that they're related by pinching. Pinching Z and W together, okay? And cutting. So, how do I get this invariant little HFK hat out of the pictures that Benzal draws? Well, I pinch Z and W together, and then I cut along this line. And I exactly recover these curves here that I was drawing before. I was drawing before for little HFK. Okay, and so let me just finish by saying: so you could ask, does the, you know, I mean, I'm just drawing a picture here, you know, you could ask, does this work in a general setting? And I think that that's a problem that I found out recently: that Wenzhao and Jonathan Hanselman Jonathan Hanselman have, maybe not quite in these words, but have thought about this problem. And, you know, so I think, you know, I think the answer is that they can solve this problem in some sense and say that this works all the time. But maybe I shouldn't put words into their mouth. Okay. So I'm going to stop now, I think, because I'm already a little bit over time. All right, thank you. All right, thank you. Do we have any further questions for Jay? I had a question. This is Jen. If you're not in the solitaurus, it doesn't satisfy like conditions one on the earlier slide, is there a way to compute the invariant for it in a simple way? Right. Yeah. Okay. So the So, obviously, for example, a good example in which you can do this is, but which is already done is the one-one patterns that Wenzhao studied, right? So a Right, so those are typically going to give you things which don't have thin link floor homology, but satisfy this arrangement. And beyond that, yeah, I think, well, okay, so maybe I'll go to the part of my talk that I didn't actually get. Of my talk that I didn't actually get around to having time to mention. So, let me give you another interesting example that you can compute, which involves links instead of knots. Okay, so one thing we could consider is the operator of adding a well, okay, so we could consider the operator of adding an extra strand. Adding an extra strand. So I start with my non-the solid torus or link in the solid torus, and then I just toss in an extra strand. And that corresponds to an operator of the sort studied by Jonathan and Liam for the cabling operator. The cabling operator, where here this corresponds to adding in this manifold here with a not in it. Okay. And so we could try and understand what is the action of that operator on curves here. So just in the same way that Jonathan and Liam wrote down the action of the cabling operator, we could Tabling operator, we could write down the action of the add a curve operator. So, for example, here, we could start with the core and just add a parallel curve to it. And what that operation does is it does something like this. It's not that produces, we get something with three non-trivial. Three non-trivial spin C structures and an invariant that looks like this. And similarly for this operator, you know, if I start with this object and apply this operator, then I'll get two spin C structures. Then I'll get two spin C structures. And the invariant looks like this. And I've drawn the arrows wrong here. And okay, and so the kind of amusing thing is that actually just understanding the action of Understanding the action of this operator on these two objects is enough to iterate this process essentially because, for example, these things here, you know, this add a strand operator is invariant under a Dane twist that leaves the strand unmoved. And I can move, for example, this arrow back to this one by a Dane twist of that type. One by a Dane twist of that type. So I can just repeatedly apply these operators to compute the sort of link floor homology, as it were, of Tn0. So for example, if I take T30, what I'll find is I have sort of interesting spin C. Interesting spin C structures corresponding to a hexagon in this lattice here. Okay, and in most of most of those spin C structures, the invariant is kind of boring, just looks like this. Whereas in the middle spin C structure, we get an invariant that looks like this. Okay, and you know, so by repeating this, you can compute the invariant of Tn0, and then by twisting, you can compute, for example, the lean floor homology of TNN. So that's kind of maybe it's not quite an answer to your question, but that's an interesting computation that you can do in this setting. Great, thank you. Great, thanks. We probably should get on to the photo, but maybe there's time for one more quick question if somebody has one. Yep. All right, well, let's thank Jake again. And Hans, I think it's going to hand it over to you and the people at Burrs to take the picture. Yeah, this is Linda here from Burrs. Hi, if you don't mind, just stop. If you don't mind, just stop screen sharing. And everyone who would like to be part of the picture, please turn your cameras on. And I'll take a couple screenshots. All right, is everyone ready? Give me a big Give me your biggest smile. Look at the camera. One, two, three, say cheese. And another one. It's just too many of you to fit into one screen. And again, one, two, three, cheese. Excellent. We will edit this picture and add our in-person group photo and publish on websites, send them today or tomorrow. You will get an email about it. Thank you. Email about it. Thank you. Thanks. And now I guess it's time for lunch for everybody there at Burrs and everybody else. I guess we'll see you back here tomorrow.
