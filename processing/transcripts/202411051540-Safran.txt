I want to tell you about phase separation of chromatin in the nucleus, and at the end of the talk, I'm going to show you some early data on its mechanosensitivity, which is related to the topic of this conference. Now, mechanosensitivity of cells and gene expression, at least on the physics side, first peak. First, piqued our interest in about 2006 with the paper of Dennis Discher showing that stem cells cultured on substrates of different stiffnesses matured in a few days later into cells of varying cell type. And presumably on substrates of different stiffnesses, there were different forces showing that the forces exerted by the stem cells through their cytoskeleton had an influence. Had an influence on their later maturation. And with Dennis, we did some work after that, showing that indeed on the substrates of different stiffnesses, the cytoskeleton was organized with different coherency as you change the stiffness in a non-monotonic manner. And this may have an effect then on the nucleus and gene expression. Gene expression at the more molecular level. Gene expression at the more molecular level and at the genetic level and its relation to mechanics was studied by many workers, and in particular, Shiva Shankar. But our goal, as you'll see from the beginning of my talk, is to understand the nuclear scale organization of chromatin, both the active and inactive chromatin. And at the very end, as I said, I will tell you about mechanosensitivity. So we're not focusing on the very Not focusing on the very molecular scale, but on the nuclear scale organization and seeing if that has some hints as far as the mechanosensitivity and gene expression. The work I'm going to tell you about was done in collaboration with a group of Talila Valk at the Weizman Institute. Just one second, I'm going to see if I can minimize this thing here up here. Show full meeting window. Oh, here it is. Full meeting window. Oh, here it is. Just a second with Dana Lorber and Daria Pavlov. And in my group, the theory that I'm going to show you and also simulations were done by Gaurav, Omar Adami Arana, who's now in Dresden, Gaurav is now in Northeastern, and Amit Kumar, a postdoc in my group. And there are quite a few papers, and you can write to me if you want the detailed references. Okay, so there's been an eruption of interest. An eruption of interest in phase separation and biological cells in vivo and in vitro, and on the right, the movie is showing you stress granules that develop under stress, not mechanical stress, the biochemical stress of cells. And that these condensates that you see here in green of proteins, which phase separate from the nucleoplasm, are reversible. You see, when the stress is removed, they You see, when the stress is removed, they go away. And people have looked at many, many examples of protein condensates in cells. And my group actually is doing that in collaboration, the group of Danny Ella Goldfarb, Weizmann, and Tony Hyman's group in Dresden. We've been looking at protein condensates. But what I'm focused today is on chromatin condensates. And to get everybody up at the same level, I just want to make sure that. I just want to make sure that when I say chromatin, everybody knows that I'm not talking about only DNA. I'm talking about eukaryotic cells, where the DNA, which is shown here as the green string, is wound around proteins called histomes that have the opposite charge of the DNA. So the DNA winds around it because it's attracted. But there's also a linker piece shown over here of negatively charged DNA. So you have something more. So you have something more complex in the nucleus that is called chromatin. It's a long-chain polymer that organizes itself in various ways, but this polymer is a composite of both the DNA and the histones, giving you something which is only slightly negatively charged. And I said the histones are positively charged and the linked DNA is negatively charged. That means that a histone here, which is positively charged, might interact attractively. Might interact attractively with a piece of DNA all the way over here in sequence space along the chain of the DNA along its contour, but it might be close in physical space and interact attractively. And indeed, we'll see that chromatin in the nucleus acts basically in the nucleoplasm like a polymer in a poor solvent. And we'll see this experimentally. And this was developed with our collaborators and shown. With our collaborators and shown experimentally in the group of Talila Volk in live imaging of Drosophila nuclei, Drosophila muscle cells, but also other cells and some human cells as well, where they looked at these Drosophila muscle cells in live flies. So the fly was alive, it was even flexing its muscles. And these are movies of 3D and also projection images of the DNA. Images of the DNA, of the chromatin and the DNA. And the red marker for histomes. You see on the left, which is the wild type, that the chromatin is organized on the periphery, on the outside of the nucleus, close to the nuclear envelope. And then we'll see the projection. And there's this black region in between, which has the nucleolus, but also the nucleoplasm, and is chromatin-poor. So the chromatin. So the chromatin is phase separated from the nucleoplasm. On the right side is a mutant where the chromatin is no longer attracted to the periphery, to the nuclear envelope, which is shown in green over here. And the chromatin still phase separates, but phase separates more or less in the center of the nucleus. So whether in the wild type where it's attracted to the nuclear envelope or in the mutant where it's not attracted, Or in the mutant where it's not attracted to the nuclear envelope, the chromatin is not a polymer which is doing a random walk in the nucleoplasm. It is a polymer that is condensed, self-attractive, or phase-separated from the nucleoplasm. And what controls this, I will tell you very, very briefly in a conceptual manner, and the papers deal with this in more detail theoretically. Now, if chromatin were a polymer and a good solvent, Polymer in a good solvent by DNA alone without the histones, it would be larger than the nucleus. So, down here are very schematic. I just borrowed this picture, but don't the details are not meant to be chromatin in the nucleus. But here is chromatin as a sort of random polymer that occupies a large volume. However, if the chromatin is in a poor solid, that means the chromatin is attracted to itself more than it's attracted. More than it's attracted to the nucleoplasm, the pranchromatin condenses and collapses and collapses to a small volume. And that's what we were seeing in the previous live fly cells. Now, there are other workers, a group of Rosen Hansel, group of Gary Carpenmore recently that have actually looked at chromatin both in vitro models and also in vivo and have seen evidence that chromatin. Seen evidence that chromatin is self-attractive, that in the nucleoplasm or models of the nucleoplasm, the chromatin is not a like DNA in water, which just expands to be a polymer and a good solvent in a random walk, but it rather collapses. And that's what we saw in vivo. Now, the very simple conceptual model, and you don't have to follow any equations, because I'll just walk you through it, is that if the chromatin is self-attractive, so the red here is the chromatin. So, the red here is the chromatin, the white is the nucleoplasm. The chlomatin is attracted to itself. We know from the physics of phase separation, all the physical chemistry, that it will phase separate from the nucleoplasm. And it has two ways of doing it. It can do it over here where the chromatin is in the periphery, or it could do it over here, the chromatin's in the center. If the chromatin is attracted to the nuclear envelope, the lamina, Ne. The lamina, NE in the slides, is nuclear envelope shown here in blue with an attractive interaction. And that in keys indeed is the case in the wild type where parts of the chromatin called lands, lamin attractive domains, are attracted to the nuclear envelope. Then the chromatin still phase separates from nucleoplasm, but phase separates from the periphery. Of course, this attraction has to overcome building this interface between the This interface between the chromatin and the nucleoplasm. If the chromatin is self-attractive, the interface costs you an interfacial energy, gamma C. So this attraction is larger than gamma C, it will face separating this peripheral zone. However, if by this extreme case, I put the attraction to the lamina, to the nucleoplasm, to the nuclear envelope to be zero, there's no reason for the chromatin to be attracted here. The chromatin is Attracted here. The chromatin is still self-attractive, still phase separates from the nucleoplasm, but then it tries to make the smallest possible interface and it goes into the center. And Gaurav and my group has done simulations published in this paper, and that replicates what we see in the experiment. So to summarize, if there's a strong attraction to nuclear envelope, you get this peripheral organization. If there's weak attraction to nuclear envelope, Weak attraction to nuclear envelope, as we believe happens in the mutants, you get this central organization. And these are some of Garard's simulations based on this very simple conceptual model. And it really depends on how hydrated the nucleus is. Here, over here, the blue is the nucleoplasm, and the red and the green are the chromatin. I won't go into the details, and chromatin density in the nucleoplasm. Chromatin density in the nucleus is a function of the distance from the center of the nucleus as shown here. And this has also been quantified in the experiments that I showed you in the Drosophila. And the comparison is shown in this paper and also in the science advances paper. So in this panel over here, you have a lot of nucleoplasm. The chromatin phase separates because it's self-attractive. And the nucleoplasm, the chromative fraction phi, is small. The nucleoplasm fraction one minus phi is large. You have a lot of nucleoplasm, 90%. You see phase separation. But the more and more chromatin that exists in the nucleus, and that's a function whether you have single replication of chromatin or whether it's polyploidy and other things, there's more chromatin. There's more chromatin relative to nucleoplasm. Well, this shell of the peripheral chromatin in the wild type gets thicker. And finally, if you have very little nucleoplasm, you don't see the phase separation. That's just like having a water and alcohol mixture where you have a certain proportion of alcohol in the water, maybe 20%. The alcohol and water will stay separate. But if you have too large a proportion, it will just mix with the water. It will just mix with the water. And the same thing happens here through phase separation. The reason for doing the simulations is that chromatin is a polymer, so we do simulations for a self-attractive polymer. It's very coarse-grained. There's no genetic information, no sequence information. The chromatin beads, if so to speak, of the chromatin chain have excluded volume, but they also have longer range attractions. And that's all there is in this very Attractions, and that's all there is. And this replicates the experiments we've shown, and even replicates, at least semi-quantitatively, the density of chromatin in the nucleus. And here are more experiments. Again, this picture here on the left is not a simulation. It's an actual microscopy picture. And the green is tagging the nuclear envelope, the lamin of the Nesprin protein. The nesprin proteins in the nuclear envelope. The red is tagging the chromatin through the histones, and you see this phase separation. It's in the periphery. However, that's the case in the wild type. If they fix the chromatin by putting maldehyde in it, other techniques that people use to do chromatin or DNA fixation, or if they spread these nuclei, or if they culture. These nuclei, they culture them, culture the cells and substrates. What happens is that these cells get dehydrated compared to the live type. And here is the statistics of the experiments on the live type and on fixed cells. And you see the fixed cells, the red over here, has a much more uniform chromatin density than the live type and the live cells that have a peak of chromatin in the periphery corresponding to this. In the periphery corresponding to this. And the reason is simply that in the fixed cells, the volume of the cell is much smaller by a factor of two or three than in the live cells. So that is a caution to dealing with fixed cells versus live cells. In the live cells, the cells are quite hydrated. There's enough nucleoplasm so the chromatin phase separates, just as I showed you over here, maybe. But in the fixed cells, the nuclei and Fixed cells, the nuclei and the cells are dehydrated, and the chromatin just fills the nucleus. And that's what these experiments show. If you overexpress lamin AC, which is a protein of the nuclear envelope, and here it's shown in green, and if it's overexpressed, then the chromatin cannot interact with the nuclear envelope. Why microscopically is discussed in several papers. It isn't quite settled, but the chromatin is no longer attracted to the nuclear envelope. Is no longer attracted to the nuclear envelope and it still phase separates because chromatin itself is self-attractive, but it phase separates away from the nuclear envelope in the center, as the experiments show. Now, why does it do that? Because then the interface of the chromatin with the nucleoplasm, which is an interface that causes you surface tension, since the chromatin likes itself better than it likes the nucleoplasm, it says separates, that interface is smaller. That interface is smaller here than in the wild type, where you have a big interface, and that big interfacial tension is compensated by having an attraction to the lamina in the wild type. But in the mutant, there's no compensation. You get this smaller interface. And that's what's seen over here. Here is the quantification of the experiments. This is the black is the control where you have peripheral organization, and the red is the laminate. And the red is the laminate overexpression where the chromatin peak is towards the center of the nucleus and not in the periphery. And the simulations are at least semi-quantitatively in agreement. So we've seen that chromatin phase separates. We've seen this could be measured in live cells, and that there's a difference between live cells and fixed cells. I won't go through this, but I'll say one more word because it's important for the mechanosensitivity and for what. The mechanosensitivity, and for what I'll tell you next, is that there are two generally two types of chromatin. To use words that the Kramer brothers use in their experiment, there's active chromatin and inactive. Active chromatin expresses genes, it interacts with various enzymes like BOL2, and inactive chromatin does not interact so strongly with those enzymes, and in general, its genes are not expressed. Its genes are not expressed. The molecular difference between active and inactive chromatins is that the histones in active chromatins, also DNA, can be acetylated, and in inactive chromatin, the histones are methylated and not acetylene. Now, you may ask, okay, so we've looked at the chromatin, and the chromatin here in these experiments is always red. It's looking at histone, but doesn't distinguish active and inactive chromatin. Active and inactive chromatin, and Talila and her group did distinguish the two by marking the acetylated chromatin in green, the histones of any chromatin, both active and inactive in red, and by looking at the overlap. And there is correlation of the acetylated and non-acetylated, but to some extent, you can see by these dots, they are separated from each other. So these green and So these green and red regions and yellow regions, which is the merge, are separated from each other, although all of them in the live cells are phase separated from the nucleoplasm. So the phase separation happens for both active and inactive chromatin, but then at another level, once it's all peripheral because of this phase separation, and the active and inactive chromatin, they separate from themselves. In other language, people use In other languages, people use it's a separation locally of heterochromatin, which is inactive, and euchromatin, which is active. And that's what's being shown over here, but not in tremendous resolution to understand exactly how that separation occurs. So we were interested in that. And the important thing is that the active blocks, so just to summarize, chromatins of polymer has two large A polymer has two large block chemical blocks in the language of a block copolymer, or these pictures of red and green sections of the polymer. There's active chromatin that is genes that are expressed. And generally, the red, I'm sorry, active is green, and the red is inactive chromatin that interacts with various transcription factors shown here as a little yellow dot. They interact generally with the active chromatin and Active chromatin and expressed genes. But the fact that these active blocks and have acetyl groups interact with the various proteins that are involved in transcription means that these active blocks might not be as condensed as the inactive block. So let's say we had a very simple model, and we did this with Omauer and Barav in a paper that was published in eLife, together with our experimental collaborators, showing that you have Showing that you have active blocks and green and inactive blocks. And when you have no proteins, they're both condensed, but they separate from each other. So you have a region of the active and a region of the inactive, but it's condensed collapsed polymers. Now you introduce the proteins that interact with the active blocks. They absorb, they bind to the active blocks, eventually called gene expression. We don't model gene expression. We're just doing a physics model of active blocks. Model of active blocks with binding to proteins, those proteins will cause the active blocks to be less condensed because you have to have room or entropy. So the proteins will absorb to the active blocks. And we modeled this both analytically in work with Omar as work of black hopolymers. The red here is the inactive block. The green is the active block interacts with the proteins. And the fact that the active block in And the fact that the active block interacts with the proteins means that they're not going to be as condensed as the inactive block. So even though the active block might be self-attracted, the proteins cause it to be pulled out a bit. And I won't go through the details, but I'll just show you that we modeled this. Omar did the black hole polymer simulation. Yarab did models, and this is a model. The red is the inactive chromatin, the green are active. Chromatin, the green or active blocks of chromatin. It's all one long, long, long polymer with regions of red, green, red, green, red, green, active, inactive, active, inactive. The red is attractive to the red more than the green is attractive to the green. Both red and green are self-attractive, so they phase separate from the nucleoplasm. And the little yellow dots here are the proteins that are the transcription factors that can bind to the green, but not to the red. Green, but not to the red. So, this panel here is where there's no binding energy. The binding energy of these transcription factors to the green is zero. And now, as you go down, you increase the binding strength. And what you see is the red remains the same. It's a condensed. The green is still condensed and stays separated from the black, from nucleoprasins, but it's less condensed because it's interacting with these binding proteins that are responsible for transcription. That are responsible for transcription. And the experiments indeed showed that if you look carefully, you saw regions of inactive chromatin that we modeled the colors in the same way that are red, surrounded by active chromatin. And here the green is a marker for POL2. That's a transcription factor in a way that shows that the inactive and active are locally phase separated, just like here, red and green, but both are. Here, red and green, but both of them are in the periphery of the nucleus. Okay, so now, how much longer do I have to do it? Five minutes? Hello? Seven minutes. Very good. So I'm almost seven. So here's a movie I'll show you again. I'll let it play again. This is a movie that starts. It's just the movie of the pictures I showed. It's going to start where the active green and the inactive red. Green and the inactive red are both condensed. There are no proteins that are bound. And as time goes on, the proteins bind. And what you'll see is the red remains the same because the transcription factors don't bind inactive protein to inactive chromatin heterochromatin, but they do bind to active pro to active chromatin to the green chromatin. And the green chromatin then becomes less condensed and it gets sort of pulled out. So here it starts. Here it starts. Okay. They bind, and the green one gets pulled out. And this is what the simulation shows, that both the active and inactive are phase separated from the nucleoplasm. But now the inactive has a lower density, if you will, a lower concentration than these red blocks. And I showed you one picture of the experiments that really qualitatively looked. That really qualitatively looked like this, where the inactive chromatin is at the center of some cluster of the active chromatin that seems less dense. And Khalil and her group are quantifying it, and we're continuing with theoretic. But now I want to say something about mechanosensing activities if we know something about the chromatin organization at the nucleus now. And the experiments focus on what's called the link complex. The link complex. The link complex is a complex of many proteins that couples the cytoskeleton, could be microtubules, could be actomyosin to the lamin, to the nucleus. This is the nuclear envelope. This is the nuclear envelope that the chromatin sees. And down here is the chromatin. So your chromatin is bound by certain groups called lamin-associated domains to the lamin, to the nuclear envelope. To the nuclear envelope, and these linked complex proteins bind the lamin to the cytoskeleton. So, cytoskeleton is bound to link, is bound to the lamin, which is a nuclear envelope, and chromatin is also bound to the nuclear envelope. So, chromatin is bound to these proteins effectively, and effectively the chromatin organization should feel the cytoskeletal forces through these long sequence of binding proteins. Sequence of binding proteins. So, this is the molecular scale reason for mechanosensitivity. Now, I want to talk a little bit about the chromatin organization that I told you about before and mechanosensitivity. And the experiments were contrasting wild type, where you have this link complex intact, and the nucleus and the chromatin feels whatever it feels from the cytoskeleton. We don't add the mutants that are linked complex mutants where some of this complex is disrupted and the binding is less strong. It hasn't been tremendously quantified. How is the binding less strong? How much of the cytoskeleton forces are not seen, but they looked at these link complexes. And what they are looking at here is the methylated domains. Remember, I said that the acetylated histones. That the acetylated histones are the ones that are the active ones, and the methylated ones are the ones that are inactive. I apologize that methyl here is a green before the acetyl was a green, but these are the ones that were the chromatin was red, inactive chromatin. And there are marks for these methyl groups. There are proteins called polychromate P1 that are repressive marks that bind to repressed chromatin. And in the control. Chromatin and in the control in the wild type, you have a certain density of repressive marks. But when you have mutations in the link complex, they're called sun and coi. These names are not important, you decouple the chromatin from cytoscalpal forces in some way that we don't yet know. But what you see is an increase in the repressed in the non-active marks of chromatin. So as you decouple the chromatin from the cytos. chromatin from the cytoskeleton, you're seeing more and more repressed marks of the chromatin. Why might this be? So we don't know yet, but we have two possible explanations. But before I tell you those two suggestions, I just want to say that the fact that you change the repressive chromatin probably in proportion to the active chromatin, there's more repressed chromatin in these. More repressed bromatin in these linked complex mutants means that you'll have less gene expression. And that means that the organism will not function the way it should function. And indeed, mutations in the link complex are coupled to many, many, to many, many, many abnormalities at the cellular level and probably at the organism level that I know less about. Less about. So the fact that you have more repressed chromatin here is sort of a physical chemistry or biophysics experiment, but the biological implications this for genetics are very important. So we have two suggestions, and we don't know which one is right. Is the increased repression for linked mutants, the fact that you have more repressed chromatin when you abrogate this coupling to the cytoskeleton, is this biochemical, namely, Biochemical, namely, there could be changes in enzymatic activity in the nucleus that are responsible for the methylation modifications of histones or repressed chromatin. Remember, I told you that inactive chromatin, the histones, the proteins of inactive chromatin have methyl marks, and maybe there's more enzymatic activity, which is changing acetyl marks to methyl marks and just biochemically giving you more repressed chromatin. Giving you more repressed chromatin. And if you have more repressed chromatin at the expense of active chromatin, then you'll have decreased gene activity. That is one possible explanation for this experiment. The other possible explanation is mechanical. Maybe what happens is that in the wild type, the cytoskeleton, because you have contractile forces, the cytoskeleton that on the one hand is bound to the nuclear envelope. Is bound to the nuclear envelope in the chromatin, and at the other end is bound to the extracellular matrix. The cytoskeletons, at least the actomycin cytoskeletons, contractile, and it's pulling on the nucleus. So maybe this pull on the nucleus in the wild type is pulling the chromatin to the periphery of the lamina. And that might be another factor in why the chromatin is up against the lamina, not just because of attractions. Not just because of attractions, but because of these linked complex proteins that couple the nuclear envelope to the cytoskeleton. Cytoskeleton's contractile is pulling on the nuclear envelope and also pulls on the chromatin. And perhaps in the linked mutant, where you get, you aggregate these proteins that pull, that transmit, transduce the pulling forces of the cytoskeleton to the nuclear envelope. Maybe the repressed chromatins know. Maybe the repressed chromatins no longer pulled to the lamina, and it leaves, some of it leaves the lamina and joins the chromatin clusters away from the lamina. A more repressed chromatin cluster may screen active chromatin. So this is two suggestions. We don't know which one is right, and that's work in progress, but I'll just show you a picture of simulations of what the second one and what the mechanical explanation would be. First of all, here are the experiments. This is the control. Experiments. This is the control with the peripheral chromatin. And this is the mutant showing you all the chromatin. And it shows how the chromatin is now in the mutant, not so much in the periphery, but is more, has a concentration, which tends more towards the center. It still doesn't fill the center, but it's not sub-peripherally located in the mutant. And in the Arav simulations, he simulated this. Simulated this. He's not putting in any mechanics. All he's doing is saying that in K equals 10, this is the wild type like this, where you have a strong binding of the chromatin to lamina. Something's pulling it to the lamina. And here, k equals 1.5, that strong binding is abrogated. And you see there's more chromatin towards the center. That's all that this shows. And in the mutant, as I said, the repressive marks spread towards the center. Towards the center, whether this is because of biochemical activity and changing the balance of methylated to acetylated marks on the histones, or whether it is mechanical pulling here versus the lack of that pulling here and the chromathin sort of relaxes, we don't know, and that's what we're looking into. So, here is a cartoon of those two pictures on the mechanical explanation. This is the controller, the wild type, where the report. Or the wild type, where the repressed chromatin is shown here. And now, if you aggregate these binding proteins, the repressed chromatin has been released from lamina and is more in the, it's still peripheral, but it is not quite as peripheral. And somehow that repressed chromatin being freed up from binding to the lamina is screening the active chromatin and showing more repressed marks. And showing more repressed marks within the nucleus. Which one is right, we don't know. We don't know if it's about chemical explanation for repressive marks or if it's this mechanical explanation. But at least this shows you how we can understand the nuclear scale organization of chromatin. It's a type of phase separation, just like many proteins phase separate. Chromatin phase separates in live organism nuclei, and that this phase separation is sensitive to. Is sensitive to cytoskeletal forces, to being coupled with cytoskeletal forces, and this may be related to the known mechanosensitivity of genetics. So with this, I think I just say thank you, and I'll be happy to take any questions.
