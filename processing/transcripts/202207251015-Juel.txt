Can you hear me now? That is sheer perfection. Okay, at least relative. Okay, so basically what's puzzled me for quite a while is, you know, you can get this incredible rich behavior of these interfaces in bubbles and fingers propagating in helioshaw channels, but there's very rarely any connection made between that pattern formation and the dynamics that actually generates it. And so that's sort of the general. So, that's sort of the general theme of my talk. And, you know, unfortunately, I'm not going to get very far with it, but at least I'm going to hopefully present you with some ideas. Okay, so in the classical system, the simplest sort of healer-show system, that's the one that you see playing on the top left there, over here. Then you essentially put, say, oil between two closely spaced plates, you inject air from the center. Inject air from the center, and you get your unstable air-liquid interface. Fingers form, they grow, the tips split, they compete, and this process kind of keeps on regenerating. But the thing that you observe is that all this pattern is completely disordered, it's continually evolving. And most people sort of describe this as a sort of, it's always a sort of a bit of a show and tell. Well, it does this and it does that. Does this and it does that? But what actually organizes these dynamics? And then, you know, you can go, and I've conveniently picked some lot of the beautiful work of the organizers here, and you can do these extraordinary experiments where you get these fantastic patterns forming in, this is usually in media that have more complex rheology. And then you get these beautiful patterns. And to some extent, in this case, because Patterns, and to some extent, in this case, because you can take as a general rule that the interface and the fingers in particular are going to want to follow the path of least resistance in these channels, then this, the path and the fingering patterns might tell you something, for instance, about the metroscopic structure of these materials and their rheology. But another way you're creating a real diversity of patterns is by playing and pampering, if you like, with the geometrical confinement of these systems. Confinement of these systems. And when you do that, then you can, for instance, with an elastic sheet, you can really suppress fingering, or you can put, create anisotropy by creating a sort of anisotropy pattern, anisotropic sort of resistance pattern in the channel. Okay, and so really here, what I want to do is to play with confinement, geometric confinement. Confinement, geometric confinement, to try to get a handle of what is generic fingering behavior in these types of systems. Okay, so we go back to the beginning. And the sort of system I want to look at is a channel. It's a helioshaw channel. It's a classical experiment by Satman and Tate in 1958. So you have two closely spaced glass plates. The channel is much much wider than it is. The channel is much wider than it is deep. We fill it with oil and then we inject there. Or in practice, we actually withdraw the oil at a constant volume flux. And in this system, we therefore have a large aspect ratio. And this is really as simple as can be. You know, there's no gravity, there's no inertia. The injected air is going to work against viscous and surface tension forces. And so really the main governing parameter is the capillary number, which is a The capillary number, which is a represents a ratio between viscous and surface tension forces, and this is a very convenient system because all the nonlinearity arises at the interface. And because of that, in a sense, you see all the complexity readily as it forms. And so in addition to that, it's quite simple. It is a quasi-two-dimensional system. It's very amenable to numerical modeling of two-dimensional depth average libertation flows. So if we So, if we do the sort of conceptually the experiment, we start with a flat ear interface. This is linearly unstable. You'll see fingers appearing at the interface. These fingers grow, they compete, and eventually, at long times, you get the famous Sathman-Taylor finger, which is a steadily propagating finger. And there's a single finger that you ever see, and it's stable because you actually see it in the experiment. The experiment. Okay, so this finger has been shown to be linearly stable for all values of the control parameter. And this is an experiment where you can see it from its early evolution down to long time. And really, a lot of the sort of early focus on this type of problem was actually quite different from what I'm going to tell you about, which was basically that people were very interested in what was happening at infinite size. Happening at infinite Sophman-Taylor parameter, which is basically the aspect ratio squared times the Capillary number, which governs this steady finger. And they were interested in that because at this infinite parameter or zero, effective zero surface tension, then there's a whole family of fingers, solutions that you can calculate analytically. But surface tension comes in at a singular perturbation to just select one of them. And that's the one we actually see. And that was basically so-called selection. And that was basically a so-called selection problem. But actually, when we do experiments, we're never at zero surface tension and we're never in the regime of infinite, therefore infinite Satman-Taylor parameter. But actually, in practice, if we just increase the Sathman-Taylor parameter, this is what happens. So you get a fairly abrupt transition to what I call disordered front propagation at a sufficiently high threshold of the Safman-Taylor parameter, which is Essentially, it depends on the level of background perturbation in the system. And when you have that, that's essentially a very strong signature of critical transition to disorder. And so, you know, it's really remarkable that you can get that sort of complexity given these incredibly simple physical ingredients. Now, when you have that sort of pattern formation, you know, what drives it? What organizes it? You know what drives it? What organizes this pattern formation? And the key point here is it's continually evolving, it's unsteady. And that's what we mean by disorder. And unsteady means essentially that starts calling for a sort of dynamical systems approach to try to rationalize what goes on. And so you can take a very simple view of the dynamical systems approach. So this is a very simple conceptual picture of transient dynamics, the simplest that is. And if you do that, you If you do that, you can say, well, transient dynamics are going to be key naturally to continually evolving propagation. And in a nonlinear system, the key features of transient evolution are the unstable states, the ones that we don't see in the experiment. And we might see them very fleetingly, very transiently in the experiments, but generally we don't see them. And so, if you take this very simple, sort of generic example of a saddle, or you can call it a stagnation point flow, if you like, then Point flow, if you like, then you will have stable and unstable manifolds dividing the streamlines of the flow. And so if you start anywhere here, your fluid path will be attracted along the attracting the stable manifolds and eventually kicked off away from the saddle along the unstable directions. And essentially, the ultimate fate of a fluid path will depend very strongly on it. Path will depend very strongly on its initial position relative to these manifolds. So, typically, in the language of non-linear dynamics, we call these manifolds invariant objects, and they're typically unstable invariant objects, stable unstable invariant objects, and they're often referred to as the edge state of the system because they separate the fate of different particles depending on the initial conditions. And so, you know, the very famous flow is that of the transition of shear flow in turbulence. Of the transition of shear flow and turbulence, and you can think there: well, that's complicated 3D flow, and there's multiple unstable invariant objects present. And then the system can exhibit really complex dynamics. And in particular, what's been found is that it exhibits these complex dynamics by moving between the stable manifolds of weakly unstable modes of propagation of system. And in shear flows, what's been found in an And in shear flows, what's been found in a nutshell is that traveling wave modes are actually key to transition, and these are periodic states or more complex states. And so these are sort of traveling wave solutions in experiments and in numerics from some of the sort of seminal work on that topic. And essentially, you can think that if you have a whole bunch of these weakly unstable modes, then you can entangle the stable and the unstable manifolds in phase space and eventually create a really complex edge. Eventually, create a really complex edge state that will be separating lamina and turbulent flows. So, that's kind of in a nutshell that, in very simple words, if you like, what goes on in there. So, really, at that point, we have a really simple system compared to all this, but it also exhibits disordered from propagation. So, is any of this relevant? And in particular, do we have periodic modes? And so, we can go back to our Hilshaw system and we can say, Short system, and we can say, Well, are the periodic modes in viscous fingering? And so, what we can do with our computations is calculate the steady-state modes of finger propagation. And we hope to get what we knew from the experiment, which is that we have one, and that's the solid line here, one and only one stable state of propagation. That's the finger, Safman-Taylor finger, as a function, say, of the capillary number here. Here and you can see that's its width, and that is its speed relative to the mean speed in the channel. You can see it here, and essentially you have that, but you also have a host of weakly unstable fingers. And these you only see fleetingly in experiments. Nobody ever talks about them, but they are there, and there are more, many more. There are basically infinite countable families of these. So, one question that you may ask is: what's the role of these unstable modes? And I'm not going to focus particularly. And I'm not going to focus particularly on that. But the next question is: really: these are steady-state modes of finger propagation. Are there any generic mechanisms for creating unsteady or time-periodic modes in these systems? Okay, so if you go back to the 90s and around Yves Couder and the lab of Yves Couder, there were some beautiful experiments done because at that time people were really preoccupied with this selection problem. And so they started to perturb their Southman Taylor. curve their Safman Taylor fingers and they were able to find solutions or the solutions of that theoreticians had predicted that were not the selected ones. But what they also were able to do is by here placing a little bubble at the tip of the finger here as well, by here sort of stretching a wire along the center line of the channel, they were able to create all these, or you could argue, in inverted comma stabilize, all sorts of alternative propagation modes. Modes and here you basically perturb what matters is that you perturb the air fluid interface very close to its tip because that's where all the action is. That's where all the fluid mechanics. After that, the rest is just shed behind the finger. And so what happens is that the tip starts oscillating and then it sheds a spatial temporal periodic pattern behind it. And what I want to try to show you that actually this is totally generic and there are many mechanisms for these time periodic and more complex. Mechanisms for these time periodic and more complex dynamics in Healer-Short channels. So I have two related systems because obviously the uniform depth heli-short channel is not going to help us much because all it shows is disorder pretty much. So I'm going to perturb the helo-short channel in two ways. So I'm going to look at finger propagation in Hilo Short channel, which has an elastic toplid. That's this one. And then I'm going to go to another one, which is a little bit closer to the classic. Another one, which is a little bit closer to the classical helioshort channel, where I'm just going to put a depth protrusion in the form of a rail all along the channel. And that depth protrusion I'm going to use is about one or two percent of the depth of the channel. It's very small. Okay, so oops, keep on okay, so before we go there, look at the experiments, which is most of what I'm going to show you, we can look at sort of what the rational. We can look at sort of what the rationale, what's the sort of physics behind this, and how do you model this? Well, for the flow in both those systems, be it with elastic lid or the rigid system, we have essentially prescribed variation of the channel depth. And when you have the elastic lid, your channel depth can also vary in time as the finger advances. So we need to take into account a prescribed depth variation. And so for that, we take the 3D Stokes equation, we depth average them, and we get We depth average them and we get the Reynolds lubrication equations. And you can see that the variable depth is there in the sort of bulk flow, in the viscous flow. But then you also have bubble boundaries, so you have a kinematic boundary condition and a dynamic boundary condition, which in the sort of Hilucha system really approximates the Young-Laplace equation. But in this Young-Laplace equation, we have to take into account the transverse Transverse curvature of the system because it varies and is going to influence what goes on. So, basically, the prescribed depth variation also comes into the surface tension effect. Okay, so then we can put all of this into UNFLEBN. And actually, before I missed one point, now if you have an elastic lid, you need to take into account the deformation of the elastic lid, and then you have to do Elastic lid, and then you have to do quite a lot of work to fully couple the Foppel-Pon-Karman equation to the fluid model. And so, this is a really big job, and I'm doing it on one slide. I'm not giving you any of the detail, but there's lots of things to be worked out in order to do this properly. Once we've done all of this, we can put this and simulate this with Umflib, which is a sort of homegrown or sort of Manchester developed. A sort of Manchester developed sort of object-oriented multiphysics finite element library. And I'm going to again pass you the details, but really, what I want to get across is that, you know, this has been done very carefully. And we have a whole toolbox of simulations with this. We can do direct time simulations, we can do steady state calculations, parameter continuations, we can do linear stability calculations, and we can do something that I'm not really going to explain what is, but. Something that I'm not really going to explain what is, but tracking these edge states potentially. Okay. Okay. So starting with the first system. So this is the system, you know, the system with the elastic lid. So in that case, you can start with just a rectangle across section of your channel with your elastic lid flat on top. And then we do exactly the same, you know, with set. The channel up is filled with liquid and then we inject air with a constant flux. But now, Flux. But now, and so you look from the top and you get a finger that looks very much like the Safman Taylor finger that we had earlier. So, in terms of the pattern formation, it's all the same, but the physics have really changed because we now have a viscous capillary elastic competition. So, the ear is working against three forces rather than two. So, if you look in, and that has an effect, because if you look into a side view of this problem, then you see that the bubble is going to inflate the channel. Bubble is going to inflate the channel, and you also see that there's only fluid motion or recirculation right ahead of the bubble, and the channel is unperturbed further upstream. And that's very different from the classic rigid Hilleshaw sort of flow, which is a displacement flow, where you're displacing all the fluid ahead of the thing. And so, if you measure the sheet deflection in from the... Deplexion in from the side, this is what you see. You have airflow coming from the left, you have the interface, and then you have a small wedge of fluid. And a lot of the sto physics of this finger propagation mode is linked to what goes on in this fluid wedge. Now, this is really a simple or simplified model of a pulmonary airway reopening. Sort of process where you can say, collapse, you have a collapsed airway, it's occluded by liquid, you breathe, and the air has to make its way to reopen the airway. And so here, the way we can mimic that is by taking, instead of just a rectangular cross-section, we can collapse the channel by applying an external pressure to the membrane and basically spelling some of the liquid that's inside the channel. And so we get another control parameter. And so we get another control parameter in addition to a capillary number, which is the level of initial collapse. So this is simply the collapse cross-section over the neutral cross-section. And then we can vary these and we can have a look at what goes on. So to start with, I just want to show you a demonstration of some of the things you can do. And here really, the spirit is we're manipulating the cross-section and we're manipulating the geometric confinement. Manipulating the geometric confinement of the flow. So you can take and you can take basically, you can create two sorts of different situations in this channel. So you always have a finger propagating, but you can actually create a finger that propagates with an entirely flat front, pretty much. And when you do that, you are very much in the so-called situation of the peeling front of matun and tape. Front of McCune and Taylor, which were peeling an elastic sheet from a thin layer of adhesive. And in that case, you get these stubby fingers. And you get, but what's interesting here to me is that you get a steady instability, just a symmetry breaking instability. You create these fingers. And there's a movie I can maybe run. Can try. Oh, yeah, there's coming. Right. And so this is a pretty good thing. And so, this is pretty much a steady instability, certainly if you have moderate enough capillary number. And so, here you've engineered the finger to have a flat front, and it fingers, and it fingers with a steady instability. Now, if you have a curved front and you engineer that with a different type of cross-section, this is what you get. And so the finger now has also fingers at its tip, but instead of just having a, and I'm going to. Just having a, and I'm going to drum it again, it's very short. Instead of having a sort of steady instability, it's continuously evolving, it's generating new fingers at the tip all the time. And these are then being advected around the curved front. And when you look at, so then if you look at the second image, that's a sort of time-lapse image. So you basically look at a spatial temporal evolution of this finger. Yeah. Yeah. So on the left side, it also looks like if there were small perturbations on the flat front. There will be. Actually, the movie, this one is very steady. That one's a little, it has some dynamics in those little indications. You have to write, yeah. But I think the point here is that you can then look at this. So this was done by Coudera. So, this was done by Coudera and co-workers in the 90s. You can actually just simply predict where a little perturbation at the tip of your finger, where it's going to end up. And you know that essentially each fluid particle is going to propagate normally to the interface immediately. And so you can build up trajectories, predicted trajectories for where any point of the curved front is going to end up in time. And you can see that it fits very nicely with some of these patterns that you see in the spatial. With some of these patterns that you see in the spatial and temporal patterns. And you're basing this basically on the simple Sachman-Teyler envelope of your finger. So the key point here is that you have continual emergence of a small scale fingering at the tip, and then you have an unsteady propagation. The tip is instability is completely coupled to the advection around the front. And then you can play, you look at this system, and we did it with slightly different motivation. It in a slightly different motivation, but you can vary the capillary number, and going from low capillary numbers, you have your very nice, steady finger, some nice, steady, asymmetric finger. But what you find very quickly as you increase the capillary number is that the propagation gets really rather complicated. Here, it's very paodic, for instance. Here, it's less so. And this is kind of this feathering patterns I've just showed you in the previous slides. So, you get all this incredibly This incredibly incredible variety of propagation modes in this system, and you can rationalize the mechanics of this. The important thing to note in all of these, in this sequence, as the capillary number increases, is that the finger starts off quite narrow and it broadens. And not only does it broaden, its tip gets flatter and flatter. And as soon as the tip gets flat, And as soon as the tip gets flat, you get fingering instabilities at the tip. Okay? And so the mechanical reason for this is basically that you're transitioning from a region, a regime where viscous forces balance capillary forces, essentially, which we call viscous peeling, to a regime where essentially you're in the sort of MacHun and Taylor regime, where elastic forces now, viscous forces are hardly important at all. Important at all, and viscous elastic forces now balance capillary forces. And the reason for that is that ahead of the air finger, there's quite a lot of fluid, big wedge of fluid at low capillary number. At higher capillary number, you lose that big wedge and the air penetrates all the way into the most collapsed region of the channel. And so you have very little fluid recirculation and viscous dissipation in that system. Okay, so. Okay, so but the point is that really unsteady behavior in these systems is totally ubiquitous, right? And you can say, well, can we predict this with our model? So here I'm showing the bubble pressure as a function of the capillary number. And so the solid lines here are the numerics and the symbols, yes? Symbols, yes? About the previous slide, I think you mentioned it already before, but yeah, so I think if I understand correctly, the standard or Safman-Taylor picture is correspond to elastic peeling? Not really, no, no, no, no, no, so to viscous or to viscous. It would be the standard Saffman-Taylor picture would be this one. I see. But you could imagine that now this wedge is kind of stretched. This wedge is kind of stretched out to be infinitely long. That's the standard direction. Yeah, that's right. So only viscous forces mapped, and there's no elasticity whatsoever. Whereas in the large capillary number, on the elastic pilling case. Yeah, so that's a very good point. But where does the flow go? Where does the liquid go? It should also be displaced, no? So here it doesn't, you don't need to, you just, you re, you, because you can inflate the chunk. Because you can inflate the channel in the elastic case, you don't need to displace the fluid so much, and all you need is just recirculate it locally. So, that's essentially the big difference, if you like, between the two. But the point I'm trying to make here is that none of that matters ultimately in terms of the pattern formation. Yeah, I need to understand the dynamics before talking about the patterns, but okay, thanks. But okay, thanks. Okay, so so you can do these simulations and you get very good quantitative agreement as long as everything is steady. But what you can see is that this is complicated. Lots of P of pitchfork bifurcations, all the letters of bifurcation. There's five different hop bifurcations just in this little region of capillary number. And so again, lots of time-dependent modes, it's pretty ubiquitous. And overall, what's remarkable is you're predicting the pressure really quite nicely with the steady states, but you are clearly not predicting the patterns. And so, I mean, in a sense, what you can take away from that is you have an extensive multiplicity, if you like, of steady solutions. But most of them are unstable. Most of them are unstable, and really, they don't help you very much to find exactly what modes the fingers are propagating. But okay, I'm going to jump over that and I'm going to jump onto the system that's easy, I think, to understand, because we're going back to the sort of rigid system. And in that case, all we have is a small depth perturbation along the central rail. And that's enough to change the confinement to be able to create. Be able to create conditions for generating more complex sort of pattern formation. And so, if you take this system, we're going to essentially do just exactly what we did with the rigid Subman-Taylor problem. We're going to inject that constant flux and we might look at an ear bubble, finite ear bubble, or a finger propagating in there. And again, it's sort of. Again, it's sort of kind of easy to destabilize the tip in this case. So here you have, so the channel is only, you can see the lines very faintly, but you have this bubble and it just periodically moves down, you know, sort of slugs down the channel, yeah? And this is very generic in those systems. So you might ask me, you know, what goes on here? Well, okay, well, it is a tip instability, and that's the important. Well, it is a tip instability, and that's the important thing here. Is that if you pick up the tip of this bubble along your finger, you see that it'll do something and have a periodic cycle like this. And essentially, you can see that it sort of exhibits an instability. So it starts off like a reasonably stable thing, and then it looks like it falls off the obstacle. Looks like he falls off the obstacle and then he restores. And so, here there's a really important point, I think, to be made: is that, of course, you know, we have no inertia in these systems, and you get all these oscillations, all these complicated behavior in a system which has absolutely no inertia. So, the mechanism here for destabilization is really linked to the confinement. And you can think of it, for instance. In this system, if you take a finger, Sapman Taylor finger, it always has the highest curvature at its tip, and then it broadens behind its tip. And here it's been put in situation where it broadens just enough to fall off, for its edge to fall off the obstacle at some point. And when that happens, basically, in these systems with depth variation, then you get a sudden change in the cross-sectional curvature of the Curvature of the finger. And what that means is that that changes the pressure difference between the oil and the air. And yes, she raises a constant bubble pressure, the pressure in the oil, and it drives the interface outwards. So this is a sort of mechanism you're saying. And you can say, well, you know, that's a bit of a letdown because the rail is absolutely essential to see this. So this is not very generic whatsoever. And you can do this in numerics, and you can find sort of traveling waves traveling. Waves traveling down sort of fingers. Okay, but actually, the fact that you get again a tip instability that gets advected down the finger is absolutely key in this system. And you can now go back to our three finger formation. And there, what you're doing is again, you set up a situation where you have now three bubbles formation that's stable, but the long That's stable, but the long bubble at the back is oscillating. And the reason it's oscillating is because it's perturbed by these bubbles ahead of it. And the question really is, you know, how does this occur? And so you start the system from rest and you get these oscillations that grow. And eventually, you can see if you take their amplitude, they grow and they reach regular oscillation. So this is a So, this is a, if you like, a steady, well, a long-term time periodic state, I guess you should call it. And then you can play with the parameters. For instance, what's really influencing the back bubble is the middle bubble. So, you can play with its size and change its size, that's R2 here. So, if you change its size, then you can see that you go from very small oscillations to much. Small oscillations, much larger oscillations, you go through a sort of super critical consistent with going through super critical hop verification. So you set up these oscillations. And again, the interesting thing, though, is that you have a very periodic cycle of tip oscillations. But the interesting thing here is that it's no longer a direct consequence of having the rail. The rail matters here for setting up this configuration, but what's happening. Figuration, that what's happening is that you have essentially the middle bubble that perturbs the shape of the front and then essentially makes it relatively flat. And when the flat, when a Sapman Taylor front becomes flat, well, he fingers. And this is what happens. He fingers. And then you get the advection of the smaller of these fingers down the side of the bubble. Down the side of the bubble, and then you get restored of the interface. And so this is much more generic, and this has really been generated under particular circumstances, but is looking much more like what we had in the elastic channels. Very much the same mechanisms. And we can now look here much more closely at exactly what is it that drives, you know, that how did this come about? So we can understand to some extent the. We can understand to some extent the Safman-Taylor tip splitting, but how does the interface get restored? You know, what is restoring it? What's creating this oscillation? And so you can plot, for instance, the time scale of this periodic cycle. And if you plot it together with a typical length scale, you find that they are very similar. And actually, they're linked by an advection speed, advection speed of the traveling wave. The traveling wave down the side of the finger. So then you can say, well, okay, so what actually allows this restorer on the interface? Well, you can plot the advection speed. So you know that you need to advect the perturbation in order to get back to restore your interface to its original shape, in order to be able to. Original shape in order to be able to start again with your tip splitting instability. And so, if you plot the adduction speed with the bubble speed, you find that they're very, very similar. And actually, you can go a bit further and look at the time, the period of oscillation of the tip. You can see that it just decreases linearly with the bubble speed. And this is a non-dimensional bubble speed. And essentially, what it tells you is that it's just the fact that the bubble propagates restores the interface. And that's all there is to it. Interface, and that's all there is to it. So, this is incredibly generic in these systems. Okay. And so, essentially, you have a tip fingering. You just need to set up the conditions for tip fingering in whatever way, and then you follow it through by the restoral of the interface. Okay, do I have any time left, Huh? Yes, yes, it's good. Five minutes? Okay, then I'll show you another kind of fun thing that you can get in these systems. Something that you can get in these systems. Okay. Yeah, go on. Thank you. Can you explain again what sets the oscillations here? Like, there is no inertia. So then what's the time scale of the oscillations? So the time scale of the oscillation here is set essentially by the By the, yeah, so it's a good question. So the time scale of the oscillation, all you have is this interaction between these two bubbles, is the fact that this bubble sets and these the in the near vicinity, we've set them up in a stable formation, which is quite an unusual state of affairs, and that is where the rail comes in. And that is where the rail comes in to allow that. But basically, they have there's a pressure grade in between them, and that sort of sets up this flat front. That's what tip splits the system. In terms of the time scale, the time scale is only linked to the time it takes for this to evict. And that is again set by the speed of the bubble. By the speed of the bubble. So just the flux at which it's the only time scale in the system. Yeah? So the time scale is the speed of the bubble over the width of the channel or over the corruption curvature. The characteristic curvature is not going to matter. Sorry, can you quickly repeat this for the, I don't think the characteristic curvature is going to matter. I'm going to repeat the question if you so uh. So the question was, follow-up question was, I think Anne mentioned that the time scale is going to be set up by the velocity. And my question was that the velocity is not time. What's the associated length scale that with the velocity, attraction velocity will determine the time scale of the oscillation? The time scale of the oscillation The time scale of the oscillation, I believe, is going. Well, I'm not absolutely sure about that one because we've had with the previous instability I showed you, I glossed over that because we never found what the key length scale to associate with the velocity. So it's just the velocity of the bubble. That's the only velocity scale in the problem. However, you end up with, I think it's basically the typical. Basically, the tip splitting instability. So it's a length scale of that that matters. And so that depends on this pressure perturbation that you apply. So how flat you make your interface. And I think that that's all there is to it. But I'm not, yeah, can discuss that further. Okay. So they kind of bite their own tail, these systems in a sense, but that also makes it incredibly ubiquitous. So, so, okay. So, I just, if I have time, I can show you one last thing. So, the point is that you need to elucidate these dynamics at low flow rate or capillary number. And this needs to be done because here I've started the, you might have caught it, but I started the movie of five identical bubbles in the same initial condition, let them go, and you can see they all end up in different configurations at the end of it. And that's quite a high flow rate. The end of it, and that's quite a high flow rate. But what we find really quite intriguing is that you also get sensitivity at low flow rate in this system. And so, here, what I want to show you very briefly is I'm going to start with a bubble that is traveling symmetrically on the rail down the system, and then I'm going to perturb it with a local constriction of the channel. And what I need to tell you about this This system is that it's very good because it supports a whole lot of different types of stable bubbles. Not like the system without the rail, which only had one thing or one bubble that could travel down the stably. Here you can get asymmetric modes or symmetric modes. So symmetric or asymmetric stable bubbles. And so if you apply perturbation and you let the system go, then you might ask, well, okay, what am I going to get at the end? Am I going to get at long term? Am I going to stay? At long term, I'm going to stay symmetric, or might I transition to an asymmetric bubble? And so I'm showing you here three identical bubbles, and they're going to encounter this little washer. They get perturbed. You can see they start oscillating in response to the perturbation. And then one ends up symmetric and two end up asymmetric, right? And so obviously, two within experimental resolution, they're the same. Two within experimental resolution, they're the same bubbles, and so then I can go a bit further and I can do this again with two, same at the first three bubbles, two within experimental resolution. Again, they encounter the washer, they start oscillating, and then split up. And here you have one that splits up, and the little one hops over the rail and aggregates, whereas in the other case, this Whereas in the other case, they start separating and they'll separate indefinitely. So, this is at low flow rate. There's nothing unpredictable about the system. I mean, we know all the steady states. So, how on earth is it being so sensitive? What's going on? Okay, so this is a little sort of classical, the explanation is a little classical sort of piece of non-linear dynamics, which is kind of nice. I think. I think because essentially, these are just snapshots of what you've just seen. All these bubbles, they come to different, they start being the same, and they come after a certain time to different end behavior. And what you can plot, for instance, well, then we can plot the centroid position across the channel. So this is this y-bar value, and you can see they start the same. One is kind of deviation of the central. Deviation of the centroid position due to a perturbation, and then they start going into this sort of oscillation again, and then they kind of diverge to all sorts of different things, okay, towards different long-term outcomes. And so really the key to all of this is again oscillations in this system. So there is here, there happens to be an unstable periodic orbit lurking around. And that can be calculated numerically. And this is kind of the oscillation of the. And this is kind of the oscillation of the bubble on this unstable periodic orbit. You can see that we pick up the shapes of the bubbles as they oscillate, they're very similar to that sort of oscillation cycle. So we believe that there is an unstable state there that influences these dynamics. And for us, the interest was how does this manifest in an experiment? So it manifests in experiments only because we perturb the system with different size of washes. So we kind of it's like Size of washers. So we kind of it's like hitting the system with a hammer, if you like, and seeing what comes out of it. And we, so the amplitude of a perturbation is very indirect, it's the size of the washer. And so we only get sort of these unpredictable region in very sort of small regions of flow rates, depending on the size of the wash. But we can do the same with the numerics, and we can start with our symmetric. With our symmetric bubble, and then we can perturb it with the eigenmode of this unstable periodic orbit, this unstable oscillation that exists in the system, but that we don't see. And when we do that with difference of amplitudes, then you can see you get exact, very similar behaviors as what we saw in the experiment. You get these oscillations, it sort of hooks onto the unstable periodic orbit for a little while, and then it gets ejected from the unstable periodic. And then it gets ejected from the unstable periodic orbit. And that is basically a sort of in phase space a diagram a bit like this, where you have your unstable periodic orbit, is this dark dashed line. And this is essentially acts as an edge state between the symmetric outcome and all the other outcomes. And why can you have more than two outcomes? Well, this is not a two-dimensional system. This is just a two-dimensional projection of this phase space. But of course, this is a very large system with a very... Very large system with a very large number of degrees of freedom, and essentially it can break up with pretty much an infinite number of different states because it can break up with a continuum of volume fractions when the bubbles break up. So you could have lots and lots and lots of different outcomes. Okay. So again, I think this is really fascinating to me that such a simple system, I'm going to jump over that, can give you essentially Give you essentially unpredictability in a totally ordered system with very little physics, really. And I'll just end on that. So I think the talk's been about really kind of trying to start making a link between pattern formation in the very idealized Southman-Teyler problem, and particularly when you have. Particular when you have curved front, you know, propagations of fingers that have curved fronts, and how time periodic behavior in these systems is really rather generic. And even though it's rarely seen in the classical viscous fingering, but you can easily manipulate the geometric confinement to really trigger it. And that I didn't talk about. And then also I showed you sort of how you can play around with the confinement of these systems. Around with the confinement of these systems to create all sorts of interesting sorts of textbook non-linear dynamics, such as practical and predictability. But the outlook really goes back to disorder. And really, you know, the question that emerges from that for me is, is, you know, to what extent are these unstable periodic mode of propagation really essential for complexity and for this disordered front propagation that we see so readily in these systems? And do they actually occur in Salman Taylor Fingering? In Safan Taylor Fingering in a channel in the classical one. And maybe a more broader question is really, you know, in shift flow turbulence, which has enough complexity to drive a turbulent state. So you have self-sustaining mechanisms that keep that turbulence going. Can that does that exist in such a simple system? Or are we actually is actually all this disorder just noise driven? This is disordered, just noise-driven. So that's for the future, and I really don't have any idea the answer of those questions. Okay, thank you for your attention. Thank you very much, Anna. There are questions. It's very nice. It's like baby pipe flow, sort of. That's right. Can you do what Hopf, what Hopf does and locate the... Hop does and locate these unstable periodic curves using some kind of Newton's method in your lymph code. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's this edge tracking. You can do that. Then you do sort of bisection, really. You jump, you try, you perturb, you try, you try to find it, and then you bisect onto it. Shooting to hit the I think that's what they do essentially. But what you can do, interestingly, in the experiment is that you can use a, you know, so glorified fitting by a neural network. So if you have already a little So, if you have already a little bit of knowledge about these systems, you don't need much training to basically be able to map out the whole basin boundary of the unstable periodic orbit. So, that's been something we've done before. I was confused by your answer to Benny's question. So, let me explain my confusion. If I understand correctly, the lesson here, the big picture. The lesson here, the big picture, is it was a mistake to get to spend so much time looking only for steady solutions. Oh, yeah. Solutions that, I mean, so there are lots of things that look a bit like limit cycles. Maybe they are limit cycles. They come from unstable critical points, and all the complexity you see can be explained in many experiments by getting caught into one of these. Yeah. And it's a high. Yeah, and it's a high-dimensional system, but hop fabrication typically creates limit cycles if there's just a single pair of eigenvalues there. So, but then the time scale is just set by the time scale of the limit cycle, which depends how far you are from the bifurcation and will not easily be set by some simple dimensional analysis. Some simple dimensional analysis associated with hyperscale cycles. So I think you have to think that the time scale of the limit cycle doesn't really possibly matter so much here. I think what matters is the transient evolution time scale. And that will be set by the strength of the pressure perturbation that eventually drives, well, that will be actuated, if you like, maybe not set, but actuated by the sort of strength of pressure perturbations you have. Sort of strength of pressure perturbations you have in a system, yeah. Yeah, so it takes you time to get entrained by, yeah, and then it gets entrained, yeah. That's right. Okay, so I don't think that is, yeah, I don't think the limit cycle itself is a red herring. Yeah, yeah, that's right. There is a question in the back. Thank you. Um, this was really fascinating. Thank you for the talk. Um, I was curious, I know this is. Curious, I know this is very just basic curiosity talking. Um, is it possible to stabilize the unstable periodic orbits in the experiment somehow? Right, like for example, years ago when people did chaos control, they also tried to do this with like the Oddly Y method or something. So I have a colleague who's working on that, you see, and she using using she's using these bubbles because she's a mathematician and she's interested in Alice Thompson and she's interested in control-based continuation. And she is using this. And she is using this again. This system is a little bit of a playground, it's a bit of a test bed, if you like. And she's using that. And at the moment, she can stabilize static bubbles, but unstable static bubbles. But the aim is to go on and to do that. And I don't see why not. Yeah. I was curious, maybe on the is it possible in the experiment to also use these illumination or optical techniques, like optical tweezers or so, to push the tip of the To push the tip of the C2. It's like a control method. Yeah, I mean, that would be very interesting to think about experimentally because we're a bit rough and ready on the control side, and we basically just have injection holes. So we make a long channel and we put lots of injection holes and we inject with a pressure controller. So I suspect there are better and more elegant ways of doing this than what we do. More elegant ways of doing this than what we're doing, but I don't know. Yeah, okay. Serated rail, yeah. But the problem is: well, okay, yeah, you could do that for the control, but if you want to, so what we, you know, if you want to study the disorder, and that would be what comes next, you don't want to apply a perturbation all along. You want to apply a perturbation locally and see whether you can sustain that disorder. That's really for me the question. Yeah. Yeah. Just checking if there are any questions online, perhaps. Sorry, I don't know. Sure, they will speak up if they have. Okay. Are there any other questions here? Not done. Thank you very much, Alan.
