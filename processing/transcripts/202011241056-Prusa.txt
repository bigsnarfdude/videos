First, what I mean by stability. So, imagine that in your system you have a steady state and you introduce a perturbation. And if the steady state is stable, then the perturbation should decay in time and you will recover the steady state, right? So, this means that the two solutions that are starting from different initial conditions, they are approaching each other as They are approaching each other as time goes to infinity. So, just a warning: this is not the concept of continuous dependence of thermodynamical processes upon initial state and supply term. This is the thing that is used in the theory of hyperbolic systems. And there, the typical result is that the two solutions that are starting from two different initial conditions, they are diverging at most exponentially fast. So, here I want something. So, here I want something stronger. I want the solutions to approach a common limit. And of course, if you have such a physical system that looks stable, then the question is whether you can prove such a behavior from the governing equations. And preferably, you would like to use some thermodynamical concepts. Because when you are developing models, you always claim that the model is thermodynamically consistent and it makes it far superior. And it makes it far superior than other models. So you would like to use that hard work that was done in the derivation of the model in some qualitative analysis of the system. So I will show you that it's possible. So concerning stability, there are basically two types of systems. There are thermodynamically isolated systems and in these systems everything is easy, straightforward and boring. Easy, straightforward, and boring, right? So, isolated systems means that you have a fluid inside a vessel and there is no thermal energy exchange with the surrounding and no mechanical energy exchange with the surrounding. And what you expect if you have some flow inside such a vessel or deformation, whatever it is, as T goes to infinity, you will finally end up with a spatially homogeneous field. Spatially homogeneous fields, velocity will be equal to zero, and the temperature field will be constant in space. So regarding the application of thermodynamical methods in the stability analysis, in this simple case, everything is clear. All you have to do is to follow this quotation, right? So this comes from Clausius. So the energy of the world, world means The world means thermodynamically isolated system, right? So, this is the translation is constant, and the entropy of the world is rising, right? So, this vertical statement gives you a kind of first guess on what should be your Lyapunov functional in the system. So, your Lyapunov functional maybe is the entropy, the net entropy in the system. The net entropy in the system, and then you have to enforce all the constraints, right? So, the conservation of energy, constant mass in the case of polymerase, the number of polymeric particles, and so on and so on. And what is important here that this Lagrange multiplier here that is enforcing the conservation of energy is known to be one over temperature. And why it works? So, if you differentiate this thing. You differentiate this thing in time, then you know the entropy is rising, so minus entropy is decreasing, and this is constant. These are constant terms, so you get minus derivative of entropy, and this has a sign. So, this is a nice guess, but in practice, it can be quite complicated. But in recent years, we have spent a lot of time in identification of In identification of energy storage ability in materials and entropic production ability in materials, right? So we know for a wide class of viscoelastic rate type fluids, what should be there as the energy and what should be there as an entropy production. So some of these formulas were known before, and some of these formulas, especially for the viscolastic rate type fluid with stress diffusion, With the stress diffusion or some more exotic modulus, we have done it in our group, right? And well, how it is related to Professor Rajakopal, so he's the person who kind of suggested this approach, right? So every material is characterized by its energy storage ability and entropy production ability. And we know how to write down the entropy, the energy, and so on. So we can plug it into this function and we. Plug it into this function and we can try whether it works. So that's good, but in practice, you are not interested in thermodynamically isolated systems, right? So it makes no sense. So we are interested in systems that are allowed to interact with the surrounding. So what you can expect here, so you have thermodynamically open system. So this is the system where you have mechanical energy exchange with the surrounding and thermodynamic. And thermal energy exchanged with the surrounding. So you have some non-trivial flow pattern inside the vessel. And if you introduce a perturbation, basically two things can happen. The perturbation will die out and the original flow pattern is recovered. Or other scenario could be, okay, so if you introduce a perturbation, then the perturbation will grow in time. It somehow rearranges the flow in time. It somehow rearranges the flow in such a way that it sucks the energy from the outside environment and it has enough energy to change the flow pattern inside. And maybe a new steady pattern will emerge. So the typical examples here are Rayleigh-Bernard convection, Taylor-Couette flow, and so on. So the systems with external forcing. And the problem here from the thermodynamical perspective is that Is that you can't guarantee that the net entropy, so it means the entropy of the whole system is increasing because you have fluxes, right? So the system can throw the entropy away or it can transport the energy, the energy or entropy out from its surroundings inside to the system. And you have no a priori control on the fluxes. Control on the fluxes. So it means that the final point here that you have a conservation of energy and the entropy is rising in this thing, it won't work. But still, something can be done. This is a trick that was probably introduced in a rather cryptic form in this paper. So you can try to work with a fine correction of your function that works. Function that works for the spatially homogeneous steady state. So basically, if you know what is the right function for the spatially homogeneous steady state or for the thermodynamically isolated system, you can have a kind of guess what should be the right functional for the thermodynamically open system, what can work as a Lyapunov function there. And well, in practice, so the formula is here. So, again, if you know what is the internal energy in the system, what is the entropy, what are the entropy production processes, then you can take it and substitute it to this formula and you can check whether it works. And I will show you that it really works using, let's say, two case studies, right? So, in what follows. So, in what follows, I will always assume that I can work with a classical solution. It's a disclaimer, right? It will make things easier, but not too much. So, first case study is the problem of elastic turbulence. So, what it is, you have your polymer solution, and the polymer solution is placed in a gap between two plates. The top plate is rotating, and you have a flow pattern. And you have a flow pattern in between the plates. And what you observe in experiment is the following: right? So you will, the top plate will rotate rather slowly. So your Reynolds number will be 0.7, right? So very small. But still, you will see a kind of turbulent flow pattern. It has all the properties of turbulent flows, right? But at such a small Right, but at such a small Reynolds number, and the reason for that, why is it called elastic turbulence, is that the fluid in between two plates is not just an ordinary fluid, it's a polymeric solution. So it means it has some elastic response, right? And this elastic part of the polymer solution induces another non-interrate in the governing. Another nonlinearity in the governing equations, and the transition to turbulence is triggered by this new nonlinearity. It's not a nonlinearity that is measured by the Reynolds number, so it's not a convective term, but it's something else I will show you. Right, so let us assume that we have governing equations. It's not too much important what is here, but what is worth remembering is that your Cauchy stress is. That your Cauchy stress is now something that you are familiar with from Navier-Stokes, plus some extra part. And this extra part, this is a tensorial quantity, so matrix 3 times 3. And this matrix is governed by its own evolution equation. And in that evolution equation, this triangle, this is some operator, but the important thing here is that you have a non-linearity here, right? And in a Right, and in a sense, the strength of this non-linearity is measured by the Weissenberg number. This is the other dimensionless parameter that you have in the system. So, you can try to follow the guidelines or the ideas I have shown you. So, you know what is the Helmholtz free energy, you know what is the entropy production, you know everything. So, you can build your function. So, again, notation V hat, this is some notation. V hat, this is some non-trivial steady state. So you have some steady velocity field, this is spatially inhomogeneous, you have some spatially inhomogeneous distribution of that tensorial quantity d kappa p, and the tilde means perturbation. Right? And if you substitute into the formulas I've shown you, then the candidate for the Lyapunov function is this one. So regarding the velocity, it's the standard. The velocity, it's the standard thing, it's L2 norm of the velocity perturbation. But regarding the perturbation in that quantity b kappa p tilde, this is what you get is this expression, right? So this is positive and it vanishes if and only if B kappa P tilde is equal to zero, right? But it's not something like But it's not something like L2 norm of B kappa P tilde, right? So it's something much more complicated. And if you use this quantity and do the algebra, then you will end up with the following formula for the time derivative of that function. So what is shown in red are terms that are negative, right? And what is shown in black are terms that do not have sign a priori. But you see that you have. But you see that you are fine, right? So this is quadratic in the perturbation, this is in a velocity, this is quadratic in that quantity B kappa P, and these are just, let's say, products of B kappa P and D tilde, right? So if you are lucky, if these terms are strong enough, so it means if Reynolds number is small enough and Weissenberg number is small enough, you can absorb these terms into the negative terms and you are done. Terms and you are done. So this was the derivative and there's another important ingredient here in this business. If you want to use this quantity that is shown here as a Lyapunov functional, you need a relation between this expression and a kind of distance in the state space. And what is another important ingredient is that you have to define the Ingredient is that you have to define the distance in a convenient way. And in this setting, what is important is that this quantity B kappa P, so this is the quantity that is governed by this evolution equation, it's a symmetric positive definite matrix. So you need to use this piece of information in your definition of the distance to equilibrium, right? So if you have two positive definite matrices, symmetric positive definite matrices, Metric positive definite matrices. There are several ways how to define the distance between these matrices. And if you choose the right one, well, so we were lucky, so this one worked, right? That's all I can say about it. So but uh you are exploiting kind of structural property that is behind the equations, right? So f using this concept of distance it really works as a Lyapunov function. It really works as a Lyapunov function. So, just the results for Taylor-Couette flow. So, this is this setting. We are able to show that if you are in a safe range of parameters, Reynolds-Weissenberg, that if we are here, then any initial perturbation will decay to zero. So, we'll recover the steady solution. It's just a sufficient condition so far. So, this is one case study. Another one is, let's say, Let's say boring from the physical point of view, but maybe more interesting from the mathematical point of view. So, this is a problem of a vessel with walls kept at non-uniform temperature. So, we know what to do in isolated vessels. So, if you have no heat exchange, so zero Neumann boundary condition and zero mechanical energy exchange, then what you expect. Then, what you expect, and you have a fluid inside such a vessel, so what you expect at the long time behavior will be the zero velocity field and a spatially homogeneous temperature field. So, that's it. First, open system is very simple. So, you still have no mechanical energy exchange, so you expect that the velocity will decay to zero, but now you will have the reflect data for temperature, right? So, we are not controlling. So, we are not controlling fluxes, we are controlling just the temperature, but the temperature is spatially homogeneous. So, this is just a number. So, this is called thermal bath. And in this case, again, the expected long-time limit is that the velocity is equal to zero and temperature is spatially homogeneous because it's compatible with this boundary condition. And now, slightly more general setting is the same thing. Is the same thing, but now the temperature on the boundary is spatially inhomogeneous. This is a function of position. And here, the expected long time limit is zero velocity again, but the temperature field will be spatially inhomogeneous. It will be a solution of steady heat equation. So, if the fluid inside is just the standard Navier-Stokes fluid, so these are the governing equations, these are the boundary conditions. These are the boundary conditions. And this is the steady state, so zero velocity. And the temperature is a solution to the steady heat equation, right? So this spatially inhomogeneous data. And what you expect is that if you perturb this state, then arbitrary perturbation should decay to zero, right? So V tilde and theta tilde should go to zero. And the point is that if you are not able Is that if you are not able to show that this follows from the governing equation, this is such a simple system, then if you are not able to show that, then probably you can't do anything sensible with the governing equations. So where's the problem? Regarding the velocity, it's easy, right? So it's known from the 50s even earlier. So you test formally by the velocity field, and you will get this evolution equation. You will get this evolution equation for the velocity, and you know that the velocity decays. Regarding the temperature, the situation is much more complex or much more difficult because the thing that helps you to kill the kinetic energy appears as a source in the equation for the temperature, right? So the kinetic energy disappears, but it not disappears, but it's converted to the thermal energy. It to the thermal energy. So you have a source here, and you don't know when and where the source is triggered. You don't know the fluxes through the boundary. If the velocity is small, then it's not true. The D is small. So all kinds of problems. So in principle, you want a method where you should use just this piece of information, right? So the amount of dissipated energy, of dissipated kinetic energy is five. Dissipated kinetic energy is finite, nothing more. Well, in this simple case, you can do something, but imagine that for our complex fluids, for viscoelastic fluids, instead of just 2 mu dd, you have something more complex, right? So there is no hope to do something with this one, except that it has a sign. And now another question is how to measure. Another question is how to measure the size of the temperature perturbation. So, again, the L2 norm of temperature perturbation is not a good idea, right? Because the evolution equation for the temperature perturbation is this one. So, this is fine, this is fine, but you have no control on this one, right? So, the temperature perturbation could be both positive and negative, so you don't have the sign and you can't get an uh bound on this one. Bound on this one. But still, you can show something. What I will show you is that you can get this result. So this is kind of, let us think that this is a convex function in theta tilde divided by theta hat in a point-wise sense. So this goes to zero. And from this, you can conclude that the relative entropy goes to zero in any LP space. So I will show you later. You later how to do this. So, the critical point here is the following lemma, right? So, assume that you know that you have a function that has a finite integral from t 0 to infinity, and you want to show that the limit of that function y is 0. So, this is not possible because the counterexample is, for example, something like this one. So, that's fine, but if you add But if you add something to this, if you kind of add a condition that does not allow the thin peaks to build up, then this one plus this one implies this behavior, this limit behavior. So you can turn the crank and you will substitute to the functional, and what you will get is something like this. So this is your functional. So, this is your functional. You should investigate. This follows from thermodynamics. The troublemaker term now disappears in a sense that it has a sign here. So, okay, fine, it's negative. Maybe even we can't exploit this one, but who cares? Because we can work with this one. And now the only problem is to find a match between the right-hand side here and the expression that... The expression that appears in the formula for the Lyapunov function. So you must have the same quantity on the left and the right-hand side. So now this is a little bit tricky. So basically what you will exploit is the fact that the stability should not depend on the choice of temperature scale. If you are using Kelvins, you should get the same result. If you are using degrees Celsius, you should get the same result. You should get the same result, and another temperature scale will also work. So it leads you to the following renormalization, if you want, of the evolution equation for the temperature. It's kind of crazy algebraic manipulation, but it works. And you will get the whole family of functionals, and you can combine them. And if you combine them, you will get this quantity, and this is perfect. Will get this quantity, and this is perfect for the lemma I have shown you. So, you can conclude that this goes to zero, and this also implies that the relative entropy, so this is this thing with logarithm here, it goes to zero in L P space, any L P space. So, conclusion, so well, there's a thermodynamic framework for stability analysis of open systems, and I guess that I have shown you that it works in a relatively It works in relatively complex settings for incompressible viscoelastic ray type fluids. And that's it.
