Naomi and all the organizers. I've only arrived yesterday, but already noticed it's a really beautiful place. And yeah, thanks for bringing all of us together. Okay, so I'll be a little bit more on the phenomenological science and basically try to give you a little bit of an idea that accents, even if you already, well, if you are optimistic and have already discovered them, that they actually. Have already discovered them, that they actually are a wonderful tool, perhaps, to learn more both about the universe but also about the potential underlying theorem. And I guess that's a little bit of what this workshop is about. And for that, also brought this kind of background picture. It's already, well, not quite a year, but a bit more than half a year old. You see this grazing in the background. This is an This is how I saw it with my eyes, but if you have the right tools, and that's kind of the point, it actually looks like this. So these were actually Northern lights visible in Germany happens every 20 years or so last May. And you can see this was just a mobile phone picture. You can see a lot more than with your eyes. I wasn't sure that it's m northern lights just by eye. Northern lights just by eye. Anyway, okay. Um, so just to get started, let me just um kind of recap a little bit the axions and its alps. I'm not going to recap the axion in a sense, but just to get on the same page. The axion and Alps have a typical Lagrangian that contains the typical kinetic term, a mass term, and for And for our purposes here, couplings to photons, so two-photon coupling, couplings to gluons, and potentially coupling to standard fermions. And one part of the important information is that here, in all these couplings, you have information on the underlying theory at potentially very, very high energy. Just to see how this works, for example. Just to see how this works, for example, in the QCD axiom, you have a calculation for the photon coupling, which tells you that it's connected, of course, to the fine structure constant, and it's connected to the underlying scalar spontaneous symmetry breaking. So if that is very high, you get a very small couple. So if we are able, and this is the power of low energy experiments that we'll explore a little bit in the following, if we're able to probe a very weak coupling, you can also. Very weak coupling, you can already get access to very high underlying physics scales. Since having access to weak and tiny effects gives you access to very deep underlying physics. And the other thing is, here you have a coefficient, and this is, in this case, the electromagnetic anomaly, and this contains information about charges, for example, of the heavy particles that contribute in the detection. Particles that contribute and that appear in the axiom models. And these charges are of particles that again have masses of z order. And in this case, there's also a QCD contribution. And as the fits QCD, this has, of course, an error. And it's not just theoretical, this is really kind of an extraction error of QCD quantities. It's just funny that this coefficient that comes from QCD, well, might actually Well, might actually be compatible with two within the measurement uncertainty and the theory extraction uncertainty. Anyway, okay. The bottom line, you always have the structure coupling over FA. All these couplings are suppressed by the scale of underlying symmetry breaking. So again, small couplings for large underlying symmetry breaking. Symmetry breaking. And of course, you can have your typical pictures for photon, luon, and fermion couples. Okay, this is a kind of typical parameter space, as probably most of you have already kind of seen. You have the logarithm of the mass here, so plenty orders of magnitude. I could even extend it a few more. So it's more biased, at least. More biased, at least in my plots, towards lower masses, so sub-electron bulk masses, but you can have larger masses as well. And here you have the coupling, in this case the photon coupling, so it's roughly one over FA, and it comes with this unit of inverse GDP. And the QCD axion lives in the hatched band, so it can live anywhere. Just select your spontaneous symmetry breaking scale, but the mass is fixed. But the bus is fixed by a relation with QCT. That makes it QCT-laxion. But of course, you can have axion-like particles which live all over this place. And I'm sure you'll have more string models, but just if you put in something kind of with a typical symmetry breakage scale, you get something nice in this region here. And this, of course, has to be contrasted. And this, of course, has to be contrasted with experimental sensitivities of various types. And we'll come to, well, in particular, briefly, the haloscope searches, but there are other things going on there. The point is, the experiments can actually reach into both the QCD axion band, but also deeply into this axion-like particle space and explore symmetry breaking scales of the order of 10 to the 12 G. Of the order of 10 to the 12 G. So, this is really where the power of this experimental observation comes from. Okay, one of the most powerful things is actually to have these axons or axon-like particles as dark matter. And in this sense, I think this was in part even the original idea of the axiverse by Azimina when it was automatically dark matter in some sense. Matter in some sense, and so this probably fits very well in this workshop. I'm just giving you the kind of reasons why, of course, axons are the best dark matter candidates. I probably don't need to convince you, but you have standard model problems. They are dark and cold because they are super weakly interacting. They are produced in the early universe automatically by the misalignment mechanism. So, this is really hard to achieve. And so this is really hard to apply for very light bosons, in particular scalar bosons. The scale makes sense, that's probably something that we'll explore in the course of this workshop. And I'll focus a little bit on these last three or more on the last two. They're testable in actually realistic and ongoing experiments. And I think we'll hear explicitly about experiments on Thursday and by Gray. And by Gray, but I'll talk a little bit about what they can tell us about astrophysics and cosmology on the one side, but also potentially as a probe of the deep UV physics. So, what can we learn beyond an initial discovery? So, what kind of information can we was trying, perhaps? And of course, what's there to do? So, this in a sense is a little bit the focus for today. Okay, so just Just one quick reminder here. So, if you take standard QCD axion, dark matter lives typically in this yellow circled area, whereas ALP dark matter can live anywhere in this red colored region here, which is essentially just constrained by some very mild constraints from, on the one hand, experiments and lifetime, so after all, your dark matter candidate should survive until today. Survive until today, and arguably particles can decay to two photons. And on the other hand, do I get enough to fulfill all the dark matter observed in the universe? So this is a mild constraint on the production. If you really wish to, you can probably push things into a larger area. But then needs typically some slightly model dependencies. So the simple models live in this kind of reddish area here. Okay. Okay, so let me briefly go into the detection. You'll probably hear much more about this by Grain on Thursday, but I would like to highlight a couple of things that allow you to actually go and see perhaps even something beyond a discovery or what we can learn beyond an initial discovery. So, this is admittedly second-order speculation, then already, but I guess that's what we're here for. Anyway, so So the good news, if axions or Alps are the dark matter, experiments become a lot easier because you have a plentiful source of axions all around you. Because just imagine you have a typical axion of about a microelectron volt. The dark matter density around here is about 300 mega electron volt per cubic centimeters. So you have something of the So you have something of the order of 10 to the 14, 10 to the 15 axions per cubic centimeter, and that's already something that you don't need to make. So they are available for your detection. And then the trick of one class of typical experiments is to provide a magnetic field. And due to the two photon interactions, axons come in, interact with the magnetic field, and convert into a photon. And the photons have all the same energy. And the photons have all the same energy because they have the energy inherited from the axon. The magnetic field doesn't contribute. And therefore, they essentially have all the same energy because they are non-relativistic. So the energy is given by the mass. And because they have all the same energy, they have the same frequency. So you can amplify this conversion by using a resonator. And this works out also in practice. It's even better because. In practice, it's even better because for these microelectron volt masses, the frequency is in the gigahertz range, or hundreds of megahertz. And that's an ordinary macroscopic kind of resonator type that you can put into a magnetic field and for which you have nice technology to detect it. And again, you will probably hear more about that. And the signal is something that you can easily scan and explore in frequency. And exploring frequency. That's already an important point. But this is essentially radio frequency technology. This is a frequency on your ordinary radius. So you can actually take a spectrum and the standard signal of this spectrum is indeed a very narrow peak because all the axons have the energy essentially given by the mass plus a little bit of kinetic energy. And the kinetic energy of course causes a little bit of the width, but Little bit of the width, but it's of the order of 10 to the minus 6 because the velocity of dark matter around us is of the order of 10 to the minus 3. And this is just the ordinary non-relativistic one-half mv squared energy. Okay, so this is an extremely sensitive probe, as you can see here. This is even an old picture, but the important point goes down to this 10 to the minus 15 couplings. So this corresponds to an underlying. So, this corresponds to an underlying scale of about 10 to the minus 12. And just don't forget, alpha over 4π is actually a small number, it's 10 to the minus 3. Okay, and yeah, we'll hear more about this, but ADMX, for example, in Washington, is exploring this part of the parameter space. But there are many more. Just to get started early in the morning, this is also a very green thing. This is also a very green thing to do. This is why it's a green slide. Because I'm not sure if you have noticed what we are doing here is we are taking dark atom and making electricity from it. Quite literally so. And you can now calculate a little bit, it's super sustainable. The perhaps surprising number actually is that the dark matter power through one The dark matter power through one square meter, flowing through one square meter, is of the order of ten watts. It's microscopic. So the power, if you were to convert all oxygens into photons, is better than what you usually harvest in link power. So it's actually not bad. Actually, even a bit more, depending on what kind of numbers you put. And of course, it lasts essentially forever until we have destroyed the galaxy. There's a little engineering problem left, but I'll leave that to May. At the moment, conversion is a little bit lacking. The probability of conversion is in the 10 to the minus 20 something range. So you get our 10 to the minus 23 watts. But that's not because it's not going through, you're converting only a tiny, tiny fraction. So in that sense, yeah, still just enhancing. Still, just enhance a little bit your magnetic field. You just need these kind of slightly space-bending magnetic fields of roughly, I think, the energy densities of the order of the QCT scale in your magnetic field. When you, at least with current technology, go to probability of war. Anyway, but for the future. Anyway, so as I mentioned, there are many, many more experiments. Sorry, there's a question. Could you? Sorry, could you um specify just a bit more where the bounds come from on the frequency range that you just discussed in these uh these axiom photon um detection? Ah yeah. Let me actually. Yeah. Um so let me actually use this slide, immediately. So it depends what what you want to do. For the QCD axiom, the frequency is always given by the mass. For any axiom or axiom-like particle, the frequency Any axion or axion-like particle, the frequency at which you want to detect is the mass. And the mass for the QCD axion is given by a linear relation between the mass and one over the coupling section, or the coupling, one over FA. And the QCD action sits on this band here. And there's a region roughly around here where you typically produce enough dark matter. That is kind of a preferred region where you without. Of a preferred region value. Without any tuning of parameter, you get roughly the right amount of parameter. That's why, for example, ADMX, but also many of these other experiments focus on this area over here. Technically, the frequency that you explore in an experiment is given typically, for example, by the frequency of the resonator. And that is actually one of the big challenges of the experiments, because if you have a Because if you have a resonator, it's only sensitive at this frequency, because only then you're resonantly enhancing it. So, what you have to do is you have to measure, tune your frequency, measure again, and do so many, many times. And you're always only exploring the region that is basically within the width of your resonator. And it's typically quite small. So, you need something like 10 to the 5 steps, maybe 10 to the 6th step, to scan a factor. Sixth step to scan a factor of two in masses. And this is why these sensitivities typically look like these fingers. They're going very deep, but typically only in a certain mass dimension. Some of these experiments, and I'll come to one suggestion, they are not using resonances and therefore are broadband, but of course this has its own challenges. But basically the region here, people have tried to cover as much To cover as much as possible of the reasonable parameter space using different techniques. How can the fingers go even deeper? Why don't you go through the pen? I mean, there's still like a little telepathy. I said to Grey, the problem is really the power. If you have talked about that. I'll talk about that. At some point, you have, whatever, one photon per hour, and these are wimpy microwave photons. So very hard to detect, and a lot of Very hard to detect and a lot of background potential. What makes the width? Maybe a great discussion: what makes the width of the yellow so yellow. No, no, not of the fingers. This is a rough indication, going back briefly. Exactly. So it's a rough indication of the range of available kind of electromagnetic anomalies. In principle, if you are creative with your model building, you can make it much wider. But this is a trick. Can make it much wider. But this is a typical kind of scan over a range of reasonable markets. I'm worried because you know people always, I mean, once such detection environments work and the kingdoms become deeper and deeper, people who start making models say, oh, it's still not excluded because you can still have a band. It's kind of boring a little bit. Absolutely. You can get a couple things close to zero if E over N is equal to minus 1.92. Okay, of course, yeah. And Seth Ruth and Vaishak Blackout scanned all the representations of the standard model that you could put axial like particles into for up to two fermions or something like this. And you can get a statistical range of that E over N. And that's what the shading in the band is. It actually shades the probability of models for certain representations in the standard model. Shading is a scale. Yeah, so it's this particular problem. So in this particular plot, it's probably representing the gut feeling. It was good feeling previously, but 75% of the other persons. But there is, of course, also the nasty possibility. You see here this error. Within two sigmas, the QCD stuff is compatible with two. And two is some achievable number with integers. So nature could be very unkind here. But yeah, let's hope for discovery. Exclusion is always harder. Okay. Very good. Okay, so this brings me already, I should already speed up, to one thing that you can do already beyond an initial discovery, and one of the amazing things. Initial discovery, and one of the amazing things is you can do that possibly very soon after an initial discovery in the dark matter expert. It's something like in each of these measurements with a resonator, you spend maybe a few minutes. But if you measure for a day after a discovery, you get a lot of resolution and a lot of information from it. And the point is that if you measure a little bit longer, you can have a high-resolution picture of this little Of this little peak here, and this picture tells you something. Because what you can actually study is this kind of peak, and this is a more realistic simulation of a signal done by Ben Safdi and company. You can actually really measure the kinetic energy distribution of the dark matter in our gas. So you're really measuring the kinetic energy distribution. You already have an infrared. We can already have information and possibly with very high resolution of how fast dark matter particles are moving about us. And this tells us something quite a bit about the galaxy formation, for example. For example, if you had a late merger with some clump going through us, you would have a very high, narrow peak or some structure like this. And so in that sense, you can get high-resolution information. High resolution information on the velocity distribution. This is something, yeah, you measure a day afterwards. You can potentially go even more if you take networks or potentially some suitably shaped cavities. You can measure not just the kinetic energy distribution, but potentially also the direction. So, if you do interferometry with several cavities, you can do resolution of the full vectorial velocity distribution. Full vectorial velocity distribution. And indeed, I'll just give you one idea that is also a different type of experiment that allows you to do exactly that as well. So this is an alternative kind of dark matter search experiment, which is a dark matter antenna. And the idea there is basically in a magnetic field, the axion essentially Essentially converts into photons, but it looks essentially like an oscillating electric field. And if you have an oscillating electric field that you provide something like a metal surface, the electron starts to oscillate. And that means the electrons emit electromagnetic radiation and it's typically perpendicular to the surface. And for this, you don't need a resonance, you just make it bigger. Very simple, but you have to work on the sensitivity. You have to work on the sensitivity. So you have to make some compromises. And people are working on that. And show you some pictures. So, this was one without magnets, so it doesn't work for axons. But just to give you an idea, people are actually building these things. So this has been built actually not far from Heidelberg in Karlsruhe. And you can take a big mirror and look actually not in the focal point, you look in the center of a spherical mirror. But different from ordinary objects. Different from ordinary objects. Anyway, but the point I want to make in terms of beyond discovery physics is the emission is perpendicular if your velocity of the dark matter is zero. If it's non-zero, you get emission at an angle. And that's easy to understand because it's just momentum conservation. In this direction, in the direction of the plane of your mirror, you have breaking of translation invert. Breaking of translation invariance, but in the parallel one you have conservation of um translation invariance and conservation of momentum. And that's why basically the angle is just given by the velocity of the dark matter. And then if you take instead of a point-like detector, you take a screen which has some pixels, you again get a two-dimensional picture of the velocity distribution. This is the type of things that you can hope to measure. Okay, then, and this. Okay, then, and this is the more modern incarnations, you can also do that with cool geometries. So instead of having one big plate which you hardly fit into a strong magnet, you can create some cool geometry. So this is a Brad experiment, which actually has this kind of conical mirror. I'm not sure, I only discovered that after seeing this paper, but many lamps actually have this. This paper, but many lamps actually have these things. So, this is just kind of, if you go outside, many of the kind of street light type things have such a reflectance. This is not something crazy, but it fits much better into magnetic field. Much more efficient, so to speak. You can also do several kind of conversion or reflection layers. It's not really, you don't want full reflections, but you can actually use dielectric. Actually, use dielectrics that has essentially the same effect, and then you can play a little bit with interference and you can enhance the sensitivity. Play a little bit of a game between ah, not quite resonant, but also not quite non-resonant, and that allows you to actually again go into the QC maximum. But all these experiments allow to some degree for this kind of velocity distribution exploration, to some degree. Exploration to some degree. Okay. So far, we've talked about the photon coupling. You may also want to know: does this also work for other couples? Because those might be interesting as well. And one important coupling in this regard is a coupling to gluons. Because actually, only if you discover a gluon coupling, you are entirely convinced it's a QCB axiom. Because this is really the defining feature. This is really the defining feature of a QCD axiom that it couples to humans. So, this is something that you would like to have and to measure. And this is something that, for example, the so-called Casper experiment does. The idea is to actually fairly back to the roots because the theta parameter of QZ, which is essentially a constant over here, creates an electric dipole. Creates an electric dipole moment of the neutron. Now, if that is determined by the coupling times the field, well, theta is something like A over F A. So the field value at some given time sets the electric dipole moment. And if you have dark matches, the field value is non-zero and it oscillates. So you have an oscillating electric dipole moment of the order, well, this is again where it's challenging, 10 to the minus 30. Challenging, 10 to the minus 35 electron charge times centimeters. Very tiny, but these people actually believe they can potentially measure. The trick to do that is, roughly speaking, also a kind of NMR or nuclear magnetic resonance type experiment. You have your dipole moment in a certain direction. This is aligned to the spin. Then you put on an electric field. On an electric field, and then you have a torque that tilts your spin in a certain direction. And if you do it right, you switch on also a magnetic field that compensates for the oscillation of the electric dichromo, because if you just wait for it to grow while it's oscillating, well, the torque flips back and forth and you get net zero effect. But if you now oscillate your spin by presenting. Your spin by processing it around a magnetic field and you are in resonance, then you can get an effect that always goes in the same direction. And you tilt your spins into a certain plane, and they oscillate and kind of rotate, and then you measure the magnetic field. And now you can wonder: can I still see something of this kind of velocity? Well, the bottom line is. The bottom line is: yes, you can at least measure the velocity squared distribution by looking at the power spectrum of your rotating magnetic field. So that actually works as well. And you can probably do that at least in some range of frequencies. Okay, this is kind of astrophysical information. But perhaps you want to be really ambitious, you want to know actually if what Actually, if what you discovered is actually C dark matter and not just some per middle fraction of the dark matter. And why would you ask this question? Well, once we have a signal, we actually don't know whether it's all of dark matter or just a fraction, because what you measure, as in nearly all dark matter experiments, you measure a product of the density and some power of a coupling. Power of a couple. And you can always place those two against each other. And then, yeah, you have a degeneracy. So, can we disentangle those? And let me just sketch to you two ways, one where we need to be a little bit lucky, and one where we need to be, let's say, ambitious and rich. So if we are lucky, so what can you do? In some axial scenarios, In some axial scenarios, so if the symmetry is broken after inflation, you generically form so-called mini-clusters. These are very over-dense structures and basically kind of clump-like objects that fly and contribute to the dark matter. Could be a relatively high fraction of the dark matter that is in these mini clusters. So, this is kind of a picture. So this is kind of a picture. The point is that these mini clusters, because of the wave-like nature of the axions, they actually have a slightly non-homogeneous structure. They oscillate in time. Just when you have positive, negative wave interference, you have this kind of interference pattern. You have a slightly non-human. Why do you need that to be, or you need the V-solution to be up to? And because if it's before, and you need. Before, your initial value will be the same all over the observable universe. And then it's completely homogeneous. Whereas after inflation, you roll down in your potential in different causally connected regions into different axial values. You get strings absorbed. You get strings, and you get really odd one density fluctuations. And those odor one density fluctuations form the minus. These are like they're like relics of the decay of the string memory. They're like relics of the decay of the string that point. Yeah. So they impart the decays, but even if you really don't know the pulsing negative for these losses. I don't think you need the strengths. Just imagine you have many causally disconnected regions and they have different initial field values for the axon. So in one it's essentially zero, in the other it's one. The horizon grows, so they can cause the contact direction. Caused in contact direction. But here you have a much higher density than here. Because your initial field value was much larger. And at some point, typically in the matter-dominated area, those regions with large field values and high overdensities, they decouple from the general expansion because their self-gravity is bigger than the expansion driving it apart, and that's when they basically become a cluster. They basically become a cluster. So, this happens typically just after matter domination sets off. So, basically, they are structures that decouple from the expansion. The other case where instatomogeneous structure formation is not strong enough to produce any spike structure. So, there you have only the 10 to the minus 5 density fluctuations. But for structures to grow, I mean, in principle, you could have. Yes, but not so much. So, these are all, so in contrast to the 10 to the minus 5, these are older one initially. To minus 5, these are order 1 initial. So they are really big. They are actually dangerous isocurvature, but on a scale that you can't observe. Because isocurvature is super constrained, but only on very large scales. And these objects are on the order of, say, astronomical units. They're solar system size. They're tiny. Something that you can't really observe. Okay. And this is essentially the horizon scale at the QCD phase. Horizon scale at the QCD phase transition. So there's a large variation there? There is some variation, but it's not super huge. It's a few orders of magnitude, depending on your axial mass and a few details. Okay. So now this is where you have to be lucky. Let's say we fly through a mini cluster with our experiment. And it's tuned at the right moment in the right way. Of course, if you have discovered it before, you'll set up your experiment. It before you set up your experiments in the right way. And now you can measure your spectrum at different points going through this mini cluster. So you always measure it when you fly through like this. You measure it here, here, here, here, at several points. And the bottom line is you can do that very precisely because the density is very high, the signal is big, and then but the the mini cluster has a much more limited velocity spectrum. More limited velocity spectrum. After all, everything has to be bound to this mini cluster. And that means the escape velocity is actually quite small. And this is essentially given by the potential inside the cluster at your given point. That's the escape velocity. And the gravitational potential. And you can then basically determine that the width of your spectrum for your axions is essentially proportional to the mass times the essential. Proportional to the mass times the escape velocity times the velocity with which you fly through the cluster. And that means from the width, you can determine the potential at the point at which you are in the cluster. It's really the gravitational potential of the cluster. So you can map out the potential as you fly through the cluster. And then it's a simple exercise of using the Poisson equation to essentially relate the potential to Relate the potential to the density, and since you know the signal power, yeah, now you have independent measurement of signal power and can get your coupling. And at that point, you just wait and measure a little bit later outside the cluster. And if your density outside the cluster is of the order of what you expect locally, then I would say you declare that you have it. You declare that you have at least found most of them. Is this also for many custom title screens? And much less overdensed because they're extended, but much more likely to be in the very good question. This is the two caveats. You need to be lucky, they're not that abundant, even if you assume that they're a sizable fracture. And at least the way we have calculated it, we have assumed it's not destroyed. But this is. But this is an oversimplification, I have to admit. I think what you would want to calculate is you would want to simulate the cluster or whatever initial tidal stream you have as it comes close to Earth, and in particular the Sun. I think the Sun is more dangerous, and see how it differs. But this requires some very hard cross-semalizationizing. And then you would have to carefully try to, in a sense, kind of solve inverse. Kind of solves inverse problems. So I think there's still quite a bit of a challenge involved. Yeah. Does the argument imply that QCD axion is 10% of dark matter or 50% of dark matter? You don't know. I think at that point you would definitely find, so if, again, if you find a cluster, you would find that this is much smaller, so this density that you observe when you're outside the cluster, it's much smaller than what you expect for it. It's much smaller than what you expect for your local density. After all, you have a decently precise information, maybe within a factor of two, of what you expect in our location of the galaxy in terms of density. It's not super precise, I would say, in a factor of two. And if you find a tense, then you would start wondering, oh, probably some problem. It's not a super hard information. A hard information. Yeah. So, isn't there already another degeneracy here? Because, in order to be able to say that this particular gravitational interaction has led to a breaking of the degeneracy, I also have another degeneracy, which is to say that I need to know exactly how the, let's say, the Earth. Or what's the exact potential felt by the actual things like the sign and moon or something? Um there is some issues with regards to that, that's why I said you need some simulation. But in general you have so if you if you assume for example the straight path so what we have fitted for example is both the velocity with which you cross the cluster as well as the impact parameter for example. So you you can extract from the evolution of the spectrum some information on the paths. But admittedly there is potential for Potential for extra degeneracy, and you need to find out how many measurements you can do to resolve all of them. But for simpler assumptions, for us, it worked. But it's an oversimplified assumption, I should say. Question was about this complication of one in every thousand years of fine-tuned clusters. How has that been? That's fairly straightforward. You say you assume that 50% of dark matter. You assume that 50% of dark matter is in mini-clusters. You know the typical mass of the mini-cluster and the typical size. And then you just calculate what is the cross-section to have an impact parameter that allows you to do this detection. The cluster can also be moving in it? Yeah, we have zoomed to be moving. Yeah, we have a zoomed. Again, simple. Yeah, but yeah, you probably can move on a more complicated trajectory in the vicinity of the sun than near C. Okay, so now let's work a little bit harder and then we don't need too many assumptions because the golden way to actually measure something independent of the density of dark matter is to do a purely laboratory-based experiment. And one option is a light shining through wall experiment. Oh, I should rush. Oh, I should rush. Okay. So, this is a standard experiment, one of which the so-called ALPS II experiment is currently being done at DZ in Hamburg. And the idea is simply, you make your own axons. You take a laser, interact it with a magnetic field, axons are produced, make it through a wall, another magnetic field, and out come some photons that you can detect. Photons that you can detect. And this doesn't require any assumptions about dark matter or anything. The probability to see something, you can easily calculate it, and it only depends on the coupling and the parameters of your experiment. The downside is it's the fourth power of the coupling. Before it was a second power, now it's a fourth power. Coupling is small, so it's painful. So, where are we? Alps to the Sea, that's the kind of most advanced option that people are currently building and imagining, is going to cover this orange area. And that doesn't quite reach into the QCD axiom yet. So, there are a few orders of sense of magnitude to go, and remember it's coupling here. And the experimental pain goes with coupling to the four. Experimental pain goes with coupling to the force power. So, you want to make it down here. So, what can you do? Well, you can first, because that's the good thing, the length seems to go exactly with the coupling, so you just make it longer. But if you make it longer, something funny happens. You follow, at best, in terms of so you go down in coupling, but the mass reach. But the mass reach decreases and decreases and decreases. And that's because, as you use this experiment, you use that the photon and the axion wave have to be in phase. And a mass kind of changes phase relation for the axion because it's not massless anymore and they move out of phase. The more mass you have, the faster you get out of phase. And alternatively, it's a question of how long can you build your experiments before you use it. You build your experiments before you're too sensitive. This is kind of the problem. Making it longer actually typically doesn't get you into this kind of preferred QCD Arxional range. But now you can play a little bit of a game. You can actually start optimizing your magnet configuration. What I've assumed so far for this line is just one big fat long magnet. Or all of them in the same direction. Of them in the same direction. But you can simply alternate the magnetic field direction, and that essentially adds a little bit of momentum to your axon and changes the phase relation. You can correct the phase again. And then you get this kind of orange area here. You get this little finger where you have significantly enhanced sensitivity, way beyond this line over here. And now the problem would be: okay, these are two. Would be okay. These are literally magnets with tons of weight, and rearranging them quickly is not an option, and you would always get sensitivity in a tiny region. So this is why this is slightly beyond discovery physics, because if you now have a discovery in a dark matter experiment, the dark matter experiment immediately tells you the mass, because you have tuned your resonator for us. Because you have tuned your resonator, for example. You know with 10 to the minus 6 or more precision the mass of your axion. And then you just build the configuration exactly to fit this setup. And you can do that with a 10 to the minus 10 accuracy. And if you do that, you can cover, with some ambitious experiment, you can cover a sizable region of the preferred QCT axon parameter space. And parameters. One has to be seriously ambitious. These are hundreds of kilometers in magnet lengths. Roughly speaking, at that point, you have to worry about Earth's curvature because you want a really straight line. And you also want to worry, if you towel too deep, it's getting hot down there. But it's doable, you know? Not completely ridiculous. Completely ridiculous. You can estimate the cost. At least at present, technology and the kind of more extreme options would be a few hundred giga Euros. But again, if you know your mass and you know already a lower limit on the coupling because you have an expectation what is a kind of density of dark matter around here and that gives you a lower limit. Around here, and that gives you a lower limit on the coupling. So you can pick and build the cheapest experiment, and that can easily reduce the cost by a couple of orders of magnitude by just building it just so that it can see what you expect from your dark matter discovery. Then you again resolve this kind of degeneracy. Okay. How many time do I have left? Minus five minutes. Time to have left? Minus five minutes? Well, we can go up to ten. Okay, okay. Let me skip. You could measure the sun's temperature with actions, that's funny. But let me actually do one more thing that might be of interest here. You can do a bit of a combination of theory and astrophysics to learn more about Axel models that you actually see in. You actually see in an experiment. But let me just go one step back. One other experiment that is independent of dark matter is the so-called helioscope, where you produce your axions in the Sun, and then it's like a big light shining through a wall experiment with everything between us and the Sun's core basically being the wall. You basically point a big magnet onto the Sun. And And um oops. Oops. Yeah. Okay. Again, if you have now you look at your sun, oxygens come into your experiment, you convert them, you can see them. This actually works at relatively high oxygen masses, whereas dark matter experiments are usually a bit harder. But importantly, you can predict. Importantly, you can predict and measure the spectrum of the axions that are expected to come from the sun. It's to a large degree a thermal spectrum, but it depends a little bit on the production mechanism of your axons. It depends, in particular, whether it's the axions are coupled to electrons, because then you have Brems-Trahlung emission, which is typically a little bit softer. You have a lower energy spectrum. You have a lower energy spectrum, but you can also have these two-photon fusion processes which give you an oxygen, which is typically a little bit more energetic. And combining this with the reaction of the experiment in terms of the mass, you can actually pin down essentially, for example, the photon coupling versus the mass for some benchmark. Versus the mass for some benchmark scenarios. Here's put in some benchmark scenarios. And you see, with decent, with existing technologies, you can roughly kind of constrain these areas. And the point is, these kind of purplish lines, these are actually typical axion models. These are typical values of E over N for simple axion models, for a bunch of reasonable. Axon models, for a bunch of reasonable but simple axon models. And you can see you have enough sensitivity to discriminate actually between different lines. So you can actually pin down the charges to some degree, or at least the electromagnetic anomaly, of your heavy particles in your axamall. It depends, of course, where you are. By the way, the width is a combination of the acuity uncertainty as well as the solar uncertainty. as well as the solar uncertainty. So the Q C D uncertainty in some regions gets actually sizable. So perhaps you could add a little bit of information there. But bottom line is in some region you can actually make a model kind of discrimination. Okay here it's actually a bit better resolved just to give you some idea. So the different purple and orange colors are actually two different solar models in this case. But in any case you have But in any case, you'd have resolution to tell whether you're on the line or off-aligned. Okay, just as a side remark, you could also see perhaps such peaks in the axion spectrum which arise from, say, so-called metals. In the sun, metals in astrophysics are weird things. So ox oxygen, for example, is a metal or sulfur, not just iron. But it's essentially everything heavy as a helium metal. Helium method. Anyway, so you can determine the elemental composition of the sun. Okay, or also the magnetic fields. But I think I should skip the dark cosmology, which let me just make two remarks. You have, and this is perhaps the most stringy thing here, in string models you have typically dark radiation, possibly a lot of it. Radiation, possibly a lot of it. But at least in some models, this can give you a sizable but acceptable amount of dark radiation. And let me just skip most of the parts. But again, you have some chance to see with a little bit of ambitious, and I think this still needs some work, to detect the dark radiation with experiments. With experiments. People have thought about it, but it's not great, I would say, the detection prospects at the moment. But if you had the ability, then you can measure again the spectrum. And the spectrum tells you quite a bit about cosmology. When is the dark radiation produced? How heavy was the particle that produced the dark radiation? What is the reheating temperature that is caused by this decay of a heavy particle? By this decay of, say, a heavy modulus field. And you can determine all that if you have enough information on the details of this spectrum. But I should say this is really probably at the moment beyond the currently existing technology challenge in terms of measurement. Okay, so let me just leave you with that. I think accents are probably the coolest dark matter candidate. In many senses, actually, it's probably also much cooler than WIMPs in terms. Much cooler than wings in terms of literally being cool. But anyway, okay, so thanks. Yeah, I was just curious about if ixo has any possibility of directly programming up to QCD? Or is it just 2v? So iaxo probably doesn't. IAXO probably doesn't. So, because IAXO sees only the photon coupling, you can kind of indirectly say, okay, it fits with, so to speak, the coupling, the photon coupling, fits with a, basically, on the line of an expected simple QCD Axel model. Then you would say, okay, that looks pretty good. But you still haven't found the Guern Merconfish. So it's a bit of an indirect argument, but you could say, Bit of an indirect argument, but you could say, ah, if I have measured a plausible value of E over N, I would say, okay, this looks pretty good, like a Q C D axiom. Sorry, I might be being slow. Why is it? Is it obvious why you don't currently probe the gluon pump line? Yeah, well, essentially, the reason is in the sun the production um well, you have no free gluons, that's the first thing, so you have the photon interaction that gives you accents. That gives you axions, you can have fermion interactions. You could think: ah, the gluon-induced fermion interaction is a nucleon interaction. But this is super suppressed in the Sun because it's essentially a velocity effect. The nucleons or the nuclei are very slow. It's the electrons that contribute most to the emission. So, in that sense, that's a bit harder. Supernovae are typically sensitive to this. Supernovae are typically sensitive to the nuclear company, but probably not with that amount of precision. Can you go back to the model discrimination part? I think in all this model discrimination story, there is always a big assumption, which is that you have a single axion. Absolutely. But experimentally, you cannot be sure that there are additional axions and they mix, and they can be mixed any almost any year. I mean, can you all eat? It depends a little. So I think this class would be, so I don't know. I can't give you a complete answer, but usually you would expect that if you have, say, a couple of axons, the first assumption that for this to change would be: ah, you have to have both. To have both of them kind of contributing equally to your experiment and to your sigma. And that brings them already quite close. So I guess what I'm asking is that if I measure a point in this parameter space, I cannot be completely sure this corresponds to E over n equal to 2, or it is another axion that has mixed with another axion and something that is close to that. Yes and no. Yes and no. So admittedly, these plots are for a single axiom. But I would actually be fairly optimistic. I think it's an interesting question that one could actually study. If you look in the experiment, and you have, say, the different axions, I would say, simply distinguish by slightly different masses, for example. I think you can have a chance to distinguish those. Because in the spectrum, you would see funny... You would see funny things due to the axiom simply from the experiment because in your the magnet of Yaxo is fairly long, and it can be that if you're on the slightly heavier side, you lose coherence inside the magnet. And this depends on the energy of the incoming axon. So, in the spectrum, you have kind of bumps that correspond to the axoma. So, this is in part how you can determine the axoma. And I would think. And I would think, probably not with Jackson, but with a bit more data, you could possibly distinguish two. But I don't know. Can I come back to the question of measuring the gluon collate? So if you want to measure the gluon collar and the axiom is dark matter, then you look for Casper up to say kilohertz frequencies. But if we know the axiom massive. Know the XEM massive ADMX is XEM tomorrow, and we know the mass is however many hundreds of megahertz. Do you have any ideas of what you could construct in terms of a dedicated experiment once you know the frequency to measure a little bit more properly? I don't, but Sebastian Ellis actually had and some collaborators. So if you could think of basically taking a material where you have possibility to align electric dipole moments. You put in a sample, take for example a xenon sample, which you align and then basically you have aligned spins in your xenon and those would have electric dipole moments oscillating like this. And all your spins in your sample would oscillate kind of coherently. So you make a little sample and then you make a cavity around it. And you enhance basically the Enhance basically the electromagnetic field from the electric dipole moment. So the oscillating electric dipole moment, basically it's an oscillating electric field that now drives the planet. And this is very hard, but if you know the frequency, it becomes considerably easier. So you could try for a confirmation in that direction. Is that like an NMR analog of what Quax were trying to do? Well, it's basically. To do. Well, it's basically it is like what's it called? The laval. It's essentially like quax. They can tell how it's kind of. It's essentially like quax. You don't know with any kind of component. Yeah. And you just need a different material. But how does it lead to an inference that really comes from the bonds where all you do if you're measuring nuclear squared? Because in, well, at that point you have measured an electric dipole moment of your nuclei oscillating with the same frequency. With the same frequency. And the electric dipole moment is usually linked to a gluon coupling. There's a predictable relation between those. You could say, okay, I could have some fundamental dipole moment that couples to the field. That is still a possibility. But it's usually a much more complicated operator than the gluon. And I think you could do another confirmation because Confirmation because once you have done your measurement, you know again at least the relation between the gluon coupling and the photon coupling and the frequency. And the frequency in an Axon model is also related to the coupling to gluons because the mass is in a one-to-one relation with the gluon coupling. And at that point you would say, okay, if all that fits together, Together, I would be pretty happy. It's not perfect, but it's pretty good, I would say. And like basically, the axon-neutral coupling induces both the axon-electron coupling. That's the axial-neutron coupling, then the axon-focused coupling. And if I get an individual measurement of these two, I can relate them back to one. Essentially, so you have the you have now kind of three things that you can measure. The the photon coupling. The photon coupling, the gluon coupling, and the mass essentially. And if those fit together in a reasonable manner, I would say this is pretty convincing. It's not perfect, but fairly convincing. Okay, let's continue the discussion of the coffee trick and thank you once again. I mean, we can start sending individuals together. Really, why do you want to be pointing? They need to ascend. Has the ability to die? Oh, you're going to die for a little bit. So, what's your boost case? Now the axon component photon and also an accident. So the axiom photon comes, we detect the sensitivity. This has an additional model dependent on mass action. Yeah, the E over there depending on that. That's exactly what I'm coming to. But let's say that you measure actual and then you have another expense that the CMs come along. But the CM is coming and you get the numbers information. I was thinking that still, we cannot tell the sighting of the chief. It's really not a hundred percent guaranteed, but remember the massive one relationship and do it helpful. Massive point in twelve hours or channel, it's also not precisely, but this is a calculation of problem. But in a one-to-one relation, so indeed, if you make a single match as a mass and the moon would already be pretty hot. I think that there's sorry, I don't know the mass of the axis. To the axiom. The mass of the axiom you have in enormous precision. Yeah, let's say that we have failed that down. And the mass of the axiom is only determined in terms of the problem. It depends on the model. Let's put it like you can do a QCD axon model or you can do a very I don't want to I would still have to do that. This is the assumption of the market. If you add contributions to the mouse, this requires some serious models. People have done. I think it's a nice proof of principle. It's a very interesting one. We need extractation groups or weird running of the GLCT in the ultraviolet. Why these two are related? Because you know the XLDK concept. Well, basically the Gluen coupling, you can do low energy chiral practication theory in QCD and you can really directly translate the gluon coupling into a Gluent coupling into a mass tone for the axon based on basically current perturbations. And this is a pretty solid argument. So this is basically, I think Weinberg did this confirmation. So he has it definitely in his GFT book, but I think this was, after all, Weinberg and Wilczek kind of discovered the particle in the axiom, which you can keep going. But I think Weinbeck has the cult collection already in his first paper. But it's definitely in his book, it's current preparation to very little I think to fiddle with. You need some really creative model that you need to get an extra mass turn off that doesn't interfere with hybrid perturbations. This is why I think these models are difficult to control in design. They often play on the They often play on strange ultraviolet interesting, but yeah, I mean, this cardboard vision here is just quite skipping over the fact that NASA squared squared over F. M is like NASA squared over F, Twitter. Proper contributions from the final control. Yeah, I think I'm not on the percentage. Yeah, for the GCSA, this is very well done. And for having exactly. And for having an exact stage between the baths of FA. So once you've pinned down the baths, I can permit you say that you've pinned down the FA for it. And that I'm happy with it. And then you measure your diagonal EDM measurement. So you get the gluon coupling. And at this point... See, that's what I'm trying to understand. When you say that when I measure EDM, when you say that I'm going to measure the proton coupling, I would have still thought that what I've measured is actually the EDM coupling, not quite the glue on coupling. Company, not quite the one company yet. Agreed. You would so, but the CEDM company is again: if you have a drill, if you have a GCD iso and you don't build anything complicated around it, the PDM coupling is predicted directly from the group. So it goes that way. It's a one-to-one correspondence, but inferring it backwards, I'm not sure. Inserting it backwards, I'm not sure if it's a one-to-one or something.
