She is a postdoctoral fellow, and she will speak about a deterministic set of spherical points with more discrepancy. All right. Yes, thank you. You can share your screen, of course, if you want. All right. Yeah, thank you very much. Thank you, Christan. Let's see if that works. All right. Now you should be watching half of the screen with it. All right. All right. Yeah, thank you for the presentation. And I would also like to thank the other organizers of this conference. I think that at least until now, it has been a total success. I hope it will continue, but yesterday there were many people listening to the talks. So congrats and thank you. Today I'm going to talk about a particular type of discrepancy. Yesterday, no, two days ago, we were at least They know. Two days ago, we were listening about discrepancy on the real line, discrepancy on Euclidean spaces, discrepancy on compact manifolds, and especially on the torus. And today we are going to focus on discrepancy of spherical points. So we will be working with the sphere of dimension two, with the Lebesgue measure on the sphere, and we are going to define what is known as the spherical cap discrepancy, that is the usual discrepancy for spherical. Discrepancy for spherical points. I'm going to focus on the problem of finding the minimal discrepancy, especially when the number of points goes to infinity. So I worry about the asymptotic expansion of the minimal discrepancy on the sphere, and about what set of points attain such a minimal discrepancy, if any. Then I will introduce the Dianmon ensemble, that is, a set of spherical points. There is a set of spherical points evenly distributed on the sphere that has such nice properties, and in particular, the discrepancy of the diamond ensemble can be computed. So, I will show you how the discrepancy of such a set of spherical point sets looks like and a bit of the sketch of the proof. A bit of notation, I've already told you that I will be working on this. You that I will be working on the sphere of dimension two. I will use the Lebesgue measure on the sphere. Whenever I talk about a family of points, I refer to a sequence of configurations of points, where the index is in the number of points. So a family of points is a sequence where the first element is a configuration with one point, the second element is a configuration with two points, the third element a configuration with... Third element, a configuration with three points, and so on. And so let's start with the discrepancy. All right, so whenever we have a family of points on the sphere, then we say that this family is asymptotically uniformly distributed if it looks like the uniform distribution when the number of points goes to infinity. And this informal definition. And this informal definition can be clarified in this first formula that we have here on my right. So, a set of a family of points where every configuration is denoted by omega n on the formula is said to be asymptotically uniform distributed if the limit of the number of points that fall into a borel set over the number of total number of points equals. Total number of points equals the area of this Borel set over the measure of the sphere. I say it again. We take C is any Borel set that is Levesque continuous. So you just think on a Borel set. And then a set of points, it's asymptotically uniformly distributed if the number of points that fall into this set tends to the measure of this set. Set. And once we have this notion in mind, then the discrepancy is just the speed of this convergence. So whenever we have a family of points that is asymptotically uniformly distributed, if we compute the speed of the convergence of this limit, that's the discrepancy. And this is written in the second formula you have here. So we compute the limit when n goes to infinity of the absolute value on here. The absolute value on here we have the subtraction of the both terms. This is the discrepancy. And usually on the sphere, we don't care about every Borel set, but we take a particular family of Borel sets that are spherical caps. And we take a particular norm that is usually the supreme norm, but can also be the L2 norm. So here you have the definition. Here you have the definition of the spherical cap discrepancy with respect to the supremon norm or with respect to the L2 norm. In the first formula, we have the discrepancy with respect to the supremon and spherical caps of omega n, a set of points, is just the supremon among all the spherical caps that I denote by capital C. And there we have the number of points that fall into these spherical caps over. Into these spherical caps over the total number of points, and I have to subtract the normalized area of the spherical cap. If instead of worrying about the supremum norm, I worry about the L2 norm, then I have the next formula, where I don't take the supremum, but I integrate over all the spherical caps C. And this particular discrepancy, the L2 spherical cap discrepancy, is Discrepancy has a lot of good properties on the sphere, in particular, because it is related with the sum of distances between every different pair of points on the sphere. This link is made through the Stolarksky invariance formula, and I don't have time to speak about it in this 20-minute talk. But last Wednesday, there was some announcement of this point distribution. Announcement of this point distributions webinar by Brian Matke. And I want to tell you that two weeks ago, Dimabili gave a super nice talk on this seminar speaking about this stolar scheme variance formula. So I clearly recommend to go there and check it. It's online now. All right, so we have these two definitions for discrepancy. And now I told you I'm going to worry about the minimal value that this discrepancy. Minimal value that this discrepancy can attain. So we go to the supremum spherical cap discrepancy and we try to think where or for which configurations can we have a really small value for the discrepancy. Well, we are taking the supremum of an absolute value. So what we want is that if we take any spherical cap on the sphere, the number of points that fall into this spherical cap. That fall into this spherical cap over the total number of points mimic it's so close to the area of these spherical caps. So, at the end of the day, we want a really evenly configuration of points on the sphere. We know some things about the minimal value of the discrepancy. Here, I present to you the main results. They are due to Beck. So, let's start with the formula that is applicable. Let's start with the formula that is above. The discrepancy is always greater or equal than a constant times n, n is the number of points of my configuration, to the power minus three quarters. This is a lower bound for any discrepancy, sorry, for the discrepancy of any set of points, and so it is a lower bound for the minimal spherical cap discrepancy. And then as an upper bound, And then, as an upper bound for the minimal spherical cap discrepancy, we have the first formula that was also affirmed by Beck, stating that there exists a configuration of points whose discrepancy is bounded by another constant, C prima, times n to the power minus three quarters times log n. This is an upper bound for the minimal spherical cap discrepancy. Minimal spherical cap discrepancy. Beck doesn't give a concrete configuration, a concrete payment of points attaining this lower bound, but he produced some random points, then he computes the expectation value, and this is actually the bound we have here. As you can see, they don't match. We have some extra log n term, and this is actually an open problem. So, what is the correct Problem. So, what is the correct order of the minimal spherical cap discrepancy? Do we have n to the power minus three-quarters, or we have to add this logarithm of n? Those are open problems. But I'm going to focus now on yet another open problem related to minimal spherical cap discrepancy: that is, given a family of points, so given a sequence of configurations of points, can we compute? Can we compute actually analytically the spherical camp discrepancy? And if so, how does it look like for a well-known distribution of points on the sphere? And we have some answers. The first one, and actually the only one for deterministic points until recently, was given by the Fibonacci nodes. Fibonacci nodes are just a set, a family of spherical points. Family of spherical points, we take a sphere, we draw a concrete spiral on the sphere, and then we distribute the points on this spiral. And it was proved by Eisleiner, Braucher, and Dick that the supreme spherical cap discrepancy of the Fibonacci nodes is bounded by this constant, 44 square root of 8, times n to the power minus 1 half. And that was the best bound we had for any family, deterministic family of points until recently. That's what they prove analytically, but I have to say that they also provide some numerics in their work, and it seems that this is not the correct order, and that we can go lower on the exponent of n. But still, that's what one can prove with this kind of argument. With this kind of argument. If we allow us to work with families of points that are not deterministic but random, then we get way better bounds. So here I want to mention the spherical ensemble. This is a set of random points on the sphere. And we have that the supreme one spherical cap discrepancy of a configuration of points following this distribution, a concrete distribution. Concrete distribution. It's of the order given by Beck. So n to the power minus three quarters times log of n. And this is, of course, the best order that we knew, no, because if we knew something better, then okay, vectorium will be taken away. Okay, so this is what we have for points. And now let's go into the diamond ensemble and present it a little bit. Present it a little bit. The diamond ensemble is a multi-parametric family of points that was first defined by Carlos Verdrán from University of Cantavia and myself. I'm not giving here the complete definition because it will take around 15 minutes and this is a 20 minutes talk, but I really want you to get the idea. So I will do it through a series. So, I will do it through a series of pictures. So, this is the beginning of the diamond ensemble. We have to take the north pole, the south pole, and then we select a number of parallels on the sphere. This number of parallels have to be of the order square root of n if we want to place endpoints. So, already we have a lot of parameters. One parameter is the number of parallels that we are taking. There is the number of parallels that we are taking, but also who are the parallels that we are taking. What heights define my parallels. Those are also parameters. And once we have that, then we just take some equidistance points in every parallel. So we take the roots of unity in every parallel, and those are again more parameters, because I have to define for every parallel how many points do I take. How many points do I take? And I also have some extra parameters that are where do I place those roots of unity along the parallel. So, for example, I can fix a meridian, like in the picture, and then state that I fix in every parallel a point on the meridian. And then the other are organized. All right, just to give you an idea of how I am choosing the number of points that I pick in every paragraph. Points that I pick in every parallel, I will tell you that I just take multiples of integral numbers between one and six, and I will show it with an example. So, this is a really basic example of the diamond ensemble. Here we have multiples of four in every parallel. So, if we start with the North Pole, in the first parallel we have four points. In the se following parallel, we have eight points. Following parallel, we have eight points, then 12 points, 16 points, and so on. And then we arrive to the equator and we just symmetrize the northern hemisphere. This is a very easy sample of the diamond ensemble. We can elaborate a little more and we obtain such a thing. So, here we have different colors for different multiples. So, we start with multiples of six in orange. So, in the first parallel, we have six points. So in the first parallel we have six points, then twelve points, then eighteen points, and so on. Then we arrive to the yellow part where we have multiples of four and then multiples of two and we just have to symmetrize. And this is a last example in which we have multiples of six, five, four, three and two, and we symmetrize. But you can see how points look more and more evenly distributed. More and more evenly distributed. All right, so that's all I'm going to say about the diamond ensemble. And now let's get into the discrepancy. And this is the main theorem. We can't compute the discrepancy, the supremum spherical cap discrepancy of any set of points coming from the diamond ensemble, meaning that for any choice of parameters, and it is always of the order It is always of the order 1 over square root of n. We have a lower bound with a constant and an upper bound with a different constant. But the order is the correct one. And those constants are highly explicit and can be obtained just given the parameters of the model. So for example, if we take this very easy model where we only had multiples of four in every parallel, then the constant going with this. The constant going with this discrepancy is a 1 for the lower constant and 4 plus 2 square root of 2, so something that is less than 7 for the bigger constant. So this constant I highly explicit, and as the model goes better, then they go closer. And in these three last minutes, let me sketch a little bit the proof just to give you an idea if you have. Just to give you an idea if you have been working with discrepancy on the sphere, and if not, I don't know, to entertain yourself. So to prove the lower bound, it is easy to see that if we take a spherical cap whose border is the equator, the equator of the sphere contains a square root of endpoints. And then we take a spherical cap that is a bit smaller than this one, meaning that we get Smaller than this one, meaning that we get epsilon up from the equator, and then all of these points that were lying on the equator doesn't belong anymore to the spherical cap. So at least the discrepancy of the spherical cap has to be of the order one over square root of n. For the upper bound, the key ingredient is that with the Diamond ensemble, we can build an R. On Ensemble, we can build an area regular partition that's a partition of the sphere with every cell having the same area of the following shape. So we have a spherical cap containing the North Pole, a spherical cap containing the South Pole, and then this rectangular cells around the sphere. And now we just have to follow the argument given by Beck to prove the upper bound, meaning that. The upper bound, meaning that if we take any spherical cap, we can divide the interior of the spherical cap into two subsets. The first one are the cells that are totally contained inside the spherical caps. Here they are colored in red. And here, since we are having an area regular partition, the area in red is exactly the number of points that fall. The number of points that fall into this red area over the total number of points. So here the discrepancy will be zero. And we only have to worry about the cells that are touching the border of our spherical caps. But with a few computations using the parameters of our model and the complete definition, we can check that this number of cells is no bigger than a constant that can be computed times one. Be compute times 1 over square root of n. And that will prove the upper bound. So I think I've already finished my 20 minutes. I hope you could follow at least most of it, and I will be glad to answer your questions. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Uhua. Yes, are there any questions? If you have questions, either please raise your hand. That's possible. Hand, that's possible via a button, or you can just use the chat to ask your question. So, and then if you raise your hands, you can just use your microphone and ask your questions directly. But I will start with my first question would be, is there any chance to expand your methods to other specific point sets or is it really tailor-made to the diamond? To the diamond, no, I mean, that could be a stand, uh, at least for the upper bound. This is Beck method. So, what you need is to have an aggravular partition with that control diameter for the cells and to make sure that you have only one point in every cell. So, this part for the upper bound can be extended. For the lower bound, it's clear that my model is based on a spherical cut. Is based on spherical caps, so it's Taylor-made, yeah. Okay, there is another question by Michael Kvneboch in the chat. Um, do you see it, or I can read it out loud? What about the discrepancy for chitat sampling using the cells of the diameter sample? That's basically what Beck did in his proof. So, he didn't build a concrete area regular partition, but the diameters that he used for his area regular. Use for his aerial regular partition are of the same order as mine's. So I could say we will have the same result. So if we use these cells with jitteric sampling, the order is n to the minus three quarters times log n. But we lose this construction, deterministic construction of the model. Welcome. Welcome. Okay, are there more questions from the audience? If not, then let's thank Uhua once again. Thank you for a very nice talk. And I'll stop the recording for this part. Thank you.
