Arrangement. So, as Ari already announced, what I'm presenting here is joint work with Sergio Blanes, with Fernando Casas, and with Cesario Gonzalez. And this is a rather recent work. And our main concern was the extension of what you call as modified potential splitting methods, or maybe also as force gradient splitting methods. Gradient splitting methods to the non-linear case. And maybe just to show you this reference, so you see here the title once again, generalization of splitting methods based on modified potentials to non-linear evolution equations of parabolic and Schrodinger type. So this was our main objective, and I also mainly focus on this publication in my talk. In my talk. So let's start with the model problems or with the kind of equations we are considering. We are focusing on splitting. So naturally, we have non-linear evolution equations where the defining operator splits into two parts, which I will call F1 and F2. So we have the two corresponding sub-problems that we are studying. Studying. And we are focusing on two situations which are motive where the motivation comes from relevant applications. Namely, first in the field of Bose-Einstein condensation, we have time-dependent Kospitevsky equations. And you see here one model, one rather simple model displayed. So you have. Displayed. So you have the typical form of a non-linear Schrodinger equation. So you have the wave function, the macroscopic wave function on the left-hand side, the time derivative. Then you have one part involving the Laplacian, one part involving real-valued potential. And then in our case here, you have a cubic non-linearity. And of course, this problem can be cast in. Course, this problem can be cast into our general formulation, and you see the details here. But maybe just to focus on the important definitions. So we are assigning a linear differential operator, so a linear part to this operator F1 that I showed you before, and then the remainder, the The remainder is involved in F2, and you have here the potential and the non-linearity inside. And the time evolution of the Grosspitevsky equation is also related to the imaginary time propagation, so to the computation of ground states or of excited states of the Kozpetevsky equation. Equation and so by analogy, we are also studying the parabolic counterpart that you see here. So, the difference is that this is now for real valued functions, so in real space, and accordingly, we have the definition of our operators F1 comprising the Laplacian, and then of the operator F2 comprising the potential and cubic nonlinearity here. Okay, so very briefly, since I assume that many of you are well acquainted with splitting methods, so the standard approach of operator splitting methods is to decompose the full problem into two problems or more problems. And what we have as a fundamental presumption is, of course, that Presumption is, of course, that the numerical approximation of each sub-problem is significantly simpler compared to the numerical approximation of the full problem, of the original problem. And then you know from a variety of contributions, let's say theoretical considerations, theoretical studies, and also numerical studies that splitting methods have very nice. Have very nice properties. So you have stability, nice stability properties. Also, you have preservation of conserved quantities. And as soon as you optimize your scheme, you also have very good accuracy. So, overall, let's say for certain situations, splitting methods are really the methods of choice. And the idea. And the idea of our work was to focus on an alternative approach. So we go a little bit aside from the standard splitting schemes and we need the additional assumption that the operator F2 in our case for the model problems I showed you, this is a multiplication operator, and that also And that also a further operator, namely constructed from the from double commutator, that these two operators have a similar structure. Okay, so the scope of applications where this modified alternative approach performs really well is the following: the model problems I showed you, the time evolution and the images. The time evolution and the imaginary time propagation of Kosmedevsky equations, so non-linear Schwedinger equations. And further classes where this approach is quite promising are the complex Ginsburg-Lander equations. We have a similar structure of this problem. And rather recently, we also somehow considered or took into account. Considered or took into account different semi-linear variabolic equations which involve high-order derivatives, spatial derivatives. And this is quite interesting in the description of patterns, so-called quasicrystals, quasi-crystalline patterns are formed in these types of equations. So, to describe briefly the basic ideas, well, it was really a kind of educated guess that led us to this new class of splitting methods. And in principle, we come from the linear case. So, we came from the linear case, we studied the linear case, and then we found out that. And then we found out that a formal generalization of this linear case based on the calculus of Lie derivatives is very helpful to come to the non-linear extensions. And in our paper and also here in this talk, I will focus on a single method, namely the rather famous scheme by Chin. It's a fourth order modified potential. Course order modified potential operator splitting method. And it's somehow quite famous. So it has very nice properties. And it's also suitable for Schrodinger and as well for parabolic equations due to the positivity of the coefficients that arise. Okay, so to explain briefly the main idea of the extension from the linear Of the extension from the linear to the nonlinear case. Let's start with a system of ordinary differential equations, of linear ordinary differential equations that I'm giving here. So the simple form u prime, the time derivative of u is equal to a u plus b u. And a and b are just squared matrices, large of large dimension. Let's think of this case. And then you all know about the Then you all know about the exact solution to this problem. And what we want to do is with our numerical scheme, with a standard splitting scheme, and also with the modification, what we want to do is to have a nice approximation of this exponential part, E of tau, the time step size, times A plus B. And here on this next slide, you see in principle, a standard split. In principle, standard splitting methods are just built on the compositions of these matrix exponentials. So, one matrix exponential involving A and some additional scaling coefficient and also this matrix exponential involving B and also with an additional scaling coefficient. Now, what is the main difference compared to modified? Compared to modified potential operator splitting methods, you see here apart from these two matrix exponentials, you also permit exponentials of this form, which involve a second commutator. And of course, it depends on the definition of the matrices A and B, but let's think of B being a multiplication operator finally in our situations. In our situations, and of A being the Laplacian. And this is then the second commutator. Yeah. And the idea of this approach is that you gain some freedom. So you have some additional method coefficients inside this coefficient C. Also, to point out that you multiply the double commutator by the Q. By the cube of the time increment tau. And what is also quite, let's say, surprising or fascinating is that with this approach, you have the possibility to overcome an order barrier that is valid for parabolic equations. Yeah, so I started with the matrix case, but now let's. Case, but now let's go to the case of partial differential equations, linear partial differential equations. And what you see here is again this double commutator. And in situations related to linear Schrodinger equations or their parabolic counterparts, this double commutator then reduces to a multiplication operator. And this multiplication operator is defined or involved. Is defined or involves the gradient of the potential. And maybe just to express it in the words by Chin himself, he was saying that the basic idea of this approach is to incorporate an additional higher order composite operator so that the implementation of one algorithm requires only one evaluation of the force. Of the force, so of the potential, and one evaluation of the force and of its gradient. So, the additional work that you have to do is almost neglectible. And this quotation also explains the common name of this class of splitting methods, namely forced gradient operator splitting methods or modified potential operator splitting methods. Operator splitting methods. So we have the potential and the modification, namely the gradient of potential inside. Okay, and now for the non-linear case. So as I mentioned before, our guideline was somehow the calculus of lead derivatives, which allows somehow the analogy of the linear and the non-linear case. So we had before the matrix. So we had before the matrices A and B, or the linear operators A and B, and the non-linear operators F1 and F2 take over these rows. And for the commutator, for the second commutator, we just have now the solution to a non-linear evolution equation. And this non-linear evolution equation involves the non-linear operator F2, and in addition, And in addition, this iterated commutator, which is just defined by the operators F1 and F2, you see here, F1 and F2, and also of their first derivatives, F1 prime, F2 prime, and we also have inside the second derivatives, F1 double prime and F2 double prime. Yeah, and in principle, this is the main ingredient. Ingredient, and then we have here the formulation of the original scheme by Qin that you see here. So, maybe to start in the end, so I have one matrix exponential or one evolution operator involving B, one involving A, and then this modification involving the double commutator. And then again, the exponential of A and the exponential of B. Of A and the exponential of B. And this is then the straightforward extension to the non-linear case. So the exponentials are just replaced by the evolution operators, by the flow operators, and this modification comes from the solution to the evolution equation that I showed you just before on the previous slide. Okay, so what is particular for So, what is particular for Chin's method, as I mentioned before, it's possible to have a splitting method that involves as main coefficients positive coefficients, real positive coefficients. And here you have a negative coefficient inside, but please mention that this coefficient is then multiplied by the time increment, by the square of the time increment, by the cube of the time increment here. And so this is. And so, this is rather small in comparison to the first term. And this ensures stability also in the context of PDEs. Okay, and of course, what you have to do is when you study a particular problem, in our case, our model problems of Schrodinger and parabolic type, you need to determine this iterated commutator. This iterated commutator, and this is the result that you see here. So, in blue, this is the term that you would have in a linear case, in any case. And what you have in addition is these additional terms here. So, this is the parabolic case, the first two lines, and the last lines are the Schroedinger case. Yeah, and what you what. Yeah, and what you get in the end is a multiplication operator that involves the potential, in both cases, the Laplacian, so the second space derivatives of the potential that you usually know by from the problem that you usually can compute by hand. And in addition, what we need is spatial derivatives of the current. Spatial derivatives of the current solution values, which are also pointed out here in red. So in the parabolic case, you have first space derivatives, and in the Schrödinger case, it's a bit different. You need also the Laplacian of the current solution value. So, just a few minutes, or let's say a rather short comment. This was a This was a kind of magic. So, what you know from the center splitting approach, this special invariance in case of cubic Schrodinger equations or nonlinear Schrödinger equations, this invariance principle also extends to our case. So, you remember I had this non-linear sub-problem that This non-linear sub-problem that I have to solve for the modified operator splitting methods, and also for this non-linear sub-problem, we have an invariance property. And of course, this property is then very nice, makes our final scheme efficient. So, due to time, I will be very briefly here. In blue, In blue, this is the case for the standard splitting approach. So, what we know from before, what is a well-known result, is an invariance property for this blue part. And what we could show is that this invariance principle also extends to our modification. So, when you have this additional part inside, and what we have to do is finally just to confirm this identity. Finally, just to confirm this identity, so time invariance, this means that the time derivative is equal to zero. And this is then finally just a calculation that is a bit longer. So you just need to study the structure of each of the components. So it's not so clear at first glance, but for some terms it's For some terms, it's nice to see that this time derivative just vanishes. And then you have some magic inside in the sense that the combination of several terms is then such that this equality indeed holds. Yeah. And the conclusion is from this invariance principle, from this special property that the realization of The realization of the modified operator splitting methods in principle just breaks down to the following. First, you need to solve a linear Schrodinger equation as for the standard splitting approach. And then we have a point-wise evaluation of the following solution representation, which is a conclusion of this invariance property. And the first part. And the first part would be the one for the standard approach, standard splitting approach, and the second part is the additional modification that we are studying. Okay, maybe in the last minutes to leave some time for questions, some first numerical experiments. So I'm starting here with the So I'm starting here with the Schwedinger case, with the Kross-Witevsky equation involving a quadratic potential. And I'm comparing the novel method, so this novel modified splitting method with standard operator splitting methods. I will display the global errors versus the time step sizes in different space dimensions, one, two, and three. three and I will also show you the results to have a comparison for between the linear and the non-linear case. Okay, and this is just concerning the title. So in this case, I have the exact solution due to this invariance property concerning the non-linear sub-problem. So you see here the result for the linear case. So my coupling constant theta is equal to zero. Constant theta is equal to zero. This corresponds to the linear case. I have the Lie splitting of order one, the strength splitting of order two. I have also the quite famous Yushida splitting of order four, and I have this novel modified splitting of order four. And this is the result. So the global errors versus the time step sizes. And this is now the extension to the non-linear case. And you see it's the same picture. So yeah, almost the same. Almost the same, almost the same result, also in accuracy. And this picture does not change much when you go to higher space dimensions. So this is the two-dimensional case and also in three dimensions. It's mainly the same picture here. Now, for the parabolic part, in principle, the same situation, just to point out. Just to point out, here I have the non-linear sub-problem. I do not have the invariance property. So I'm computing the numerical solution based on an explicit Unge-Kutte method of the appropriate order. And what you see is stability is a bit more delicate here. And what is also interesting when we It is also interesting when we are using the Yoshida splitting with complex coefficients. This is the appropriate scheme for the parabolic case. And as soon as you do it in the straightforward way, in a naive manner, you will see an order reduction in the nonlinear case. And these are the pictures. So again, here theta equals zero, no coupling constant. So this is the linear case. And And there, of course, I have the exact solution for comparison at hand. And you see, this is the result. And now, in the nonlinear case, my modified method keeps the order, keeps the order four. But for the complex coefficient, Yoshida splitting, I would observe an order reduction. So it's in principle then has well, it has the same order as the strength splitting, but slightly nicer. Splitting, but slightly nicer accuracy here. And this picture is essentially the same then in higher space dimensions as well, in two dimensions and in three dimensions. You see more or less the same results, but what you see here, the problem becomes stiffer and so stability is a bit more sensible. So this is a bit more delicate. Okay, so. Okay, so, well, we did some further numerical experiments. You're very welcome to address me if you want to know more about this. But for the moment, I will just jump to the conclusions. So, sorry, I was too fast. So, what was our main concern in principle to introduce the general framework in order to extend modified potential operator splitting? Potential operator splitting methods to nonlinear evolution equations. And we specified Chin's method of order four to model problems, namely the Hospital equation and its parabolic counterpart. And what concerns future work, of course, a rigorous stability and error analysis would be of interest. So this is Interest, so this is not yet available. Extensions that I mentioned briefly before to other kinds of applications: the Ginsburg-Lander equation and also these high-order reaction diffusion equations with pattern formation. And finally, it would also be of interest to design optimized schemes. Yeah. Okay, so that's all. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much for your attention. We have time for one or two questions. I make it, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Thank you for the talk. Could you go back to the slide where you were discussing positivity of the coefficients? Yes. When you did your talk. Where I introduced the scheme, maybe. Maybe, Chinsky. Yes. You mean this? Exactly, yeah. So you pointed out that both coefficients are positive apart from the one which has the third power of tau. He said this is not so bad because this is small. But this involves a differential operator. Because here's the A. So why does this not cause any problems to the parabolic case? Yes, that's true. Yes, that's true, but of course, I mean, well, so in principle, as soon as the time step size is small enough, this term is fine. Yeah? It's small enough compared to the regularity of the solution. How about it is because the domain commutator is a part of the because you have two massive. Because you have two derivatives which discover two derivatives. You compute the derivative of a function that is a combination as far as the solution is regular function. Okay, okay. Hi, Mechel. I would like to ask about conservation. You had something where you said time derivative of your right hand side. Of your right hand side, just Spanish. I was a bit puzzled about that conservation statement. I'm not sure I fully understood your question. At some point, you said you crucially use some invariance property of your non-linear solution. Along the solution. Yes, I think that S is in the kernel of the Jacobian of S. Of situation of F, and I'm not well. So maybe I can just show you this result once again. I mean, I did a stupid computation and when I differentiate F along the solution, I get the Jacobian of F applied to dot, u dot is F of U, so I need something in the kernel of the Jacobian, and I'm lost a bit. I'm lost a bit. Well, you do not have this invariant, or you cannot see this invariance property for the full problem. The point is that we have the problem. Yeah? Sorry, I didn't get, sorry. No, no, don't worry. Maybe I did not point this out clearly enough. But let's say the point for our message. Let's say the point for our method is that you have this linear sub-problem, this first sub-problem that you have to solve, and you have the non-linear sub-problem that you have to solve. And by the invariance property, then you know you have the solution, you have a solution representation for this non-linear sub-problem. Sorry, don't worry. My question is exactly connected. It's exactly connected, and there are things you're picking up. So, your algorithm is because of this, it's explicit, explicit, right? Yes, yeah, yeah. Imagine that you even get rid of the commutators just using Stran's pattern. And you were interested to come up with this bit of trigger for non-linear energy, which is more general, but the potential depending on the size. And in that case, And in that case, you don't have this invariance properly, you actually have to only get implicit split operator. And it's only in Russia that actually happens that the potential is just of psi squared in front of you can solve it exactly the non-linear propagation. Yes, I mean, what we need for the potential, if I understood you correctly, we need the potential. We need the potential to be real-valued. This is the assumption that we need in order to derive this invariance property. Okay, so I have to think about it. So, if it was arbitrary function of position plus some function of wave function, do you think that you could always solve it exactly if it was really functioning? Well, look, of course, I mean you have to. Yeah. In our problems, of course, I mean, for the Grospiteski equation, you have this form, you have a space-dependent potential. And in order to have this invariance property, you need it to be a real-valued, the potential. That's the essential quantity. Of course, as soon as you have a time dependence here, and I'm not sure I understood you, that it might also be a wave function. Might also be wave function dependent, then of course it's not clear that you have this invariance. No, exactly, but Gross-Pitaksky time dependence comes via the wave function dependence in the last term, not in the V, but in the last term. But it's a special, very special case of non-linear energy equation, which doesn't have this promise. If there was a more complicated dependence on the wave function, I think not be able to. Okay, okay, okay. I just wanted to cut it. But maybe you can, maybe you could just write me a short message and then I could maybe think about this once again. But of course, I mean, we are using quite a special form of the models. That's clear. Okay, so there are no further. Thank you very much. Thank you. Have a good time. Thank you very much. Bye bye. And yes, it says a lot of the time.
