For this audience I'm also very happy that I think I do not need to explain any of these words in my title in detail. But just wanting to point out that when I look at the topology of synaptics, I'm now not looking at the layering, but really at the orientational defects. And the second point is it's about cold oil liquid crystals here in particular to get these complex defect structures. So man, further I'd like to acknowledge my Man, further I'd like to acknowledge my collaborators, so Louis and Dirk from Oxford, they did the experiments. Then there were also involved Michel and Raphael, which helped us a little bit on tetratic order parameters in three dimensions. And then Powell from our group at Distodorf, he did the symbogations. And this is, of course, together with Herb Model Government. Good. To the outcome of my talk. So, actually, to say I was a little bit torn in different directions. Was a little bit torn in different directions, so I should structure it. So, the original idea was: okay, after taking a talk, which I have given for several times, just stripping it down a little bit to match it to the time. But even after the first session yesterday, I kind of had the feeling that I should weave stuff in and even put something more on it to kind of aim at all these goals we had. So, in the end, I decided to do something a little bit in between and starting with a little. And starting with a little bit more detailed introduction to densifuncture theory. Because we now had three tutorials on very fundamental different aspects, and now I just want to have a microscopic theory put on top and give you a little bit more of the ideas I'm doing. And then in the end, when it goes to different topological structures in extreme convincing, I structured it in several sub chapters which we can kind of individually discuss. Can kind of individually discuss after each part of it, and I can then also jump over some guides. Okay, so this is my general introduction. These are also the hitches that you now have here given around. So, what I'm doing is hard rocks. So, really like these hitches, they don't overlap, but they also don't have long-range repulsion or any attraction. And for this simple hyper model, where the interaction potential only has two values, we can Only has two values, we can get the full liquid crystal phase behavior, which you all know. But just again to point out, it's not temperature-driven, but just by increasing the density. And a little bit looking closely, so when you have a cap potential, which is the basic ingredient of density function theory, this will hard work, of course, depends on both position and also the orientations. And in the end, now this putting into a density functional theory, which I'll explain you later after showing. Explain your data after showing your initial results. This is usually the only theoretical equation I'm showing you. So the main idea of DFT is to have a functional now of the grand potential. So we are in general in the grand canonical scenario. This is a functional of the density and the minimizer of this functional is then the equilibrium density which results position and orientation. And when we plug this in, you really get the graph. This in, you really get the grand canonical or the grand potential of the system. So, pretty similar, like in Gander Vishen, you minimize a functional, you get your solutions which look like this, and I explain this now. And then you also get the free energy which you can compare to, say, which is my stable solution. Okay, so the density depends on position and orientation. And just for all these liquid cursive phases, we know just how this could be acts. So, isotropic, we have no orientation or order, also, the density is just. Orientation order also the density is just completely constant. Tiger coding is always the average density overall orientation. Then these green arrows are now the pneumatic director and the length of it is the manic model perimeter. So in the pneumatic phase we're still homogeneous in space but we have of course a pneumatic director. Okay, sympathics. This is now the important thing. So this is how symctics look in DFT. So you really have these variants which is kind Really, have these evarions, which is kind of the expectation for the positions of the center of mass on particles combined with the pneumatic ordering in the spectral A case, which is what I get for these R rods perpendicular to these gayers. And you could also have a crystal where you then see that also this fluid-like structure within the selected gayer is probably to get really individual peaks. So, this is our state scope, and this is to show that we can very nicely. That we can very nicely reproduce the topology of the phase diagram of the rods, which is then just a matter of density. So, increasing the density, you kind of get from isotropic to pneumatic to synagogic to crystal, wherever how rotten your rods are, this is here the aspect ratio of the other variable of the system. And so, there are two points which I'd like to point out. One point is the isotropic magnetic transition. And basically everything I'm showing you is a two-dimensional by the way. Two-dimensional, by the way. And so the isotropic dimetic transition, you can really get this analytically, which is a nice thing. But the downside in two-dimensional is that it's kind of relatively off disablation when you really go to lower densities because of peculiar aspects which you have in even dimensions. But of course, I want to talk about synaptics. And here in this dense region of the phase diagram in theory, it's really accurate and we are also very close to the simulations. Okay, so keeping this in mind. Okay, so keeping this in mind, this is MACTIC, and now we want to put in single find, and then we're kind of about here in our phase diagram. And this is the general outline of our methods. So I won't talk very much about experimental methods. It's pretty much the same as Lisa told us yesterday for the colloids. So you're looking from the bottom up of a sedimentation here, where you hear in bright field microscopes between your individual rocks. You also did some logations, which looks kind of similar with broad layers. Kind of similar in rod resolution. Now we can really compare one to one. Then these magnetic layers correspond to these individual rods, and this is a very close structure agreement, I would say. So it's a circular 2D confinement. Yes. I will go to many different confinements later, but I impose the circular cavity by an external potential, which I'll show you in the next slide. And how I get this structure. And how I get this structure, it's also like Patrick told us you have an initial guess, which is, for example, here. So I kind of know that this magic order wants to have several parallel layers. Now I'm playing the video here of how this now iterates over the original Lagrange equation I showed you before. This is no dynamics, just the iteration of this equation. And you see then the functional itself searches its proper gazing, finds here some kind of second domain. Some kind of second domain, so we can also really get these grain boundaries which we find a simulation experiment that will either send a quantity to other guys to poke it or for later on. And yeah, so it's a little bit more of taggering to find these structures here, but in the end, since we have free energy, we know when we have such a stable status outcome, how good it is compared to others. And so it's fine to start with relatively good guesses. Start with relatively good guesses for that. Okay, so this is now the technical slide I just brought up for you to give you a brief idea of how it is so you don't need to follow everything. So just to give you the idea, you write a grand potential which consists of kind of a free energy of an ideal gas, which is exactly known. It's just a rogue row. Then you have an external potential with which you impose your confinement, and you have the chemical. And you have the chemical potential, which is just from the Schumpeter transformer of the free energy because it's grand anonymity. And this guy is now the important part, this is what encompasses the interactions, the axis free energy. And kind of the whole idea of DFT is now to transfer the problem of solving statistical mechanics partition function, the configuration integral. This problem for interacting systems is transferred finding an accurate expression for this free energy functional. For this free energy functional, which you then put in your DFT and minimize. And so, how you can do it in general, for example, in very denote systems, you know how this function looks like. It's kind of a square term in the density, and you have a Maya function, which is defined kind of as the Boltzmann factor of your infection potential minus one. And this for hard rocks now only again is only two values because their potential is zero or. Because their potential is zero or infinity, so this is either zero or minus one, depending on whether the particles over or not. And so, this guy in the very root limit is at least the three-dimensional exact, and this is practically all-side theory. And what I'm now doing in fundamental measure theory is going further steps using geometric information based on the fact that the Mayo function is nothing more than the Euler characteristic of the intersection. Characteristic of the intersection of two particles adheres if they are convex. And if you do this, you can use several ideas from integral or differential geometry to decompose this and get several building blocks of your functional, which then describe the interaction also for denser systems. And this is the main idea of it. And these are several papers going back to my PhD work where I did several things like isotropic mematics, like differences. Isotropic matting, stack decransition. And also, what I want to put out, because this connects to one of the open problems, we can also extract elastic coefficients for the pneumatic phase and really set up a Gandal Deschen theory with all the parameters determined from this functional. And something I would like to find out is in how far one could do the same thing for technical. So, this now to keep in mind that. So, this is the first. So this is the first part where you could have any tech question on this technical part. U buries the orientational information, flower case u in the Meyer function. Sorry, this u is the pair potential. So where's the this guy here? And this depends on the orientation of the individual particles. And then the orientation, it comes coming from a rotation of this just Just the geometry. So you decompose this guy, and also the Maya function still depends on the orientation. You decompose this into the building blocks, which themselves are vectorial and tensorial. And these tensors, in particular, are then what gives rise to a pneumatic order parameter, which is part of your functional. The pneumatic order parameter itself is a function of the orientation distribution, and this is what gives you the stuff to minimize. And if you just have a homogeneous system. And if you just have a homogeneous system, you could do this completely analytically in 2D, minimizing this functional, which is a function of the pneumatic order parameter, get an analytic orientational distribution, and then kind of because it's a second-order phase transition from the isotropic to pneumatic, from the bifurcation of the isotropic state, you get this analogy formula for the phase transition. Now to my topological structures when I put these magics in confinement, like I showed you before in the motivation. And this is just a brief outline of the chatter idea. So I think in the matic phase, we all agree how these topological defects look. So this plus one-half, this minus one-half. And now the idea, like indicated in the sketch, when we have a semectic and we look from very far away, okay, in confinement, there is a plus one-half defect, but in the end, as you all already Half defect, but in the end, as you already saw, in this maxis we have a grain boundary. Now, this grain boundary, when you look again for the same thing, you go a path along the whole grain boundary, see how your director changes, then you could in principle give a topological charge of Gaussian half to this grain boundary as a whole. And if you look even more detailed in it, you see that along this grain boundary, in the ideal case, the rods are pretty much perpendicular to each other. Pretty much perpendicular to each other. So, all the rotation of the director kind of happens at these endpoints. And this you can kind of account for with another symmetry, namely the tetratic one, which is not a symmetry intrinsic to the particles, which is kind of imposed by this nectar structure. So, when you kind of impose a fake symmetry of the particles by just drawing a cross, you can kind of go through this brain boundary. This grain boundary by saying, okay, I identify particular rocks with each other, and then we get quad rotation. And then we could define plus one over four and minus one over four tetradic defects at the endpoints of these grain boundaries. So this is the main idea, and this is now how we want to identify them. And this we do in confinement, and I think you also should also know all that we have in confinement when we have impose a particular alignment. Impose a particular alignment with a wall, which for hard rods is always preferably parallel. If it's not parallel, then we kind of assume that it should be parallel, which is kind of a virtual defect. So if you find this confusing, then that works indeed. I'm per particular. This is just then 3D is a virtual defect. So we have this charge conservation that for both symmetries, the charge individually adds up to the Euler characteristic, and this is a topological quantity. And this is a topological quantity, like so for the circular confinement we had so far, it is one, so we need to have two defects. Then, also the Audiengator, I want to consider different polygons, which have all the same Euler characteristic, but then when we dig a hole, then the Euler characteristic changes, and so do the topographic states. And even if we dug a second hole, this would be also the case. So can you go back for a second? Yes. So, just like when people try to put arrows on the When people try to put arrows on pneumatic directors. So suppose I look at your final, um, the bottom picture on the left. Yes? So how do you know how to lift that up to the magnetic? So you have this fourfold thing, but the reason you can have charge quarter defects is because it has its fourfold symmetry. So how do you know how to go backwards? How would you get to B? C? From C to B. Because I understand. I understand that you can tell me that there's a global twist, but there's an equivalent. So if I took B and rotated everything by pi on 2, that would be a different structure. That should be the same in the C L C two language, right? I think so. I don't think we'll understand directly. So the thing is that this is, of course, not a particle symmetry, but the idea is just to kind of remove the grain boundary. And if you rotated any the director field overall, you would still have a particular directors here, right? Right, but if you rotated all the directors in B by pi over 2. Then if you rotated them by pi over 2, you would get a different them by pi over two you would get a different you would get a different texture yep that would have the same c1 c2 well with the colors split what no the colors if it's really quite tetratic there are no columns that's not okay but then then either you have the line or you don't have the line so maybe you mean this that you kind of by only having the tetratic symmetry By only having the tetratic symmetry, you lose information about whether or not there's a grain boundary. That's exactly right. This is exactly the point. And also, I have this gateway, you really see this. So then you can't always go backwards and reconstruct? No, but we also never claimed this. And also the construction or the assembly idea we show later is always based on the grain boundary, just characterized by its endpoints. I see. So you always remove that. Never go to the endpoints. No, no. No, no, we really don't get this. We just say the analogy is grain boundary and the fine structure of it. And everything else we probably get here later on, yes? And can you measure, I don't know if it is a word, the width, the thickness of the grain bottom? Yes, but we do this by kinematic and tetratic order parameters, as I will show you in the next guide. Okay, that's Okay, I think I should now go further. So, now first going on: circular definitions again, as I just said. And this is hopefully already answers the first question. So, to illustrate this, it's not only that we look at the snapshot and draw this by eye, we also did the pneumatic and the tetratic field. So, just to summarize, so first thing, in this circular confinement, this state we call a bridge state, which is characterized by this big central domain separated by these grain. Separated by these grain boundaries, and when we do now the pneumatic order parameter field, you see these two dips where the pneumatic order is very low. And these are now the grain boundaries, which both taken together represent the discrimination or discrimination lines as we sometimes also call them for that fact that we consider the topological charge of Gaspar Nauf. And now in the tetradic field, you also see, of course, in a noisy way, because these are individual particles here very nicely, these four different regions. Very nicely, these four different regions where you have this class one over four defects at the end points. And this goes now here. Now you see the second point, probably pretty nicely because this is now our idea of going to the third dimension, just saying, okay, we know what's in a circular cross-section, so kind of extending it by having a cylinder or a spherical cap. And then if it's sufficiently shallow, you really see that. Shadow, you really see that you can do the same analysis in the third dimension by having in the pneumatic field kind of now brain boundary walls and in the tetratic field kind of tetratic pillars. And this kind of going back to the comment, if you only see the tetratic here, you would expect a complete symmetry. So you just have these four points that you could either think here is a nematic rate boundary or here. This is just the information which gets lost, but it still shows the defined structure and it gives you another way of tracking this defect. So this is kind of the idea behind it. And also for the spherical cap, you see the same thing here, only here in the cylinder case, you see at the wall that there's also some kind of mnemetic defect, which is due to the rock standing upright at the mantle. But you wouldn't see this in the tetratic, and this is all. See this in the tetratic, and this is also a nice thing while the tetratic symmetry is interesting to look at here. And just as a side note, what we did together with Michael and Rafael, the tetratic order parameter in 2D, has no direct analogy to the kubatic order perimeter in 3D. So that for a tetradic order parameter, which did exactly what we wanted here, being high in if the order is in that. In if the order is nematic or tetratic or cubatic, then we need to introduce a new tetradic order parameter because the cubatic order parameter is low in a purely nematic state. So this just as a side remark here. But the bottom line here is when we are in the shadow cavities, we still have this pseudo two D charge consolation and we just do the C Isis. And of course we know in 3D in general this does not hold and so we check those for gargoyle signatures. Which forgot your signatures, then, of course, the vertical domain, there's a complete different free vertical domain. And as I said in the beginning, I cannot now not talk about all the details I'm showing here, but I'm happy to take questions for the part of the talk so far. Otherwise, we'll just proceed. So, so far to the secular issue, now I'm going to pause. Issue now. I'm going to polygons, and as I said, the Euleristic doesn't change, and you consider different polygons. And this is kind of a little bit in the outline. So we have the same rich state, but we have now a different appearance of the topological defects. And I chose just the three representative polygons to illustrate this. So it's again always a gas one-half defect of both sides. So these green lines are just analyzing for the pneumatic defect. For the pneumatic defect. For example, here in this steptagon, you really have a network of this grain boundary, which in total is a Gaussian half-church. And here in the tetratic case, you really see where you can do contours through the grain boundary and then analyze your point defect. So to summarize, what you should see here is now when we have polygons, that these grain boundaries try really to anchor at the corners and with their positively. And with their positively charged end serum, which directly means for the triangle there must be one free-floating grain boundary and two here connected. So even this, which we call type A plus positive one-half grain boundary, this appears in very different shapes. So in the circle not attached, here in the triangle attached with one end, and so on. But the interesting thing is now in the pentagon, you have, of course, five plus one-fourth charges at the bottom. Of charges at the boundary. So, here this framework is really different from the other two because this is now without a charge. And you can really see this in the tetratic field that this guy here in the middle is negative. So, the charge conservation is very fine. And indeed, these two kinds, which when you just look at the fields, look very similar and just different from the kind of their building. And this is also what we suggest here. We have this dugadic box, and now when we get more corners, we can have. When we get more corners, we can kind of using these to kind of assemble these more complex networks here, which here now have a negatively charged node in between. And the second thing is when you increase the opening angle of these guys, you also kind of get gas pronounced defects, like for example comparing these two uncharged frame boundaries, this guy and the hashtag one, it does not really separate into Separate into two endpoint tetratic defects. It's kind of like they already have a near gate because the opening angle is just larger. And also, when the corners are round, then the frame boundaries do not that much kind of anchor. And this is the overall overview. So we can kind of go from a circle to a round triangle where the grain bars are not very much attached through all out all those polygons. out all those polygons until in the Dodekagon this looks very much again like a circle so we have again these four deep dots in the titratic field just like struggle. So any question on this part? And so this is practically all I wanted to talk about in this paper here where we introduced the idea of these different shades of one and the same memetic defect in one and the same state. All at the same stage. Yes. Does it mean the fact that uh that it attaches to the bone? Does it finally mean that the most expensive defect is not exactly the grand boundary, but the the and the facility of the you see this very much in the in the square which has in particular no tetratic defect. It's also always effectively at Effectively at the boundary while you have some nematic defects somewhere in the middle, which would kind of not matter whether or not you had this defect. Plus, also, if you would fit the rods perfectly to the ball, then you would just misalign and drew out the boundaries. So the shape here is really more or less arbitrary. In the end, it's all about kind of still having to cope with violating some agreement at any point on the system. Maybe I need a little bit more to understand, especially the ectagon. I really don't see the grain boundary at all in the middle. Like it looks very smooth to me. Here? Yeah. This guy. Yes. Yeah, it is smooth. And this is what I said. It's just because the angle is so large, you barely see it, and in some way it becomes more or less in. Becomes more or less indistinguishable from having no grain boundaries. And this is kind of when you go from the Dodeka gone and the angle is so large that also your Gangst scale is comparable to the Rod Gangst scale, you kind of would not even see the corner. So also the main message here in the pentagon, you see a clearly isolated tetratic defect, so you see the separation into this fine structure, but here in the heptagon, it kind of gradually dissolves and the defects allegate. Dissolves and the defects allegate until they would be completely gone, like in a good loading control. Yes, something like that. So the perfect defect would be in the square because it's exactly sitting at the corner. Here you also see very nicely these defects in addition with this negative one and just increasing the angle, then it kind of. Then it kind of slowly annegates because it's still a defect pair, a plus and minus defect pair here. We would just say it has annihilated, and eventually it's just done. So then there are still some artifacts. In going between your triangle and your guitar pick, the derivative on the recorder is somehow controlling the angle and how close the angle is. And how close the end gets to the corner? On everything, of course, on average, these are representative snapshots. So it's not that in the triangle, it'll always be in the corner. So in the triangle, I think that it is pretty much always in the corner. Sometimes in this round triangle, there would also be in the corner. We did some statistics on that. This was just kind of illustrating a smooth decision from a circuit of the triangle. Recognition from the circuit of the triangle or from any polygon all around the polygons to be sharp angles. I see possibly Amon that the value of the order of parameters, the dematic order of parameter at the defect varies with the geometries. And especially, for example, it's the lowest, I understand, for the square one, where it has it coincidence or no, in the square. Coincidence? No, in the square, it's also related to the angle. So, in a square, it's just the sharpest defect. Yes, in the pentagon, you also see it nicely, and then in the end, you kind of enforce so many varieties in the system that it would still apply, but not exactly. So it it really So, if you design an algorithm to detect these defects, and this is also what you kind of get from here to here, at some point you just wouldn't see them anymore because it will be expedient. But then it's interesting, you follow how the pneumatic order is lost, more or less, depending on the orientation, this orientation of the well model. It depends. You always have the grain boundary, but it kind of the perfect. Kind of the perfect perpendicular orientation gets a little bit washed out. Okay, then I should at least lose a few words about what we did for the animus. So now we changed the topology and this means also we can now we do not need a defect. So for now we have enforced defects by having all the characteristic ones. So this is again the bridge state in some different Different representation, and now we're really comparing on one-to-one level the experiments to my DFT results, and this is always the order parameter. So, this is what we have with the bridge set. And now we dig a hole inside, and this generates at the hole or the inclusion to additional minus one-half grain boundaries, which are usually shown by just a missile guidance or on a vertical level. Here, in an experiment, indeed, there's a single rod which Indeed, there's a single rod which really does the grain boundary here. But the idea is: okay, you can easily think when you just put a tiny hole, then this stage should be stable because it does not change much for the Bridge state. And we call this a gamma state because gayers kind of go around this inclusion like in a gamut of glow. But um in general, in both in bridge and gameter state the um symmetric gaiter spacing is kind of um the same as in Baum. Of the same as in bound, the gauze just have to cope a little bit with the geometry of the inclusion, which kind of can make a problem to the general structure. Then there is another state, and this is also very nice that Jonathan mentioned that yesterday, that there is a nice analogy pointed out by Deschens in 72 between the edge dislocation in band smacks, or it's gate smacks depending on whether you're talking on gales or orientation. On Gales or orientation is analog to this apricos of 46. And so this is why we term this state Shubnikov state, which has kind of a director which just goes around in circles. So the gauze is split and this is kind of relaxed by all these edge dislocations. But this comes, of course, the benefit of having no topological defect in terms of grain boundary here. Just having to kind of accommodate these layers through. Accommodate these layers throughout the system. So, this is the Shupnikov state. We also find this to be stable. And of course, in between, you kind of could have composites of these states, which would correspond to one minus and one plus one half defect. So, I call this composite Gaddiner-Shubnikov because one side is just one side is Gaddiner. And indeed, now when you see there are always constraints given by these inclusion to the Gadminer state and Inclusion to the Gamma state, and by forming such a composite, these constraints can be relaxed because Liga's are not that much constrained by the symmetry of the system. Okay, and finally in the experiments there is also a very interesting state, the domain state. And here we have radial grain boundaries, which are, however, as we then find out, and this was actually the main motivation of looking at the topological charge of these guys. Here, these grain boundaries have zero charge. And so the topology. Zero charge. And so the topology is the same as in the Schupnikov state. And this is a point which I will briefly mention when I get to the theoretical basic paper. So this is the overview of what we have in the experiment. When we do the experiments, or I did not do them, but Louis, he did them several times. He looked at the states, and in the end, he kind of got a statistic. So in this space diagram is now the relative frequency of observed states, and what we see. And what we see here is zero inclusion size, so this practically bridge state to gauge inclusion sizes, so a gauge hole in between. So, what we really see is a transition from Gaminer to Shutnikov and very weird stuff going on in between. And this now we looked at with the density functional theory. So, we reproduced again all of these states. And as I said, in DFT, we kind of impose all these structures and compare the free energy. And this we did here. And this we did here. This is also similar to what Patrick showed, just in a different way out. So, here is the free energy difference to the minimum. So, the minimum state is always the one on the bottom, and the others have higher free energy. And we kind of followed similar structure and we found several structural transition, in particular from gamminaria composite to Shubnikov. So, confirming what we see in the experiments. And also, we found different gaminar structures. So, we again also have very So, we again also have very different minimizers which sensitively depend on the geometry. And this is then the main thing we find here. So, an indirect Shuknikov transition and no stable domain structures. And this is what I said. If I initialize a domain structure in a DFT, they just evolve into a Shupnikov state. So, there are maybe different things in the experiments for evolved which have stabilized this guy. So, now doing what we just looking at in the Shupnikov. We just looking at Mavina Shutnikov from what we did here. So, looking where this transition between these two clean states happens and drawing these points into the experimental state diagram kind of very nicely confirms the trend of the experiment that we have this transition. And we also see when we increase the size of the system that the Schutnikov state becomes more stable. And this is regated that the curvature of these boundaries becomes low, so it's not such a big deal to define. Not such a big deal to deform these layers. Okay, so one result which I like very much I want to show you in the end. This is now related to the layer spacing. And you see this even when you look at these microscopic or these close-ups of the structures. So the thing is when you have an edge dislocation, this also informs the layers around it, which you see here on both sides. So also edge dislocations, as you of course know, they cost some kind of energy. Course, know they cost some kind of energy, as well as does when you kind of stretch the gayer spacing. So, in the end, what we get from the theory, and what is nicely confirmed in experiments, is that it's not, you cannot expect a particular number of edge dislocation just from imposing the bike nayer spacing everywhere in the system, but indeed it's a competition between these two, which means that the outer wall here, the nail spacing is the outer than in bulk, and at the Larger than in bulk, and the inclusion is smaller, and this reduces the number of edge dislocation at the cost of kind of an egastic layer deformation. And this we found a very nice trend in both TFT and experiment, which really confirmed this. And really cooking here, even at the inclusion, the layers even tilt, and so the layer spacing is even shorter than you could get by having perfect parallel guidelines on this interface. On this interface. And just in one example, here, these are these two points. So, this is a very low gauer spacing here, which is free to close packing of tilted gauge in your outside is a much larger than in bulk. Okay, this is what I wanted to say about the animals. The rest I could skip depending on the time. So I think it's about to, I think we should close with the questions. Goes to the question. So, just to mention, we have done this, and this is also worked together with Pedrick with two holes. We have several questions of now the layer orientation of structure between the inclusion. And one thing maybe I mentioned, what I find nice is we have a tilt angle of the semantic layers which go through the inclusion, which is preferredly relatively large. So, this is a what a typical structure should look like. And also the experimental and numerical statistics indicate the same trend. The same trend, and with this, I want to conclude just showing everything I did so far. So, saying, okay, geometry can change the shape of the defects, topology can change the type of the defects and induce a competition between these two. If we induce a second hole, we both change the topology again and we also break the symmetry, so there's even more possibilities going on. And if we are only in relatively shared categories, Are only in relatively shared cavities, all the structures persist in the third dimension. With this, I want to show you the nice cover picture which Powell drew for a paper on the 3D brain boundaries, and I want to thank you for your attention. Any last questions? Uh so uh thanks, really interesting. Uh thanks. Really interesting. Um so I was thinking about uh this diagram which as a function of the size of the whole uh the the you know the system uh changes. Um I was somehow a little bit surprised that there is nothing let's say magical about you know something that happens when the size of your diameter of your hole is exactly the same length as one or two or three. Length as one or two or three layers. It does, indeed. But it's on a fine scale, so it's exactly this. So, in the experiment, you couldn't see it because also it's difficult to reproduce exactly the same cavity multiple times. But indeed, this is slightly non-monotonic here, and this is really related to how the particular geometry fits. And also, what has happened here, this is kind of so, as I said, there should pick off as the So as I said, the shoot becomes the state becomes gas and gets stable. But eventually here there there is just no gamminer state possible anymore to because no rod would be able to stand upright if the overall size of the final becomes so small. So these are really microscopic effects which we can capture with the theory. I'm not sure it's a very good question, but do you think that these results bring also information on the structures that are formed by molecules? This was also the question I was addressing yesterday and how much this can be translated. So, in general, my impression is that these brain boundaries. These brain boundaries need some kind of release rigidity of the galaxies. So I would really like to see this stuff in molecules, but I would not bet my life on it. Yes, but it is kind of much softer. If you have an observation that the curvature has a minimization of energy in some way, then you could adapt your result for this. Result for the specific free boundary, and then inside we would obtain the same results that you do. So, what I want to say is that the free boundary could be the result of in a humanization of components, okay? But once you have it and you observe it, and you want to have the information about how it is inside, then we could use your your system. Your system with this closed boundary to know how it is exactly. It's weird. A lot of people think molecules are harder mass machines. Yeah. I know why you think. Except for the tails. Except for the tails. Part of the knowledge. Is it it becomes like exponentially more difficult to like More difficult to like put a second species of particle in here. In the computer simulation, it does not at all become more difficult. In DFT, also not that much, but one would of course need to re-integrate the stuff. But in print, you can see if smaller particles tended to reside on domain layers and if they don't. Usually, expects different lights, they separate. Yes. Lines, they separate. Yes. Or they at least would destroy clean pictures. Well, no, you can have B201. No, if the concentration is small enough, it would be very interesting to check. You know, it's funny, right? Because although it would be smaller than the spectrogens, but when the physics, when the physics, the American Philosophy Society advertises, they didn't talk about kids, they talked about hot down three. That's nice. Yeah, we couldn't do it. We couldn't change it, right? No, no. It was a woodwick, okay, as America for that, yeah. I also didn't suggest hitches, but so the hot dogs were there for me. And we focused on the physical parts on that, yeah. All right, well now let's uh back in again.
