I want to thank the organizers for the invitation. Thank you very much. So, this is a joint work with Mero de Pino, Gianthos Bo, Monica Musso, and Yun Cheng Wei. And it's on the Keller-Siegel system, the classical parabolic elliptic system in dimension two, and with critical mass. So the system is here. So, the system is here, you represents a cell density that diffuses randomly, let's say, but also is moved due to a drift. And the drift is generated by V, which solves Laplacian V, or is a solution of Laplacian minus Laplacian V equal to U, but we select a particular solution given by the convolution with the Newton potential. And we consider this model. This model with positive conditions, but because most of the works are in that setting. And we are interested in the phenomenon of blow-up when the total mass, which is the integral of U, is equal to the critical mass. So let me talk a little bit about this. So let's say for solutions with sufficient decay, the mass The mass, which is the integral of u in the whole plane, is preserved in time. Okay, and then it was observed by Jaeger and Lookhaus that if the mass is small, then the solution is global in time. And if the mass is large, then the solution glows up in finite time. And then there is a precise threshold, which is mass equal to 8 pi, that divides the regimes. The regimes of global solutions versus a finite time blow-up. This was found by Dolbo and Pertin and Lanchet Dolbo and Pertin. And to explain a little bit this number 8 pi, let me recall here an identity satisfied by solutions of this equation. So if the solution has sufficient decay, one can define the second moment as the, well, the integral of the density times x. integral of the density times x squared. And again, if the solution decays sufficiently fast, then the time derivative of the second moment is equal to an explicit expression, a constant that depends on the mass. And mass equal to eight pi makes this constant here on the right hand side equal to zero. And mass with different than eight pi would make the constant over here either negative or positive. Either negative or positive. So this is an important quantity for the equation if it is defined. And there are other quantities that are conserved. For example, the center of mass. So the integral of u times any of the coordinate functions, again, is constant if the solution decays fast enough. So if the second moment is finite, then integrating Integrating the time derivative formula, so we get the initial second moment plus a constant here times t. And if n is bigger than 8 pi, then the constant in front of t here is negative. And because we are working with positive solutions, which is preserved by the flow, then the solution cannot be well defined for all times. Okay, because the right. Times okay, because the right-hand side over here becomes negative in finite time. On the other hand, well, if the solution has mass a pi, then actually the second moment is constant along the solution. And if the mass is less than a pi, then the second moment, so this expression over here, it tends to infinity because this factor over here is positive. And actually, the solution behaves, well, it goes. Well, it goes to zero, behaves a little bit like the solution of the heat equation. And the asymptotic profile and the analysis of this situation was done in several works that I list here, Nagai, Campos, and Dolgo, Gagne, Fernandez, and Mishner. We are interested in the case of mass equal to 8π, but let me comment briefly about the super comment briefly about the supercritical case so the supercritical mass and bigger than a pi so formal expansions of the of the form of finite time global were found by rir and velastis and velastis in these words were here and there are a rigorous constructions of finite time block solutions by raphael and schwyer in the real case and by collotte gulma smud in the lot Guli mass mudian nuyen in the non-regular case. In this situation the solution concentrates in a way that u forms a direct delta with mass 8 pi plus a more regular part. But from now on we are interested in the case of mass equal to 8 pi and then what happens depends on the second moment on the initial. Second moment on the initial second moment of the solution. So, if you allow an initial condition with, let's say, slow decay so that the second moment is infinite, then several things can happen. You can, well, there are stationary solutions that I will describe a bit later, and the solution could converge to one of these stationary solutions. These stationary solutions, or actually, it could also oscillate between different stationary solutions if the second moment initially is infinite. And if the second moment at time zero is finite, then it was proved by Lacheck, Carrillo, and Masmoudi that the solution as t goes to infinity, because the solution is global in time, they must still blow up as t goes to infinity, but the blow-up takes the form of a direct. form of a of a direct delta multiplied by 8π and the direct delta is centered at the point q the center of mass of the of the initial conditions and so it is this case that i want to to discuss more precisely so when the mace when the mass is equal to a pi and the second moment is finite then we know that the solution blows up in infinite time and you And u concentrates like a delta times eight pi. But we are interested in a more precise description of this concentration. And well, an important tool before discussing this form of concentration is a Lyapunov functional and some steady states of the equation. So the following expression over here, whenever it is well defined, is Liabinov functional for the equation. Lyabunov functional for the equation. That means that the time derivative is less or equal than zero. Actually, the time derivative has this explicit expression over here and is less or equal than zero. And this functional capital F of U appears also in a well-known inequality. The Loberinik had this big solo inequality, states that among functions with the correct decay. The correct decay for this to make sense, and with mass equal to it pi, okay, the functional capital F is minimized and the minimizers are known. So the minimizers of the functional are given by this function u0 and the translations and dilations of the function u0. So these are the dilations that preserve the mass, okay? And this function. To mass, okay, and this function over here has mass. So, this inequality was proved by Carlin and Laws, and a stability version of the inequality was given by Carlin and Figali. Okay, so since for solutions of the Keller-Sigal problem, the time derivative of the functional is negative, one may imagine that along a trajectory, the trajectory the the the functional f approaches its minimum and the derivative so this this expression approaches zero so if you imagine that the solution is settling to something that something should satisfy that the integral over here is equal to zero and if you make the change in value u equal e to the v then v satisfies the yivill equation But solutions of the Livir equation with mass finite are classified. And well, we have this family of solutions. So V is either the function gamma zero or suitable translations and scalings of the function gamma zero that is over here. Okay, and if we recall that U is e to the v, then we find that the following functions are steady states of the Keller CL system with mass equal to eight pi. And furthermore, an observation here is that, well, the second moment of these steady states is infinite because these functions just barely don't have the k to make the integral finite. make the integral finite and so when i was talking before that if the initial conditions are i mean the case slow in particular you could think of a steady state as initial condition then the solution can do several things for example if you start with with an initial condition which is very close in some sense to to this u zero then the solution will converge to u zero. The solution will converge to U0. But you have also a family of steady states, and there are also some initial conditions which produce oscillation between these steady states, all with infinite second moments. Okay, still the interest here is the case of mass equal to a pi and finite second moment. And so there were some formal works trying to describe the Trying to describe the precise asymptotic behavior by Joanne Siri and by Campos. So they find that the density should behave like a scaling of the function U0 that I gave you before, and that the scaling is a function lambda of t that has a precise rate of going to zero. Lambda t is more or less like one over square root of log of t. And recently. And recently, there was a ribrows construction by Gould and Masmoudi of a regular solution that has this profile. Of course, this expansion, when I write that small u is approximately given by this, is up to a certain distance because further away, the solution will decay faster than the solution of the Keller serial system. But let's say on compact set, you would expect this type of behavior. And the result of which. And the result of Guillaume Masmoudi also includes a stability result, saying that once you know a radial initial condition that produces blow-up with the profile given above, then perturbing that radial initial condition in the class of radial functions and with mass A pi, and so that the perturbation has fast decay, you still have the same profile. The same profile for the blow-up of the solution. And so, our main result here is that one can go outside of the radial class. So, the result is that there exists some initial condition with mass equal to pi and finite second moment, so that for this initial condition, but also for any Also, for any other initial condition which is close to this one, u0 star, with mass 8π, but not necessarily radial, the solution still blows up in the form that was described before. So it is a scaling of the function u0, that is scaling that preserves mass, with the parameter lambda t having this expansion over here. So the difference with respect to the previous... The difference with respect to the previous work is that here, so we produce one initial condition and a neighborhood in the class of functions with mass. And this neighborhood allows us to consider non-radial initial conditions. So we can produce non-radial solutions to the Keller-Segual system that have infinite time blow-up in a very precise way. And so the techniques we used here can Here can be extended in several ways. One can consider the situation with a supercritical mass, with the mass n bigger than 8 pi times an integer k. In that case, the solution is known to blow up in finite time, but we can produce a solution with a blow-up profile, which is very precise. It's a sum of the functions u0 scale around points that can be. Around points that can be prescribed and with parameters lambda j of t that have this asymptotic formula over here. So a version of this was obtained by Colot, Gulm, Asmoudi and Nuyen, where they find finite time blow up, but blow up at a single point. So this is blow up at several points, well, with a certain rate and mass superscript. And mass superfluid. One can construct also or give a rigorous construction of a solution predicted formally by Secchis, Guillama, and Pelaskis, where the solution blows up at a cluster of points that all of them are approaching a fixed point, in this case, the origin. So the result is that there are initial conditions. Is that there are initial conditions? So, the solution blows up in finite time, and the blow-up profile is over here. So, you see that we have the same function from before, the U0, the steady state of the Keller-C0 system, but now it's centered at a point which moves with the speed, which is the self-similar speed for this finite time blow-up. So, all of these blow-up points are approaching the origin as T goes to capital. The origin as t goes to capital T, which is the time of global. And well, the points have the form of square root of capital T minus T times Aj. The Aj's have to be solutions of a particular system, algebraic system of equations. And in particular, one can find solutions to this system that are arranged as vertices of a regular polymer. Okay, so this is the first reverse construction of this clustering blow-up for the Keller siege system in finite time in finite time. And a third extension is that I mentioned that a result by Carlin and Figali just gives that for That for suitable initial conditions close to a steady state, the mission converges to maybe another steady state in the family. Although the result given by them gives a very weak rate, but let's say explicit rate of convergence, one can get better rates of convergence, algebraic rate of convergence, if we assume. If we assume that the difference between the initial condition and the steady state has some decay, okay, I'm getting a bit loose about what is the correct decay, but if we assume a correct decay and smallness for the difference of the initial condition and the steady state, then we can get convergence of the solution of the K-L-Sigal system with an algebraic decay in time. The previous result by Carlier and Figalli gives a decay in time that is something like one over. That is something like one over the square root of log. So, let me give you this formal argument to describe the rate of blow-up, in particular how the parameter lambda behaves, because it is closely connected to the method of proof of this result. So, the formal argument goes as follows: you assume that you have. As follows, you assume that you have a solution of the Keller C system that is close to this function u0, small u0. Small u0 is capital U0, the explicit steady state. I'm centering here at the origin for simplicity scale by a parameter lambda, which is unknown and for which we want to get a formula. And I am putting here a parameter alpha zero of t that I will explain in a minute what is the row. Is the row, and so we take just a scaling of the function u0, but because u0 decays slow and we are working in the setting of finite second moment, so we want some decay at infinity, I will put a cutoff function that makes this u zero, makes it equal to zero if the modulus of x is bigger than, let's say, two times the square root of t minus t. square root of t minus t. Okay, so this is a cutoff at this similar region so that the whole function over here has a well compact support, growing support, but compact, and it is an approximation of the scaled function capital U0. So the parameter alpha zero of t is chosen so that the mass of this explicit construction over here is a pi. And well, a computation gives. Well, a computation gives that alpha zero of t has to be a main order one, and then there is an expansion in t that you can compute. There is lambda squared over t times a constant. The constant depends on the cutoff. Lambda is for the moment unknown. Okay, so if u0 is close to be a true solution to the problem, okay, with mass eight pi, because this is the choice of the parameter alpha zero, then the second moment identity should say that. Moment identity should say that the time derivative of the second moment of this expression should be zero, okay, it should be approximately zero. So I'm neglecting here a lower order terms. And then if one substitutes the explicit formula for the function lift u0 over here and computes the second moment, so imposing that the second moment, so that this expression here is constant in time, leads to an equation. leads to an equation for lambda which is lambda squared times the log of square root of t over lambda should be a constant and this gives lambda t of the order of one over square root of log of t okay so going to the proof of the of the main theorem so we we construct an initial approximation which is based on this function u zero but more complicated. More complicated. One slight difference is that there are certain parameters, alpha, lambda, and we also shift the center of blow-up. And so alpha, lambda, and c, which is the center of the scale function u0, are parameters that for, let's say, are free to be chosen. Chosen in some way. So then, so after we construct the function u star, we try to find estimates. So if u is the solution of the Keller C system and we decompose u as u star, the explicit construction plus the function bar phi, which is supposed to be small, then we write an equation for bar phi and try to get estimates for the function bar phi. Barphi. And the estimates for this bar phi are based on estimates of a linearized operator. So this phi satisfies a non-linear equation, but let's say that if you linearize it, then you get a linear equation for which so that I mean this linear equation is the central part of the work. And we show that we can get good estimates for phi if the parameters lambda, alpha, and c are adjusted in a suitable way, so that some conditions that I call here orthogonality conditions are serviced. And then in one word, I will say that it is convenient to separate the analysis of the operators and of the remainder here of phi. Remainder here of phi into different regimes depending on whether we are far away or close to the point of blow-up. So let me go a little bit into more details. So I recall here, so this is now the function U0 is the same one as I wrote before, but alpha is a certain parameter which is close, very free from the moment, but close to what we expect to be. Lambda is also. Lambda is also free but close to what we expect to be, and C is free is close to what we want, which is a fixed point. And so we take the scale function capital U0, the scale steady state, scale by lambda, and center at C. And alpha is there somehow to adjust the mass. So let's say that this is our first approximation. Then let me discuss what happens if we try to linearize around this approximation. We linearize the Keller-Sigrett equation. Approximation. We linearize the Keller-Sigrett equation. So let's say that we call S of U the operator that we want to make equal to zero. So E here is the convolution within Newtonian potential. This is convolution within Newtonian potential of U. And then we linearize. So we imagine that we want to compute the operator applied to U0 class phi. And what we find is that this is equal to the operator applied. equal to the operator applied to u0 plus a linear here what i'm trying to highlight here is a linear parabolic operator in phi okay plus a quadratic remainder and the the parabolic operator is a time derivative equal to this operator that is what appears when you linearize this operator over here so Operator over here. So the main paragraph equation that we have to study is time derivative of phi equal to this expression over here, which is, let's say, Laplacian plus other terms, in particular it's a non-local operator of far and equal to a certain right-hand side. So a big part of the work deals with estimates for solutions to this equation. For solutions to this equation in inert2 with appropriate initial conditions. And what we want to do is find estimates for this under suitable conditions. Now, because of the form of the... So this function little u0 is a scaling of a steady state and this scaling suggests that to study what happens to the perturbation phi near the robot point. Near the global point, if we want to consider it near the global point, we have to scale it in the same way. So we are going to write the perturbation of the solution as in the same way as before, as one over lambda squared times a function of a variable that we call y. It's the variable shifted so that it's centered at c and scaled by lambda. And in this way, the linear operator applied to R becomes. applied to R phi becomes essentially, except for this factor lambda minus four, becomes an operator L0 applied to capital phi. Here is the relation between the two. And the operator capital L0 is very explicit, is the one over here, and actually is the one that you get if you take this linear equation and you linearize it around the steady state capital U. steady state capital U0. If you take that equation linearized around capital U0, you will find this parabolic problem. Now, so we want in these variables, we want to get estimates for solutions of this parabolic problem. So let me comment very quickly about just the leptic part. Okay, so if you consider the lytic So, if you consider the litig problem, L0 of phi equals h. And well, this is a relatively nice operator that you can analyze mode by mode. You can decompose phi and h in Fourier modes in the variable theta. So I'm thinking that r and theta are polar coordinates. And just to give some of the results, I will assume that it's radial. You can do it in full generality this morning. In full generality, this analysis, but let's say for simplicity that everything is radio. So if you assume that H has zero mass and fast decay, then you can construct a decaying solution to this problem. And one thing that you see in Miat is that somehow you need the right-hand side to have zero mass. But the other observation is that if H, so together with having zero mass, has a zero. With having zero mass has a zero second moment, then the behavior of the solution is better, it's even better. And then there is another which is also important: the mass of the solution is zero if and only if the second moment of the right-hand side is zero. And this operator over here has a kernel, it's an explicit function that I call here capital set of zero. It's given in terms of the function capital U0, and so this kernel. Use zero. And so this kernel is explicit. You know very well it's the k, it's decay is like one over modulus of y to the four. And so if you don't, if you're not careful with the kernel, you can pick up solutions that don't decay as fast as you want. Now, so these are more or less the features of this linear equation. And so let me try to describe a little bit something about the parabolic problem. So we have So we have for the variabolic problem, we know this operator and zero, we have two types of estimates. In one version, we find an estimate for the solution that somehow loses a power of t with respect to the right-hand side. So I will be slightly more precise in the next slide, but I imagine that h decays to zero as time goes to infinity in an algebraic rate. So one over t to the nu will be the decay of h. Over t to the nu will be the decay of H. And we find also decay on solution, but the solution decays less than the right-hand side, and there is a loss. And in one version, well, we only assume mass zero for the right-hand side, in this version, we lose one power of t. And if we assume second moment equal to zero of the right-hand side, then we can achieve a better estimate losing only one t to the one-half. Okay, so let me. Okay, so let me try to be more precise here, but this is more technical. So we take norms which are weighted and infinity norms. So we want, for example, the right-hand side to have a certain decay that is a power of t modified by a log. Okay, this is technical, the important thing is this power only. And with a certain space decay, and there is a certain modification that we have to do to this weight inside or outside. Inside or outside of the similar region. Okay. So there is a parameter. This is the most important parameter, the time decay. There is also space decay. Time decay, let's assume, is between one and three halves. And then there are some small other parameters, sigma, epsilon, that let's say we assume they are small. And this is a way to avoid some, let's say, resonant estimates in the results. So the first result I stated here for. The first result I stated here for regular symmetry functions because this is what we need, that can be done more generally, is that if the mass of h is zero and if h has a bound like this, you find a similar bound, but the important thing is that you will lose one power of time in this estimate. So if the right-hand side decays like one over t to the nu, the solution is one power less. And the second result is now for general h assume. Now for general H, assuming mass equal to zero, center of mass equal to zero, and second moment equal to zero. So if the side decays like one over t to the nu, the solution still decays and we lose a one half. And these two results are slightly, they are connected. So what we do is in the first proposition, let's say the one that is where we lose a lot in the Where we lose a lot in the estimate. In reality, what we do is we prove a decomposition of the solution. The solution can be decomposed in two parts: phi perb plus the element of the kernel times a function of time alone. And phi perb has, let's say, bad decay in space, but has good decay in time. And the second term in the decomposition has good decay in time, one of our modules of white. One of our modules of y to the four here, but has slow decay in time. Okay, and we obtain this estimate, we multiply, I mean, we use the test function, analyze the quadratic form, and so on. And then there is a bit of the solution that is very difficult to estimate. And this is the bad part of the solution. Now, for the second estimate or the second procedure, Or the second proposition, if we want to find an estimate for this solution over here and putting all these zero initial conditions, sorry, I forgot this. Then, well, one trick that we do here is to formally apply an inverse of the operator L0. So if you apply an inverse, somehow you are left or left to this equation over here. So where capital H is an inverse constructed by hand of the function small h. function small h okay now for this one you can apply the first proposition and find the composition like this okay and and now the solution to this problem phi well is zero applied to the whole thing but because this element is in the kernel this part drops and so so you get only l0 of the function capital phi perp which has better decay in time Has better decaying time than the rest here that somehow got absorbed by the operator L sigma. Okay, I think my timing is up. Thank you for your attention.
