And Christophe, are you ready? So, our first speaker this morning then is Christophe Boone, and he'll tell us about homogeneous Einstein analogies. Yeah, thanks a lot for invitation to be here and for the possibility to give a talk. It's my first time at that. It's fantastic, basically. So, I've been asked to give a survey on homogeneous Einstein many points. So, the idea is like, I mean, there's a first part, first half an hour, I will give really an overview, what do we know and what not, yeah. And then in the second part, I will go a little bit deeper in some methods which might be also of interest. What methods are used. So, let me spend five minutes on the general situation, how I see it. So, I mean, this talk is going to be complete. It will be many, yeah. So, of course, maybe we see some separated metrics. And then, of course, yeah, and for this one called Einstein. What is called Einstein? Christopher, is there anything darker by any chance? It's not showing up on the region of the metric, lambda denoting the Einstein constant, yeah. Of course, yeah, physics, comes from physics. So my point is you should think about, I think about this as a system of PPEs, yeah, and you may very well think about a system of PPEs. Very, very simple about the system of the typical, but think about this, yeah. And so that kind of means, just this means to me is like on a compact manifold, of course, then you have a maximum principle, so you have obstructions, so to speak, whereas on a non-compact manifold, there are no obstructions in this sense, possibly. So I expect on compact manifolds to be more rigid compared to many anti-gaffling polymorphic functions on CD. Polymorphic functions on C, yeah, but if I ask the functions we found it, yeah, then you have this. So, okay, just five minutes. The story depends a lot on the lambda, yeah, which real number, yeah. So if lambda is positive, then manifold must be compact by user. And I will strict mainly to compact ones. Restrict mainly to compact ones, even so later I will switch back. And kind of it's fair to say, so there are many examples, yeah. And symmetry assumptions are possible, yeah? I will come to this, yeah. So many, yeah, and this could be out of. And this could be outer symmetry or inner symmetry. I will not say too much. Now, still keeping compact, I mean compact. So, saying very special exemplars. Referring to special monomy, of course. And finally, still compact, yeah. I'd say very few. Let me comment on this, yeah? Of course, here we have the K-La ones, yeah? But if you say, well, for now, I don't consider the K-La ones, yeah? So then it's very short the list here, yeah? But here too, yeah? And if I say very few, I would like to remind you, also my colleague John Loca, yeah. Look at the arch showed that negative reaching no obstruction whatsoever. And it's not only true that you have no obstructions whatsoever, I mean these metrics they are many, yeah? I mean they are dens in C0, yeah? Many many of these guys. Many of these guys here. So naively would expect many examples here, yeah? And the more positive the curvature gets, the less examples you would expect. Matter of factly, it's the other way around. Okay, so as I say, many many things could be said. Many people should be mentioned. I'm sorry, this is a five-minute thing, and I was asked to speak about homogeneous isometrics, yeah, but that's like. Homogeneous isometrics, yeah, but that's like, yeah, maybe in general, yeah. That's of course a non-compact, sorry, yeah, and I don't say anything about this, yeah? Okay, so now when we call this a homogeneous space, yeah, which is called space is the isometry group. On the manifold itself. So these are kind of, if you think about geometrically, easiest examples of remaining manifolds, but also the most boring ones. So you can't tell, are you Canada or are you in Germany? Local neighborhoods look alike kind of pretty boring universe. Still, of course, mathematically, Still, of course, mathematically, you would like to understand them. Because later, if you assume less symmetry, this is, of course, a lot of symmetry, the highest amount of symmetry, they may show up as orbits and then may come back to you. You want to say something about the geometry of orbits, whatever, and if you don't know, well, then you have a problem. Okay. Um yeah, so let me let me not start here. I will do the slides, I will start here. I will go simply together. Well, then go sit into that. So I'm done. Serum, yeah. So that's a very easy story, yeah. So there's a serum Sievsky seven five ancient guardiness. More genius really flat space is flat, yeah, so pretty pretty boring, so to speak, yeah? No new examples. I mean, there's a very nice proof, yeah? It's a geometric proof. You use this flipping CRM, yeah, you check, and then you if the spaces. And then if the space is non-compact, you split off lines, yeah? So you can reduce it to the compact case and you use bottleneck. But somehow it's not trivial, so to speak. And the question here is to me, one big question I would write normally, but I only say the big question is provide algebraically. You cannot prove this algebraically. Even worse, it seems to be really difficult. So you write down the region of homogeneous. Down the region of a homogeneous metric. I will not go to these theoretic things. You write it down, you assume it's zero, and what you want to show is not only the reach is zero, all section curvatures are zero. This is what you have to show. What they normally say is if you don't have a permanent position, don't do it. People try for 50 years, yeah. It's difficult. Okay, so so, yeah. Okay, so yeah, so that's completely understood. Of course, notice if you drop the assumption being homogeneous only to combo GP1, yeah, orbits being hypersurface is wrong. I mentioned four, yeah, how many examples, yeah? So this is very special question. Excuse me, sir. Yes, I just check. Is this theorem assuming completions or no, no? No, no, yes. Yes, in the complete case, as I say, you use a splitting theorem, you convince yourself it's a homogeneous space, and then, I mean, there's a ray, and every non-compact manifold has a ray, but because of homogeneity, you pull back the ray from points lying out further and further, and you get a line. And because Ritchie is zero, non-negative, it splits off. So you split and split and split until the signal is compact. And then there's Bochner, yeah? You have Ritchie. You have Ritchie zero is less than or equal to zero, and you have killing fields. They must be parallel. That's it. So if you, but I mean, you see, it's quite some machine. The splitting theorem is not a piece of cake. So this is, so to speak, an algebraic problem. I should say this. This PD becomes now a system of algebraic equations. Okay. So that's completely understood. So that's completely understood. And then recently we made progress on the negative side. Einstein manifold. And Q is end up with zero is diffeomorphic to R. Okay, so the assumption is so to speak geometric, homogeneity plus Einstein, and the conclusion is topological, yeah? And there are two statements hidden, so to speak. One is you take a simply connected, non-compact. Connected, non-compact, of course, these things have to be non-compact, yeah? Homogeneous Einstein space, and then the CM says, well, cannot have topology, yeah, must be Rn. That's the one thing. The other thing is now you are on Rn, yeah, and you wonder, you have homogeneous Einstein magic, can you have quotients? That's a completely different question. Maybe at first not so interesting. We would like to understand the simply connected case first, and then go to quotients. It says, no, you can. Says no, you cannot even have Porsche. But this is maybe less interesting. Saying is simply connected, yeah? There cannot be topology. So it's like, yeah, I said this already, it's a set theorem. So what does it say? There are not many examples. If you like Einstein metrics, it's a bad theorem. It tells you as long as the topology you cannot have homogenous case. Again, all this is a Again, notice is again immediately wrong if you drop assumptions. You go to Komichi Yua, yeah? Many examples. Of course, all non-component. Okay, so a little bit history. Known and less than or equal to 10. And known means known up to finitely many spaces. I will not give you the list, yeah? I will not give you the list, yeah. There are results, yeah, and I would like to mention names here: Jensen Bono Roff 2000. Five I guess then La Fuente Arroyo Fuente seven. And then there were also partial results, yeah, by so they checked in these dimensions, yeah, with exceptions, yeah. I will give you one exception, yeah, showed that this is true, yeah. And then there were also partial results, yeah, more having more assumptions, yeah. Peter Peterson by Chablonsky and By Chablonsky and others could be deducted as now. Let me explain why it's difficult. So this was conjectured at 75, yeah. 55 dBT Alexa. So one open case is open. Open case was M8 SL3R. So I will. So, I will do a little bit of linear algebra, yeah? I'm sorry. Eight-dimensional Lie group, yeah? You consider left-invariant vector fields, yeah? Take a scalar product and the identity, yeah, and you move it around. That gives you a genus geometry that was open. Why is it difficult? Why? Well, there it is G left invariant. Yeah, I don't write it, I just say G with reaching G less zero. So your task is on S and 3R you have this left indiametric with negative Rigi curvature but you must show that you cannot improve negative Rigi to constant negative Rigi. That's a problem. And you must find obstructions. And you must find obstructions. And like here, in German case, of course, you don't have any obstructions whatsoever. And this is quite different compared to the Kayla case, of course. Of course, in the Kayla case, if you have negative 3G, Einstein 2. There is quite different. But here, this very special class is different. And that's why it's hard. Okay. Um just check time. If you have questions, you just ask it. You started a little earlier? A little late? Oh. Yeah, so you have to 10.02. Okay. Yeah, maybe then I do the next part a little quicker, yeah? So maybe let's not make it a zero, just the cotton. So now we know, yeah? I mean, so what do we know about hubergenius Einstein metrics on our edge? Alright, that's the next question. If you want to classify, uh, so genes Alright, of course, it's lambda negative, yeah, lambda zero we know, they're boring, yeah, we don't need to know, lambda positive must be compact, yeah, you have to disc, yeah, they are isometric. Symmetric Einstein solvent SG. So this is a one-connected solvent N group and down is a left and right matrix. This is of course semi-sync. It's maximum distance to solvent. So, yeah, so we are in this class. Yeah, so that is really a theorem, yeah. I won't say too much. And then, so we are back to this, yeah, and then you have the deep structure theory developed by Barvet and Heber for. And table four applies. So, this is the bracket language, if you know, if you have not heard about this, yeah. There's a deep structural theory for this very special homogeneous spaces, yeah? Initiated by Jan Saber, yeah, and yeah, I will say a little just kind of. bit more clients so so kind of there are g i t is arising at the horizon so to speak yeah here in this paper geometric invariance here yeah and you get you get estimates which you can use for the summons yeah so what's the upshot so the classification of these guys classification of Einstein solid Einstein solve reduces, can be reduced to the classification of Ni solidates. Meaning, you have a knee-potent Lie group and down with a left invariant, and you ask this appear knee-soliton. So Ricci soliton is expanding, but lambda. Is expanding, yeah. The lambda is always again negative, yeah, is never grading, yeah? Never grading, and it can never be trivial, yeah, it can never be Einstein, yeah. They are true solitons also, yeah. So this is, I don't tell you how to do this, yeah? Just saying this you can prove and this is considered easier, yeah? Still, this is kind of wide open, yeah. I mentioned seven and higher, yeah. It's not clear which Niopotent B group of two. Neil potent B group of two to carry any sort of or not. There are constraints, easy constraints, but they are with it, then it's a difficult problem. Okay, so still, we know a lot. We know the topology. That's the first result. The second result is we know the algebraic structure. So this is about the algebraic structure. But the final classification. But the final classification is not completed. Just to give you, maybe if you're not writing these machines spaces, you may wonder, how could our machine structure on the cleaning space look like not coming from solving negro? How is it possible? Well, give you an example. You all know, of course, special linear group, yeah? Two dimensions, yeah? Two dimensions, and you know, of course, the topology. What is it? It's S1 cross R2. Yeah, and therefore, the universal cover is R3. So, you take R3, you take K copies, well, R3K, K and this regroup is semi-simple, yeah. It's semi-simple, yeah? It's maximum distance to solvable, yeah? And you can, like here, you can ask, does this homogeneous space, does this Lie group with a left invariant match for this action? Does it or not? Now, if you maybe are lost or want to think about something, yeah. This theorem does not say that this phase does not admit a left invariant isometric. It doesn't say this. So there's an equivariant version which is still open. Okay. Yeah, so this is a Yeah, so this is a good pressures on this mark. So what's the change, the change in the 8 we see the form? Oh, the twiggle? Yes. That's the universal colour. I mean the product structure of why matters. Why don't you just appear the universal colour of the set of instead of the product structure? Well, topological. Well, topologically, it's a product. Right, I'm just asking if you just consider one component instead of a product space, then what's the difference? Well, I mean, it's dimension 3. Of course, in dimension 3, you know Einstein has constant curvature, yeah? So that's why it's kind of really boring. But already, two factors will be good enough, yeah? Two factors will be good enough. But dimension 3, of course, you can Of course, you know, okay. Okay, so this was lambda negative, number finally, lambda. Lambda negative. Now finally, lambda positive. Yeah, so it's an old theorem of mine with Megan Compact One connection homogeneous. Homogeneous base MN Admits homogeneous Einstein of course with and a bigger serial provided and And that's an equal 11. Let me make some comments on this. So, n equals 11 is optimal. So, there's a 12-dimensional homogeneous space. Yes, SU4, SU2. If you count dimensions, it's fine. Dimension of SU4 is fifteen, SU2 is three, fifteen minus three is twelve, yeah? 15 minus 3. 12, yeah? I had to tell you which SU2. I won't. So it is a 12-dimensional compact between the space, yeah? Well, special SU2, yeah. And it was discovered by a Kenzie Bank, Ziller, 86, yeah. So you cannot have any homogeneous Einstein magic. So there's a little subtlety here, yeah. Of course, in the category of pairs, yeah. G mod h, yeah, you can ask for a left invariant, g invariant Einstein matrix, but you can go back and say, no, I'm interested in this smooth 12-dimensional manifold, and I consider all homogeneous structures. There are spaces which admit infinitely many different homogeneous structures. The same smooth manifold, compact ones. Non-compact, clearly, a family of solo-bearing potent ones, families, yeah. Yeah, and they showed, well, no, we don't have it, yeah? So there's some topology here. So this looks like Einstein is a very weak condition, yeah? You always have it, yeah? But it's quite misleading, yeah? It's quite misleading. I'll come to this in a second, yeah. So large and it's wider. Meaning, the existence problem. You have a compact homogeneous basically connected. Does it mid-homogeneous isometric or not? Is that a strong condition or is there a weak condition? You would like to know. I mean, that's the case, of course, classification. But of course, you learn from the Kayla case, I mean, lambda negative is the easiest case, lambda zero, how. Lambda zero, harder, much harder, next case. And lambda positive, of course, is expected to be the most difficult case. Here, kind of oximilar, yeah. You do not even have a conjecture, yeah? There's no conjecture even seen at the horizon which phases should and shouldn't have. Okay, I should be precise here, yeah. So now this line is only for specialists, yeah, not being afraid of lead groups, yeah. So we take a So we take a G mod H, yeah, this is a manifold, but then what we do is sometimes a smaller beak group acts still transitive. So we consider a possibly different presentation. It's the same smooth manifold, but this is a sub, maybe a subgroup. And then we consider only these spaces. So the advantage of this process is The advantage of this process is we may have more metrics. So, the space of metrics which are left in variance of vectors is always a subspace of this one. So, if you want to prove non-existence in this sense, it's good enough to consider all these canonical presentations. You must do so. The other way around is: if you do consider presentations which are not of this type, what it means is you take a canonical presentation. What it means is, you take a canonical presentation, a space, they are left-invariant matrix, it's a finite dimensional space, and you consider metrics with higher symmetry. Of course, this may happen. Say, take S3, you take left-in variant metrics on S3, and then there are the Bacher metrics, yeah? They have higher symmetry. So much a group is not SU2, it's U2. And then, of course, you get less metrics. So this is hidden here. If you don't know these things, don't worry. These are algebraic details. Yes, so so okay. Yeah, so now yeah, let me ask you a question you really write it down, yeah. Is it possible? Is it possible to show that classification of compact one connected inside space it's like G is, of course, MN is a finite problem provided n is less than equal to some n0. I will elaborate on this in a second. So you consider all convect homogeneous spaces simply connected up to dimension 1000. The question is, is that problem, whether or not they admit or do not admit, can you make it into a finite problem? Clearly, if it would be a finite problem, you could maybe use computers, whatever, you could start such a process. If it's not a finite problem, well, you cannot use computers. Well, cannot use computers. Most likely, yeah. So, what's the LED? Yeah? Why is that not trivial? Yeah? To start with, yeah? And that's an interesting observation in its own right. M7 scan C3 S1KL done by a fair few list SKL KL setup is just e to the I KT e to the I L t e to the minus L t to the minus of i plus l t these are diagonal matrices, topologically that's an S1 and there's a slope, what we say SKL, yeah. So these are the famous other Balar spaces, yeah. They're they're seven-dimensional simply connected manifolds, yeah, and and they cover infinitely many homotopic types, yeah. Infinitely many homotopic types. So they can be dimension circle. So if you want to answer this question, you would need to have a method treating these spaces uniformly. Question one, maximum homogeneous eye symmetry, and all of them. They come always as torus bundles. The question is, is it for these torus bundles? Torres bundles, yeah, is other theorems telling you, well, the one torus bundle has an Einstein magic, all of them do have an Einstein magic. Or another theorem could be, if one torus bundle does not have an Einstein magic, well, then all the other ones cannot have Einstein magics either. That's the question. And so to speak, I will not go into this. This is the general picture. What you have to take is if there would be such theorems, you could answer this affirmatively. This damage. Still, it would not tell you: is that a weak condition or a strong? This is a different question. It's like, okay, so maybe because time is, yeah, maybe I just say, yeah, so there exists general existence and non-existence here. Existence here. Let me mention maybe the first rank sitter. They started all this, 86. Then I joined later. Four, then five, twelve, yeah, and and any others, yeah? Any others? So there are theorems which help you, say, proving such a theorem, yeah? But it's not good enough to answer this question. Is it a strong condition? Yeah, for instance, maybe I can explain this easily. Obviously, what's the taste? So the taste is like this: you take the manifold, and it's Mn G mod H, yeah, and I assume that H is maximum, yeah, H is maximum G, G H connected decor, and then the space of metrics, yeah, of course this is an algebraic problem, yeah, it's finite dimensional, yeah, it's a finite dimensional space, and what they show is that under this assumption, yeah, it can be. Assumption, yeah, you can compute the scalar curvature of all of all left-in value metrics. Of course, you can do this as a number, yeah. But what you can show is on a compact domain, you have the scalar curvature bigger than equals zero. This is compact, and outside, in a non-compact domain, well, it's negative. That means on this compact domain, the scalar curvature attains its maximum. Maximum. And then, well, Einstein matrix are critical points of the Einstein-Pilbert action, yeah. And this is also true under symmetry assumptions. Yeah, you get a maximum point, and this maximum is a gene maximum. So this is their observed. So they understood the behavior at infinity, so to speak, of the scalar curvature and got an Einstein metric. So they started this. Then later there's a multi-parsec. You need Paris Male, and so you can elaborate on this. You can understand what are the high energy. Yeah, what are the higher energy levels of this function? You can try to connect it to this theory. I say I will not go into this, but these are really general theorems covering classes of homogeneous theories. But still not very useful, but I'm not worried about that. Okay. Question on this part? Just a clarification on your theorem providing rather than considering when you say so there admits enough homogeneous eyes standometric provided m is less than 11, so you've got examples. So what you're saying is that you don't know about Jam, right? You're not saying that there's a non-existence result in objects. No, I say n is a level is optimal. So there is this left-dimensional space, and it does not admit any homogeneous isomer. So that's yeah, this is all I'm a second space where we can show this. I mean, proving non-existence, believe it or not, is of course much more difficult. Clearly, yeah, existence is somehow prove it, you have one, and that's it. Proving non-existence, you must understand the whole problem, so to speak, is much more difficult. Did you say there's a topological structure that we have to as I say, we would love to work. As I say, we would love to understand, yeah, whatever understanding means, yeah? We don't see so far any pattern, any yeah? How did the one Zilla sorry? Look, how did the one Zilla prove this now? Well, I mean, okay, the first thing is now you ask me, the SU two is maximal in SP two, yeah? And the SP two is maximal in SU2. So the space of homogeneous magics here is very easy. Of homogeneous magics here is very easy. It's two-dimensional up to scaling one-dimensional. In this case, you write down the Einstein explain, you can solve it explicitly. It's a quadratic equation, you can solve it. And then they check, and this is a topological thing, they check no other Liek group can act transitively on this M-twerk. You must exclude other pairs. This is what can happen. There's another pair which looks algebraically completely differently, but is the same smooth manifold. Manifold. And this is where topology goes on. But it's not like the topology of the pair GH or the equivalent topology. That we would love to see a serum. Like relating the Einstein conditions to properties of this pair. So if this property has this and this, the pair has this and this topological property, then you cannot have an isometric T-invariant or get it? Yeah, so it's something like this, but we don't know. I don't know. You don't know. I don't okay. So, yeah, so this is very special. So, let me come back to a negative Einstein constant. So, it seems, yeah, so in this setup, so there's some convexity here. So there's some convexity here. Hidden, I I cannot really explain this to you yeah, but uh for negative Einstein constants yeah, there's some convexity here and this convexity is very very useful So for instance these these Einstein solve metrics and solving Lie groups they are unique up to gauge that's the result in the contact case there are examples where you have in the fixed dimension you can have many many different ones You can have many, many different ones. I mean, non-isometric ones. Of course, if you have a solution, if you have a problem, you have many solutions, clearly, there is no trivial notion of convexity. Convexity would give you one single solution. So you see already on this level, contact case, the positive case is more difficult. Okay, so let me state another theorem, which looks like completely unrelated, yeah, but maybe interesting. But maybe it may be interesting, maybe it might be interesting, yeah, because it is the assumptions are much weaker, yeah, but connected legal. Symmetrically and co-compactly on complete remaining manifold with one single orbit type. I may explain the theorem in a second, yeah. So then Then if metric is Einstein, it's negative region, then you should think about Mn being non-compact, you should think about the group G being non-compact. If you have this, then the radical and two And the n orbits are locally asymmetrical in new scientists. The new sorry, so let me explain this long series right now. Sorry, this is a little bit longer. So let me give you a picture. So this is a rigidity theorem. We have no assumptions on the dimension of G or whatever. Of G, or whatever, you could have a manifold of dimension n a billion, and dimension g would be, dimension of g would be two. Theorem applies. Only very little simplification. Okay, example M is just a product. P cross B and B compact. G acts on the left, G factor, yeah, and the quotient space clearly is the B, yeah, is compact. This is co-compact, yeah. That's important, yeah. Now so what's the picture? There's a P, there's a G orbit, and then there's a N orbit. So let me explain what's in the oratica. What's the near radical? So the near radical, if I write Li groups here, they all will be connected. This means it's normal subgroup, it's Ni-potent, and it's normal. And then this next thing, this comes from linear algebra, from Lie theory. There is a biggest such thing. Of course, you can have a Lie group, and you can have a maximal regroup, K1. You can have a maximal regroup, K2. But there is not a single biggest. But there is not a single biggest maximum. This does not exist. Here is different. There's a biggest normal knee potent subtropical. It's called the knee return. And the claim is this acts polarly. So what does that mean? So the picture should have is a proper subgroup. This is Q. So this is the GQ. This is NQ. This is NQ. And now you have a submersion here to the orbit space. So this is M n, that's P, M, mod N, yeah. To identify the N orbits, these are going to be points. And now, what means polarly? Yeah, polarly means simply that for the n orbits, there's a slice. There's a smooth sub-manifold of the angle space such that the n orbits intersect all I mean, intersect the slice orthogonal. It's an integrability condition, if you like. For the specialists, this is a remaining subversion. A remaining subversion, yeah. There is a vertical distribution, it's tension to the orbits, and there's a horizontal distribution. Polarly just simply means the horizontal distribution is integrable. This is what it means. Very easy, yeah. You can look at the least theory, yeah. They of course they do this point-wise, they tell you something, yeah, not going to understand, but geometrically, this is what it is. Now, here I should mention, even so, the space is a product. Is a product, the magic we start with is only gene-verified. So we do not assume that the magic is product or wall product or whatsoever. So in general, it is not true that the B, of course you find the tangent space of the P canonically here, it will not be the orthogonal complement of the geodes. There is connection. And if you know the metrics where there is connection, these are the most difficult metrics to deal with. Metrics to deal with, yeah. Probabing, you know, already a lot, yeah. Connection makes things pretty. And then, as a further, it's a normal subgroup, yeah? So G naught n is again a D group, yeah. You can divide this out again, yeah? This direction, yeah, and then you land in B M N G, and that's compact. And that's crucial. Use is crucial. So the space is, so to speak, homogeneous up to something compact. Okay, so this explains the CRM and these solitons I have talked already about this. Of course, the n orbits, the n x3, yeah. And so that means the geometry, these are very special, very distinguished. So the Einstein condition, if you consider this. So the Einstein condition, if you consider this as a force, as a force, coming from outer space, astronomy, forces the Aino orbits to be very special. They may not be locally isometric, may not be isometric. So there's gauge groups, yeah. Common families, yeah? Okay, so that's a picture. So let me see how much time. Oh, 40 minutes. Okay. Let me. Let me say a little about the proof. I mean not welcome to point to the proof but now the Einstein condition Condition implies, well, you made it submersion. You know the basic book on Einstein manifolds, there's a vertical equation, there's a horizontal equation, and then of course you would like to see that the vertical part and the horizontal part, the cross term is zero. I throw this away, I only give you the vertical Einstein equation and the horizontal Einstein equation. So let me do this. The region is minus negative, so we get on the left side minus g u. minus g u u yeah so the space notation vertical vector fields q v w horizontal ones x y z so this is vgn u plus l z u plus a u a u minus some la exchange u and then you have And then you have minus g xx v g bar minus x squared minus 2 a squared. These are the equations. And now of course I must tell you what are the unknowns, what are the data. There are five unknowns. So the Rigi N is of course the Rigi Rigi tensor of n orbits. So this is algebraic. These are the fibers. You have restricted, you have a reduced metric on each fiber, yeah, and it gives you a reach, yeah? Of course this should show up, yeah. The set The Z is a mean curvature vector curvature vector of n orbit is of course point. So until you are set. Sorry, the best book of course, yeah, is n. Mean curvature is called n. So, but here, of course, there's a neopotent leak group flying around, and neopotent leak groups are. Around and negroms are also called N. So we cannot both call it N and N. So sorry, if you like the N, it's the N. It's nothing else. It's the mean curvature vector of these orbits. Just needed a different letter. Now, the L-axis, this is the shape operator of N orbit. And the X is horizontal. Horizontal. And let me write the N, meaning the n submersion. So there are several submersion floating around. There's this submersion, there's this submersion, and of course, both would appear. The set, for instance, the set is horizontal. The mean curvature is perpendicular to the orbits, of course, yeah? So that would be such a shape of periodic. Okay, then of course the A is the A tensor. Is the A tensor? I will not say more. A is zero H integral and then the reach bar the reach of P G bar. You have an induced magic, yeah. You have an induced magic, yeah? There, yeah, making this to a remaining separate. Okay, so some comments on this. Yeah, first, there's a special case which kind of sometimes helpful. Well, the special case is the orbits are hypersurfaces. The orbits are hypersurfaces, so you are in a comogenity one picture. It's a generalized surface. It's a generalized surface of revolution. R2, some solution. If S1, then a hypersurface. You can also play this. What's special about this? Well, if you have a hypersurface, the normal distribution is spanned by one single vector, the normal bit. Our one-dimensional distributions are integrable. So in this case, these two terms are zero. And much more importantly, And much more importantly, a one-dimensional remaining manifold is flattened. So, this guy is also so. So, this becomes an ODE, a check, well-known ODC. This is a trace of the Riccardi equation, yeah? It's a constraint equation. This is not a typical. So, it helps you getting some ideas about this. Of course, you see, well, now they were not there in the community one, but now. Now they were not there in the Commodity Dev1, but now they are there. I mean you have to deal with this. And in particular, you have to deal with this. And I would like to highlight this. To me, this is like the most difficult part in this equation. And this is the vertical part. On the vertical part, you have the groove edge. So you may hope this is algebraic. So you may hope the vertical objects are nicer. You can say something. On the region, clearly that's true. It's a region of homogeneous. Clearly, that's true. Yeah, it's a rich of homogeneous space. That's nice, yeah. This is, let me do it. Green, that's hope, yeah. This is nice, yeah. So, so, also, this is nice, and here, yeah, is semi-nice, yeah? So, you have to understand a little, yeah. It's like you should think about this as a Laplacian, yeah? Some Laplacian, yeah. But what's really, we need to use blank here, what really should trouble you is this. Trouble you is this idea. I mean, it's the base and it's a metric on the base and copy A. So we start with this manifold. I give you any metric on the base, any. Then you pick some metrics on the fibers, add some connection and make it Einstein. I mean. Einstein. I mean, who be any measure? Now you want to get sharp estimates. You need those equations. You need this term. You cannot throw it away. You want to get sharp estimates, not knowing anything about this term. So this is a really job of data. Okay. So let me last five minutes. Let me give some ideas, yeah, where, how can you get? How can you get estimates politically? A R X Estimates. A I call this GLT estimates for rigid this homogeneous structure which are sharp on neat solids. So, this is not new. This goes back to Laurette and uses Gerban mass stratification of the space of brackets. The manual, yeah. These are these fascinating estimates, yeah. These fascinating estimates, yeah? They are sharp, but they are not explicit. Bougie Joas is an estimate which is sharp, you understand, with a sharp, yeah? And it's explicit, so to speak. So they have a nature, they are not explicit, but sharp, and you can use it. You can make use of it. So this is key. This is a starting point. If you cannot say anything about these homogeneous structures, well, I guess you can imagine what that. This must be the easy kids. The other things, like, that's a different issue. So, B, what we use now for this is a general formula known for a long time, but apparently has not been used. This is true for any, remaining manifold. So Rigi XX, diversion of X squared minus so nabla X, that's a Liquid connection, what is it? Yeah, it's tensorial in the first component, that's an endomorphism of the tension one, yeah? Twice, take the trace, and then you get a divergence, yeah. So the thing is, if you integrate over compact manifold, yeah, second line disappears, yeah? So it's this thing. So it's this thing, yeah. You can find this formula in Peter Peters' book, yeah? Not the term, but contact and then. So this is what we use, yeah, to get hands on this. You see this little bit after divergence, it is like it's algebraic, yeah? So there's a Nabla X, isn't it a morphism? It's quiet. And what's the divergence, of course? Divergence of X, of course, as you know. Trace Nabla X. Trace mar blah x and piggy, yeah, of course the analysis we try should be minus trace. That's a square, doesn't matter. Take your preferred sign, yeah. Okay, so this is the second thing, yeah, and then you cannot see how the proof works. I apologize, yeah, it's not possible even if I give 60 minutes only on the proof, is it possible? I tried, yeah. The proof is impossible. I tried, I failed. So, so let me just, yeah. So, this is the start. This is very important to get hands on this thing, yeah? Where you know nothing about, yeah? And now the last thing is something which is like plays the role of the integrating factor for an ODE. You know some ODEs you can write down, but you cannot solve. They are not exact, yeah. But then you multiply it with a positive function, and they get exact, yeah. And they get exact. They are the derivative of something. This is called an integrating factor. So, this for ODEs is well known, but you can also play similar things with PDEs. Sometimes you're lucky, you find an integrating factor for a PDE. And now, this is like, so what we call generalized generalized animals decomposition. Decomposition, yeah, so B G bar G bar, so this is compact X smooth vector field. So that's the situation and then you can show there exists a unique smooth function which is positive. I mean unique after scaling as you can see. I think we need up to scaling. As you can see, the second gap is a linear PDE gap, such that the new times sorry, I wrote you so much. Sorry. That's actually pretty well. Sorry, I'll check. So what's it what's a classical Hademotic composition? What's the classical Hademot decomposition? Well, the classical Hanimal decomposition says that you can write the x gradient be twittled plus x0 uniquely and the x0 is diversion 3. That's a classical. So this is modified. It's almost this, yeah? But there's a twist, yeah. We want it to have this pre-factor. And this is like, I mean, it works, yeah? Like with integrating factors? Factors, yeah. You have to already want to solve it, you have to find it, you write it down, but it doesn't mean that you understand, yeah. So we do not really understand why it is clear. If you consider this equation, of course you must do it. Of course. We don't know. I guess one shouldn't. You shouldn't understand why it is clear that this helps. Okay, so I guess my time is over. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
