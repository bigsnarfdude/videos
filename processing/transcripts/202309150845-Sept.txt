Um what sort of concentration is it is profile? I mean I I probably have the numbers there, but I mean like are we talking about a dense solution? Yeah, so these the total bulk solution is 10 micromolar of particles, but the concentration inside is hundreds of micromolar and tens of MIP per mil. All right, volume fraction. I'll show it in a second. Volume fractions are one or two percent. Yeah. Since you're giving a talk, I'll solve the questions. Be giving a talk on those solved questions. Divalence here? This doesn't have any divalence in it. We haven't done a lot of materials properties versus divalent. We have done some materials properties versus monovalent. And the viscosity and the surface tension do go up with the amount of salt, because the bonds get stronger as you increase the salt, because the salt screens the electrostatic propulsion, so DNA can bind itself better when the salt concentration is higher. Salt concentration is higher. And you can actually quantify that pretty well. Okay, so obviously, this is not a biological system, right? So the question then becomes why to study it. And one reason to study it is because it's highly engineerable. So it's an interesting system because modern DNA synthesis techniques allow us to control sequence very easily. We can test out lots of different designs, lots of different particle shapes and flexibilities, and ask questions about physical properties, mechanical properties of finite valence liquids, of network liquids. Balance liquids of network liquids. And also, it's become of interest and part of the talk will be about sort of biomimetics. So I could sort of think of this in the same way. I guess Ray gave the very first talk where she talked about, boy, it's interesting to reconstitute cytoskeletal materials in vitro to understand something about the physics of cytoskeletal materials. And we can start thinking about similar things with this system. It's interesting to study condensed DNA phases in vitro as maybe a model for things in the nucleus as artificial chromosome. And there's various people ourselves. Chromatin, and there's various people, ourselves included, that are also thinking about some applications. So, this field, roughly speaking, Spiritino started it thinking about like very physical water structure things. We started to use it and thinking about these kinds of questions I've listed here. Then the pandemic happens, and I fell asleep for a year, and now there's about 10 or 12 different groups around the world that are playing with these systems, studying these various things. So, it's sort of fun and also a little scary to have all these other people working in it all of a sudden. For a few years, we were like people. For a few years, we were like people be once. So, we've done a lot of things. This is the salt-sensitive stuff that I just talked to David about, and I wasn't going to go through anyway. I'm not going to really talk about interfacial engineering, except I'll just mention we have found ways to create molecules that localize to the interface of the nanostar droplets. So you see this bright ring here. And in fact, those interfacially active molecules can control the size of the droplets such that you can make droplets sort of on the scale of this, which is just a few nanostars across. A few nanostars across with kind of a brush-like layer. So it's almost a swollen micelle-like nanostar droplet, maybe 50 or 100 nanometers in size. Maybe that's a drug delivery relevant thing. I don't know. I'm not very good at that, but we're thinking about it. So what I'm going to talk about are the things in red. You guys love mechanics, so we'll go over some of our mechanics stuff, a little bit of the active stuff, and then as much of the structural stuff as we have time for. Please, yeah. Very, very long. The experience drops. Wait very long, they still have drop lengths. Say overtime? If you wait very, very long, they expand. Yeah. Yeah, as long as you maintain it and make a uniform field. Oh, oh, oh, that part of it. I thought you were, yeah, some people talk about these coacomate systems turning into gels over long times. They stay liquid-like for long times, but certainly the droplet state is metastable. This is, and over time they coalesce and they coalesce the emulsion that causes correct. The issue typically is that they do sediment, they're just a touch heavier. They do sediment, they're just a touch heavier than water. So, when you make them in a flow cell and they sediment to the surface, then this diffusion on the surface is so slow that getting to the state where there's just a puddle of DNA and water on two sides throughout the equilibrium separation takes an enormous amount of time. See, some fusing together? Yeah, drop a fusing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was the video I showed. Yeah, this video had that. If I can make it play again, no. Yeah, those two are going to fuse. Yeah, those two are going to fuse. And certainly, yeah, we see that. Yeah, depending on how much Brownian motion and how we allow them to interact with the surface. What about osmolar microphone? We haven't seen that. Now, the surface tensions are really low. So I believe, I can't say that we've sat there and watched for two weeks to look for Ostwald processes, but in the timeframe we've looked, we haven't seen anything. There's some statistics on droplet size distributions that are consistent with coalescence being. With coalescence being the dominant ripening procedure rather than Oswald processes. And I think it's just because the surface tension is too low to have a big Maplace pressure, basically. Okay, just to show you the phase diagram, right, so whenever they're just UCST type liquid phase separation materials, they're UCST because DNA bonds are thermally unstable, so you increase the temperature and they destabilize. What this is showing is the phase diagram. The phase diagrams for three, four, five, and six valent nanostars. And what you kind of see is that the critical temperature saturates once you get above four bonds. And that's roughly because at these concentrations, if you had a solution of just sticky ends at this concentration, unconnected sticky ends, that temperature is basically the temperature at which the DNA bonds would just be unstable. So these guys are melting because the bonds are just becoming unstable and the whole network is. Is becoming unstable and the whole network is falling apart at once. The interesting thing is the three-fold network, which has the same bond at roughly the same concentration, is melting much lower. So very few of the bonds are actually breaking apart here. It's just that the network is so underconnected in the first place that just breaking a few bonds is enough to melt it. So there's some finite valence effect going on in this difference in critical temperatures. But what I meant to say, of course, also is that these are just classic QCST things. If we quench in this regime, that's where we see co. Quench in this regime, that's where we see coexistence in droplets. But we can also, with special care, work way out at high concentrations, which I'll show you for some of the rheology measurements where we're in a 100% dense liquid phase. This is the answer to Fred's question before. For the four and five armed, at low temperatures, we get this 25 mil per mil and therefore roughly 2% volume fraction DNA. So even though these are dense liquid phases, they're 98% water, and that's just a sign of these being made out of. Of these being made out of semi-flexible filaments, right? If you make coacerbits out of flexible polymers, it's up to 30% volume fraction solid. Here, because they're rigid rods, they sort of push their neighbors away. So maybe not quite as empty as the collagen networks with Fippensilman was showing, like 0.1% or something, but we're pretty low. It's a pretty porous media. Okay, mechanics. So now we're working out at the 100% dense liquid phase, and we can make enough of this to fill up a spinning disc Rhyon. To fill up a spinning disk rheometer and do bulk rheology measurements. And here's the rheology of the 3R network. And 3, 4, 5, 6, they're all basically perfect Maxwellian materials. And the reason is because the particles are extremely monodispersed, the bonds are extremely monodispersed. The only time scale in the system is the off-rate of the DNA bond. So a single time scale means you get a maximal material, it's a liquid, at low frequency, it goes completely homogenous. If most complex homodulous but solid, you know, the power laws fit very well to the expected terminal regime behavior. We also can do things like check the kinetics of the relaxation time. If you check that relaxation time versus temperature and make an Arrhenius plot, you extract an enthalpy. The enthalpy that we measure here is around 200 kilojoules per mole, if you can't read it, is exactly what you would expect based on DNA thermodynamics predictions for the sequence we're using. All right, so it says that breakage of a single bone. Alright, so it says that breakage of a single bond, the off-rate of a single bond is the thing that sets the relaxation colour. Yeah, I just want to get a rough picture of what the system is like. These nanostars are in the droplets, and when you do the rheology, the droplets are in the droplets. This is not in the coexistence regime. Here, we are doing rheology here out in this part of the phase diagram. We made a very concentrated solution. So there's no surfaces in there. There's no surfaces in there. It's just 100% dense DNA wing. Yeah? Sorry? Three, four, five. I'm sorry, I guess I think there was some animation that was supposed to show up differently, but whatever. Three, four, five, six. Obviously, you see two things happen. There is a slight decrease. There is a slight decrease, a slowing down of the relaxation time. And that's as you increase arm number. Every single one is individually still consistent with this Arrhenius, so it's still a single bond kinetics, but there's some entropic pre-factor is what we think is going on. When you have six arms, there's a little more of a constraint in how far the arms can flee to the term, like it's just a little bit more than a few.  So this is not the better way to do it is to just fix the volume fraction. So now we're looking at 3, 4, 5, 6, but now there's half as many six particles as three particles, but the same total amount of DNA because there's twice as much DNA per particle. And when you do that, you see roughly a tenfold increase in the modulus when you go from three to six. On top of that, we did some nonlinear stress-draining behavior. So we actually worked at relatively high frequency. So, we actually worked at relatively high frequencies, did large amplitude oscillatory rheology in the plateau modulus regime for all of these. And this is not the best plot, but what you see here, for example, in the orange dots, these are the z equals 3 as we increase strain and it yields at some point, and you see this yielding. There's this other line that's a fit, which I'm not going to talk about. But what you're seeing is a z equals 3 is highly strained stiffening. It's kind of a rubbery, though, extensible. The rubbery, the extensible network is what's going on. The four shows a little bit of this strain stiffening, but the fives and sixes, this is a different scale, hardly show anything at all. All right, so between these two observations, we've got an enormous stiffening well beyond what you would predict from a rubber model or a phantom chain model or anything else. We have an indication that the ZO3 network is floppy and underconnected because it hasn't entropy plasticity. It's got a finite modulus, but it's sort of rubber. Finite modulus, but it's sort of rubbery and extensible. We think that we're seeing one of these rigidity perpendiculation systems that, of course, everyone in this room has taught me all about jumping hater and both. So this is at the plateau frequency? This is a little bit past the crossover time. Yeah, this is about 60 hertz. Yeah. It's in the plateau modulus region. Yes. The yield. You talk about gel all the time. Is there a generation transition? So these are the dynamic. Yeah, these are steep. If you anneal these slowly, they're sort of equilibrium liquids, right? If you anneal slowly in the dense phase, past the critical point, it forms a dense equilibrium liquid. And then what happens, because DNA bonds get sort of exponentially stronger with temperature, as you keep going down, eventually it just freezes in one of the configurations of the equilibrium liquid state. Of the equilibrium liquid state. So Scuratino calls this an equilibrium gel state. Now, if you go very quickly, other things, you can get aggregates and you can quench it too quickly, and you can see if you if it's kinetically dependent. If you go very, very quickly, you don't give the liquid particles. Correct. If you go slow enough, you can get. If you go slow enough, you can get to arbitrarily low temperatures and just freeze it in one member of the ensemble of liquid configurations.
