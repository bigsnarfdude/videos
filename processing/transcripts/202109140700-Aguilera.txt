Okay, just let me introduce Juan Aguilera. So he's working at the university, a technical university of Vienna and Ghent also. And I think he won the Beth Prize for his thesis. I don't know when it was, a couple of years ago. And he's going to talk about the Pi 12 sound. Py12 soundness spectrum. Please. Thank you. So, last time that I gave a talk, I made a promise that the time after I would include some proofs on my slides. And now I have to do it because I noticed that the audiences overlap. And otherwise, you would all know. So, but I'll start from the beginning. And I have And I have to apologize to the people who have seen my previous talk because the first slides will be familiar, but then it's going to go somewhere else. So this is a good talk for everybody. And it's joint work with Fyodor Pakomov. Which, by the way, let me start with an advertisement. Next talk is going to be by him, so you should stick around. And here's the table of contents. We're going to start with Hilbert's 10 problems, which were even before the 23 problems. Problem number two was to prove that the axioms of arithmetic were consistent. But then Gödel's incompleteness theorem came along and it says that problem number two cannot have. Says that problem number two cannot have a full solution, and that was the beginning of everything. And the question became: what's the closest you can get to a solution? There's an answer from Gensen in 1936, who said, well, here's a proof of the consistency of arithmetic. And the only issue is that there's an ingredient of a proof that you can't formalize in arithmetic. And that's an inductive procedure, a very simple inductive procedure, but applied for many steps, namely epsilon zero. Namely, epsilon zero. So, well, we were all at Anton's talk, so we are experts on epsilon zero. Then Takuti came along in 1976, 1967. Sorry, I'm in Austria right now and the German numbers. All right, okay. So he came up with analogs of Gensen's theorem for pi 11 comprehension. And that was the beginning of what is now called ordinal analysis. So let's try to generalize it. Let's define the pi1 norm of t to be the least ordinal alpha such that the consistency of t is provable by an induction along alpha. That's the first attempt, but Chrysal showed that this doesn't work because if t is consistent and it's recursively enumerable, then it's always equal to omega. Enumerable, then it's always equal to omega. So I guess it works, but it doesn't tell you anything. So I guess in a way he solved the problem, but then we needed new problems. So we need a better measure of the strength of a theory. And here's another candidate, which is the pi 11 norm of t. Norm of t and this is the least ordinal alpha such that t doesn't prove that alpha is well founded. And this is a better notion. It still doesn't seem to capture what we want, but until we can phrase that more precisely, this is probably as good as we can get. And this is a more precise problem, so we can look at it. And there's been many, many advances. There's been many, many advances in this line. So here's the theorem, which is a folk theorem, which says suppose T is pi 11 sound and it's recursively enumerable, then its pi11 norm is recursive. It's less than omega 1 church cleaning. So it makes sense to try to find this ordinal because you can describe it computably. And this developed eventually into ordinal analysis, which I am defining. Which I am defining for now as the study of theories in terms of their pi 11 consequences. So it's a bit more general than what this definition says, but more general goals are harder to achieve, perhaps. In any case, let's stick with this definition for now. It's the study of theories in general. It's the study of theories in terms of their pi 11 consequences. This might involve showing that an inconsistency is not among those consequences or finding structure within those consequences. Many things that we should want to do. And here's another definition, which I'm calling pi12 proof theory, which is the study of theories in terms of their pi12 consequence. In terms of their pi 1, 2 consequences. So it's like ordinal analysis, but now we are looking at syntactically more complicated sentences. And the problem that comes up is that you can't use ordinals anymore because ordinals are pi 11. So you can't use them to study the pi 12 consequences of the theory. So we must go beyond ordinals. Must go beyond ordinals, and the solution is to use dilators, which were introduced by Girard in the 1980s, probably before. So I'll just go over the definition so that we all know what we're talking about. I might go a bit fast. We'll see. Feel free to stop me and ask questions. So, we're going to think of ordinals as a category. So, we have ordinals as objects, and then morphisms are strictly order-preserving mappings from an ordinal to another ordinal. So, functors are going to map ordinals to ordinals, and morphisms to morphisms. But we're going to look at some special types of functors that are easy to deal with. Deal with. And we're going to require two properties that Anton defined earlier, but let's go over it again. So let's say that a partial order P is directed if for every two elements of P, there's a bigger element than both of them. Now, suppose we have a directed set of structures, say in first-order logic, and the order is embeddability of the structures. Then we can define a direct limit, which as you look a direct limit which is you look at equivalence classes p, x where p is an element of the partial order which is a structure and x is an element of p and then you say two classes are equivalent if letting some bigger element in the partial order have embeddings from the two structures then the two elements x and y get mapped to the same point and that's the direct limit the model theoretic direct limit So, if we go back to ordinals, whenever we have a directed system of ordinals, calling it what p, and we have a functor f, we can define a different directed system, f of p, where the objects are f of a for every a in p, and the embeddings are, we just look at all the embeddings in p, and then we map them by capital F. So we're So, we're going to say that f preserves direct limits. If, whenever we have a directed system, the image of the direct limit under the functor is the same as the direct limit of the image directed system. And that's what it means. So, we're going to want functors that preserve direct limits. And this is going to imply, for example, that if you have a limit ordinal and you write it as a limit of smaller ordinal. It is a limit of smaller ordinals, as an increasing limit of smaller ordinals, then you can compute the image of the limit ordinal by taking the limit of the images. So in this case, the embeddings of the directed system are just identity. So that's one. Then we need to talk about pullbacks. Suppose we have. Suppose we have ordinals x1, x2, x3, and x, and we have embeddings from x1 to x and from x2 to x, then we will say that f3 and embedding from x3 to x is the pullback of f1 and f2 if you can factor f3 through the embeddings f1 and f2. Embeddings F1 and F2. So you can find factor embeddings F31 from X3 to X1 and F21 from X2 to X1 so that everything commutes. And that's a pullback. So we will want functors that preserve pullbacks. We're going to say that f commutes with pullbacks if for all ordinals x1, x2, and x, and all morphisms f1, And all morphisms F1 and F2. The pullback of F applied to F1 and F applied to F2 is F applied to the pullback of F1 and F2. And the dilator is a functor on ordinals which commutes with direct limits and pullbacks. And this is the definition. It's a very nice definition. Though it won't be that crucial. It won't be that crucial for the talk. We won't deal with the we won't work with the definition in detail, but keep it in mind if possible. At the very least, you should think of dilators as very orderly transformations from ordinals to ordinals. Let's say that a dilator is countable if it maps countable order to. If it maps countable order to countable, sorry, countable ordinals to countable ordinals. And well, the observation is that every ordinal is the direct limit of the directed system that consists of all the finite subsets of this ordinal. And the morphisms are inclusion. So every ordinal can be represented as a limit of finite ordinals. So then, So, then, if we have a dilator which is countable, then all we need to know in order to know how that dilator acts on arbitrary ordinals is how it acts on finite ordinals and finite morphisms, because it commutes with the direct limit. So, a dilator is uniquely determined by its restriction to finite ordinals and morphisms. So, if D is countable, then D is coded by a countable log. Coded by a countable object, by a real number. So we're going to think of D as a countable object, even though it's a proper class. It doesn't have more information than your average real number. And the theorem of Girard is that the collection of real numbers which code countable dilators is pi one two complete. So this. So, this is the course on dilators. So, we can move on. Here's a definition. It says it's the central definition, but that's because I copied this slide from a previous talk. It's not the central definition, but it's a good definition. Let t be a theory. We're going to write d is the pi 1, 2 norm of t. One, two norm of t if the following hold. Suppose t proves that f is a dilator, then f embeds into d and d is universal for this condition. This means that if we have another ordinal d hat, such that all the provable dilators f of t embed into d hat, then there's an embedding from d into d hat. And embedding means there's a natural transformation in the sense of category theory. So So, since I'm going kind of fast, let me take a moment to look at this definition again. Suppose we replace dilator by ordinals, by ordinal throughout. So then we would be defining an object D so that every provable ordinal of T embeds into D. So it's bigger than every provable ordinal of T. And what does universality mean? It means that whenever you have an ordinal which is bigger than all the provable ordinals, then that's bigger than D. So this would be saying d is the least ordinal greater than all the provable ordinals of t. I guess we're talking about recursive ordinals. That should have been written down. So if we replace dilator by ordinal throughout, we get the definition of the pi. Out, we get the definition of the pi 11 norm of t. But now we just look at dilators, now we get the pi 1, 2 norm of t. And so that's why it's a natural generalization. The only issue here is that it's not clear that this thing should exist. Because, well, for ordinals, that was easy because you just find one ordinal that bounces all the recursive ordinals. Recursive ordinals, which you can do, and then take the least one. But here, well, first you need to find a dilator that bounces all the dilators, that you can do. But then you need to find the least one, and that's not so easy because dilators are not well ordered by embeddability. So there's no reason at first sight why there should be at least one, but there is, and that's the pi one, two norm theorem. It says a Theorem. It says suppose T is pi 12 sound, then the pi12 norm exists and it's unique up to bimbetability. Well, that's just immediate from the definition. And moreover, if t is recursively enumerable, then its norm is recursive. And that's the pi 1, 2 norm theorem, which I won't say anything else about, but Fedora's talk would be will be. But Fedor's talk will be related to this. So stick around. Instead, I want to talk about the soundness spectrum. So what is this? The pi12 norm theorem says that this is defined whenever t is pi12 sound. And so we might ask: is there anything we can say about theories that are not pi 12 sound? Is there anything worthwhile we can say about these theories? And um. And these theories show up sometimes. We sometimes look at theories of the form: suppose there is no transitive model in T of T, and then you argue from that to obtain some lower bounding consistency strength as an instance where such a theory might occur. But in any case, the motivation for what I'm going to say now is that there is surprisingly something interesting to say about theories that are pi one to unsound. Pi 12 unsound. I'm going to talk about the pi12 soundness ordinal. Let t be a theory. I'm going to define O12 of T to be the least ordinal alpha such that D of alpha is ill-founded for some recursive D such that T proves that D is a dilator. So now, what is this saying? Suppose T is fully sound or pi 12 sound, then whenever T proves that something is a dilator, Something is a dilator that really is a dilator. So, whenever you apply it to an ordinal, you're going to get an ordinal back. But if T is not fully sound, it might happen that T proves that something is a dilator, and really it's not. So there's going to be some least ordinal that gets mapped to an ill-founded ordering. And then we might ask, what is that ordinal? And it could be, for example, that T is. And it could be, for example, that T is pi one one sound. So you can be working such a t, doing ordinal analysis for such a t, proving things about it, using it to derive arithmetical consequences. And you will never deal with the fact that it's pi one two unsound until you look at pi one two proof theory. So this ordinal, the pi one two sound is. So, this ordinal, the pi 1, 2 sound is ordinal, it's a measure of how close t is to being pi 1 2 sound. The larger the ordinal, it's saying the harder it is for t to reach a pi 1 2 error. And it's always defined, unlike the pi 1, 2 norm, assuming we allow it to take infinity as a value. It's an ordinal number, however, it's not a dilator, so it won't capture the full spectrum. Capture the full spectrum of pi 1, 2 consequences of t, but it's going to give us a lot of information about t. And I won't say much about that today, but you can show that if two theories have soundness or no that is close to each other, then more or less as sound as each other and other things. For example, you can. For example, you can say that you can show that the pi12 soundness ordinal of t is recursive if and only if t is not sound for Boolean combinations of pi11 formulas. That's something you can show. So here's the problem. It's a quasi-pi one two analysis of theories. Give me, I give you a theory t, and then you give me. Give you a theory T and then you give me its Pi 12 soundness ordinal. And this leads to the spectrum problem, which is the focus of this talk. Determine which ordinals alpha can be of the form O12 of T for some recursively enumerable extension T of ACA0. So, this is a concrete problem. And what I want to do in this talk, in the remainder of the talk, is I want to talk about the solution. I want to talk about the solution to the spectrum problem for admissible ordinals. So, Fedora and I know the solution in several instances, and this is one of them. And that's what I want to talk about. So, what is this solution? By the way, the talk is 40 minutes, right? Minutes, right? Can anyone confirm or deny that? In total, it's one hour, including questions. Including questions and comments. Okay. Just thinking about pacing. Okay. Thanks. So let phi be a formula in some language and let A be an ordinal. We're going to say that. We're going to say that alpha, sorry, alpha. We're going to say that alpha light phase reflects phi if L alpha satisfies phi implies the existence of some alpha bar less than alpha such that L alpha bar satisfies phi. Note that this has no parameter. We're going to say that alpha is light phase sigma 11 reflecting if it light phase reflects every sigma 11 formula. So this is a largeness property for ordinals. Light phase sigma 11 reflecting. Light-phase sigma-11 reflecting ordinals will be moderately large admissible ordinals, depending on who you ask, maybe. So here's the theorem. Let alpha be admissible, then the following are equivalent. Number one, alpha is not light phase sigma 1, 1 reflecting. And number 2, alpha is the O12 of T for sum recursively. Of t for some recursively enumerable extension t of ACA0. So, this is the spectrum theorem for admissible ordinance. Let's look at the proof. And let's start with the easy direction. Suppose that t is the recursively enumerable extension of ACA0 and alpha is the O12 of T. So, what does this mean? It means that there's some recursive. means that there's some recursive pre-dilator D. A pre-dilator is like a dilator, except that it might send well orders to L-founded linear orderings. There's a recursive pre-dilator D. So it has all the structural properties of dilators, but it might not preserve well-foundedness. There's a pre-dilator D, which T proves is a dilator, but really it's L-founded when you apply it to alpha. And while D is recursive, so it's definable over. Recursive, so it's definable over L omega over the natural numbers. So let phi be a formula which over L alpha asserts that alpha is admissible, d applied to alpha is ill-founded, but for every gamma less than alpha, d applied to gamma is well-founded. So this is this is a true formula. And alpha is admissible. So d applied to gamma, well, this is really what. Well, this is really well funded. So it's going to be isomorphic to some ordinal. And because alpha is admissible, it's going to be isomorphic to some ordinal smaller than alpha. So the third condition is just first order. It's saying for every gamma less than alpha, there's some ordinal which is isomorphic to this d of gamma. So the whole conjunction of one, two, three is. Two three is expressible in a sigma one one way. The only difficult thing is number two, which is sigma one one. So this is a sigma one one formula that is satisfied by L alpha, but by definition, it can't be satisfied by any smaller ordinal. Because if you take any ordinal smaller than alpha and any dilator that T proves as a dilator, any pre-dilator that t proves as a dilator, in particular d. Is a die later, in particular D. When you apply it to gamma, it's going to be well-founded, so this won't hold. So L alpha satisfies phi, but it doesn't reflect. And that's one of the directions of the proof. What are we missing? We need to show that if you have an ordinal alpha, which is not light-phase sigma and one reflecting, then we can find a theory T, which is the recursively enumerable extension of ACA. Recursively enumerable extension of ACA0, and alpha is the pi12 soundness ordinal of t. So we need a detour. Let me just briefly talk about beta proofs. That's going to show up a little bit. So there are several ways of doing this, but let's do it as follows. Let's look at a language that has a specific relation symbol. A specific relation symbol less than or equal. Now, let gamma be an ordinal and let phi be a sentence. We're going to first define the notion of a gamma proof, where gamma is a parameter. So we first expand the language by constants indexed by ordinals below gamma. And then we're going to add axioms that say c iota is less than sik psi whenever iota is less than. Whenever iota is less than psi or equal, or c iota is not less than or equal to seek psi, whenever iota is not less than or equal to seek psi. So we're basically adding it the information about gamma to the language. And we allow these as axioms. And then our proofs, our gamma proofs, are going to be first-order logic proofs in sequent calculus or anything. And we're going to give them access to an infinitary gamma rule, which Gamma rule, which says if you have a proof of iota for each iota, then we can conclude the universally quantified sentence. And that's a gamma proof. So now suppose we have a gamma proof P, I'm going to write it P of gamma and a gamma prime proof P of gamma prime, and gamma is less than gamma prime, and suppose we have an prime and suppose we have an embedding from gamma to gamma prime so what we could do is we could try to construct an embedding from p of gamma to p of gamma prime and we're going to call this p of f and this embedding is going to be induced by f so what is this embedding it's uh it's the only thing it could be we take the n sequent of p of gamma we map it to the n sequent of We map it to the end sequent of P of gamma prime. And then we go upwards, preserving predecessors in the proof. And then, whenever we have a sequent, we want that its image under the embedding is just the same sequent, except that whenever we have a constant C iota, in the image, it's going to be the constant C F iota. So you're embedded one proof into the other. You're embedding one proof into the other one just by relabeling constants. And in particular, you're going to have that whenever in P of gamma you have a gamma rule, the premises are going to go to premises of the gamma prime proof. And there are going to be some additional premises that show up that weren't there before, but that's okay. So this is a proof embedding. And then what's the definition? A beta proof is. What's the definition? A beta proof is a system P consisting of gamma proofs indexed by all ordinals, which P gamma is a gamma proof, and every embedding in the ordinals extends to a proof embedding in this way. So it's a particularly uniform sequence of infinitary proofs. And though the key point is that these are functorial, so really this class-sized sequence of proofs is uniquely determined by Is uniquely determined by just the finite proofs, Pn for finite n. So these are literally finite proofs. And so beta proofs can be coded by a countable object, just like dilators. So we might identify P with just this initial sequence. Let's talk about a beta pre-proof, which is a sequence P of n, which admits embedding induced by all finite embeddings. Embedding induced by all finite embeddings and finite ordinals. And this uniquely extends to proof tree speed gamma for gamma and ordinals. So if we just start with this data, we can reconstruct all the transfinite proofs. And the only issue is that if we just start with this sequence of Pns that we don't know comes from an actual beta proofs, then when we extend it to transfinite proofs, it might happen. Proofs, it might happen that some of the proof trees are ill-founded, and you have to live with that. So, essentially, a beta proof is a beta pre-proof where every induced proof tree is well-founded, just like a dilator is a pre-dilator that preserves well-foundedness. And we're going to talk about the beta completeness theorem, which has many incarnations and was proved by Gihad at first. And let's state it this way. Let phi be a formula. Then we can effectively find a cut-free beta pre-proof P such that provably in ACA0, the following are equivalent for each gamma. Number one is that phi is valid in all beta structures in which Beta structures in which less than the ordering is interpreted as membership and gamma. So we have a structure with the specified binary relation symbol, and we interpret that as membership in gamma. So this is a structure that has access to the real gamma. And number two is that the gamma component of the beta proof is a well-founded proof tree. And in particular, phi is valid in all beta structures. It's beta valid. Structures, it's beta valid and only if P is the beta proof. So this is the beta completeness theorem. If you just restrict this to gamma equals omega, what are we getting? It's valid in all omega structures, so all structures that have somehow access to the actual natural numbers. If and only if the omega proof has the omega rule, it's a well-founded proof tree. A well-founded proof tree. So that's the omega completeness theorem. So this is the beta completeness theorem. And now with it, we can go back to the proof of the spectrum theorem. So, what do we want to do? Suppose alpha is admissible, but not light-phase sigma 1, 1 reflecting. We need to find a theory team such that. A theory t such that the O12 of T is equal to alpha. So alpha is not light phase sigma 11 reflecting. That means that there's a sigma 11 sentence phi such that L alpha satisfies phi, but no smaller L gamma satisfies phi. So we're going to take this phi and we're going to play with it a little bit. The first thing we want to do is let's replace phi by some different phi prime. phi by some different phi prime so that instead of working with L alpha we're just working over the structure alpha common membership and you can do this without any problem because we just want a sigma one one formula in sigma one one formulas in second order logic they allow one existential quantification it doesn't have to be monadic it can be an n-ary relation so you can say there exists a structure Exists a structure that satisfies Krivke Platek plus V equals L and whose ordinals are alpha. And then that structure satisfies phi. So you can do that. So from phi, we can obtain a formula phi prime such that alpha comma membership satisfies phi prime, but whenever gamma is smaller than alpha, it doesn't satisfy phi prime. So what is this not? So, what is this not phi prime? It's the negation of a sigma 11 formula. So, we can write it in this form. For all relations, something first order. So, this is literally a relation in the first order formula. So, if we remove this outermost quantifier, we have this first-order formula with a relation symbol. So, we can think of it as a pseudopi. So we can think of it as a pseudo pi11 formula. And we have the following: phi 0 of r is valid in all structures of the form gamma membership. What does that mean? It means that whenever we take a relation x over gamma of the right arity, the structure gamma comma membership comma x satisfies phi zero of x, but it's not valid in alpha, it has a counter model, namely an R which codes L. An R which codes L alpha plus whatever witness of the sigma 11 formula. So we're going to work with this formula now and we're going to apply the beta completeness theorem. So we can effectively find a beta pre-proof P such that provably in ACA0, the following are equivalent for each gamma. Number one, P of gamma is a well-founded proof tree. Well-founded proof tree. And number two, phi zero of R is valid in all structures of the form gamma, membership. So, what do we know from this? Well, we know that P of gamma is well-founded if gamma is smaller than alpha, and if not, then it's ill-founded, or at least that alpha is ill-founded. Because we knew that's what we knew from item number two here. So now we can define the theory T, which we're going to use, which is A C A 0 plus beta is plus P is the beta pre-proof. Sorry, plus B A C A 0 plus P is a beta proof. This is a pi 1 2 statement, so this is going to be a pi 1 2 unsound theory. And we claim that. And we claim that the O12 of T is alpha. So how do we prove this? Well, we want to prove an equality. So we'll do first one half and then the other half. We want to show that the O12 of T is less than or equal to alpha. So we need to find a pre-dilator D such that T proves that D is a dilator, but D of alpha is ill-founded. And that's going to be easy. Ill-founded, and that's going to be easy. So, how do we do this? We have p, the beta proof, and it's a very uniform sequence of proofs. So, we can actually define a functor d, which to each ordinal alpha gamma, it first looks at the proof p of gamma, that's a tree, and then it looks at the Kleene-Brouwer ordering of that tree, that's a linear ordering, and then that's the output of the dilator D. Of the dilator D. Well, you can check that it's a dilator. So you give it gamma, looks at the proof P of gamma, and then looks at the Kleene-Brower ordering on gamma. So what does that mean? First of all, it means that because T proves that P is a beta proof, well, it extends ACA0, so it knows that the Kleini-Brouwer ordering of a well-founded tree is a well-order. So it proves that D is a dilator. So it proves that D is a dilator. However, P of alpha is an ill-founded proof tree. We knew that. So its Kleene-Brouwer ordering will be an ill-founded linear ordering. So we have found a dilator that T proves is a dilator, but D of alpha is ill-founded. And the conclusion is that O12 of T is less than or equal to alpha. So now we have to show that we couldn't possibly. That we couldn't possibly find any smaller witness to the unsoundedness of T. So let's prove that alpha is less than or equal to the O12 of T. That is that if T proves that D is a recursive dilator and gamma is less than alpha, then D of gamma is well founded in the real world. So let D be such a pre-dilator. T proves it's a dilator. And we're going to show. And we're gonna show that it's well-founded below alpha. And for that, we're gonna adopt a temporary hypothesis, which says there exists a real number x, such that the omega one of x is alpha. So the least ordinal, which is not recursive from x as a parameter, is alpha. This is the least x admissible ordinal, alpha. And it has the following property. And it has the following property. Let T bar be the following theory in the language of second-order arithmetic with an additional constant symbol C. And it's a second-order constant. So I guess it's a first-order relation. So t-bar is obtained as follows. You take all the axioms of t and then you And then you make C into an oracle of X by telling it that it contains all the elements that X contains, and it doesn't contain all the elements that X doesn't contain. The hypothesis says that this theory is sound for Boolean combinations of pi 11 formulas in which the constant C appears. So, whenever T bar proves a Boolean combination of pi 11 sentences with the constant C, then that's true in the real world whenever we replace C. In the real world, whenever we replace c by x, so we're going to use this hypothesis to finish the proof of the theorem, and then we're going to show that the hypothesis holds. I'm going to leave this slide here for a minute while I go get my charger because I'm running out of battery. I'll give me a second.  Okay, I got my charter. It's good because otherwise, the rest of the proof would have been left as an exercise. proof would have would have been left as an exercise so we have this temporary hypothesis and we're going to use it to show that if d is a pre-dilator which t proves is a dilator then it's well founded below alpha how are we going to do this we're going to do this by We're going to do this by proving the contrapositive. Suppose that, or I guess by contradiction, suppose that the O12 of T was less than alpha. That means that there is a recursive pre-dilator D and an ordinal gamma such that T proves D is a dilator, but D of gamma is L-founded. Then what? By the temporary hypothesis, the omega one of x is equal to alpha. The omega one of x is equal to alpha, so there's an x-recursive ordinal notation for gamma. Let's call it a. And then we have this implication that says if alpha is well ordered, then sorry, if a is well ordered, then d of a is well ordered. This implication is provable in t because t proves that this is a dilator. And well, it's not true, it's a false implication of pi one one sentences. Of pi one one sentences with the parameter x because alpha because a is given by x so that was exactly what we were supposing didn't happen so I guess it was not counterpositive so we've shown that the temporary hypothesis implies the result that we were looking for. So now let's So now let's just prove the temporary hypothesis, which I believe I wrote down again. Let me read it again because it's a long hypothesis. We want to show that there exists a real number x such that the omega 1 of x is alpha and it has the following property. Let t bar be the theory in the language of second order arithmetic with an added second order constant c and whose axioms are all the axioms of t and then the oracle axioms that say n. And then the oracle axioms that say n is a member of c for every n in x, and n is not a member of c for any n not in x. Then bar t is sound for boolean combinations of pi 1 1 sentences in which the constant c is allowed to appear. So let's prove that. So we need to start by finding this x. And we're going to do this by forcing with hyperarithmetically. With hyperarithmetically pointed perfect trees. So, this is sometimes called pointed sex forcing. So, what is this? Conditions are binary trees in L of alpha, and they're perfect. That means that every node has incompatible extensions, and they're hyperarithmetically pointed. This means that the tree t is hyperarithmetical, and every branch through the tree. So let's just take a generic G, subset of the partial order, and let's make it sufficiently generic so it intersects every dense subset of the partial order, which is definable over L alpha. And then what Sachs showed was that if you take this generic, then L alpha relative to G is a model of Kryptiplatic. And actually, that's the least G admissible ordinal, alpha. So what Sachs wanted to prove was. So, what Sachs wanted to prove was that every admissible ordinal is the least admissible relative to some real. And that's what this shows. So, now we can define, this is going to be x, g. So, now we can define bar t to be the theory consisting of all axioms of t and then the oracle axioms. We're going to say n belongs to c if n is in g and n doesn't belong to c if n is not in g. Is not in g. So, g, well, g, I guess, really was a generic for this filter, but it's a countable thing, so we can think of it as a real number, which again, we can think of as a set of natural numbers. So, we want to show that this theory is Boolean pi 1, 1, sound relative to C. Okay. I can't see what this is because of the Zoom interface, but I think we want to show that. I think we want to show that t, oh, we want to find a model m of t together with all the true pi one two facts about g and that's going to give us what we want because if bar t were not Boolean pi one one sound relative to c, then there would be no such model because they would prove something false. So you wouldn't be able to find a model of t with all the true facts about g. With all the true facts about gene, true pi one two facts about gene. So, how do we find this model? Well, it suffices to find a model M of bar t, which contains g and which satisfies all the true sigma 1, 1 facts with parameters by absolute downwards absoluteness of universal quantifiers. So, it's going to be an omega model. So, then you have downwards. So, then you have downwards absoluteness. Such constructions are more or less common, but we want a specific model. So, I'm going to include details. So, how do we get this model M? We're going to get it by stages. We're going to start with M0, which is the omega model that consists of all sets arithmetical in G. And then we're going to go one by one, take a set Y in the model, and then look at some true sigma one one fact about Y. True sigma 1, 1 fact about y. And then we're going to add a witness. We're going to add a good witness. So how do we find it? First, we note that y is arithmetical in G. So the hyperjump of G is not hyper-arithmetical in YG. And then there's a basis theorem of Simpson that says that if this happens, then you can find a witness to the sigma 11 statement, which additionally satisfies that the hyperjump of G is still not. That the hyper jump of g is still not hyperarithmetical in the triple, and that's what we do. We take this x, and then let's just look at this claim in order to preserve an induction hypothesis. So suppose, yeah, suppose we have an x that satisfies witnesses, the sigma 1, 1 fact, and additionally, the hyperjump of G is not hyper. The hyper jump of g is not hyper arithmetical in xyg, then the omega one of x, g is the omega one of g, that's alpha. And that's that's not hard to do. It falls from a theorem of specter, which says that if the omega one of A is less than the omega one of B and A is hyperthmetical in B, then the hyper jump of A is hyperthmetical in B. And it's just immediate from that because we take A. It's just immediate from that because we take a equals g and b equals x, g. And then, well, if this equality were false, we have this hypothesis. Clearly, g is hyperthemetical in g, x. So then we would obtain that the hyper jump of g is hyperthemetical in x, g, which we were assuming doesn't happen. So that's the proof of the claim. And so, what have we done so far? We took a sigma 11 sentence with a parameter, and then we found a good witness to that sigma 11 sentence, and then added it to the model without preserving the ordinals that are computable from elements of the model. So, let's just do this again. Let M1 be the omega model of all sets that are arithmetical in G, X. So, now we have M1 satisfied. So now we have M1 satisfies this sigma 11 statement. So now we take another Y and we take another sigma 11 sentence and then we find another witness and we keep doing this in some clever way. So you just make sure that at some finite stage, you just make sure that some point you have to consider every parameter and every sigma one one formula. And that's, I mean, that's not very clever. Well, that's what you have to do. Anyway, if you do this infinitely often, you take the union of the omega models, you're going to get some countable omega model n. And this one will be what we wanted, because whenever we have a parameter in n in a sigma 1, 1 formula, which is true, we added a witness to that sigma 11 formula sentence at some point in the construction. So this is what we wanted. It's a model of ACA0 because whenever we added an element, ACA zero because whenever we added an element, we took everything that was arithmetical in it as part of the construction. It satisfies all true statement 11 sentences with parameters in the model. In this condition, too, it's important. It says that if psi is an ordinal isomorphic to a well ordering in the model, so to a real well ordering in the model, then it's smaller than alpha. Why? Because Why? Because of the claim. Because at every stage, we added, we closed under arithmetical definability. But the ordinals that you can get arithmetically from a reel are the same you can get recursive. From a real are the same you can get recursively. So, what are we missing? We want to show that m satisfies bar t. So that we want to show that p is a beta proven m. That's the crucial step that was missing. So let's assume towards a contradiction. Otherwise, by the way, I thought it was done because it said it was 42 slides, but I guess I was. It was 42 slides, but I guess I was misled by this numbering anyway. So suppose that towards a contradiction, M is not a model of T and that P is not a beta proof in M. So what does that mean? It means that there is some linear ordering A in M such that M thinks this is a well-ordering and M thinks that P alpha is not a well-founded proof tree. Alpha is not a well-founded proof tree. So the point is that this ordering in M, it's recursive in G because, well, and M thinks that every ordinal is the length of some ordinal recursive in G. So by soundness, this A really is a well-ordering, and by soundness, this really is ill-founded. So A is isomorphic to some ordinal. To some ordinal psi, because it's really well ordered, and so it's isomorphic to some ordinal less than alpha. So psi is less than alpha. And alpha is the omega one of g. So we can find an ordinal notation for psi relative to g. Let's call it b. So then we can write down a sentence theta that says b is well ordered, the ordinal notation b is well ordered, and p of b is i founded. And P of B is ill-founded. And this is a Boolean combination of π11 sentences relative to G. But we had already seen that M was sound. So, yeah, the problem is that PB can only be L-founded if the length of B is greater than alpha. So, this is false. It's a false. Is false. It's a false implication of pi 11 sentences. It's a false Boolean conjunction of pi 11 sentences relative to G, which we had shown in the previously last slide that couldn't happen. So that's a contradiction. And that's the end of the proof. So I finished in time, kind of. Kind of okay, thank you, Johan.
