Association, and we have about six applicants. There are three over there, but we have three more. So, you can see the map, it's almost everywhere covered. Our president, who is Mike Akpel, she's from Switzerland. She's working very hard. Her goal is to attract Africa, of course. That is what we are missing. Course, that is what we are missing, many countries in Africa. But we have 94 countries already members. Okay. Yeah, and if you could go down, that would be probably Canada. Yes, over there. So if you want to like any collaboration with any other country, you have questions, even if you want to find Louise or me, we're all here. So any country you want to reach out to, there is an email, there is a website you can see how other people do it, you can compare. How other people do it, you can compare with maybe get some ideas from them as well. Yeah, and there is the next say: statistics problem. So in that place, you can find the participation, the numbers of each country. And the total, we can see the total over there. Before COVID, we were more than six million already of participants. We went down a lot, but still about. Still about 4 million in this moment. And I think we recuperate those numbers very quickly because countries are moving online and in different ways. So we will recuperate those numbers. And actually, we have about 15 new members after COVID. So these new members, of course, we will increase our numbers. Yes, there is all these countries, and each country, when you want to see how when they join, How, when they join the association or how they develop, how they grow. There's a graph for each country, and since when they are with the association and how. So, most countries when you can see they dropped in 2020. We don't have 2021 yet. Or 2022, yeah. No, not yet. Yeah, some countries. That's uh statistics we can go over and just. Over and just have some ideas how people do all over the world. And these are the meetings. This is an important page to see, you can think of which countries did the kangaroo meeting before. And when you plan ahead, you can see how did it go. And we always try to think of the best way to have evenly distributed pain of travel for people. Like Europeans, it always has been in Europe most of the time, right? Europe, most of the time, right? Yes, actually, the first time that was outside Europe, watching Puerto Rico in 2014. Then after that, US in 2019, the second time outside Europe. Then it's going to be in Brazil. This will be the third time. That's in twenty twenty four. And then hopefully in Canada will be the fourth time outside the outside Europe. Outside Europe. What else? Ah, well, I don't know if you are familiar with the meeting. What do we mean with this meeting? The annual meeting is where... Oh, the way town. Yes, all the members come together to a place. This is the meeting. And the main goal of that meeting is to choose the six papers, the questions for the six papers of the next year. That's the main goal of. The main goal of that meeting. So we collect questions that all the members send. We have this book with a couple of thousands of questions. And during the meeting, we select the problems. That's the main goal of the meeting. The second main goal is to have the General Assembly where all the members are together and we vote and make decisions, important decisions for the association. And the third one, of course, is exchange. Course is exchange experiences. We have a lot of opportunity to do that. Yes, and I think the collaboration, as you can see, when we meet in person, is such a valuable meeting when you compare how we can connect with people online only through a little discussion, but there's no talking over meals, side talks, coffee breaks. We can't do it. So it's very important to meet once a year and choose those questions, but also have the exchange of ideas and everything else. So these are the countries. Else. So these are the countries for now listed. And I think there is an opening for 2026, 2027, whenever your board decides to propose. And Louise can talk more like what is important before you propose to be a country hosting country. What's important to think about and how to have high chances to be approved. Yes, I should say that these are the meetings that are already approved by the General Assembly. So the last one is Turkey in 2025. So in this meeting that we will have this year, we need to approve at least one host country for 2026. Canada is in our list. We have at least one more applicant for that year, for 2026, 2026, yes. So the process is that the country sends the application. Send the application. I think you did that already. And then the board take this application. We have a meeting in June. The board gets together in June. Maybe you can show the board. Yes. To see. Absolutely. So when you go to the fifth button, which is the official, you'll see the president. It's our president. And these are the board members. Yeah, the secretary. Yes, the secretary is Alexander from Germany, and then Robert is the treasurer from Austria, and then Joanna and Hosbur from Turkey. These are the elected members of the board. And the other three people, they are also in the board, and they are in the board because they are celebrating the annual meeting. So they become part of the board one year before, and then they stay one year late after the meeting. It's three. After the meeting stream, yeah, so Bart is here because in Belgium, we had a meeting last year in Belgium, so he's still on the board. Angelo from Italy, we have a meeting in Italy, and then North Macedonia, Alexa. Yeah, so the board gets together in June and then proposes, study the applications and then proposes in November during the annual, November, October, during the annual meeting to the General Assembly of the 94 countries, and then they vote and they decide. They vote and they decide. That's the process. So the board presents the options and promotes the best ones or whatever. Yeah, that's how it is. So what do we expect? I mean, the board and the General Assembly for an application, it has to be an established member, which can always by far satisfy that requirement. It has to be proposed in a city. Be proposing a city with international arrivals, or at least a city nearby. That city nearby. That's very important because this is a very short meeting and people are coming from around the world. So it has to be a convenient place. It has to provide a comfortable hotel, normal but comfortable, and a comfortable place for the work. Usually the best thing is in the same hotel, but it can be in a uniform. But it can be in a university or in a school. It is cheaper. We have that many times that they work. But it has to be close because as I said. Walking distance. Yeah, some countries do like meetings in a school. We can walk 15-20 minutes because there is meetings all the time. I don't know if it's a lunch break, you go back. Yes. Internet, of course, is important because we work using a system that we have, the association have that. That we have, the association is connected to the six groups. We divide it in six groups during the meeting. Each group is working in one paper. And for example, these groups decides to select this problem, then it's in the system, and then everybody, all the other groups know that we select that problem, so they cannot choose that problem. So it's an interactive selection process. So the internet has to be good. Something that we always require is that we always require is to provide transportation from the hotel to the from the airport to the hotel that's that's something that yeah and just wanted to underline this that this is the most important part because you will have 200 people coming from 80 or 50 countries some flights might be delayed some might arrive at one in the in the morning some completely different than they were scheduled so it's good to prepare for a team of people Good to prepare for a team of people that would be there. So I can share my experience in 2019 when we organized. It was difficult for us, even though it was Chicago, a big airport, but still there were so many moving pieces you had to take care of. So we booked our people, team members, volunteers, people we paid to make sure that they would be committed, not just for us, but also for their families. Like talk to your family, is your husband okay that you will be for three days with us and he's okay? With us, and he's okay, like you would not be with your children, let's say, because you have to be kind of on call with us. So it's something you can organize now and plan ahead if you have those team of people, maybe 10, maybe six, to have people that are waiting at the airport. Some people don't speak very good English, so you have to kind of be very cooperative and have the shuttles and everything. So that's very important part. Yes, so the meeting, let me. Meeting, let me is basically four days: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. So, Wednesday is the arrival day. Everybody arrives, and we start with a dinner. So, for the host country, I'm going to decide you what you have to pay for that. From the dinner of the Wednesday, then on Thursday, we have the General Assembly, the first General Assembly in the morning, and then we start working. Morning, and then we start working with the groups. Friday is a working day, the whole day we are working, and then Saturday we have the general assembly, the main one in the morning, and in the afternoon we usually have some trip, some tourism thing to do. And then Sunday is the living day, so this goes until breakfast. So that's basically the it's always the same. the it's always the same the obligation you would have to be from the dinner wednesday all the way to sunday breakfast yes so each member is in charge of their the cost of the trip of the airplane of course and we pay 300 euros for the first and second person when he says we that means the person that comes will pay no person who comes yes the the the member who comes The member who comes has to pay 300 euros for the first person and the second person. We call this subsidize because sometimes this doesn't cover the real cost. It depends on the country, of course. There are several countries that with this, they pay everything. Not in the States, maybe not here. But isn't that for if they are with somebody else in a room? 300? This is in Taurus. If they are loaned, uh could be a little bit higher. Yes, yes. If if you people ask for single rooms, so they have to pay the difference. The real cost. If somebody asks for a single room, they pay the difference. Okay, so many countries, I will say that like half of the members just go one person, and then some other members go with two people. Then you pay six hundred euros for the 600 euros for the third and the fourth people. We have countries like, for example, Spain or Catalonia, they take usually five people to the conference because they want one in each group. So anyway, if you are the first and the fourth person, you have to pay this in a chair room. And then after that, you pay the real cost. The real cost, whatever that cost is. Whatever that cost is, the real cost is. Is there a maximum number of people they can send? No, there's not a maximum. So they can send 20, but the real cost starts after four. Yeah, yes. There is not, in theory, there is no maximum, but the host country can have a maximum. Yeah, because you can have unlimited number of beds. That's right, that's right. Yes. And also, this is what you can plan ahead how much you will gather from the members coming in and how much there is left that you have to cover by yourself. Left that you have to cover by yourself. There will be a lot of costs. So the hotels don't cover that, right? You can't have for $300 five-day stay or four-day stay for someone. So that would be something you will receive from each member registering. We pay that much. And the rest, you have to think about how would we cover? Do we have some grants? Do we have money saved? Like in the US, we save money for many years, for seven years. We're saving money because we don't have grants. We don't have people that send us money. We don't have people that send us money, we don't have education department giving us money. So it was kind of many years of savings. And at the end, you just have to be ready for it. So you have to think about the cost. That's number one, because if you have money, I think you'll be fine. But that's something it's very serious. So with the news when you are organized, how may I ask how much you guys spent? Okay, I could tell you. Okay, I can tell you some numbers. The interesting part is the US conference was the most expensive conference in the history of the associations you can approve. Yeah, definitely. And first of all, US is very expensive. We wanted our guests to be in a nice hotel in the city center, downtown Chicago. So the hotels, you can imagine how expensive these hotels are, right by the Michigan Avenue. By the Michigan Avenue, close to all the attractions, Chicago River. So it was very expensive. You probably be, you know, better with much less. So don't look at these numbers at something, but you can report them if you want to. I don't have a problem sharing you with this. So the hotel itself with the food and the technical support and everything else was over $300,000. Wow. But you had to. Wow, but you have to you generate some yeah, yeah, I'm not counting how much I got, yeah, yeah, yeah. So that was in US, it was expensive, yes. Yes, and besides that's only the hotel and the food, but they also have tourism through the river and many other transportation from the airport to the city and back was around thirty thousand dollars. Thousand dollars. How do you do it? You have a shuttle. We have a private shuttle. Basically, you just call the transportation company. You say you need shuttles for people to go back and forth. And that's what we did. We basically had a company that accommodated us with that. Yeah. So, sorry, Rosita, which CTD did you propose in Canada? Do you propose already CD? We are discussing this now, but options are. No, but options are covered in Montreal possibly. Last meeting, I think Montreal was something talking about that. But we can decide that. Yeah, we need to decide. Yeah, and when you talk about it, think about which airport is the best, the most friendly airport to get people from Europe because the majority of people come from Europe. This I am thinking. There are other programs there. Yes, afternoon. Some kind of attractions. We took people on the boat with like sightseeing and showing downtown Chicago, there was a tour. Town Chicago. There was a tour that we said we just had dinner, drinks, dancing, and tour of the city on the boat. So that was something people liked, and something that Chicago is known from, the lake, the river. So you can think of a city also that is attractive, something maybe that people know about and would love to see. So it's up to you what you come up with. So like the entertainment and the dinners outside was around $50,000. $50,000. $50,000. Only this is the same thing. And these are all approximations. So, yeah. And this is not a good example. US is not the best example. We are not a good example because US is extremely expensive. So. Approximately how many people attended? Close to 200. 200. 186 was the number. Yeah. Can we cap it? Yes, you can. Yes, you can. I think the hotel has limits, and you should be able to say how much, but at least allow one person from each country that participates. But now it might be different because you are post-COVID country and last year and we allow people to be in the regular meeting and also online. So there is a chance you can also be able to do it, right? Louise. We'll continue because some countries may not have money for tickets. Some countries may not have money for tickets and travel. Some countries may be still not able to come to Canada because of visa, and some countries may be afraid because of virus. So you may have less. So it's 400 grand US around. Yeah, more or less. You have to think of payment for your people, payment for parking, for cars, and everything else that you want to have. Have anything, the technical support, the room, and also, like Louise mentioned, you have to have six rooms when you book hotel: rooms for the team, room for a board, room for technical people, room for a check-in and check-out. So for the main thing, anything else do I have? My notes, and also one thing to mention that I don't think you mentioned yet, that the board arrives. Eventually, and then the board arrives on Monday. So you have to also accommodate the board, which is seven people, to be ready to have books, to book the rooms for them as well, because they come earlier if meetings starting Tuesday morning, but they arrive Monday evening. I can give you also the numbers in Puerto Rico. We celebrated the Oliquette in 2014. San Juan, we did that in San Juan. San Juan, we did that in San Juan, which is also very expensive. We did that in the Caribbean, that is the best hotel in San Juan. So we spend in total for the activity $170, $70,000 and we collect $100,000, about $100,000 so we have to get $70,000 from our association. That's USD? Excuse me? That's USD. Yeah, USD. And another example, I'm very close to the Ukrainian organization. They organized the meeting in 2016 and they covered, of course, everything with the money they collect. And we were in very good hotels and very good activities. So Eastern Europe is not very expensive. So that was good for them. So those are two more examples because the more examples because definitely they did a great job they tried to to do fantastic things so it was so he did that's that was the best conference yeah puerto rico because of the weather too it was october and it was just new on the beach right so it was beautiful yes i've got a question with travel costs um does that have any impact being that most people come from europe being in north america central america anywhere like that does that have an impact on Anywhere like that, does that have an impact on a number of people who come or not? Not really, actually. And especially with US visa, Puerto Rico also needs US visa. And we thought we were going to have a problem with that. And no, nobody, everybody got their visa. They were excited because it was the first time that was out of Europe. Now, the association in general is a little bit concerned about that. They don't, because of the cost, they don't want to go each year to America. Each year to America or to this side of the world. So that's the reason because you will not see definitely two countries in America consecutive. That would be very strange. Yeah, and I have to tell you, we did have some countries that didn't come because of the visa issue. They didn't get the visa. Oh, another very important thing that actually you brought to my attention is the fact that you have to be ready to support people with visas. So before a couple of Visas. So, before a couple years before we organized our meeting, we had the letters of recommendation and invitation for our conference. So, they apply when they apply for visa in their countries, you're able to submit the letter, invitation letter, that this is a conference. I'm not going there to stay or I'm not going there to do anything else. Just for this conference, I'm a math teacher, math professor. So, there is something that I can help with a sample. Definitely what we wrote. Sometimes I was in charge, so sometimes I. Was in charge, so sometimes I called or emailed the embassy in support of a member because they had questions or they didn't want to give them visas. So, some people didn't come because of that reason. How many you have in how many participants? I think it was about 140, 140. You can see here the number of members after the meeting. After the meeting. So, for example, in the United States 2018, 77 members after the meeting, and there were about 200 people. Now, you should take in consideration that we are 95 members, 94 members now. So maybe we will be 100 in four years for sure. So numbers could increase, I would say, but the host country can have a limit. The host country can have a limit and say, well, at least two people per country must be accepted because we want that. But after that, they can say just two people. If we are 100 members, then you can say maximum to 50 people or something like that. How many do you need to organize? I can give you the I can give you the exact numbers. I was in charge of certain things, and certain things were in charge of somebody else. I don't know exactly, like the airport. I was not in charge, but I believe at least four people were at the airport non-stop to find people with the, you know, a KSF sign or something that would show that this is the group, take them to the shuttle. So I believe there's at least four. But did you ask for them? No. Yeah, but the whole team because it depends. Chicago has so many terminals. I arrived in one, others arrived in another. Right. But I believe maybe 10, maybe 10 people for the team responsible for like check-ins, airport, also technical support. Yeah. Yeah, it wasn't, I think so, yeah. It wasn't like a crowd. A crowd. So, for the organizing committee, could you want to call it 10 that were on campus during this time that were doing things? Yes, like actively, yes, doing things. Because, you know, you have a hotel, you have the check-in, so we don't need that. We just say you go to the check-in, there's a clerk at the hotel, and he does all the work. He gives you the key, so we didn't do it. We just gave them the badges, we gave them the bags, the gifts. Them the bags, the gifts. Now before that, like you're organizing your transportation, you're organizing tours and everything. So the team is technical? More or less the most involved. I don't think we get more than 10. Yes? Yes. Yeah. But we work really hard all the time. Yeah. A good job. Yeah. That's the right amount, Kevin. The 200 people are coming. Each person is assigned a specific task. So you're in charge of shuttle and you organize the Charge of shadow, and you organize the people that are now the shadow. That's your job. So they focus on that. So that makes sense. But people need the visa. I mean, that's communication. Yeah, not just visa, just remember a big thing for us, maybe you too was to manage the information, who gets when, and just make sure all the airplane, all the airplane arriving and later departing, because you have to make sure that they get on time. Because you have to make sure that they get on time. So that was a lot of work because some people don't tell you right away where they arrive, what time, what airline. So it was just constant nagging sometimes, like we don't have the information, give us information. And it was just. That's the biggest challenge of saying what to subscribe. It was challenging, yes. And we did have some complaints that we didn't pick people right when they arrived because they had to wait 30 minutes. So they had to wait one hour. Had to wait one hour. I waited two hours. Yes, she waited. She has not perfect, and the traffic in Chicago is terrible. I don't know if you've been to Chicago. It's just terrible. So even for shuttle to go back and forth or to arrange everything. And at that time, one of the trains that takes people all around the airport was broken and there was construction. So everything contributed to that. Everything contributed to that, it wasn't perfect. She had to wait a couple hours, a few hours. Some people complain about it too. So that's the only real complaint we had. I say nothing else. Agreed. Yeah, this is your for me. Yeah. Question. If you put on your KSF hats as members of the project, could it be considered increasing possibility? The cost of living has been rising, including because of a war, but not just because of that. Now, inflation, maybe in most countries, is around 12%. And these 300 is from what I remember, they'll be dead forever. Maybe it's 10 years. Yeah, we discussed that. I should say something here. I should say something here. We have applications. We have many applications usually for hosting the conference. So we don't see the necessity of increasing that cost, increased momentum. But we have discussed that in the work. Yeah, the Canadian dollar is not as bad as compared to US dollar, right? How much we're still talking, like we're comparing things prior to COVID. Prior to COVID, sort of prior to wars, et cetera. One question, out of curiosity. Did you guys ever get a first, a fifth person? And what would be kind of the real cost? How do you, like, if I'm a fifth person applying to attend and I need to know how much I need to pay, how give me a number of the real cost before it's done, you know, how much it costs per person. An example, you mean? Well, like $1,200. And $200. $1,200. For example, that's a real cost. Okay. So a common real cost. Kind of, that's how much would be the real cost. And the participants cover this much, and the rest is kind of your own, like the host country funding. Yes, so the cost of everything you subtract the money that flies in. And usually it's more expensive if you calculate the real cost for one person because maybe you add the transfer. Because maybe you add the transportation, but for the group, what's cheaper? You can calculate that individually. So it's the real cost. No, but it's just okay. Yeah, so 1000, 1200 is a common real cost that I have seen in the past. Yes, but I also want you to know that there's very few examples. I don't know anyone that brings more than five people from the country. Yeah, no, it's three or four countries at my point. No, yes, three or four countries. Poland, Spain, and one. Yes, yes. But yeah, you shouldn't think that it will be a lot of them. Plus, obviously, you can put the limit at only two per country. If we have 100 countries, everyone brings two people, then you have a limit to 100. And yeah, you have to check with the hotel as well. And to let you know, we started a relationship or signed a contract for the hotel to. For the hotel two years ahead of time. So, by 2020, if you want to organize in 2026, I think by 2024, you should have the hotel book, signed, and also enough money to put as a deposit. If our country is always there, we will immediately request a hotel. Oh, yeah. We see our country there on this list. We request a hotel. Is it always October? It's always October. Sometimes beginning of November. Okay, sometimes. Canada, October would be better. Yeah, not Puerto Rico because of the current caves. I mean, Canada, October is your last weather in the last season. I also would like to share something with you because when we did this in Puerto Rico, our group were asking. Our group were asking, why are we doing this? I mean, and then we thought we should get something from this. And then, what we did is that we invite 25 teachers, math teachers, good teachers, to the conference. So, we applied for a grant to the Department of Education so they pay the cost of these twenty-five teachers, the cost to participate. So, we put five teachers per group. Five teachers per group, and they participate as members. As members of Puerto Rico, they went through the experience of selecting the problems of all the experience. So, I think that's important. You can have idea like this that you get something from organizing this conference. So, we have now these 25 teachers very well prepared. They did this professional development. And they volunteered to help in some way there? Yes, so it was funny because they were participants. So it was funny because they were participants, like from Puerto Rico, but they became the staff. So if somebody happened with the system, they were running and telling us, Look, there is a problem in my room. So at the end, they were kind of a staff. That's clever. Yeah. So we got this grant from the Department of Education. We were able to pay the cost for these people and some money we we got a little bit more so that that also helped. So you can do things like this too. You can do things like this, yeah. Any other questions about the conference because time is running out? I just want to show you one more important thing, which is a newsletter. If you want to know what's going on in the association and also how things develop, new countries and new ideas, how people there's a lot of articles about how to write good questions, question selection. So, that's a newsletter we started last year, and there's a lot of wonderful. And there's a lot of wonderful articles you can read and learn from them as well. So that's the last one. There's also each article, each newsletter talks about a conference. A person that organizes a conference has his own article and talks about like the Italy. So that's something to look at as well. I think I'm not going to open it to save time, but you can do it yourself. Yeah. No more questions. So now it's time for gifts. We celebrate. So I'm just trying to think of an answer. So you need a team to initially need a team and say, okay, we're going to do this. We're going to assign people or this person is going to be in charge of transportation, this person, researcher, whatever. And then, and then during the conference, you guys aren't yourself? During the conference, Yourself during the conference, we pay for their hotels because some were not from Chicago, some were some that lived in Chicago went back home for the night, but people that were not, we paid for the stay, so they stayed overnight with us. The staff, do you mean? The staff, the staff, yeah, understand what you're doing. I didn't understand. You need, we need a team to organize. Yeah, just like for the organization, like I can so initially need to ascertain a team. You need to assign for a team and then assign different tasks, different responsibilities to each one, yeah. And then during the conference, during the meeting, you will need five or six people just volunteers to help problem solve. Yeah, and also try to find people that are good at the task. Don't say like you have to do this, just ask them what do you feel comfortable doing. Some people may be comfortable with like relationships, talking. Like relationships, talking, organizing some, maybe okay with just driving back and forth or welcoming people at the airport. So you decide who is the best for which position. Yeah, but so you would need people like all day, there are different shifts. Yes, because people will come from 5 a.m. to midnight or later. And usually hosting country, the country is responsible for bringing the people from the airport to the hotel on Wednesday and then on Sunday. Wednesday, and then on Sunday from the if they arrive on Tuesday or Monday, that's a good point. That's on them. If they would decide to come on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, or leave Saturday, we are not responsible for it because you have your own responsibilities, you have your own tasks during the conference. So they have to take a taxi or whatever to get. And that will happen. At least 10% of the people will arrive, especially if it's here, arrive earlier. So two or three. Right earlier, so two or three days early, so you don't have to worry about that. Sorry, just I just want a clarification. So, you had said that you had a shuttle service at the airport that drove them. So, what's the need of somebody being there as well? Like, if you have that. Because the shuttle is a guy that sits, that waits outside the herbs and the waistcoat. You have to know someone who's totally bringing to the shuttle. That's that's also okay and and that that. Okay. And that person would have an itinerary of what all the different people, the times they've been coming into. Exactly. Exactly. And check off, they're here. Yeah, because people are confused. They get out of the airport that you don't know what shadow to take, don't know where to go. And a lot of people, you have to understand, a lot of people are in their 50s, 60s, 70s. We also have 80s. So some people are elderly, and you have to make sure they are safe and comfortable. And there were some people that don't speak English, like most of Belarus and Russia, they only would speak Russian, very limited English. But they started to learn. Yeah, they are learning. But it's different that our conference, where you go to a conference and you don't know anybody, these people that come here, 80% of them, they know each other very well. So in that sense, the organization is easier because everybody goes together, they know what to do. Goes together, they know what to do, it's not strange people, so they know each other. And yeah, I was gonna say in Belgium last year, sorry, I we they needed to deal with this testing and OER requirements. I remember going to do my test on Friday and I needed to travel on Sunday, and I was not getting the result. They said maybe 48 hours, but my flight. Maybe 48 hours, but my flight was kind of earlier than this 40. So they were calling, staying on the phone, somebody local and asking for my results. So I completely after the call. But what I'm saying, there are many other things local that you need people to cover. Yes, and you don't know what's going to happen in 2026. There will be new challenges and you just have to be ready or at least have someone to take care of it. Take care of it. I know my turn is a question, so maybe we can go ahead and just two quick questions. For the location, when you say there's sort of a maximum distance, commuting distance from airport to location, because it sounds like Toronto, for example, you might be looking at over an hour agent. There is sort of a maximum? We don't think we don't have like maximum, but we have something that's called a reason, something reasonable. Because when you have 200 people and you have three hours to take each one. Have three hours to take each one of them. That's maybe not reasonable, but maybe an hour is reasonable. Just all within the reason. I don't think we have hard rules on that. No. And the other question is: are there insurance requirements? Is there anything that the organizer asked to do or the whole staff to deal with insurance for the events? What are the things that you have in Chicago? I don't remember that. That was an issue. Yeah, I think it was the if you want. Yeah, I think it was the if you want to purchase your like when you travel, we have insurance during the hotel and stay for everyone. You have to just buy the insurance and I think it's within the rules of the hotel. But when it comes to travel, everyone is responsible for themselves. I can look into it. I don't know exactly how it worked with insurance, but that's what I'm doing. I think this is a responsibility of each one, not of the host country. Yeah. So medical insurance. Yeah. So medical insurance in Canada will be expensive if they get sick. Well, they are, they have to have a child insurance. This to be said out travel insurance. I assume the food was provided in the hotel? Yes, we have the like morning, breakfast, lunch, dinner. Most of the time it was provided by the hotel. Twice we took our guests to the city. Guests to the city. Once for a concert and meal at the cafe, hard rock cafe for music and dinner and the second one on the boat. But I think the one responsibility is once to take people out, right? At least once. At least once to see something different. Yeah, so you don't have to do twice. But sometimes it's cheaper outside. In our case, in Puerto Rico, Caribbean was very expensive. So we took, I think people like So we took, I think, people like three times or at least three times outside for dinner. So evenings. Yeah. My question was actually: I'll ask you about insurance escape as well. So I'm going to pop that up. But my other question was, so is there anything we need to coordinate with the government? Because we're bringing different people in. How did I know? That's a conference. It depends. For example, you were asking what was the main, the most difficult thing. The most difficult thing for us in Puerto Rico was the visa thing. We were very worried about that. So we coordinate with the Department of State of the United States. So in the way that when somebody was going to get the visa in Ukraine, they tell us what time is their appointment at the US Embassy, and then we tell them to the Department of State and they write them. So we had that coordination and that was very difficult. And that was very difficult, but I think it worked. And we did the work for them because usually you get the visa for five years. Or 10 years. Or 10 years. And then before the first time was in Puerto Rico, then when they went to the state, most of them already had visa. So yes, you have to coordinate with independence, but you think you should do it. So from your experience, what? yeah so for your in your experience like what is the most difficult most challenging part of it for us was the visa issue because we were involved we want to be involved because we know this difficult for many countries to get the visa so we want to help in some way visas were difficult uh the travel coordinating all the flights was difficult and also finding the best hotel for guests uh in a good place because a lot of hotels booked ahead of time so Ahead of time. So finding a good hotel to make sure that we have the rooms and everything is because some hotels have had limits up to let's say only we can seat 26 people, but in the group was 30. So that was one problem. What are we going to do? There's like a collier, which is level 3, 4. 30 people signed up, but there's only 26 chairs. How to organize this desk to fit Zumar? So do you recommend like a B, so three-star hotel, four-star hotel, is it etc? Style to a full style hotel, but is it acceptable? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, okay. I wouldn't look at stars. Okay, I would look at hotels that know how to do it. They organize conferences. They are decent, a decent part of the town. Doesn't have to be the most expensive, but something that they can accommodate. That's important because that's the main cost, of course. Yeah, general sort of expectations. General sort of expectations in terms of competition. And that's how you will be remembered, you know, the conference. People want to have, we work a lot, but people also want to have some kind of relaxation, some kind of collaboration, some nice feelings that they can just have fun as well. And we are here until tomorrow morning, so you don't ask questions to. You should agree if the airport has like Edmonton Airport. Edmonton is not on the list exactly. But we have a shuttle, you know, it runs every, I think, half an hour from the airport to downtown from the airport. Some hotels in downtown, there are shuttles. So it's okay if we take the does it have to be a private shuttle or you just wait for them at the airport and then you bring them to the airport. And then you bring them to your house. You don't have to have private. You can have hotels. But if you talk to your hotel, the hotel is huge and can accommodate 800 people, let's say, they may have shuttles, but they have all the guests. So they will not say like this shuttle is only for you. Yeah. But even in Richmond, say, hey, we pay your feet. That's the one you shuttle is just for us. I think this one is not the hotel, it's the city shuts a story. It stops a few different hotels. Yeah, different places in the city. Yeah, this is a place in the city and it can take a long time to get to it. It takes a while. But it comes often and you also pay for a private hotel. It's cheaper, it's cheap. Yes. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay, so we celebrated 25 years this year of Bayath Kangaroo starting 1998 and that's the 25th Bay Kangaroo. So we have special flyers. We also have little kangaroos with the old. Little kangaroos might be older many years ago. It says 25 years. Mask kangaroos, so all of you were getting these. And I also, I hope you can still use this. These are masks.
