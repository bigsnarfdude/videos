Related to stability and dispersion in horse media for viscoelastic flows. Before I get started, I need to fix this. It's okay, I can move with this one. Do I have my own one? This doesn't look this up. Okay, great. So, before I get started, I would like to acknowledge the role of those students who contributed to what I'm going to present today. Most of what I'm presenting today has been done by Manish Kumar, who was a PhD student in my group and is currently postdoc at Wisconsin Medicine. Currently, postdoc at Wisconsin-Madison, as well as Supreme, who is PhD student in my group and Neil Bradu this month. So, the reason we are interested in complex fluid in complex geometries is the wide range of applications in industry and also biological applications. From enhanced oil recovery, where polymers and surfactants are used when primary production is not leading to any additional extraction, and in that case, surfactant polymers are used for multiple reasons. Are used for multiple reasons, affecting interfacial tension, suppressing viscous fingering by tuning viscosity, but also it can affect elastic instability and lead to extra extraction. Other applications are groundwater remediation, where similar laser fractures or polymers can be injected to displace contaminated water, or microbial mining, where microbes can be used for the same purposes. But in that case, the microbes produce extracellular polymeric matrix. Produce extracellular polymeric matrix and those themselves are viscoelastic. In terms of biological applications, drug delivery is an example, or a micrus that is covering cilia, covering airways that are used for trapping particles. And another example of viscoelastic fluids would be microbes forming biofilms that can form on prosthetic devices, catheters moving body fluid, many implants, which also produce extracellular polymer. Which also produces extracellular polymeric matrix and on the scale less. So, what I'm going to talk about today is starting to talk and briefly talk about multistability in array of core construction, which is a mimic of or simplified version of pores media. Then I'll talk about Lagrangian stretching and how we use that to get information about Polymer stress in both simple geometry as well as porous media. And then I'll talk about elastic instability and dispersion in these first media. And dispersion in dispersed media. And if I have time, I'll talk about one or two slides about viscoelastic net, which is something we very recently developed. So, elastic instability, when you have viscoelastic medium, even in the absence of inertia, then Reynolds number is very small. And often, Weisenberg number, which is the relaxation time of the polymer times effective shear rate, is used to characterize those. For example, studies, experiments, and computation have shown asymmetry that forms. Have shown asymmetry that forms beyond a threshold Weisenberg number that are leading to asymmetry and elastic instability. Or in other coronavirus flows, such as flow around a cylinder, you would see as Weisenberg number increases rather than symmetric, no weight around the cylinder, we see wake for TCT developing or even for larger Weisenberg number, the flow becomes asymmetric and transient or even chaotic. The example that I'm going to start a talk The example that I'm going to start a talk with is an array of core network that was experimentally initially studied by Christen and Stigit, and then we computationally looked at it to understand the multi-stability and elastic instability in more detail. But what is the reason behind elastic instability? Well, once we have curved streamlines, we have development of those hook stresses that drive instability. And basically, when you have, this is an example of Taylor. This is an example of a rheometer flow in these rheometer conant plate geometry, where above a certain Weisenberg number, even for zero Reynolds number, very small Reynolds number, you would see development of these elastic instabilities. These experiments are done by Gareth McKinley and his work. But basically, what happens is that you have these shear flows, you have stretching of polymer molecules, and that leads to mispolastic hook stresses that develop, and that drives. Stresses that develop, and that drives secondary or induced radial secondary flows, and that leads to elastic misability. And these polymers are basically relaxing on the scale of lambda, which is relaxation time of these polymers. So in order to address or talk about the problems that I discussed, we look at it computationally. We solve continuity equation and conservation of momentum, where the stress itself is basically solvent to stress. Solvent stress and polymer stress. Where for solvent stress, we have a nice Newtonian stress that depends linearly and varies with strain tensor. But when we have polymer stress here, we model it with PDP, where we have stress relaxation and contribution of polymer to viscosity, as well as these. Rather than having basically detailed structure of those polymers, they are modeled as spring dumplings. And these spring dumplings, at some point, Dumbles at some point they'll stop stretching more. So we have this length scale or polymer extensibility that here is shown with lambda with L. Relaxation time is shown with lambda, polymer resposity with Ata P, solvent resposity with A to S, and fluid density with rho. And we use Rio tool developed in OpenFun, and it's based on log affirmation approach. So here is a calculation for core network. This is a simple geometry we looked at. This is simple geometry we look at. And what you see is that when we are beyond a critical Weisenberg number, we see these streaks of polymer stress that are basically moving downstreams like maflake structures, and we have these eddies that form. And then to characterize and better quantify these flows, we define the length of scale of these eddies where we have the stagnation point from these corner of the pole. So here is a plot of. So here is a plot of any size. As a function of time, you see fluctuations in any size. And as we increase Weisen-Merck number going from green to black to red, we see larger fluctuations in any size. We see similar behavior if you plot the same information using power spectral density. Now, again, if you look at the same information differently plotted for any size and calculated for a range of Weisenberg number, you kind of see two regimes. This is PDF of any size. And what you see is Eddie size. And what you see is that eddy size is rather narrow for a smaller Weisenberg number, but it's widely distributed vertically above a critical Weisenberg number. The way we define critical Weisenberg number is that if you look at the average or standard deviation of these eddy size as a function of Weisenberg number, this one now a battery, but I used the razor pointer from the other one. So the standard deviation or the slope of this curve would change and we use that number as a critical Weisenberg number. So here's a case where we are below critical Weisenberg number and you see these steady flow patterns and these eddies form in the corner of the channel. And if you look at Polymer's stress, these filaments of large Stress, these filaments of large polymer stress form, and that's where it acts as a barrier to transport, where it separates these eddies from the ball proof of these array of core network. Let's look at another example where we are above critical Weisenberg number, where the flow then becomes on a study and we have multi-stability forming, where we have cases where we have one ID in top corner or bottom corner or both, and then we transit from one stage to the other. Again, if you look at these streaks of large polymer stress, it separates these eddies that form from the bulb flow here in the middle. And we'll come back to this as if I move through this talk. But we can condense all the information I showed in that video in a space-time plot, where for a case where we are below critical Weisenberg number, we see these two streaks of large polymer stress, where I'm basically separating these two eddies from the bulb flow. And for the case where we are above critical Weisenberg, Where we are above principal Weisenberg number, you see these different modes where we have two eddies, two strips of large polymer stress, one eddy, only one of the strikes is detached from the wall, the other one is attached to the wall, no eddies, both of these streaks are attached to the wall, and the last one has little eddy here and here, so that's why you see these two strips. And again, I'll come back to this information in a couple of slides. But this could be useful for enhanced oil recovery. For example, if you have a trapped oil and without elastic instability, And without elastic instability above critical white, below critical Weisenberg number may be trapped within these eddies. As you go above critical Weisenberg number and flow become transient and small distability forms, you may be able to release these trapped oil within those from those corners. And experimentally, people have done several experiments that show addition of polymers can lead to extraction of oil or reducing oil saturation within these complex pores media. So let me now start the second part of the talk, or main part of the talk, which is discussing Lagrangian stretching and relationship with polymer stress. And we'll do this calculation or discussion for course media, but I'll start with simpler geometries and simpler constant equations. So the reason we are interested in that is that I already talked about in that, for example, area of poor network, we saw these filaments of large polymer stress are basically act as barrier. It seems that they separate the eddies from the bulk flow. Separate the eddies from the bulk flow. But this happens for many other geomet flows as well, like flow-around simple, or flow-around single cylinder, where you see these strips of large polymer stress is guiding the streamlines and the flow. Or similarly, for flow around two cylinders, you see, for example, when you go above a critical bisombic number, you go from nice and symmetric and no eddies, you go formation of these eddies. And that's where you have filaments of large polymer stress and are. Of large Polymer stress and are separating these eddies from the main flow. Or again, above a Christian-Weisenberg number, you have this asymmetry and the Polymer stress pushed by the stream lines. So what we wanted to look at is that can we use this information? Of course, this Polymer stress and velocity field are related to each other through that constant equations that we've shown earlier. But can we use this information to use it as a post-processing tool that if we have the experimental velocity field, we can get polymers? Field, we can get polymer stress. Why are we interested in that? Because getting polymer stress experimentally is challenging. The only way to do that is by refringence. But that's limited to some applications, like for example, highly sensitive optical instruments. It's applicable to linear stress-optical rules, larger stress-optical coefficients, and using deep microfluidics with large fluid thickness. But what is the basis of this biorefringence? Is that if you have incidence of light wave, Light wave based on the polarity of the light, they will experience different refractive index. And the phase shift of this light is related to the variation in refractive index times thickness, but the refractive index variation itself is related to stress. And that's how these experiments by Simon, Howard, and Garrett McKinney were done to get the polymer stress. But again, it's limited, for example, to some sulfactant solution, not necessarily dilute polymer solution, and for many scenarios, that cannot be used. So in order to understand, So, in order to answer the question how we can calculate the stress from particle velocimetry of velocity field, for example, we looked at concepts that developed in the field of fluid dynamics in large Reynolds number flows and fluvient flows. And that's called Lagrangian coherent structures. For example, you see these Lagrangian coherent structures persistent in flows like tornadoes or Jupiter atmosphere, and people have looked at these in detail when developing. Have looked at these in detail when developing mathematical tools called Lagrangian stretching. What we wanted to understand is that can we bring those tools from those fields into complex fluid and these velocity flows and get some more information about polymer stress? People have already used Lagrangian stretching to look at mixing in microfluidics or other scenarios where these regions of Lagrangian coordinate structure tell us about barriers to transport and mixing. So qualitatively, the stretching kind of Qualitatively, a stretching and a stress field are both barriers to transport. Can we find the relationship between the two? They seem to be a skeleton of these flows. So what is Lagrangian stretching that I'm talking about? If you have a bunch of, like let's say you have a fluid element in your flow domain, it gets advected and deformed in that flow domain. Now, let's say you distribute a bunch of these fluid elements at x0, and then you advect them with. X0, and then you advect them with the velocity field that you have, and then you calculate these matrix P here, which then you use to calculate right Cauchy grain deformation tensor. Then eigenvalues of maximum, or square root of maximum eigenvalues of these stretching, these Cauchy grain tensor gives us a stretching field. People have looked at it and shown that these attracting and repelling LCS tells us about transport, just as an analogy. If you think about Analogy: if you think about repelling LCS, you can think of ridges of mountain, and if you have rainfall, these raindrops will move away from those regions. So, similar concept. Now, here we are calculating this stretching field for these elastic flows, and we want to know how can we get more information about its stress. So, we have Eulerian velocity field, let's say from experiment, particle image velocimetry. Can we get to Eulerian stress field? But now to connect them, we use the concept. Connect them, we use the concept of Lagrangian stretching. In order to answer this question, I started with a very simple model of constant equation for which we can solve things analytically first. And that's the second or fluid model. There are, of course, limitations to that. This is only valid for a slow and a slow varying motion and for a small Weisenberg number regime. But the powerful aspect is that I can analytically solve it and see what's the relationship. So this is the second order constant equation where you have these parameters B1 and B2. Have these parameters b1 and b2 and b11 related to fluid properties. So basically, if you want to find it for a bunch of different constant equations, they are related to, for example, Phine P, Gesick's Pantier model, they are related to polymer viscosity, relaxation time, and mobility factor. So we have the constant equation. We can look at a bunch of canonical flow theories and see how stretching and polymer stress are related to each other. So here we looked at central flow, simple shear flow. Looked at extensional flow, simple shear flow, rotational flow, where we have a stress field for these constant equations per second-order fluid model. Then we can calculate the stretching field, and what we've seen that in the limit of a small Weisenberg number, which is for which these constitute equations are valid, there's a one-to-one relationship between trace of polymer stress and a stretching field. So they are related to each other through these other parameters that are only fluid properties, and we know, for example, from rheology measurements. So we didn't. So, we wanted to go beyond that, look at a bunch of other scenarios for which we can solve it analytically. So, we did it for post-solo flow, for quadratic extension flow, and quartic extension flow. And you don't need to look at these long equations. The only thing I want you to pay attention is these green terms. And exactly the same relationship that I showed in the previous slide holds here as well. So, there is a one-to-one relationship between stretching field, Lagrangian stretching field, and polymer stress. Stretching field and polymer stress. We wanted to look at other scenarios. We looked at motion with constant stretch history and showed that even for non-small Weisenberg number, there are the same relationship holds for finite Weisenberg number regime. So then we wanted to go even beyond that because those were still limited to simple flows. So then we looked at things numerically, and these are some benchmark flows for which we solved things computationally. Things computationally for cross-sell geometry, cavity flow, flow-round cylinder, and contraction extension contraction channels. And so, this is trace of polymer stress for all these different flow fields that I showed. And this is the stretching field. So, you see resemblance similar topography, even though there are small features within a stretching field that is absent in polymer stretching field, in polymer stress field. However, if I look at original However, if I look at regions of stress field, they would coincide with manifolds of stretching field. This pink line is the maximum of stretching field, and you see they coincide on these filaments of larger Olmer stress. We tested a bunch of other flows, like that array of core network that I shot earlier. Again, that pink line, which is coming from a stretching field, coincides with where we have filaments of larger stress. Similarly, for flow around two-cylinder, you see this pink line overlays with where. Pink line overlays with where you have these contours of a polymer stress field. The question is: does it fail? For all this exam, we didn't mathematically prove that's the relationship. We tested it for a bunch of different flows analytically and numerically and in both. Does it fail? Well, we found out there are scenarios where it fails. But in order to explain when and why it fails, I need to define flow type. So flow type is calculated based on a strain rate tensor minus the vorticity tensor divided by the two. Tensor divided by the two. If this flow type is rotational flow, we get it minus one. If it's real flow, we get zero. And if it's elongational, we get one. So let's see when it fails, what flow type we have, and what's happening. So if you look at extensional flow, we see that the small Weisenberg number, the two fields are similar. That's actually what analytically we even found, the relationship between the two. For the large Weisenberg number, we see that these trace of Palmer stress. That these trace of Polymer stress and a stretching field have the same topography, but that's not the case for finite Weisenberg number region. So let's look at flow type for these problems. So when we have for a large Weisenberg number, the two fields actually coinciding with each other, we have control plots that are greenish, which is zero, which is shear flow. So the flow is shear-dominated, and that's when the two fields still are very similar. However, for a finite Weisenberg number, when we have inhomogeneous extensional flow, When we have inhomogeneous extension of law, the two relationships don't go. Then we went back to look at those geometries. We saw for everything where we saw that this stretching field and this Polymer stress field were on top of each other. That's when we had shear-dominated flow. Here you have large filaments of large Polymer stress. You see shear-dominated flow. You have green color here. Again, where you have these strips of large Polymer stress, it's shear-dominated, and so on and so forth. It's shear-dominated and so on and so forth. For all the other geometries that we had tested, like this array of core network, again, like where you had these two events of large polymer stress, it was shear-dominated. You had flow type to be zero. So this relationship holds, and what you can do is from experimental velocity field, then calculate flow type, see where it's shear-dominated, where it's extensional dominated. And then from that, you can basically calculate Lagrangian strength. Basically, it calculates Lagrange and stretching and gives you information about polymer stress. So, now I want to do this calculation for porous media, but also I want to talk about elastic instability and dispersion in porous media. So, here are two-dimensional porous media model that we looked at, and here what I'm showing it are on the left, contours of polymer stress, and on the right, velocity field. So, what we see is that these filaments of large polymer stress forms, they create these channels for the flow to move. Channels for the flow to move through, and through these channels, the flow moves faster, but there it creates some dead zones as well. We looked at both ordered array of cylinders as well as disordered array of cylinders. And what we see is this lane chaining that occurs for ordered array of cylinders, whereas we see these dead zones and filamentation of the power stresses, creating these channels for flow to move. We have some fast zones and some dead zones. What we did is then look at What we did is then look at range of Weisenberg number and range of order and disorder, and this was collaboratively done by Jeff Bostovza, where they did experiments and built these posts, microfluidic posts, and injected a bunch of particles here. And computationally, we solved the exact same problem and we injected a bunch of tracer particles. So we looked at both elastic instability as well as the transport of particles. So here for Weisenberg number four, for example, we see elastic instabilities for both order and disordered flows. Order and disorder flows. And then, if we look at the transport of these particles, what we observed is that for a small Weisen-Berg number where we don't have any elastic instability for ordered geometry, we see these particles going through these hosts. Whereas when we increase Weisenberg number, we see much larger longitudinal as well as transverse dispersion. And the reason for this stronger longitudinal dispersion is. Where this is stronger, long-term dispersion, is that those channels are created where we have fast flows through them. And this PDF of particle distribution shows exactly the same thing. Here, basically, you're looking at trajectories of all these particles, and as we go from blue color to pink color, basically, that shows moving in time. Then he went back and calculated from the velocity field, either experimental or computational velocity field, he calculated these stretching fields, which here are These stretching fields, which here are shown in red. From computations, we can also calculate Polymer stress, and then we overlay these stretching fields and Polymer stress, and they are on top of each other. So that concept that we talked about holds even in these more complex geometries of porous media. So I'm going to recap this part of the talk. And so we showed that there is a one-to-one relationship between polymer stretching and polymer stress. Stretching and polymer stress. We showed that this holds analytically for second-order fluid models, but also a broader range of ordered fluid when we have motion with constant stretch history, which I didn't talk about in this talk, but that's the calculation we have already done. We showed that it holds for shear-dominated flows, but it can fail when we have inhomogeneous extension flows. And we can use that to use experimentally calculated particle osymmetry measurements, and then from that. Symmetry measurements, and then from that get information about the stress. Here, I didn't prove the relationship, the analytical relationship between the stretching field and velocity field for a very general case, but we have shown it very recently in what is the exact relationship. It's a little bit more involved in long equations. I'm not showing them here in these slides, but you can please reach out to me if you're interested in learning more. I have two more. In learning more, I have two more slides that I want to just kind of advertise for another work that we've done very recently. It's another way of calculating polymer stress, but of course, using AI and machine learning, which is a hot topic these days. And so the way we did this is developing physics-informed neural network, and we call it viscoelastic net. We built multiple networks, like velocity network and a stress network. And also for this calculation, also we use particle velocity velocity field as an input plus bound. Field as an input plus boundary condition, and then output is finding parameters of constant equations. So, the way it works: we track these passive particles, find velocity field, feed it together with boundary condition for stress and pressure to the vispelastic net, and from that we get the stress field, pressure field, and the parameters of the constant equation. This work was very recently published in Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid. And with that, I'm going to end the talk, and please let me know if there is any questions. Nice start to the meeting. It was really nice, thanks, Fazoo. So the Lagrangian stretching kind of fails when you have inhomogeneous extension flows. So it works well when a flow is weak. Is it to do with the fact that it's just like weak flow in the sense that two particles only separate linearly in time if you have any extension? Time, if you have any extension component. Yeah, exactly. And when for the exact form that we find basically there are integrals up to a particular time you're interested, and when they are exponentially separating from each other, basically those terms we need to calculate it, and it's related to stretching, but it's not exactly stress equal to stretching or proportional to stretching. So you could calculate the outcomes by and the same. Very tough, very interesting. So in early on, when you showed your simulations for the plastic instab the onset of instability, I agree that it doesn't depend on the perturbation in the system, but the shape and morphologies of those ABs depend on the numerical perturbation that you have in the system. So in this case, we didn't play much with the perturbation. The onset the eye doesn't affect, but the detail may affect the detail of the perturbation. So, I mean, kind of piggybacking off of that, what was the general refinement you were doing? You said you were doing open phone simulations. Did you do a BIRID independence study? What flow rates did you use to do all this stuff? That's a good question. I don't remember the number, but it's in the paper, but I don't remember the number. I guess I'm maybe following up on Rob's question a bit. You have this nice partial agreement. Some partial agreement between the straining and the stress. So you're comparing, I maybe just didn't quite follow this, you're comparing with the trace of the stress field. The trace of stress field. Is it obvious that it shouldn't depend on any other invariants? That's the sort of obvious first invariant of the stress. Is it that when it fails, it's a more complicated relationship involving other invariants of the stress field? I believe that's the case, and then that's why, in the case that we have the full solution, which is still you can do post-processing, is a little bit simple. You can do post-processing is a little bit simpler than just solving the constant equation. It's not exactly like it's a function of stretching. We have some other terms that we need to take into account. In principle, can you put those? I'm going to use the same thing. Yeah, it's going to be more complicated. That's what you're working on. Okay, one more quick and then we've got a couple of lines. Yeah, just following up on that. So if you have the Cody Green Pensor for all time, then presumably you get. Then, presumably, you can integrate the entire stress. That's exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's exactly what you need. We have shown it now analytically for a bunch of flows again, like shear flow, extensional flow, and it agrees well exactly. And then now what you're doing is computationally, testing it for each bunch of computers. Okay, so there's a couple of questions online. Amir, do you want to unmute and ask your question? You can test if it works. It works really, yes. Beautiful talk, Arsenal. Just a question about the dimensionality of the simulations. Were these 2D or 3D? Does it matter? These were 2D, though we tested, 3D becomes computationally more expensive. We tested it for some 3D flow which the channels are not very deep, and it worked as well for this. So the characteristics of being stability doesn't depend on the dimensionality. Oh, the one that I talked about wasn't for the instability, it was for Lebron stretching and how it resembles the Polymer stress. Oh, excellent. Thank you. Thanks, Amien. Parissa, do you want to switch? Yes, hi. Thank you, Alexa, for the nice car. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. So I had a question for the range of Weisenberg's number and Reynolds number. I assume Reynolds was very low, correct? Yes, Reynolds number is very low on the order of 10 to the power minus 3, 10 to the power minus 5, but Weisenberg number is between 0 to 50. Okay. So still is the last one. Yes. Okay, I think we should probably wrap up with that. We should probably wrap up with that. Thanks, Andrew.
