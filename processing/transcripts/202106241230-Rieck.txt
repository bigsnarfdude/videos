Welcome back. Welcome back, everyone. Our next speaker will be Joa Vrik, who will tell us about hyperbolic groups. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mari. Thank you, Jennifer, for the opportunity. I'm very happy to be here. And I think it's traditional in this conference to start by mourning that we're not together in Oaxaca, so that's most unfortunate. We have been a good opportunity to visit my friend Yair in Tabasco. To visit my friend here in Tabasco, which is quite close to Aka at the cross light, anyway. I'm not sure about this at the Mexican bus stop, but anyway, I thought I'll break this tradition and make a list of things that I love about remote conferences and read that list to you, and then we'll get right to work. If that's okay, so we get right to work. So, yeah, we want to talk about hyperbolic groups. And Polly's talk, G is hyperbolic. Is hyperbolic and one-ended. We will also assume that it's torsion-free. What we say all works in the torsion case, but it always requires a separate argument, which is the emborieth. It's better to assume that it's torsion-free. So, in particular, a group like this is finitely generated. That's in the definition of five-boring groups. Let's say my set that we call S, and as always, we assume that our generating set is symmetric. It's infinite because it's infinite because the finite groups are exactly the zero-ended groups, and we're assuming one-ended. And it says decidable where. Word problem. Those are properties that we know hyperbolic groups all have. And so, how do we view a group like this? Let's take a picture of the group group all the way on the right-hand side of the board. Of course, we view the group by looking at its Cayley graph. Cayley graph down the vertices Vertices are the group elements themselves and edges. Oops. Edges come from edges come from S. S's are generally set in the usual way. So here are all my group elements. Group elements, so somehow, and if this is the group element x, and this here is x times g on the right, here is this g is the generator, then I put an arrow with the direction from x to x g and label it by g. And all that these are labeled. So, our business would be actually labeling the group. That's what we want to do. So, we already have some stuff labeled. So, we already have some stuff labeled, that's what I wanted to emphasize here. The other thing that we want is we want the rule to act, and it acts on this. G acts on the right. So, for instance, if we take H in G, then X will go, maybe send it here, to H X. X G will go to H X G. goes to hxg which i can write as hx times g so you see they differ by a generator the generator g specifically on the right so i get the edge here so the group on g of g on itself it actually acts on the label acts on the label It moves the group analyst to its cells, it takes edge to edge, and the edges have the same labels exactly as directed edges. Okay, that's of kind of all meaning. What we want is, let's keep this for later. We want to study, we want to study root and G. study group achieve via actions on compact metric spaces okay so of course gamma is a metric space because we endow each edge with length one and then it's a metric space but it's not compact so an example is given by the following It's given by the following. I'm going to look at the space A to the G. The definition of A to the G is all the functions omega from G to A. Here, A is finite. You choose your finite set, whatever you want. When we choose a finite set, let's agree that we automatically put on it the discrete topology. When we take a set to a power, let's agree that we automatically put on it the product topology. Automatic put on it the product topology. So A is compact, but different of A to the G is compact, and G acts on it as follows. If I take a group element G in G, and I take a function in A to the G, then G acts on the right, omega dot G, dot G, that's an H. Omega dot G is a new function in this space. A new function in this space, so I need to tell you what the values are. The valuated on some h is my original omega on hg. So this group action is compatible with the group action that we have here. And so that's a good start. This is called a shift-based. If you think about Z, here is C, you have a bunch of points like this. The group actually itself. The group action itself just moves everything one. And so, what you have here is you have some labeling, which means every point in Z get a certain label, these points get a blue label, and these here get, say, the green label or whatever label you want. The way G acts on this colouring, I want to ask what will be the colouring, let's say, of this element of Z after G acts. G X. I'm acting by plus one. I see the color green. That's the colour I'm going to use. So you can see the shift. So this is Z. You can see that this is Z, right? Where is zero? You cannot see zero. The point is that the Kaylee graph, for us, is not the group, but it's the G state. The group, it's a state with an action of G. We do not know where the identity is. Where the identity element here is. Let me have a look at my notes. Okay, this is a little bit simple. Stubshifts. Stubshift is the subspace of A to the G satisfying two things. The subspace is closed. The subspace is closed. Okay, this is a compact house-load space, so closed subsets are also compact, and of course, the subspace is G invariant because we want group actions. We want G to act on it. If it's invariant, then G will act on it. Okay, so there's all kinds of ways we can get those. If you're familiar a little bit with group actions, you probably know the word minimal. And minimal group action is. A minimal group action is a space that doesn't have any invariant subspace. If I want omega to be minimal, for instance, then it has to be the closure of every orbit of every monitor. Anyway, it doesn't matter if you know these words or not, but here is a way to construct omega. Here is an example. Take some element in A to the G. We're going to look at the orbit of this element. At the orbit of this element the set of omega dot G for all G and G. So I'm going to let every book element act on omega, look at all of them, that's the orbit. This is automatically gene variant because we acted with all the book elements. It's not closed. Closes. Take a closure. The closure of Z gene variant is still gene variant, and so this will be a closed. And so, this would be a closed gene variant subspace. And if you're familiar with this notion of minimatically, all of the minimal omegas are rotated this way. Okay, so here is the most important concept for our definition omega. Omega in eight of the G is called strongly aperiodic. This appears a lot in the literature and there are various, I'll just try to say, there are various ways to write it in terms of a little bit of a mouthful, but it's a very simple thing. If for any point of omega, any little omega on omega, the stabilizer. The stabilizer for any omega in omega, the stabilizer of omega is trivial. So let's think about the stabilizer for a second. Okay, I can color this group with colors from the set A in some weird way. And then I can move them and ask whether the colors cover themselves exactly. Maybe I color all of them blue. Blue is one of the elements of faith. Color off and blue, move it anywhere you want, will always cover itself, so that's not so good. What we're looking for are subshifts of the total shift A to the G that has this property that any point that you take there has triggered stable answer. That's strongly irreducible. Now, okay, let's go back to the groups. Here's the Kelly Graph. There's one computational problem with this Kegraph, and it's the following. I don't know how to address points. Remember, this is not the group. This is a G space. The group acts on it, and you know, the way it acts on the vertices is freely adjusting. Any two vertices, there's some group element taking one to the other. Some group element taking one to the other, and only one such group element. I mean, if you want to take x to y, then you have to multiply on the right by y x inverse. That's the only one. And so I cannot distinguish between group elements. If you take two group elements and you take an arbitrarily large ball around each one of them, they will always look exactly the same. So, what we want to do with this eight of the chip, this is secret, I'll tell you, what we want to do with this a What we want to do with this A to the G is we want to label the group elements in such a way that no two group elements will have identical neighborhoods. Now the group is infinite. You can't impose that by looking just at small neighborhoods. You have to allow me to look at very big neighborhoods that's forced on us. So what I want to say is this. I'm going to label the root elements. But everything here has to be finite because this this button goes into a computer. This button goes into a computer. So you can only have five many labels. These are the labels, the elements of A, buttons A. I want to label the group elements in such a way that if you take two points, distinct points, there is some very big R so that the ball around one, of radius R around one point, is labeled distinctly for the ball around the R ball around the other. Now let's see what happens. Now, let's see what happens if it fails. I have two points so that any size ball whatsoever around them has the exact same labeling. Well, then you can imagine the group as an infinite ball. That means that the group element that takes this element, this one, like H here took this to this, preserves all the lay-like. Here's a group element with a non-trivial stabilizer. If all the stabilizers are trivial, then any coloring that we take on the gun. We take omega, and for any size, for any two group elements, some size ball will distinguish between them. Okay, this is still a little bit of a problem because you think about the process of producing subshifts in this way. One thing is how do I control that the labels are always different? But the other thing is I don't really know what the closure of a point is. The orbit of a point is countable. Point is the orbit of the point is countable, the closure is uncountable. How do I find points there? So, what I want to do next is to describe how we have local instructions for coloring. And then we'll go back to the setting. We'll use these local instructions to produce our subshifts and ask whether our subshift was strongly aperiodic. Okay, this feels very confusing. Let's go to the other side of the board and talk about what did local instruction happen. All of the local instruction approaches. I have to admit that I'm more nervous than usual with this format of talking with Yanohov. But I did want to tell you, what I actually wanted to tell you is this is joint with David Cohen and Hein Goodman Strauss. We're really terrific collaborators to work with on this project. So let's see, we want a subshift of finite diamond. And SFT is stand for subshift log finite type. Is a subshift contained in A to the G given by local restrictions. So, okay, I have my group. I know I have my group. Here's the group. And here are the generators. This is the labor of this vertex. Vertex and these vertices have their own neighborhoods. I don't know what things look like in this group at all. Well, yes, we said that these are all in the neighborhood of this. And so on. And I'm going to look at balls of some radius R. So I'm going to fix R, which is the radius of the ball. Let's say this is the ball of radius R on this. Is the ball of radius r around this point here? This is x, the ball around x of radius r. And then I'm going to take my colors, I'll bring the colors. Hold on. Here are my colors. And I'm going to say red here, red here, red here, blue here, blue here, blue here, and maybe some green. Say A has three elements. A has three elements in it, red, blue, and green. Here is a color. Now remember, this is extremely rigid because with these edges come labels. This is maybe the generated G1. Maybe this is G1 inverse. Maybe this is G2. Maybe this is G2 inverse. You can write G2 inverse or write G2 and have the oxygen error, of course. This is what the ball of radius RAM X looks like. It tells you absolutely everything. You put this. Everything. You put this vertex here, the center one, on the vertex of the kdigraph you want, and the ball of radius R has been completely covered. And maybe, so this is the chart. And maybe this is chart number 27. You have a lot of charts. And the coloring of the groups is choosing which chart you use at every point. Now, okay, so this obviously gives me. Excuse me, let me try this mirror. These kind of rules define a subset, subset of A to the G. But if it's not necessarily a subshift, we don't know what's going on. So there are a couple of exercises we need to do because we know that it needs to be an invariant under the group and close. We need to know that if we take a stack of groups of this cycle, A stack of rules of this type, and we cover only using these rules, the set that we get is gene-invariant. That's kind of obvious that it's gene-invariant because we never said where this x is. You move the whole picture, you have the same picture somewhere else. So, gene variance is easier. It's an exercise to see that this is close. So, this is, in fact, subject. Anyway, my point being that the subshift is a finite time is not defined as a subshift shift that happens to have a finite act. It is defined in this way, and it happens to also be a subshift. And those are the subshifts that we're interested in. If you give me a coloring with this subshift, I can go at every Google element, look at a ball 3D scar around it, and see whether what you did is legal or not. And if it's illegal, I toss it out. And if it's legal everywhere, of course, checking everywhere that the computer can't. Checking everywhere that the computer can't do, but if it's legal everywhere, then that's a legal colour. And so I checked my notes along. So the question is this. What let's just add some words, finitely generated. Generated. Maybe you want to say infinite. You don't need to say infinite here. But it's kind of silly if the group is finite. What finitely generated groups can fit a strong behavior into the condition that we just had a moment about the stabilizer of every point needs to be trivial subshipped for finite time. So let's quickly survey some things. So let's quickly survey some things that are known. This all started with Wang, who didn't actually produce one of those, but asked the question and realize its relevance to theory of computation and whatnot. That's in the 16th. Berger produced the first one. Well, underline this because the other people contributed somebody to produce the first one. Robinson simplified Berger's way work really significantly and in 1960. Really significantly, and in 1997, if I remember correctly, Carly gave a really easy proof of that. And this is Z plus E plus Cherry on Coke. C plus F. And that was already quite the hard work of the Burgers. It's in his statistical student of Wang, and this is notoriously important to read. I haven't tried it. Robinson gets his name here, in fact, because he gave a construction that is much more readable. That is much more readable. And Carrie's construction, that's the one, definitely the one you should read. Lost of groups which are irrelevant to us with C plus C subgroup. Not all. Well, I'm natural. Not all the groups with diplomacy subgroups are known to have this. Are known to have this. I don't want to put it on the board because then it kind of sounds like I'm saying that some of them can't have it. It's not claiming that there are lots of constructions with lots of grouped C plus C subgroup. There are some though that don't have C plus C subgroup. BS N1, the bounds of solitary group N1. Also, the bumps are solitary group NN, but let me not put it there because it has a C plus C as a finite subgroup. A finite sub hook, but you have a finite index, finite index sub, you have a finite index sub hook that has such a strongly scale period, such a finite type, and you will inherit. There's a lot of names to go with this one. I guess the construction degree of Room and Carrie, although there there is a list of other names which I think are mostly their students. The reason there's a list of other names is that Obrun and Carrie did the right construction for a different problem. The right construction for a different problem. They weren't interested in this problem, but there were a related problem, so some people finished it off. Let me write something slightly imprecise. Just say the words. If you have the product of three groups, where each of these groups is infinite with a decidable word problem, then this will have a strongly aperiodic subshort of time and time. Such a final time. In this size work, and this is a bar here. So if two of these groups have in them an element that isn't totally, then there is inherent. But each one of these groups can be. One of these groups can be a torsion group, an infinite torsion group. And then there will not be a sequence in here, and so that's a little bit different than this. It's a lot different than this. However, these groups can never be hyperbolic, so it's still irrelevant to us. Goodman Strauss had something that's relevant to us, although it's not really a group H2 has a title of H2 that's aperiodic, but those. Aperiodic, but those tiles do not conform to any subgroup of text on the group of states too, so it doesn't give us hyperbolic groups. But building on this, Cohen and Goodman-Strauss, may emphasize this first hyperbolic example. So, the fundamental group of the surface of genus two or more, closed surface, are the ones that these guys constructed such infinite type four. And last but not least, is Charlotte Moses. Chocolates lattices in rank at least two simple egoes. You don't need to do any of these words. Technically, this work is different than what we're interested in. It's not relevant, but it was inspiration. And so, this, first of all, legal direct of a legal. Lie groups, the rank of a Lie group is the highest dimension Euclidean plane that embeds in it isomorphically. If you have a plane, of course, it's like having a z plus z, you're never going to be a ball. But it's interesting what he did. What he did is this. He took his leap rook and he took a lattice. I guess he framed it in terms of tilings, but that's okay. He took a lattice and he looked at the Voronoi cell decomposition corresponding to that lattice. So if you look To that practice. So if you look at R2, E2, and you look just at the z lattice, then the volono itself would just be the usual squares. This is far the usual squares. The usual squares. Then we said, I'm going to decorate each one of these squares. And the decoration is going to be such that, however you assemble them, as long as you conform to what the decorations are, however you assemble them, you will not be able to have any kind of periodicity. And how did he do that? He took a second lattice that's incompatible and look at the intersection, the pattern of intersection of the corona cells. But the idea of lacing something with an incompatible Relating something with an incompatible thing is the inspiration that we got out of this. Let me erase this. A bit too handy. Okay, that's all very positive. There's very, very little known about groups not emitting a strongly aperiodic subshift of finite type. All finite groups actually do atom at once. So the word infinite level is just similar infinitely there. There are two obstructions. There are only two known obstructions. One is undecidable. Undecidable work problem. If a group has an undecidable word problem, it will never be a strong aqueous subject for finite type. Another one, which is later comment, eventually there is a much more groups with more than one head. More than one end. You know, means two or infinitely many ends. A group that has only two ends looks like C. It's a finite extension of C. If you have any kind of finite subject of finite type on it, you know, you have all these little chunks that you're coloring by legal charts. At some point, the chunk will have to repeat because there are only finitely many ways of coloring chunks, and you have infinitely many. Coloring chunks, and you have infinitely many chunks. And so, once it is a big enough chunk repeated, you can do whatever you did here and just keep copy repeat it again and again. Pick up is not a hard argument. Infinity ended in general is a little bit more involved, but we don't need it. But the point is that we're only discussing one ended body group, and that's a very important thing for us right now. Okay, I don't want to check the time because I know that'll be bad news. Be valued. Okay, so I guess I should tell you what the hyperbolic group is, but you know what hyperbolic group is. Hyperbolic groups are groups that look like this. In other words, if you take any three points in the group and any geodesic, if you take any geodesic triangle in the group and you take any one side of it, And you take any one side of it, it remains close to the other two sides. This actually doesn't really look quite. Let me make it more clear. So if you look, you know, in my case, if I take off my glasses, just reflect a little white. But how do we work with hyper? What's so good about it? Work with high courts what's so good about it. So I think different people give different answers. But here's my favorite thing about canons. Only I call them canons. Troplex finite state automaton. Okay, so we have our generating set, and the finite set of automaton is a directed graph with labels. So you have one vertex that's labeled start, which is Start, which is where you start. You have other labels which are vertically determined by S1, S2, S3. S1, S2, S3, whatever. These are states. Then you have edges with labels. And what the edges do, what the labels are, the labels are generators. Here is G1, G1 inverse, G2, G2 inverse. G1, maybe G2, certainly can have a head of this, and so on. And so, if I ask you to start at star and go for a trip along this graph, then you get a path and you can write down the letters that you went through, G1, G2, G2, G2, however many times you want, G1 again, and actually there's nothing going out here, it's just stuck on. Actually, there's nothing going out for you to stop. You can get stuck on it. What these paths are, these paths are exactly the short decks geodesics. Let's go back though. Maybe there's some element here. Maybe I remember for a second where the identity element here. So here's my moment. So here's my one. And I can go from there to this positive identity. I can go here along a generator G1 and then along a generator G2 and then along G1 again and then along G1 again maybe and so on. I get some group element over here. Every group element is connected to the identity in such a path because every group element can be written as a product of the generators. So that's what it means to generators. Means to generators. Some paths are just ridiculously long. Some paths are as short as possible, then we call them geodesics. Now, I can impose another condition. I can put any order that I want on the finite generating set. It's completely arbitrary. It doesn't matter if G1 and G inverse are inverse. Generators are equal. None of that matters. Put some order on the generators. And then you're in the following situation. Maybe this is one, two, three, four. Is one, two, three, four, the shortest path from the identity to this element here. But it need not be unique. Among all the shortest paths, take the one that comes, the one that comes first in the lexicographic order. That makes its point here unique. And those are the paths that you see here. I mean, in terms of computation theory, what you say is that the language of shortness geodesic is the regular language. It has this exact picture here. Picture here. So let's clean this up for a second. What does the group actually look like now? Because remember, all the goal is the goal is to decorate the group in a way that we can work with it. So the group looks like this. I start the identity and then I use some generators G1, G2, G1 inverse, maybe another G1 inverse, G2. G two G one inverse again G two G1 G1 inverse. So this is not going to happen actually. Because if I do G1 and G1 inverse, that's not going to be a GLS. And we keep going with this. These things are never going to converge to each other. This is not going to happen. Because if this happens, what does it mean? This path here is the shortlex geodesic to this specific point, and this path is also the shortlex geodesic to this point. But shortlex geodesics are unique. If you have two words of length three, they can't both come first in the dictionary. So this doesn't happen. So what we see is the entire group now is one big tree with its root and the identity. And each group. And each group element gets a new label. This could be S1, maybe this is also. Let me put the labels in a different colour. Very important that put them in red. This would be S1, S1, S1, S2, S3, S2. It's not unrealistically at all. Why? Because when I traverse this. Because when I traverse this tree, a path in this tree, I'm going along a path in this F sigma. And the path starts at the start position and then goes to different states, different vertices. And each one of those is a state with a name, and I'm putting the names here, and now I've got another label on all the group elements, okay? So We are ready for an SFT that actually Gromo wrote about in his paper about hyperwork books from the 80s. And Cornette and Papadopoulos wrote a lot about this SFT. And to understand it, let's look at what Let's look at what the local information of our group looks like. What do I see at every point? So I'm shutting the group from the identity. At every point, we look like this. Every point except the identity. The identity is not in the game. Every point looks like this. I have some label, maybe S1. And I have my neighbors. Neighbors. Here are the generators, you know, G1, G2, and so on. Let me not name all the generators. And so here's a group element that has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight members. Of course, because the KD graph looks the same everywhere. Because the KD graph looks the same everywhere, everybody you have integers. What I have is the following information: I have the state of the machine, you know, S1, whatever it's written here. The quick right, I have the function age distance from the identity, but this is absolutely not true. Let's leave it there for a second because we cannot need H, but we can't have H. Everything has to be fine. Everything has to be finite. The only finitely many states, that's great. But you can be arbitrarily far from the origin. This can't be used as a label. And the last thing that I have is I have something called P. The parent. Now, here is the identity. This is where I started. And here is the shortest geoletic that got to this specific group element. P says, what is the group element that comes just before it? Comes just before it. So I need to know which direction to go in order to go back in time, back in my short XQL desk. So P is actually a generator. It's one of the generators. Okay, H can't be used though. H cannot be used. So instead of H, we're going to use the derivative of H, which we wrote this way. What is the derivative of H? Well, if this is some distance from the origin, I don't know what the derivative is. I don't know what the distance is. I can't put the distance into a machine. It can be a big number. But I can tell you that these are the same distance. These are distance one more, and these are distance one less. So what this is, it's a function to take the values minus one, zero, and one. And its arguments are the generators. If I'm at this point and I put generator g1, I get plus one. Now the age of g1. Of G1 equals plus one, for example. Why? Because in this picture, I can see if I apply, if I'm at this point, whatever this point in the group is, the only x, I apply G1, I go one further away. Okay? This is the finite thing. It's functions from fact functions from the finite set to a finite set, they're only finite in many of those, and that's what we put here. Derivative derivative of distance from identity. This is the discrete set. So derivative must be understood as differences. Okay? All right. Probably best for everybody in the room if I didn't tell them how much of the top colours were fortunate. But here is what Conerd and Pokodopoulos did in detail and roll also. The name we gave it is the short lex star shift of finite target. Every point Vertex. Every vertex gets all this decoration. We know who the parent is, we know the derivative of age there, and we know the state. Balls of radius. Radius A delta, we never discussed delta. Yeah, I mean, of course, secretly, I assume that you've seen polygroups shortly. I have a polygroup, you remember, it's the thing with the thin triangles. The width of the triangle is called delta. Anyway, I have a polygroup comes equipped with a certain number called delta. A delta is the radius of the bolt we're looking at. Bolt of three is A delta. That's where my charts are. The question is, what charts are I look at? The question is: what charts are allowed? I'm going to give you the allowed charts. Look like bones in the KD graph. Remember, the KD graph already had all this information on it. But now I'm allowing you to mess with it and move it around and change it any way you want. The KD graph not Not containing if you look at the ball in what you want to be your subshift, every point will look like this. There will be some p, some value agent, some state, and the ball of size 8 delta has to agree completely with. To agree completely with some ball of size H delta in the book itself. I mean, I can do stupid things here. Like, for instance, I know that if I look at the derivative of H and I apply it specifically to the generator P, that I'm comparing the value of H here to the value of the previous one. That has to be minus one. But maybe I put a different function here when it's not minus one. That's totally stupid to do. But you can do that. So we need to have some rules that say. So, we need to have some rules that say that it actually looks like the group. And that's the rule. Every ball of certain quite big size, we call it A delta, looks exactly like the group. And so there's many details we don't have time for. So maybe you can ask a question about the LA delta. Why would you want a delta? Here is why a delta is good. Here is one thing that you get from it. If you look at One thing that you get from it. If you look at this function here, the derivative of the function, well, you integrate it and you get the function h. Of course, you can only get h up to the shift. Because I don't know what the value of h here is, but I can say if the value of h here, let's just say zero, then here it has to be one. And here it has to be zero, and here it has to be minus one. That's a problem. You won't necessarily get a function h. Why? Because you might go along a big loop, come back to the original. Along a big loop, come back to the original point, and it won't be zero. It started at zero and ended somewhere else. Well, big loops in the KD graphs are words in the generators that represent the trivial elements. Words in the generator that represent the trivial element can be broken up into smaller things which are relators. If you go along every relator and you always get zero, the contribution of these derivatives of a is always zero, which is what happens in the case. Which is what happens in the KD graph itself. And the KD graph ages a non-function. If that happens along every relator, then it will happen on every closed path. And the ball size 8 delta contains a complete set of relators. Okay. Why did why did actually so this gives us a subject which we can call Subscribe, which we can call only the zero. Things are decorated this way. Why did Gromov want this? Gromov didn't have Bonard and Papadopoulos more at this, but Gromov has way towards the end of his paper one page that describes this. Why? Because there is a function from this set into the bound B at infinity of the model. And what is this function? If you're giving me some subshift here, Subshift here, then I can look at any vertex that I want, any group element whatsoever. I can look at p of that, p squared of that, and so on, and this will converge to some point with I called C in the boundary at infinity of the book. Okay, we need to prove that it's independent of this. The point is that these geodesic, the P geodesics, they go toward the origin. They go towards the origin. The origin doesn't exist here, but if we look at both, they go towards the origin. So, any two points, if you look at their p-geodesics, they converge. But you get this function here. And so, what Gromov was after is this. Pell is subsist of finding time. Finite type, G acts on this, it maps to the boundary at infinity of G, and G acts on this as well, and these actions are compatible. So if you take a single group element and you write the usual square, you'll get a commutative diagram for every group element. And this action is also onto. This function is also onto. Every group element appears with every boundary point appears in this way. It appears in this way. So that's what Gromo wanted to say. Grommo wanted to say the action of the group on the sphere at infinity is a factor of the subshift of finite time. That's an action of finite time. But we want more. We want to say that this action is strongly aperiodic. That's not going to really work because this action is not strongly aperiodic. And so now we go to elaborate. We need to do something more. I want to describe to you what we do more. We're going to look at the level and I'm going to write h equals zero. h is the function that's obtained by integrating the derivative of h. We know that there is such a function. It's only defined up to scaling. I want to start at a certain level. You might as well shift it to column zero. Of zero, and I have my different vertices here. Here is one of them, P. V stands for village, actually. And we're going to add more information. So far, we have P. So we know for every village what's its parent village is. We have the boundary, the derivative of age, and we have state. And we have a lot more information. I'm just going to write it down. I'm just going to write it down. Add the list with no. Okay, I don't know where anyone else. We have the population. We have something called delta. We have the matching called M. The population of every village will be at least one villager and at most some abundant number of villagers. Some bounded number of integers. And this function here will tell me how many villages it has. Delta kind of tells me how many descendants it has. More precisely, actually, let me cheat. 2 to the delta, delta v, these are all functions of v. So if you know v, you know 2 to the delta v is number. Is number of kids and M matches parents to kids. Here is age equals one. There's going to be a bunch of integers here. Over here, we have a bunch of integers. Villagers. Here we also have all kind of villagers, and this is M. And of course, M will have arrows from all the villagers. It's a projection between the children of the villages. So M goes from an arrow, we pick a village, a villager, the I is the villager, and Jane is the kid of the villager. Is the kid of the villager and it gets matched to a different village? Let's say this is the village you, and some villager living there. Okay. I'm going to look at the top because it's going to tell us something. The book tells you that you don't want any technical details to be spent. The top never lies. What's that got to do with? What's that got to do with anything? That's got to do with anything for the following way. Seven reasons. Suppose that we had an element, a non-trivial element in the stabilizer of this SSD. This information here is laid on top of the information that we already have before. If you have anything in the stabilizer of this SFT, it takes levels to levels, but you can't fix a level. But you can't fix the level. You cannot fix the level because if you look at the orbit of a point at the level, you get a subgroup Z which is distorted. Anyway, you have to shift the levels. There's no way that you can do anything else. And this destroys shifting the levels. And the reason is the following. If I look at level zero and I take a bunch of villages in here, so they Of villages in here, so they have their population, and now I look at say level n for something n and I look at the descendants of these villages that have their population here. So, what happens to the population? The population, let's just call it Pn here. It's of course not a population data level that's infinite, it's just in this chunk over here. Let's call this. chunk over here let's call this p0 pn equals t to be sum of these deltas times pn prime zero one of the technical details i was hiding for you is that these deltas are constant in all layers so delta of zero delta of one delta of two and so but the number of villages grows Grows as lambda to the n. What is lambda to the n? Lambda is the growth rate of the two. Of course, there's a lot of details here that are hidden, so it's no choice. But if two is not compatible with lambda, then there's no periodic sequence that it will approximate. That it will approximate lambda to the n. And if two is compatible with lambda, then we're going to play the same game here, this three. So, when we start doing all these things, we look at lambda and we say either two or three will work, we stick to that one. And so the upshot of it is this. Gromov already produced a subshift of finite type, which was studied in detail by Connert and Papadokos. This subshift of finite type is never strongly aperiodic. Strongly aperiodic because it always admits some configuration where you can shift up. You may not be able to shift up by one, but by some number of levels, and then it covers itself. And we need to break that symmetry down. To break that symmetry down, we populate the vertices which we call our villages. And the thing that breaks the symmetry down, actually, is the population growth from level to level because it's not compatible with. It's not compatible with the growth rate of the group. Okay, so you know, I think that's a bit more technical than I wanted to get. But I mean, the positive side is looking at my notes and they got a lot more technical. So I'm going to finish early because that's my way of saying I'm sorry for the list of technical. Okay, let's thank Joa. Okay, let's thank Johav for his talk. Yeah, are there any questions? Okay, well, if there's no questions, we can thank him again. Thank you.
