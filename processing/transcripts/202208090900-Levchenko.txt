Okay, great. Okay. The sound wasn't that great. Hi, everybody. I hope you can hear me. And it's a pleasure to be, at least to have this opportunity to talk about our work. There's a bit of, I guess, curse on me attending this particular band meeting. I've tried several times. I've tried several times, and each time there's something that comes in the way. So, rather than standing up the organizers and Andrea in particular, who invited me, we figured that perhaps I can at least present through this Zoom communication. Of course, I'm supremely envious looking at all the pictures that are coming my way through the email, and I wish I was there, but unfortunately, I have this ankle. But unfortunately, I have this ankle injury, and so climbing would not be in the books for me. So, what I'd like to do today is talk a little bit about these aspects that are pretty familiar to physicists, but are perhaps less used in biology and might be useful. Yes, hello, Hello? Especially someone just talked. It's okay. Continue. Okay, good, good. Especially in the context of the topic of this meeting, which is really related to this sort of idea of how we marry biology, thermodynamics, maybe statistical physics. And so some of the terminology coming from those fields in physics might be interesting to examine in the context of what we know about biological. Context of what we know about biological systems and specifically information processing in biology. So I'll share some thoughts on that. And of course, for the most part, people doing this are those in the trenches and the lab doing experiments, doing analysis, our collaborators, funding agencies. Those are the ones that I am infinitely indebted and grateful to. Indebted and grateful to one of my favorite quotes from Richard Feynman is that to understand life or actually anything in nature, you should be thinking in terms of jiggling and wiggling of atoms. And it's a wonderful quote from a physicist, and among other things, it reveals the The focus on what any physicist, I think, would think about as one of the key basic blocks or fundamental units for the science that they're doing. And biologists have a slightly different viewpoint. It goes back to the 17th century about what the most basic unit in biology is. Not that biology doesn't have atoms, of course, it does, but It does, but what defines biology as a science might be the notion of the cell. It's pretty unique to biological systems. And Schleiden and Schwann, following the discovery by Robert Hooke, really defined certain things about that as postulates, as sort of basic ideas in biology. We still use today to a large degree. And one of those ideas is, of course, again, that the cell is the most basic unit. The cell is the most basic unit of life. Now, thinking about cells in the early 21st century, I think we're gradually accepting that they're also this multi-state and biased. And I'll try to explain both of those terms very soon. Information storage, acquisition, processing devices, we really think about life as very much based on. Very much based on storage, position, and processing of information, trying to marry the information about the environment with the information contained in a sort of hard-coded way in the DNA, and either being successful when that information use is successful or not in terms of cell survival, for example, or propagation. So with that in mind, So, with that in mind, I still want to go back to the idea of how we think about something as simple as gas molecules, something that goes back to the analysis of the statistical properties by Maxwell Baltzmann Gibbs. And, you know, we think of it as this sort of movement of molecules, and there's a certain distribution that describes it. If we measure the velocity of this molecule, We measure the velocities of this molecule. And we see that if you look over time, this distribution is sort of dancing. So, what it also means is that there are a different number of molecules in different bins of this distribution, and there is a continuous transition of molecules from one bin to another. And if I look at it just a bit more in detail, of course, you know, if the molecules were left to themselves, their own devices, they would continue moving. themselves, their own devices that continue moving with the same speed that comes all the way from Newton, the same velocity. But of course, there is certain randomization that takes place because of the molecular collisions with each other and with the walls. And that takes a while for this to unfold because the molecules have to move around and collide. Now, what just happened on the screen is, you can say, well, Is you know, you can say, well, the movie is over, we should go to the next slide. But, you know, there could be another interpretation of this, and that is, I just am playing the game of freeze, the party game of freeze, and I just said freeze and everybody froze. Or maybe I just lowered the temperature, which is equivalent to freezing. Or maybe I have a different clock and everything slowed down. I just live in a different time dimension. And even though the molecules are still moving. And even though the molecules are still moving, they're moving incredibly slowly. Now, the difference between what we saw before with faster molecule migration movement and slower one is that previously I could have taken a look at single molecules and they were moving sufficiently fast and changing their states or velocities sufficiently fast for me to, after a long, long wait, but still acceptable in terms of. But still acceptable in terms of the time that they have on my hands to reconstruct the full distribution, even if I was looking at a single molecule. Now, if they're frozen like this, I can still do some statistics across the population of molecules and record their velocity, still reconstruct that distribution. But I would not be able to do that based on looking at an individual molecule simply because it would take me maybe an infinite amount of time. So even though eventually So, even though eventually a single molecule may visit all the possible states, velocity states in this system that I'm looking at, it's just impractical for me to do that by following individual molecules. And I would perhaps be much more successful looking at the whole population. And so, what happened here is essentially this idea of ergodicity was violated to not fundamentally, but from the practical perspective. The practical perspective, ergodicity really implies that even watching a single molecule, as I said before, is sufficient to reconstruct the distribution of velocities or other properties of the system because eventually it will visit all the possible states and I can do that. Now, so there is this implicit idea of reflected in the word eventually or in Eventually, or in this freezing, potential freezing of migration, or slowing down the time. There's a time idea here. And so the system, even though in principle it's ergodic, could become essentially non-ergotic if the changes in states are very slow. So we should be thinking about how long does it take for perhaps not molecules, but states. Perhaps not molecules, but states of the cell to change, or for if you're just focusing on a single cell, for that cell to visit all the possible states it can visit, which could be all the possible states other cells in this population may visit as well. So again, in the way of thinking about this cells as multi-state and somewhat biased information. Bias information devices. We can think of it as continuously morphing between different states, but perhaps doing this fast or rapidly or doing this relatively slowly. And what we're trying to do frequently is to reconstruct the distribution again, pretty much like we were looking at this Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, but now distribution of probities of the cells. And for that, we would challenge the cells. We would challenge the cells, perhaps with some signal, and record the state of individual cells, perhaps at some time point, based on their responses to this input. So again, the state that we're trying to define can be practically inferred by doing these types of experiments where we expose the cells to some input and measure the output distribution and try to assign. And try to assign different states to different cells. But of course, again, we can wonder if that over some reasonable time may change for a given cell. It can just explore different states. And again, I'm talking about some sort of reasonable time. What do I mean by that? And of course, that's another thing we learned from physics. That's another thing we learned from physics: is that nothing is absolute, and we should define these time scales carefully. We should compare time scales to each other. And so what would be sort of the reasonable time scale over which we can ask this question? Well, you can say, well, that's sort of the observation time scale, right? So you're just sitting there at the microscope, you're trying to observe what's going on with the cells. And over that time, perhaps they'll change their states. Individual cells may change their states or not. Individual cells may change their states or not. Maybe they'll change their states a lot, maybe not. But this observation time scale is also a bit arbitrary. It really depends on how much time you have in your pocket, so to speak, for that day. Frequently, my students object if I ask them to do continuous observational cells for more than perhaps 24 hours. So, and even automatic systems will refuse to do that for six. Will refuse to do that for a sufficiently long time. So, what are the reasonable time scales that we should be thinking about over which certain changes may occur? And so, arguably, this is just my viewpoint here. I think we can define several important time scales that we should be thinking about, one of which is this randomization, which also is known as mixing or cover. Known as mixing or cover time scale. Cover time scale, for example, is used widely in the Markov chain analysis. This is again this time that it takes for the system to explore possible states within the Markov chain. Mixing time scale is similar, is used more in statistics and probability theory. Randomization probably is a bit more sort of general. And this again, if you keep looking at the specific. Keep looking at the specific cell, for example, how long does it take for it to explore possible states, all the possible states that you may have in the system? There's this, what I would suggest, this biological response time scale would be a bit more reasonable than observation time scale. This is the time scale to which that randomization time scale may be contrasted or compared. And this is not, it's still pretty nebulous. It's not some sort of fun. It's not some sort of fundamental constant, but it's something that relates to a meaningful response. So it could be cell migrating over a certain distance or genes expressed to a degree that may define cell responses such as cell proliferation, migration, death, differentiation, and so on and so forth. So there's certain things that we may define as interesting from the biological behavior standpoint. But there are other time scales that I will probably spend just a bit. That I will probably spend just a bit less time on. And this is the memory, for example, time scale, or more precisely defined as integration time scale, when there is a certain window over which the cell can remember being stimulated and therefore can integrate multiple stimulation inputs. There's, of course, the fluctuation of the input itself. The conditions and environment may not be constant and may be fluctuating. not be constant and may be fluctuating and that gives another interesting time scale to think about and finally adaptation time scale which is in some ways related to both response time scale for example response only continues up until the adaptation especially if it's a full adaptation or memory because it's related to also related frequency to integration of the incoming inputs so but we'll primarily focus on the first two time scales On the first two time scales. And more now, a bit more sort of carefully, we can talk about effective ergodicity in the system. So the system may be effectively ergodic if this randomization time scale is sufficiently fast. And so it takes, you know, it happens pretty quickly. And on the, if you compare it. And on the, if you compare this to the response time scale, the system has time to randomize. Non-arbodic would be the opposite of that. The randomization time scale may take much, much longer than the response time scale. So essentially, a system is frozen, as I showed you before, and all cells retain their states over the course of the response. And partially ergotic could be when randomization and response time scale are scales or similar. So, what I'm going to do is give you a few examples. So, what I'm going to do is give you a few examples for the rest of the talk while also discussing some implications of this ergodistic view. And of course, as I already mentioned, it relates to this notions of time scale and state of the system. But maybe potentially a bit more clear if we look at individual systems. So, I apologize for interrupting. There's a little window with the video feed from our classroom that's kind of blocked. Video feed from our classroom that's kind of blocking part of your slides. Would it be possible to move it to the right? Is this better? That's great. Thank you. Okay, great. Okay. Sorry about that. So this first example is really the example I like very much because it kind of sounds like a fairy tale. This organism, addictidium discoidum, very classical in biology, model organism can exist as single cells or can exist as a multicellular organism. It's a multicellular organism, and particularly when the cells are starved, they can come together. We'll talk about it in a second, and form essentially this blob that gradually becomes a mushroom. But before that, they can also, before that, they can turn into a slug, which kind of looks like something that can crawl almost like a worm around. Around. And then, if that slug doesn't find food, then conversion to mushroom may occur. And then the mushroom itself can shed spores that will fly away and perhaps find a better place just by randomly following the wind. Now, again, it's pretty spectacular how this works. It may resemble some of the fairy tales when somebody turns into different creatures. Turns into different creatures. But again, if you look at the life cycle of this organism with all these different possible states of many cells together, there is definitely this initial state where the cells do have to figure out how to come together and find each other. And they do it by essentially signaling to each other and forming this beautiful patterns where a lot of cells are coming together, perhaps forming. Together, perhaps forming this ultimately spiral movement, circular movement, and that leads ultimately to them forming either a mushroom or a slug. And so you can sort of try to figure out, well, how do they respond to signals that are produced by other cells? How individual cells may follow those signals. And this is not our work. This is the work that I also like very much and I wanted to mention because. Much to mention because to me, it's one of the first, if not the first analysis, careful analysis of ergodicity in biological systems. And this is coming from early papers from Alexander Arden's lab, where they essentially took these cells that we just saw and they immobilized them and sort of poisoned slightly their cytoskeletons. So they turned into this wonderful circle, circles or spheres, and then they expose them to pulses. them to pulses of the signal and try to observe using just a biosensor telling them where a biological molecule is within a cell, how the cells. And so in response to each pulse, you can see this kind of crescent on this, just the signal kind of goes to the membrane, but not everywhere, but specifically to the part of the cell. Part of the cell that will indicate sensing of this directional signal that is hitting the cell. And if the crescent is pointing towards the source of the signal, then this is a very accurate sensing of the direction of the signal. If it's pointing kind of sideways, it's not that accurate. And so you can really sort of measure the direction of response, this angle of the directional responses. Uh, the directional responses, and you see this rather, you know, um, stochastic uh responses. Some cells are pointing correctly, some are pointing sideways. There will be a number of cells pointing even in the opposite direction. So it's pretty stochastic. It's not a super precise sensing mechanism. And then, of course, you can ask: well, what if we again do this type of ergodicity analysis instead of looking at population responses, many, many. Population responses, many many cells responding to this input. What if we look at the same cell responding to this input? Is it ergodic? Again, so just to kind of keep this population picture, this is single responses of many, many cells, and then contrast it with responses of the same cell to multiple inputs. I think it's 10 inputs over a certain amount of time. And what you can see is that single cells actually respond in a very consistent way. Respond in a very consistent way. There is a bit of difference from response to response, but pretty much they seem to be sensing response in a very consistent manner, meaning that if it was pointing sideways in the first pulse, it will be pointing in the same way, a little bit sideways or even opposite to the direction of the stimulus each time you stimulate it. Stimulated. So the system is clearly on the time scale that we are interested in. And the time scale here is this multiple pulses that drive the cell migration. Even in vivo, as the cells are assembling, they're also responding to this pulses of the signal. And so you can see that the cells over this time course, if you keep looking at one cell, you'll see a very consistent but very biased type of response. So it's not an ergotic situation. Exotic situation in the sense that we defined. Here's another example. This example is now less exotic, and it really is something that occurs in our bodies all the time. When there is an infection, the bacterial cells may be sensed by macrophages, or if there's a cut in infection, the disrupted vasculature blood vessels will generate lack of oxygen, which is also. Generate lack of oxygen, which is also sensed by the cells. And the macrophages, kind of this masters or jacks of all trades, will be the supersensory cells that will also secrete a lot of broadcast signals, such as TNF-alpha, which is a cytokine that essentially signals the presence of infection, or VGF, which is again another broadcast signal that tells the cells that there's a lack of follow-up. Tells the cells that there's a lack of oxygen. So they're kind of relay systems. And these broadcast signals now can affect more specialized cells. For example, cells that lining blood vessels, if they are exposed to TNF, they can create windows and cells in the bloodstream can exit, including some cells that are specializing on battling the infection. If the synthesis cells or blood vessels These synthesial cells or blood vessel cells sense the presence of EGF. They may even reorganize. And in fact, a very interesting morphogenesis process may occur where new blood vessels may form to compensate for the damage to the old blood vessels. And you can see that cells will specialize further. Some cells will become tip cells. They'll be just Tip cells, they'll be just crawling and leading the pack of cells behind them. And the cells behind them will be dividing just so that this whole new blood vessels can grow. And so, you know, clearly a very interesting sort of setting to examine. And some of you, of course, may know that we've been particularly interested in this signaling by too many cross-sectors factor TNF. And it And it has, you know, it's been examined in a variety of different ways by a variety of different people. And it has this pretty sort of canonical response profile where you have a peak, a dip or a trough, and then a secondary plateau. And I'm not going to go into any of the details of that because it's been explored in a huge amount of detail. But of course, other than to say that we can That you can, what you just saw was analysis of the average behavior, but you can also do very precise analysis of single-cell behavior, response to this, both in time and as a dose response. For example, using this very nice microfluidic chips that we designed and used extensively. And you can measure not only these pathway from TNF to a specific transcription factor called NF kappa B. Called N of kappa B, but also to other transcription factors such as ATF2 or CGN. And you can do it at many different doses shown here in different colors. And so, you know, it gives you a very rich data set of both single output distributions and joint output distributions. Output distributions as a function of the dosage, and as I said, in reality, of course, again, over time, you'll see that now if you look at the distribution of responses across the cell populations, on the right, you have time going kind of up rather than to the right, as usually is shown. On the left, it's shown on the x-axis. Either way, you can look at it this way or that way, but you see this interesting. Way, but you see this interesting changing distribution of responses over time, and again, something is going on going on over time. Perhaps cells are changing their states. Clearly, distributions are shifting around. And clearly, you can sort of try to examine how all of that may help cells gather the information about the presence of this broadcast factor, TNF, and therefore. Factor T and F, and therefore ultimately perhaps respond to that. So you can look at it as, you know, one of the first things you can do is just say, all right, maybe it's okay to just look at a single time point, let's say at the maximum response time point, and which you can do at different doses also as shown here. And from that, turns out, again, I don't want to belabor that because this seems to be now pretty well known. Seems to be now pretty well known. You can do the analysis of information flow. And again, the input would be OTNF, the output could be one of these transcription factors, as I showed in the nucleus, for example, NF kappa B. And looking at that as a communication channel, you can use this distributions of responses that I just showed you, either for different doses or time points, but let's say for different doses at the given. Points, but let's say for different doses at the given time point, to estimate the capacity of this channel, information channel, which essentially you can derive by exactly measuring these distributions and also maximizing that function for different, finding the maximum function of mutual information for different possible distributions of the. Possible distributions of the input. So, the interesting result that a lot of people are surprised by, and we still have many people trying to challenge in different ways, we were also disappointed by that to some degree, and we challenged that in many, many different ways ourselves, is that this mutual information is not super high, at least for that one time point. And it's just about one bit, which essentially allows cells to discriminate between accurately between just two inputs. Accurately between just two input levels or values. Now, one of the ways we tried to challenge that was to look at ways this can be perhaps re-estimated or something that the cells themselves may use to increase the capacity of this information processing or information transfer. For example, maybe we should indeed be looking not just how the information travels from TNF to NFK B as one of the outlets. N of kappa B as one of the outputs. Maybe, you know, I already showed you other transcription factors can be activated by the same input. So maybe different pathways and you can integrate over multiple pathways. So that's one type of integration you can do. Maybe you can integrate over time. Maybe you shouldn't be looking at a single time point. Maybe the cells really can integrate over time. And that allows them to get rid of some of the error. Get rid of some of the error that may accumulate otherwise. It could be integration over multiple cells, which is shown on the right, which definitely is a very powerful way to integrate the signal. It could be negative feedback, which is not an integration mechanism per se, although it could involve that as well, for example, for integral feedback processes. So there's a lot of integration, different types of integration. Integration, different types of integrations seems to be a pretty basic mechanism for potentially getting rid of noise and improving the transfer, the information transfer in the system. Now, the one that I'd like to particularly focus on is the integration over time. So, again, as I mentioned, there's definitely a time aspect to all of this. You can measure the response. You can measure the responses not over just one time point but over multiple time points. Another way you can also figure out what happens with the integration is just remember that gene expression controlled by this transcription factor is a natural integration mechanism. The transcription itself integrates the presence of NF-KAP in the nucleus, for example. And when you look at that, what you find is that individual cells, when you look at That individual cells, when you look at gene expression, they will express these genes now downstream, as we say, or controlled by NF-kappa B in different ways for different cells. You see the single cell responses here, but interestingly, each one seems to be pretty well behaved. So in other words, there's very little in terms of fluctuations or changes in states. It seems like cells will just maintain their states over the course of 10 hours here. Over the course of 10 hours here. And another way you can look at it is looking at individual cells. I should have given the, this is from Mike White's lab. The early work that was done in that lab also suggests that there are the single cell responses that are pretty sort of predictable, almost deterministic in time. They're different from In time, they're different from each other, but each cell behaves in essentially deterministic fashion. So, again, we see that over either by looking at the integration or even just unfolding behavior for individual cells and many other studies examining this another way, all point to the fact that it seems that the cells really just don't change their states over pretty considerable amounts of time. Now, is it the biologically response? I mean, is it Biologically response. I mean, is it the time that we would classify as biologically relevant, or is it just observation time that we decided to use? Well, it's arguably relevant biologically because, again, this is the time for gene transcription. This is when cells really are engaged in meaningful biological response, such as creating these windows that I mentioned before, through which other cells may come out and start. Come out and start dealing with the infection. So, these are a couple of examples: one for this amoeba cells, Dichtiostidium dyscoidum. The other is this cytokine or TNF response in the cells that we have in our body. And they both seem to suggest that it's really not an ergodic process over the time scales that we're looking at. And so, in both cases, And so, in both cases, really, you cannot really gain, you know, here in this example, because you can predict what the response is going to be like at later time points. And cells, really, each individual cell essentially behaves deterministically, it doesn't make any sense to integrate over time because knowledge of response at a given time point is equivalent, because of the deterministic property of the system, to the knowledge of the system at any other given time point. System at any other given time point. And you can show this experimentally that integration over time doesn't really add to this information amount that we estimated. If it does that, it adds very little. It adds a little bit to the bits that we are looking at here. So, and this again is a problem of non-ergotic systems because they don't really look at the input in different ways. They don't really change their bias. They don't really change their biases, so to speak, over the reasonable course of time. And therefore, it doesn't really add to their information input. If they were able to change their states, if they were exotic, then of course they could by integration over multiple states that they would visit, they could definitely improve their information the capacity of information transfer quite a bit. Uh, information transfer quite a bit. Um, now you can say, Well, and this argument also has been made that this really is a very useful, though, uh, property of the system because each cell being essentially almost deterministic over this time course, you know, you can stimulate it with many different inputs. And as a well-behaved, almost non-stochastic cell, it would be able to very nicely discriminate between different inputs. And that's true. And that's true that when we say two bits, it may not in some sense relate to single cells because they could be much more precise. But they are all biased. And so when people talk about this and they make an argument that, you know, let's just pick one cell, I always have a question of, well, which cell are you going to pick? And the, you know, cell picking of individual cells is a choice. Is a choice. And again, I don't need to tell this audience that any choice involves another information event, information processing event. Essentially, you're infusing information by choosing, and that leads to this effective increase of the ability by individual cells to process information. So, the issue with this argument again is that the choice can be quite arbitrary, and therefore, you may pick some bias. And therefore, you may pick some biased cells that will not be able, even though they're internally more consistent, they would be still not accurately providing you with information about the environment. The non-ergotic cells potentially could be better at another interesting sort of way of transferring information called fractional response. This is where what matters is not what individual cells do, but what fraction of cell may respond. What fraction of cells may respond or not? And the reason for that is just this fractions of either responding or non-responding cells may not change very much over again over the time course of the measurement. And finally, we'll revisit that they have a low phenotypic plasticity and again sort of will tend to respond in a very similar fashion over the course and that may carry certain disadvantages for the system. I'll revisit that in a second. So let's cover So let's cover in the remaining time the opposite sort of situation where we have ergodic signaling responses, signaling and responses. So I'll give you another example, and this example still relates to blood vessels. This is more of a developmental setting rather than a setting that you may see in the case of infections. And so, for zebrafish, when the embryo develops, and you kind of focus on the tail of the developing embryo, you see this regular pattern. You see this regular pattern, and there are many interesting features of that. But one of the interesting features is that the blood vessels, when they form, they form also in this kind of repeated pattern. And they are pretty easy to track. And so you can sort of essentially the embryos are transparent. So you can really sort of stick them in the microscope, which we did, and try to observe how they form. Observe how they form. And as you do, you also can follow signaling. And specifically, one of the more signaling events is calcium signaling. So below, I'll show you this nice movie where you should ignore what you're looking at right now. This kind of other part of the embryo and focus on this area. This is where the blood vessels are going to grow. And so you see these flashes of. And so you see these flashes of kind of almost like flashes of lightning if you look at the Earth from space. This flashes are flashes of calcium signaling in the actual life embryo. You can see that it's very active, many fluctuations, oscillations, but if you look at a bit more carefully, you'll see that cells in the front, the steep cells that are moving, they actually don't have this kind of fluctuations. They're very steady in calcium. And cells behind them, cells that Cells behind them, cells that divide, have these repeated spikes. Something you can actually observe even in the lab when you look at individual cells, see this behaviors where there's a steady response as well as this fluctuating response. And we know from just a general analysis of this system that calcium is indeed very important and can be decoded to indicate to the cell that it should move or process. It should move or proliferate. But it's not, well, at least wasn't known very much as we were sort of looking at this, particularly looking at the embryo. And so by looking now in the lab, what you've basically recognized very quickly is that there are, again, three different behaviors of calcium that you can separate, kind of almost like three words and the vocabulary of the cells. There is the steady response, there is this. There's this transient peak, which is not that important, but there's a pretty steady, low but steady response. Could be fluctuations that I mentioned, or no response at all. So three different ways the cells can respond. What they respond to is this other input that I mentioned before. I should have mentioned it again. This is this VGF signal that signals lack of oxygen in the system. So this is how the calcium. So, this is how the calcium behaves in response to that. Now, as you change the concentration of EGF, different fractions of cells will be in different sort of or different fractions of cells will exhibit different behaviors, three different behaviors that they already indicate. And gradually, what you'll see is that more and more cells will show this very steady calcium response, and less and less cells. Response, and less and less cells will show no response, and somewhere in between, we'll have this fluctuating cells. So, now, how should we even think about the different kinds of responses, right? And it's very helpful to think about this kind of in this cartoonish way almost. You probably have seen, again, a lot of this analysis before in various systems, but just to sort of reiterate, what we frequently see is this, or we can sort of draw this phase down. Sort of draw this phase diagrams where, for example, for a feedback system, positive feedback system, there may be three different possible responses: low, high, and bistable. If you combine positive feedback and negative feedback, a very similar phase diagram can be drawn, where instead of bistable, we frequently have hossultry behavior. And so, this is just a parametric view of the system. This is sort of, you know, the cells can be anywhere on this diagram or can be. On this diagram, or can be moving on this diagram in response to the input, or even moving because their states may be changing in time. And again, I'm not going to get into why this looks like this, but in a slightly deeper way, it's just a reflection of this fold bifurcation. And what's interesting, of course, and as I said, because of cells potentially being on this diagram somewhere, it's interesting to relate. Somewhere, it's interesting to relate the signaling parameters that you can measure in a system as these distributions, for example, N of kappa B in the nucleus or some other types of distributions, to where the cells may be on these phenotypic kind of phase planes. And frequently, these phenotypic parameters will be functions of signaling parameters, and you can directly map your populations onto these phase diagrams. And as, for example, input increases. For example, input increases, you can see how this whole cloud of cells may be moving, and therefore, different fractions of cells may display oscillatory behavior or fluctuating behavior that we saw for calcium, low response for high response, for instance. And so this can be sort of explained in this particular way. Now, what's interesting is that it does have a certain meaning. So the cells that fluctuate actually have higher expression of transcription factors that upregulates. Of transcription factors that are preglate, such as MFAT, that preglate cell division. Whereas, if the cells have higher probability of constant signaling, not fluctuating, but constant signaling, they will abregate their migration. Now, there's an interesting question of how do they decode these different temporal patterns, which we go into this paper. In this paper, suffice it to say again that these different patterns do have some meaning for the cells. Some meaning for the cells, and they are very meaningful in terms of growth of blood vessels. I described before some cells actually migrate and other cells behind them divide. So, again, is it ergodic? It turns out it is. So, if you focus on individual cells, you can focus in this embryo. You can look at cells that are tip cells in the migrating cells, but frequently you'll see that the migrating cell will not be migrating continuously. It will stop. And it happens almost invariably. It happens almost invariably when there's a transition from low-level, sorry, steady response that is different from no response. That's called higher-level response, but steady response, to fluctuations. As soon as you see fluctuations in calcium, the cells stop and frequently will divide. And you can see the switches from movement and no oscillations, essentially, or no fluctuations to fluctuating situation. Situation in real time for many of the cells. And vice versa, they can switch from proliferation to migration. This can happen in a situation, for example, when a new branch of this extending blood vessel may form, and you now have a new cell that is moving and other cells behind it begin to divide. And again, you see very You see very substantial correlation between this behavior and the fluctuations of calcium in the cells going from high, very spiky activity to very steady, low, but non-zero activity, which indicates the migratory behavior. So over the course of this development of blood vessels, we can definitely see switches between the different states that we've indicated previously. And in that sense, the system And in that sense, the system is at least partially logotic. And so, one other way to look at it is to, and we kind of get into it in this upcoming review in science, is that within that population of cells, you'll see not just the steady distribution, but kind of a movement within this cloud of what were switches of the states within the cloud, allowing cells to explore different phenotypic behaviors from no response to proliferation to migration. To migration and back. And overall, we would term it a phenotypic plasticity. So, this is a very phenotypically plastic. Even single cells can explore all these different behaviors over a reasonable amount of time. I'll give you one more example since we have a little bit more time left. And this is again something that happens with this migrating cells, for example, in these could be tip cells that we already mentioned, that the tips of the Cells that we already mentioned at the tips of this extending blood vessels or future blood vessels, or it could be cancer cells invading in the matrix around them. And it's a very interesting set of phenomena, very actively explored. We are very, very interested in that. And what's interesting is that, you know, this metrics, the structure of the metrics and physical properties of the metrics. The physical properties of the metrics have a very profound effect on how the cells move, whether they move, and where they move. And in fact, cells themselves can reorganize the matrix. So, for example, this is an example of a bunch of cells sitting within a matrix. And you can see the structure of the matrix changing by developing wrinkles initially when the cells begin to pull on the matrix. And as these wrinkles develop, essentially. These wrinkles develop, essentially, the matrix fibers align. The cells actually follow those fibers, they can crawl out and take it very seriously as a cue for them to go and follow these fibers. And even individual cells, excuse me, individual cells can deform the matrix. So you can take cancer cells and in blue in these lower panels, you see this matrix that begins to organize around them, and then they essentially follow those matrix tracks as a Tracks as a train would. So, you know, in that context, what you can do is you can sort of try to mimic the structure, density of the metrics, this whole aligned structure of the fibers using this nanofabricated devices that we constructed a while ago. And, you know, when you put cells on those devices, you'll see that there are some interesting phenomena. For example, they can follow the density of those fibers. But even if you look at But even if you look at how they move along the fibers, there are some interesting things that are happening there. For instance, some cells will just for a very long time fluctuate both in terms of their migratory sort of shifts, but also if you follow the behavior molecule called Pa3 Kname, which usually is activated at the front of a moving cell, you see that there's a continuous repolarization. The cell actually doesn't. Repolarization cell actually doesn't seem to make up its mind where to go and continuously switches this polarity as it kind of sits in the spot. And so again, you have this interesting oscillatory behavior. You can really figure this out on the molecular level as well. And this is a case again where you have this combination of positive and negative feedback that can yield not only oscillations, but also steady responses. Also, steady responses, steady, relatively high or low responses. In fact, you can again get a similar diagram for some parameters of the system that we saw before. And you can sort of populate that with cells. And you can see this again on the right, kind of again, the same diagram almost with this intermediate oscillator behavior, but also behaviors that are more steady, either low or high levels of those. And indeed, you can observe more persistent migration. Uh, more persistent migration, more oscillatory, and kind of more random migration, more indicative of low level of signaling. And depending on the density, again, density of these fibers serves as an input for the system that can define the fractions of cells, showing you different responses. This more sort of random low-level activation, oscillatory, or persistent, higher-level activation, and higher polarization. And higher polarization. And so the cells essentially can move in different ways, either more persistently or not very effectively by these indecisive oscillations, or more randomly, not very effectively either, kind of locally without making much progress. And again, we can sort of do this mapping of populations of cells into this phase diagrams. And depending on the input, the population now shifts kind of a little bit. The population now shifts kind of a little bit upwards or downwards. These are different zones indicating different outputs. In fact, you can sort of reconstruct where the population is from the fractions of cells showing different behaviors. And again, you can ask, is it ergodic? And one way to look at it is to look at the experiment, and you can have some nice implementation of the model. Also, is this Markov model, kind of where the cells may visit different. Kind of where the cells may visit different states. And experimentally, what we see is that the cells will crawl over a certain time. But if you look at, let's see if I can use my pointer here. So you look over here at a cell as an example here, it goes and then you start seeing that the cell after a very persistent migration will stay there and oscillate for quite a while. And so, again, this is, I can, you know, So, again, this is, I can, you know, there's definitely analysis, further analysis of this, but I just wanted to show you this as an example. And Markov model basically, you know, supports that as well. And again, so it doesn't seem to be, you see quite a number of cases where the cells switch from, you know, between these different responses. They're not stuck in either one of them. And so you can ask, well, why the heck would they oscillate? Why the heck would they oscillate? You know, that's not very effective. Why would they kind of switch from more persistent behavior to oscillatory to random behavior and back? And one interesting potential interpretation of why such behaviors might be interesting is this sort of idea of how if you are in a dark room and you're looking for an object, or you know, it could be also me in the morning looking for my keys. My keys. If somebody shot me, you know, a movie of me doing that, I would be sort of running around the room, but then periodically stopping and spending some time, you know, kind of sniffing around. Same thing with the dogs. They kind of run around, then they stop and start sniffing. I wouldn't be sniffing, actually. I would be just looking. And then I'll run again and so on. So it turns out to be an optimal strategy for in the absence of the Of the input, such as gradients of some factors that the cells may be sensing. In the absence of cues, this allows you to cover some area very quickly and find some objects. Now, for cancer cells, this can be quite effective because they may be looking for particular places, for example, available lymphatic or blood vessels for them to get into and to continue spreading through the body. Continues spreading through the body. This is again just a kind of plausible, perhaps explanation, not proven fact, but this could be a very interesting sort of way if you could, again, be plastic in your responses and not just be stuck in a given behavior. They can sort of temporarily over time switch between different responses. And oscillations actually here are a very effective way of this stopping and potentially reversing. Stopping and potentially reversing your direction of migration, it helps a lot with this. And so, it's a little bit of an elaboration on this algorithm. So, just to conclude here, one is that, you know, again, just to kind of focus on this ergodic signaling where the cells can actually switch their states over response time, it does allow you to take advantage of the temporal regulation, as I mentioned before. The cells in this case can potentially. Before the cells in this case can potentially, by switching their states, could examine the same input from essentially different standpoints, almost viewpoints, and then integrate that. Now, of course, that requires the presence of integration, an integration mechanism. Could be gene expression, as I mentioned before. But that implies, as I mentioned before, another time scale, very important time scale of memory, remembering being stimulated for some time so that this can be. For some time, so that this can be integrated with more recent inputs, for instance. And of course, a greater phenotypic plasticity. So this is something that allows individual cells to explore multiple possible states and therefore multiple possible behaviors over the reasonable time scale. So, overall, what can be beneficial about Can be beneficial about this viewpoint that we're taking today, some of these examples. I think we need to be maybe a bit more consistent, agree on how to define cell states, how we should think about time scales, what time scales are relevant to what may happen on different time scales, and how they may affect signal processing by the cells. And then, specifically, more specifically, whether over the time scales that we believe are That we believe are relevant, whether the states may change, and the population may be essentially or effectively ergotic or non-ergotic, which can have profound consequences for responses by both individual cells and populations of cells. So I want to stop here and thank you for your attention. I hope I didn't bore you too much and may have some time for questions. And we may have some time for questions if there are any questions. Right, so we have a few minutes for questions.
