People on Zoom, can you hear? Well, okay. Well, thank you, everyone. Thanks for the organizers to Patricia, Fabrice, Sami, and Chengf. It's very, very nice. And I guess it's been useful for many people. So it's been nice. Thank you. Right. So I will talk about this topic that I have been working for the last few years with people, with PhD students. With people, with PhD students and other colleagues. And I will give a kind of a review of different ideas. At the end, I will mention some applications. So this topic, when people say random environment, two important models are the Sinai's walk, which is a discrete model, and the Brock's diffusion, which is a diffusion in continuous time. And people consider it to be the analogue. To be the analog of Sinai's work. Actually, there are some limit theorems. I have some ideas on that as well. So I will say some words about Sinai's walk and then I move to the Brooks diffusion. So the Sinai's walk proposed in that year is basically a random walk going one unit up or down, but the probability is going to be random. probability is going to be random. Okay. So you fix at every site of the integer of the integers, you have one probability. Like if this is zero, so this will be alpha zero, alpha one, alpha minus one. So all these random variables are going to be independent, and you can take them to be, for example, Bernoulli. Bernoulli. So sometimes you place in one side 0.25, 0.75. So it means that you, when the particle goes through this site, depending on the value of alpha, it will be more prone to go to the right or to the left or up or down. So that's the environment, the alphas. Okay? So when people call the quench case when you fix the environment. You fix the environment. And the kind of questions people are interested in is when you want to study how the environment is going to influence the behavior of your particle. So this is one of the main things. That's why in applications, like sometimes we don't have, in general, we don't have the environment. So one question is: if you have a trajectory of your particle, how you can... Of your particle, how you can infer information from the path to know some information of the environment, because that will help you maybe to make some predictions. Because the environment is going to tell you, as you will see, where is more likely to find the particle or less likely. Okay, so what Sinai did, a very important, very nice contribution, was how to encourage Was how to encapsulate all this information of the environment in order to study the behavior of the particle. So he proposed this function called W. They call it potential because some connection with the potential in physics. And what you can see here is this function with encapsulates all these probabilities. Basically, when you Basically, when you take these quotients, these logs, you build here another random walk, which might be symmetric or not. So depending on the symmetry, you will have some behavior or not. So the important case is when there is symmetry. When there is symmetry, so this is a random variable. It will take one value, say one or minus one, with probability one half. With probability one half. Okay, but you can study different parameters. So let me show you this simulation made by the colleague. So this is a simulation of one random walk, this since walk. You can see how what it starts at zero, it moves in a very short range at some times, at some time windows, and it seems like just. And it seems like jumps, but they are not jumps, it's a continuous movement, but it likes jumps. So, this behavior comes from how the potential, which has information of the environment, how the potential is. So, in this case, look at this range, which is around 40. It corresponds to a very low valley that forms the potential. So, this is the lowest valley, that's why the Is the lowest valley? That's why the particle spends lots of time inside this valley. For the particle, it's difficult to cross to this area or to cross to this area because of these big walls. So that's why they name potential, right? So this is how we use a potential to try to predict where the particle is going to be found out. And so the results of Sinais were based on some scaling of the potential, which gives at the end some Brownian motion. And then he used some results, well, several formulas that are known for the Brownian motion. And then after, people like Brocks use these ideas of Sinai to propose the diffusion. Okay, so this is. diffusion. Okay, so this is this phenomena is going to, you can see it as well in the Brox diffusion I will show you. So this is the kind of results like in this behavior from Sinai. You have your particle, you divide by log square of log n, and then you have a limit. Once you fix the environment, you have a limit which depends on the environment, and this function is known. This function is known and is related to the minimums of the potential. Okay? This is more like a law of large numbers. So at the beginning, I was confusing and to me it seemed like central imitation, but this is more like a law of large numbers because we are living fixed the environment for so every trajectory is going to converge in probability to this number fixed by the environment. Fixed by the environment. There are more formulas like the density was known after two people calculated it independently. So, this is the starting point for all these results about these processes in random environments. And then Brooks proposed this analog of this equation. This is a stochastic equation. This is a random noise. It depends. It depends on the position of your particle, and this random noise will be independent of the randomness, which is intrinsic to the behavior of the particle. So once you fix this noise, you have, say, a stochastic equation, and the movement of the stochastic of the particle will depend on how the noise. How the noise, the valleys it forms, just as in the discrete setting. Okay. So, in this case, this diffusion has this generator, this infinitesimal generator. You have the twice the derivative, this term. Of course, all these equations, all these expressions are at the formal level. Are at the formal level. So we have to make sense of this noise. So one way to do this, what Brock did, was using the Itos-Machin representation of a diffusion. So once you have some expression, some intuition of the stochastic equation or the infinitesimal generator, maybe you give the scale function, the speed measure in a form in a rigorous way, and then you can define. Way and then you can define your diffusion. So, this is the definition. This is a proper definition of the Brock's diffusion. You have this time scale of the Brownian motion, time and space scale, transformation. This function S is the scale function, and this function t is going to be in terms of the scale function and the. terms of the scale function and behind this is the speed measure. So this is well defined. All these integrals are Riemann integrals of continuous functions. So this is well defined. And then, well, this is our definition and we can simulate and we can study in a more deep way all this diffusion. So here I have this simulation. I have this simulation. I have this simulation made by Mariana, a colleague. So basically, she draws the environment, she rotated the environment, which is this one. And then she run a simulation. And you can see in this simulation, the same phenomena where the particle is around this valley, right? It kind of wants to go outside because of this. So this valley is pulling or pushing. This value is pulling or pushing, as you want to say, but it comes back, right? In this simulation, so same phenomena and similar questions we can well, we can model with these two processes something, or we can try to answer similar questions. So, this is the introduction. So, what we have been doing is studying the generator, right? At the beginning, we left At the beginning, we left fix, which is like a big step, really. We assume that the state space is a finite compact set, and then we study this generator. What we have behind this generator is something that we call the Brocks with killing or killed Brox diffusion. Or kill Brox diffusion. So basically, with this setting, I will explain, we are able to build the analog of the Brox diffusion bot confined in a finite state. So this work done with colleague from Costa Arica, Jonathan Gutierrez Pavon, and we don't really use theory of distributions because like this stochastic equation. The stochastic equation. The boundary conditions are such that the diffusion at the end is reflexive on the boundary. So there are some ways to define that. I think f of a is zero. The domain of the functions are zero at the extremes, I think. Anyway, so we don't use theoretical distributions, but we use because we are dealing with this finite interval. One very nice tool to use is the theory of Strum Louville, the Strum Louville theory for second order differential equations. But of course, this term is what is not well defined. So the step we proposed. The step we proposed to do calculations is basically to define Dirichlet bilinear form. So when we define, or we try to define this bilinear form, at the end, giving sense of this is just taking the ethos stochastic integration. So it looked at the beginning. So it looks at the beginning, it seems quite arbitrary, but we found out that it's quite natural. It gives a quite natural way to deal with these diffusions. So what we do is using this theory of strum-leville and these Dirichlet forms, we find the inverse of this operator, which people call it the green operator. One question about these green operators. These green operators is defining these functions, these independent linear independent functions u and u and v, which in this case are related to the scale functions. The scale functions, look here we have the integral from a to x and from x to p. So these explicit functions, they help to characterize the eigenvalues. At the end, we can say there is a discrete spectrum. Say there is a discrete spectral set, and we can characterize the eigenvalues, the eigenfunctions, and then give the probability density for this skill diffusion. So, this is one approach we have been taking. But we have other approaches. We have this approach, this other approach with my colleague Mariana as well. Mariana. So, in this case, we use the theory of We use the theory of excursion theory. Excursion theory is very useful when people have to deal with local times. And local times are very important for random environment models because they help you to measure how much time your particle spends somewhere. And this is what you want to measure. You want to measure, okay, in this area, in this valley, how much time it spends. So local time is a natural variable. It's a natural variable which tells you to use excursion theory. So, what's excoriation theory? One way to explain is that when we deal with the Brownian motion, we want to find how many times we find a pattern. So, imagine the following. So, we have the time, we have the time, and you have your Brownian motion. Your branch motion, and you want to see you want to see how many times you find this small trajectory starting at this point and finish it at the same point, or some other point, maybe the one. So you fix some threshold, and your question is: how many times do I find this pattern? Because of the loss of memory of the Markov process, of the Brownian motion. So, what Ito noticed is that at the end you have a Poisson random variable that counts the number of times you find this pattern before one threshold. So, excursion theory actually helps you to see how many times you have some kind of pattern in your trajectory, and that number of times is a Poisson random variable. It's a Poisson random variable, but the difficult question is to see or to say what the parameter is. So, in general, it's very difficult to know what the parameter is. You give me a very sophisticated pattern, it's difficult, but for some small trajectories is known. For example, in this case, my pattern is the following. So, this set is the set of trajectories. The set of trajectories that starts at zero, and at some point it will touch one threshold, A. Okay? So that's a part, right? Starts at zero and then touches A. So how many times do you find it? It's a Poisson random variable with parameter this one times the size of the time window. So this function, this measure, people call it the characteristic measure. And it helps you to say what the parameter is of your Poisson random variable. So, what we did with Mariana was basically try to see if we have an excorion theory for the Brox diffusion and to say something about the characteristic function. Why is it natural to consider the excursion theory of this diffusion? Actually, in many diffusions, when you diffusions when when you build them when you consider this ito's mac itos machin uh characterization you are only transforming your your brownian motion you are stretching the time or shrinking and also the space with continuous functions so like in this question right like how many times do i find a pattern if i study the diffusion these patterns they come These patterns they come from another pattern which is distorted originally from the Brownian motion. So, basically, we are able to say that effectively this proxy fusion has this the excursion theory of the excursions of this proxy fusion, they are applied They are a point Poisson point process, just as the Brownian motion. And the characteristic measure is going to be some combination with the original characteristic function of the Brownian motion. So in this case, we need the scale function. This scale function has the information of the environment and this small transformation, which is just shift. Transformation, which is just shifting, shifting your set. So, in this case, you first basically, how do you say, you transform your set. There is one word I want to say. You transform your set, then you translate it, and then you evaluate at the characteristic function of the Brownian motion. So, this is how we can find the parameters of the Poisson random variable. The Poisson random variables behind. And how do we use this kind of theorems? I'll tell you. Actually, now we are using this for this inverse problem I told you of knowing some information of the trajectory, say something about the environment. But in this case, I will show you this. These kind of results arise from that theorem. Like, as I told you before, the As I told you before, the local times are very important. So in this case, we have this is the local time of the Brock's diffusion at point B. So here we have the inverse of the local time, right? So you stop at the first time when your local time at B surpasses this threshold. So the inverse of the local time. And here we have this stochastic. We have this stochastic process. This stochastic process is the local time at C at time the inverse of the local time. So it looks quite complicated, but I will tell you why this is useful. Well, one of the results is that the local times at some point at the first time you're At the first time your diffusion hits some threshold is going to be some exponential random variable. And the parameter of the exponential comes precisely from this theory of excursions. So it is very nice to understand these kinds of inequalities because, like in this case, when you ask about the behavior, like the probability that your local time That your local time is bigger than something, then you might be able to say, okay, that means that your Poisson random variable is zero. There are no points. There are still no, you don't have the pattern you are trying to calculate the local time from. So, or maybe in this case, actually, it's bigger than zero. So, to calculate this probability is one minus the probability that this is zero. The probability that this is zero, and this is the that's how this kind of exponential random variables arise. So, okay, that's something. Then we can find these characterizations or representations. So, this stochastic process at the end is a compound Poisson process. You have here some random variable regarding this. Variable regarding this local time and this sum of exponentials. Okay, this kind of results, you have them because basically once your diffusion starts somewhere and you are studying one pattern, then first you have to reach the kind of pattern you want to find. And in that, say, in that surgery, in that... Say in that surgery, in that small path, you accumulate local time in one point you want to find. But once you reach the pattern, then you want to see how many times you find the same pattern and the same random variable is going to arise, the same exponential. This is how you get these kind of things. And what I like is this result, this funny stochastic process. Process minus this exponential of the environment times the time is a martingale. So, notice here the following. So, since it's a martingale, this martingale starts at zero. So, when you take expectations of this local time, you are saying that these expectations are precisely this function depending only on the environment. Depending only on the environment and in a linear way with the time. So, what happens when this side C is the smallest place of the valley? So, you are saying that the expectation is the largest. So, these kind of processes help you to prove or to see in an analytic way this phenomena of how. This phenomena of how your diffusion concentrates in the bottom of the valleys. Okay? So the proofs are, as I told you before, these equalities connecting the local times and the Poisson random variables. So this is the kind of the results that we are working on. We want to, in a theoretical point of view, To in a theoretical point of view, we wish we can extend this to other diffusions with random environment, or at least I think there's a family of diffusions with random environment. This is something we are working on. But when working on these topics, we notice that there are some connections with other applications, with other ways of thinking. And one When I was in my PhD, I was very keen on financial mathematics. And in financial mathematics, there is a very important, not just a model, but this kind of way of thinking. The binomial model, or what people, the names are Cox, Ross, Rubenstein. It's a discretization of the way of thinking of Black and Schultz. So the And shots. So the Sinai's walk is like a natural way you can natural model for financial mathematics. But the problem is that in the Sinai's model, the probabilities are random, which are random. At the end, they don't play any role because in financial mathematics, people want to price contracts. So the probabilities vanish. They don't play any role. So we propose other random walking random. Other random walk in random environment, but in this case, instead of the probabilities being random, so this this will this will not play and this will not work, we propose being random the size of the jump. The size of the jump is going to be random, which means that at each environment we have like a lattice of possibilities where your diffusion or your particle or your prime. Or your particle or your price go through. So you change the environment, you change the lattice. So this is one well, people ask me, well, okay, you propose that, but if there is something that already works, why do you report? Basically, this model contains the binomial model. So if I choose some specific parameters, then I recover this way of thinking. Thinking and, in my point of view, like when you study phenomenas like the market, there is a random environment. And if you are able to know something of the environment, you might be able to make some predictions. Okay, so this is one application. Then we use this in control theory. Another application I like very much is when you study these interacting particles systems, like the range, zero range process. Zero range process. And then at each side, you place a particle, which normally is a random walk, and they push, the particles push each other. But now you can ask, okay, what if each particle is a sinized random walk? What would you get? So this is something we have worked as well. I'm not presented up here, but at the end, you can get a stochastic partial differential equation as well. So this is a big overview of all these kinds of. A big overview of all these kinds of models. Thank you very much. Here are the reference. I think. Perhaps a very naive question. When you were talking about the local times, you had this phrase that you were using that there's Phrase that you were using that there's like a pattern, and you're looking for how many times the pattern is the path meets this pattern. Do you and then you drew on the board like an actual curve, whereas the set you had on your slides was more like a kind of a class of paths. Right. I was thinking, if it's like a specific path that's being repeated multiple times, in the continuous time, that would be a probability zero event, or am I? Zero event, or am I or was the like the presence of the random environment mean that there are actually paths, like short instances of paths that would occur multiple times right okay so I say a pattern I mean uh a path starting somewhere oh right so the the the route that it takes between those two points doesn't matter it's just that oh okay sure yeah so Oh, okay, sure. Yeah, so if I say, okay, I want my path look to be say I write these two grain. Yeah, right. So this is this is clearly some kind of uh Borel set. So on the continuous paths. So yeah, finding the I am itself. Sure. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. That has helpful. Are there any other questions? Are there any other questions? Does anybody online have any questions? Well, if not, let's thank Carlos again for a nice talk. I think we have a break now for coffee.
