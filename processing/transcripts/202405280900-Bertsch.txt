Okay, thank you very much. Good morning to everybody. I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me. I'm really sorry. I planned to go to Canada, but at the end I didn't make it, so I apologize for that. Anyway, here I am. I would like to talk about something which started, a project we started a long time ago with. Time ago with Professor Mimura in Tokyo. Wait a moment because I'm not able to what's happening here. I'm not able to turn pages. Why is that? Wait a moment. It is strange because. It is strange because I tried and it worked out no, since I tried to everything and it worked out, but I put the full screen and somehow I'm not able to get out of it. Did you return the keyboard? Maybe yes, no, I yes, yes, I did that. Wait a moment. I interrupted the sharing and I start all over again. I'm sorry, I apologize. Okay, now it seems to work. Okay, so let me start again. Sorry for this. So as I told you, this is a very old project which started with Professor Mimur and his collaborators, Isuhara and Wakaza. And so probably some of you heard about this. I would like to focus on a recent development, which is the last thing we did. Which is the last thing we did with Mayan Mimura. So I tried to explain very quickly where the model comes from, what are the characteristics, etc. And then I try to focus on the thing which I'm very much interested in. And I hope you can help me because there are some open problems. Okay, so the model. The model is a it's a model about the inhibition of growth. So what does that mean or not? Of growth. So, what does that mean? There are normal cells, density N, and there are abnormal cells, density A, which in a later stage could become cancer cells, but that's not so important. And then Mimura had the model, which is written there, which the reaction terms are rather standard quadratic terms. Instead of having a Plausion of N in the first equation and a Plausion of A in the second equation, we have We have a complicated combination, which is somehow the sum of n and a, so the total density, which is there is a correction, which is sigma. If sigma is less than one, that means that the abnormal cells are softer, so they push less. You have to think about a mechanical system where there is a population of normal cells, and then there is arriving a population of abnormal cells. Of abnormal cells and they touch and they start to push, okay. And they push less if they are softer. So, sigma less than one means softer abnormal cells. D is an important parameter. I am always going to take d is equal to one simply because we cannot do better. This is a proportion of diffusion coefficients. Gamma is a constant, k is a constant. k is a constant, these are rather standard things from population dynamics. So I skip this and I change variables. N was on the normal cells and then there was this combination sigma times A, I'm sorry. Sigma times A and I call it V. Okay? So that means that the sigma disappears from the gradient there. But we have to rescale some constants and what's left is this. what's left is this simple system. Okay, there are this afterwards we understood that there is an older paper by Chaptain Graziani Prezioti about tumor models, models for tumor growth. And if you look very well at it, it's inside there. This is a simpler form. Okay, so the problem is what happens if So, the problem is what happens if the abnormal cells meet the normal cells. We would like to understand which are the stronger ones. The abnormal cells, if they are dominant, they can invade the area where there are the normal cells, which, of course, if you think about cancer, this is dangerous. Now, if you take D is equal to one, which I'm going to do from this slide on, then you can sum the two equations. Then you can sum the two equations, and it is very natural to give a name to u plus v. So u plus v, I call it w, and then you get a simple parabolic equation for w, which is simple in the sense that the differential operator is simple. And you get a rather, I didn't specify this because I don't use it, you get a very complicated reaction term in terms of u and v and then in terms of w and u because we are, of course, you. U because we are, of course, you can eliminate v, and you are left with a hyperbolic equation for u, first-order equation for u. Given w, this is a first-order equation in u. So it's a parabolic hyperbolic system, and this is also the case if d is different from one, but that's not the problem because it becomes the operators become more complicated. Now, since there is some hyperbolicity, what happens if initially If initially U and V are segregated, they are separated somehow, so the supports are separated. When they meet, they don't mix. That's a mathematical property of this system. So they start to push each other. You get a free boundary between the two populations, but they don't mix. And that's what we call the segregation property. Once solutions are segregated, it means that the product Segregated means that the product vanishes almost everywhere. For later times, that stays like that. So they cannot mix. Okay. Now we did some mathematics about that. There is an existence always if D is equal to 1, it is this proportionality between the diffusion coefficients. There is an existence theory, which is not simple at all, but that's possible. And there you have this also this property, the segregation property is satisfied. So if they are initially segregated, they remain segregated. And we started a series of papers by Mimura and his collaborators, and then also Pertam wrote some interesting papers about this. That's existence. Uniqueness is not known, and if D is different for one, nothing is known. Now, we. Now, we want to know which population is stronger. So, it is very natural to look first of all at planar traveling waves. And then, of course, you get the one-dimensional problem. So, we take x in R and we rewrite the system in the variable Z, this X minus C T, the usual travelling wave variable, and we are going to look for travelling wave solutions U of capital U and capital V in the variable Z. capital V in the variable Z. Now this first terms come from the divergence. The first other terms come of course from du Dt and here you have the still the same reaction terms as before. There are standard equilibrium. If u is equal to 1 and v is equal to 0 that's very easy to see and also if u is equal to z and v is k over alpha. Alpha. These are equilibria. So we take these equilibria two different equilibria as the conditions at minus infinity. So for z very negative, v is dominant. And for z very positive, u is dominant. Okay? So you get a picture like that. So we are interested in a traveling wave, for example. In a traveling way, for example, of this shape. If this is indicated that k is bigger than alpha, I will always take k bigger than one and alpha bigger than one. You can play with this, and there are different parameter regimes, but today I am interested in this one, which are some of the natural ones. Okay, now you can imagine that k over alpha is less than one, then the picture changes, and you somehow. somehow it is natural to guess that if k over alpha is bigger than one then the the abnormal cells so that that's v essentially they are dominant they want to push to the right here in this situation that is rather intuitive okay so that's so the first result we had is that so in this this picture here we have an we have a traveling wave but We have a traveling wave, but you can wonder if there are segregated traveling waves. So, segregated traveling waves means that v is bigger than zero, for example, for z negative, and u is bigger than zero for z positive, and then z is equal to zero. There's an interface where they meet. Now, that's true, and I show you first a picture. This is so the blue line is V for z negative for zero z. Z negative, or zero, z is equal to zero is an is an arbitrary value, that's the translation invariance of a turbulent wave. So we put the interface there, it's a sharp interface, and you get what we expect that if k is bigger than alpha, that's to the left, then the abnormal cells are dominant, and if k is less than alpha, you have at the right, the u are dominant. So there is a there is a There is a unique traveling wave up to translation for all these parameters, and the speed, I call it C bar gamma, and C bar gamma in the first case is positive, and that's what I wrote here. And this is a theorem which we proved a long time ago with Vakasai Mimura, and the And the explanation is there, which I said already. If the abnormal cells are too soft, so that means that the sigma is too small, what is written there, what that means, the normal cells resist and are dominant. If, on the other hand, the abnormal cells are not too stiff, soft, or they are strong enough to push, then Push, then you get the other case. So the abnormal cells become dominant, and that is dangerous. Okay, now this is all what could be expected rather easily. So we have to go on. Are there other varying ways? These ones are unique. If you require segregation, these ones are unique. And that is very easy because you can imagine that you get two single equations for u and v, for u for z positive, for v negative. Or V negative, and these are second-order equations, ODEs, and you can solve them, and you just have to match them. So there is no difficult mathematics in that. Okay. Are there other traveling waves? Are there traveling waves which are not segregated? And those we call them overlapping traveling waves. So that means that U and V are strictly positive everywhere. Everywhere. And the first case is that k is bigger than alpha, so k over alpha is bigger than one. So this was the case that the normal cells are stronger, right? In the segregated case. Now, there are also traveling wave solutions, and this is a typical KPP picture that there is a this positive speed which of the traveling wave of the segregated travelling wave, which are called Aggregated traveling waves, which are called C bar gamma. In this case, it's positive because everything wants to go to the left. Now, that becomes a minimal speed. And for all bigger speeds, there is another solution which turns out to be overlapping. Okay, so here there is not a big surprise. It's a lot of work to prove it, but it's not what I really want to talk about today. Today, I want to talk about this case. If k is less than alpha, so then in the case of the segregated traveling waves where there is a sharp interface, the normal cells are stronger, so they push everything to the left. Now, the surprise is that this is not the case if we have overlapping traveling waves. There are overlapping traveling waves, we can prove that they exist for all non-net. That they exist for all non-negative speeds, so for C equal to zero, there is a standing wave, and also for C positive. But this is rather magic: that for the segregated solution, for the sharp interface, everything has to go to the left. And if you have, there are overlapping traveling waves for non-negative speeds. So, this is a completely different and less intuitive situation. And we would like to understand. And we would like to understand this better. So I focus on this regime. And there are many questions which arise naturally. First of all, can we say something about it? Can we explain why mathematically there is a difference between segregated traveling waves and overlapping traveling waves? Of course, the question is: can you fill the gap? Are there traveling waves? I mean, did we miss? I mean, we miss some overlapping traveling waves which go down to the minimal speed, which is negative, or they are not there. Does something happen there? And then, of course, which is somehow the topic of this conference, what about stability? And if what we see now, you have a segregated traveling wave, so you would like to perturb that a little bit and create a A little bit and create a little overlap. So that's what they did in this picture here. This is the second waveline wave, which wants to go to the left, and you take a perturbation, and it becomes an overlapping initial value. What happens if you perturb this? Now, I can already tell you now that it is a completely open problem. We don't know what happens here, and that's why I would like to have some suggestions. Some suggestions. Okay, so the third question is the stability, the local stability of the segregated traveling wave. That's one of the questions, but maybe the most important one. And in the other parameter regime, where alpha is less than k, so where you have a minimal speed, we have the KPP situation, then we cannot handle the analytically the stability. Analytically, the stability question, but there's very strong numerical evidence that the answer is yes. So, again, that is the typical KPP situation: that if you perturb with things with compact support or whatsoever, then you could perturb the wave with minimal speed, then that one is stable for that sort of perturbation. Okay, so now we have to go to this case. To this case. Now, why is this so difficult? Okay, let me first go back to question one. Question one was, can we give any mathematical hint about the difference between segregated radio traveling waves and overlapping traveling waves? Now, I wrote the system again, which is the old traveling wave system, and then I in the rewrote. And then I rewrote it and just to split off the product between u and v. So what is the difference between a segregated and overlapping tarling wave? In the case of segregated tarling waves, that term u times v is not there. You only see it if you have overlapping tarling waves. That's, of course, also for the PDE system. If you have a segregated solution, that term is not. That term is not there. There was a DUDT, but that term is not there. Okay, so we don't know why, we don't have a good analytical explanation, but apparently that term becomes extremely important. And if you start with a segregated traveling wave, you perturb a little bit, then this term is positive in a very small region, at least initially. If, on the other hand, you look at segregated solutions, then the terms disappear. And what happens? Where u is positive, v is zero, and where u is positive, where v is positive, u is zero. So the system split up in two very well-known equations. These are really KPP equations. They are degenerative because it's a perfect medium operator. But okay, that I never said that all. Okay, that I never said that all the problems have nothing to do with spurs medium operators. We are talking about things where u and v are positive, and in particular the sum u plus v is positive. So it's really the hyperbolic character which. Now u plus v prime, of course, is something like minus the velocity, and that's exactly the interface condition for the segregated solution. So if you go back to the segregated picture, yeah. If you look to the left here, the segregated traveling wave, to the left there is V, to the right there is U. But the sum is W, okay, U plus V. And that is a nice increasing function here, and it really is increasing, we can prove that. So that means that U plus the derivative is positive. So that means that that segregated traveling wave has to have a negative speed. Okay. Now, this is a slide. I have to show that to understand. Okay, I said I don't give any proofs for the existence, for example, of overlapping traveling waves. It's a three-dimensional problem. It's a parabolic-hyperbolic problem. So, what we did, we introduced some new variables. We introduced some new variables. u plus v is already introduced w. This essentially is the flux, it's the velocity, it's the vector c, which is different. And r is the proportion of u respect to u plus v. So if you think about a segregated solution, small r is discontinuous and w is a continuous and positive function. And positive functions. Now you can write down the equations. There are terrible equations with terrible non-linearities. And so this is the 3D system. What I would like to show you is that if r is equal to zero, r is the flux somehow. If r is equal to zero, you get the singularity. And that singularity corresponds with the interface condition if there is segregation. Condition if there is segregation, and really where r is equal to zero, that is in the old system, is the interface. Okay, so you get a very singular 3D system, and so at that point where capital R is zero, small r can be discontinuous, okay, because you can for example segregation property, capital U is is discontinuous. U is discontinuous. Now, but the only thing I would like to know to say about this three-dimensional system is that you can do some local analysis at infinity or minus infinity and look at stable and unstable manifolds. There, everything is regular, there are no singularities. So, if we are in the case that C is negative, this is the case we are interested in now, we would like to know if something happens for C negative, then the un. Negative, then the unstable manifold in minus infinity and the stable manifold in plus infinity are one-dimensional, and we are in a three-dimensional space. So, topologically, there is not any hope to find the connection. So, for C negative, I told you that for C positive, you can use this and prove existence. That's very technical, but it doesn't matter. It's possible to do that. Now, I'm interested for that gap between the negative. Between the negative C bar gamma and zero. Is there any hope there? And the first observation is that topologically there is not too much hope. So the conjecture is that in this parameter regime, there is not any hope that we can fill the gap with overlapping traveling waves. Now, here's a surprise. Now, here's a surprise, and that's what I would like to discuss with you. There are other traveling waves. If in that gap, there are traveling waves, which go to the left, so the normal cells are still dominating. They have interfaces, so they are not overlapping, they are not positive everywhere. But if you look near the interface. So something very strange happens. The blue line is V. So here is V positive, here is U positive. And then you fill the box here and you see that the colors do not match. And what happens there topologically, mathematically, that where capital R is zero, you can jump. You can jump in your phase space. Capital R is not continuous. So that means you can jump to another equilibrium. meet you can jump to another equilibrium which which at least a local equilibrium which you can connect in a completely different way so that means that these interfaces are are essential here now here there are two interfaces there are also solutions with three interfaces you need you have to put two boxes and it depends on the value of c if c is near the the the the velocity of the segregated traveling wave Of the segregated traveling wave, then you get only two interfaces. If you increase C, the number of interfaces is increasing, so you get first three. I made a picture of six, but six is an arbitrary number. If you push C very nearby zero, you get a very big number. So if C goes to zero, this number of interfaces goes to infinity. Okay, your time is one more save two minutes. Maybe two minutes? Yes, yes, that's enough. So, this is the theorem that in that parameter regime and for the speeds in that gap, there are traveling wave solutions with possibly a big number of interfaces. Okay. The question three was a stability question. So, that was this question here. If I take the segregated trailing wave and I perturb, what happens? And we don't know. So, we don't know, we don't have any reliable numerical indications. So, I would like to describe you what happens there. If you look at the perturbation, there is the blue line, which goes down abruptly, and the red line, which goes up. And the red line which goes upward properly. This is completely different than what we saw in this picture on the right. Here the colors do not match. So apparently, when you talk about stability, this perturbation is not a small perturbation in a certain topological sense, which I cannot define. There, something strange happens. And that comes all from this product, u times v. product u times v so and and and that we see that back in the numerical if you try numerics the numerics does not work it really crashes and you get very strong if you try if you put this as an initial data me you solve the the pd you get very strong oscillations near this interface so there is some magic this is my last slide This is my last slide. Okay, I repeated your open questions I mentioned before. But the thing I would like to know is this last problem, even without the hope that we can define mathematically stability, et cetera, large time behavior. But is anyone aware of similar systems and hopefully simpler systems where something similar happens? So this incredible difference between This incredible difference between sharp interface and diffuse interfaces. It completely changes the mathematics and the behavior of the solutions. Okay, that's all. Thank you very much. Yeah, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you online. So, very nice talk, very nice interpretation of the results. Could you tell me, this segregation property also for D is not equal to one, or is it only for D equals one case? Okay, I think it holds for D is different from one because the parabolic hyperbolic. The parabolic hyperbolic structure does not change. The operators become more complicated, but essentially there remains a hyperbolic equation, and it comes all from that. That does not mean that there can be sure about that, because also if you think about the simpler problem, to write down traveling wave solutions for those, for D different from one, then you see that very strange things happened at the interface. So I think there are interfaces. There are interfaces, but we didn't even try to. I tried a week to look at that a long time ago. And we decided that this was already so intriguing and interesting that we left that for the future generation. So I think the answer is yes, but I'm not sure and I cannot offer you any mathematics to justify that. Let's thank Professor Butch again.
