Here presential, like Zum. Now, I have the great presentation to Florencia Leonardi and the Matemánática de la Universidad Nacional de Mara del Plata in Argentina and Doctor in Bioinformatica for the Universidad São Paulo in Brazil. Adornment Professor in the Statistica Institute of the University of São Paulo and sugar de Investigación is prohibited. Statistica and today statistic inference for the model of stochastic model. Florencia, when it was much gracias for the invitation, for the presentation, and well it is a non-starland here for this audience. Well, my idea is with a little voyage of series, the slides, the transparency. The transparencies are in English, voyable en Spanish, but a problem. That is the doctoral, that I professor in the University of Federal University of San Carlos, Academy in the establishment in Brazil. Andrés Estudio. This is Andrés Studio method of inference statistics and selection of models for this model of stochastic models of block models that is a model study in the actuality, although someone, but a model that continues to be studied, and there are various problems, all relationships and some interesting things to study. You enjoyed To study. You understand work that 2012, and with a little about some other linear investigation that can continue or that you can study. So, you can see how this model is a model of how general. Most generally, and they are thinking for a probabilistic model that is for graphs or readings where the nodes are organized in communities. Because the model of communities, or in stochastic blogs, but also the idea is to study communities in these reds and in this graph. In these rides, and in these graphs. So, assuming that existing communities that have particular ideas, no? This model is a model that generalizes the model of models that to paragraph, which is a simple model, and also between the probabilistic models for graphs and models. The model of two renies, a model where they have not. When I have a red, a graph that is organized in a lugar in the space, and where a risk between two nodes with a certain probability and independent form. So, I have some vertices, to migrate, and with a project, like. As if there was a moment, and if it were, and thereby put a risk, if one of the alternatives, a colloquial. So, that generated a graphic that if the graph because it is a particular way, we are as community because all the vertices of the same manera, not groups, between vertices. So, this model stochastic blocks or. Stochastic blogs or community, what is generalized model, a model for me, but where we will, if not, depending on what community. And well, if you are interested, or interest in this model, the object in the detector problem, the community of society, the majority of the work. But community nodes, community detection significant detection that I want to identify is the group or communities that community. What do we have the number of communities? The number of communities, I can see this community, the community is important. We want to group those nodes in different groups, to see what they are in the group, not community detection and study. But what other studies on Andrés in your TECI is full problem estimate the number of communities, because in general, all the problems of communities. All the problems of community detection and when communities, I think, three groups of three groups. But not how determined the number of communities, no? So that is more problems of selection of models, so that selections, the dimension of my model, know when communities have graph or relations. In this graph that order that observant. Well, basically, the definition of this model is a little bit technically possible, but we have the vertices, which are these negroes, and where a variable are this one, two, estats, so this variable is very. So, that variable is alienatory, I will decide what happens. So, these variables are one, it is two, these three van services between a view, assuming that communities. So, that variable assume of one, values of one, and ten probability of variable segual. Or you will see a A community with this probability, dent of the possible communities. So in the case of the model or existence, because all was a community, directly the community, the differential, that there is distinct communities, distinct communities, and the probability that I connect the communities, superior variables, set. Variables, SETA. There via a dose, my view have a jot to parse and value one, and where one is with this probability, depending on the community of vertices, that's the beauty. The community of settlement and jots, which is actually the community of New Zealand and the New Jota. So what is it? What is studying and matrixamo que las probabilities with aristos? It is obvious to different parts of vertices that connect vertices that they are delayed one and two, you have a probability, if you want to connect two vertices that they are the community, or two of the community one, have different probabilities. So, for example, the community doesn't wonder, not Mojeña, it is important of different forms. And the question is: in general, that I observe the variable sets, or the unique observer is like observing a graph or a red, like this with the negro, but the variable sets are. I don't know what they are, the community, I observe the aristocracy, observe a graph, the nodes, the vertices, and aristocrats, and I don't know what communities. What are the communities? Well, community detections are determined what they are variable settings, for example, to see what are the groups, and the problem of model selection, selection of models, and when you are coming. If you have a question here, But no mention, you can contradict the value of it. And that communicates aleatory to see with who are communicated. That's what I do understand. If it is a relationship with the Qatar de vertices, well, because I'm clear, no, when you're in general, you have many vertices, the vertices will be in. So, that is some, but in vertices. Well, no, no, I can't exclude very, but not in it. But I'll have in vertices, and I have communities, no? Caba menor que en general delumo communidaden que ser menor que el numero de vertices in general because no tendría una una problema more complicated. That are also interesting, okay. What I will have with many vertices, and where numerous vertices are mental, no? You can So, what when you articulate them, there are the new articles that will appear on it. What is the same idea of the case? A community, or the process generating attribution of a community, is diverted, and connecting developments with what are probabilities. Yes, no, but no, we have not much. And many. So we observe that matrices, that we have a graph, everybody, because it is a A graph because it is a matrix in porn, so it is graphic in where it is, or a symmetric matrix because I live a graph or redesign direction, not in direction. So, that is a symmetric matrix, and I have a tenarist or a zero sixteen. So, how is that? The two generations with the same. How do you matriculate the general matter with that process that split their matrices aleatorial? So, basically, if I observe it, if I think two vertices, you see two vertices, two points, I can have only a matrix of this type. I can do it in the diagonal because no tengo, no tengo booklets, no. And, And there is a option of 16 vertices are connected or not, if they are connected, you will have it. If I have three vertices, you have a matrix as well, they have the diagonal and symmetric and ten that my indicator that parents are connected. So, yes, I will create because I momentarily numero de vertices have major dimensions. Con dimension major. But it is matrix are what I observe in the practice. If you observe a graph, a red transformation in a matrix of this type and vice versa, but if all that observes, it is observed from the variables of this set that are made communities. So, how we could identify the number of communities. Very much technical because. Because I think for us, it is a little very very technical, but we need work to identify the communities, but first space of parameters that have my space parameters are all the distributions about possible communities, all the peak summer, that means their distributions discrete about a cap and all. Obreguno and all the matrix P that means the problem of aristocrats where symmetrical matrices can calculate the distribution of similitude with these variable sets and matrices, the dimensions in it. And it has probability, this form where I think it is a red with.  So, the community, how aristocrats, not the matrix of essence. So, as an observo, it is variable set, not to study directly from similarity. So, we have to regular parameters and to not have this part that has to see with it and with the community that observe. Well, these controls, these things that are a definition of strategy, but it is implemented. But it implementes when they have the community, and these controls orders, but between the community and the community. They are using my red graph, and it supersedes what they are the communities, like the tengo, or something that directly colors. So, So, what we do is a little behind, a little behind, but traditional significance that attributes a distribution prior to my metropolis, so the distribution P, as the matrix. How much, or you know, with known, the tendency that is not facilitated because novel communities a prior distribution to the distribution of the community that will be a digital and probabilities, the voyage put a product of vetas, which also are like the dimension. Vetas independent. So, directly a priority that meant a distribution about this par, about the space of ypend. It is meant to be a formula a density with one thing that has this form that is good. But the formula of the density formula for these parameters. So, one thing that I say to the parameters can be a true thing that is calculated. True, what is calculating that especially of the part of the matrix? And one of them is an experience in relation to this priority that the idea of parameters. So, this experience is integral and probabilities with this priority. With this priority, this density in relation to all the parameters. So, when it integration has a mystery, it is better with all the possible parameters that could have this density. So, I have estimated that distribution. I don't know the market that you experience, it is integration. And what we have. Integration. And what we have is the marginal margin of the utterance with the settings and the settings, especially the problem of the complex. This is that esoteric. Well, like the set in the tenets, I think that to calculate this marginal calculation possible sets. Well, we have to put them in all the possible sets, but there is a problem of it. And that's what we have to do. And what have interesting these distributions of probabilities about the matrices? Or is it a little distinct from the vertex similarity that is not a probability? This similar distribution of probability and proprietary interests are one and their integrated objects of matrices and so. And then that means proprietary to study this estimate. Well, when I calculate this distribution, you can proponent one estimate for the number of communities. How do you do it because it is dependent on this thing? Depending on how these things, I have a priority different parameters. The dimension changes a function. The dimension changes a function of cases, and what maximizar of this function, in functions of cases, with a penalty. The thing that put a penalty because needs to penalize models that have a lot of community, well, that has a justified, but I think that voyage can enter the detachable, but we have a penalty to regularize the logarithm. Regularizar logarithm of distribution with a function that is more of the order of logarithm of English. No, it has a specific form of penalty function. But if you want, if I can calculate this and me calculate this function to validate, and there is that maximizing this, that have caused me to estimate the number of communities. That's me un estimated from the number of communities. No, well, that's a estimate. It would estimate function have proprietary function. Well, if we consistently, if it is generated, a real, esoteric model, stochastic developments that have communities, that was generated with communities, and with parameters and the And the cake with the interior solid part of a sufficiently integral is estimated to be. Or with this estimated concept identified when it comes to a result of consistency, we have to estimate this whole environment in a article that we have the reference. And this is a function in the practice estimates, we simulate different and estimated with some other possibilities, the nuestros are the current curve, and the other proposals that exist in the nuestro function. Pastebin objects in these cases where distributions p with communities are not very balanced. So, the discourse, the geographical document, are distributions uniform. So, I da laid the same probability for community distribution between the same. The two communities with 2% of the nodes, other concrete, and other constraints, are a little bit valuable. So, in that case, the other parcel functionality. But in this article, the results are in this article that was published in 2005 with Andresa and what I want to comment from this model: how this definitely built. How this definitely is our proposed number of communities with this type of problem, but to think about this problem, some of them, when I mentioned it, but one has the question that I have the cataract relations with our cases, in our case, summoning that. In our caste and numerous diversity, but we could study when I have a number of communities that also with these estimates. It was functions and when I observed more, I will create new communities, that passes in case, with estimates. It can generalize. Because in our case, the reading of the nodes of a community, the same community, in the same form, alleged form only by this community, but very rational in the practice, where I could have no queen. Tener nodes that have many attractors and connections in Finn, and not that there are the same community of other people who specifically approach the node. So, this is a model with correction of grades, in correlation, the possibility of connecting with the other. But it can depend on this problem. And other problems that we are thinking about, also in the consistency of a consultation, we have a criteria of information that this relationship with a little more concept is a classic para para selection of models for. For selection of models, to determine the number of communities, but we are the project, but consistently, it is not a cosa, all and that is a cosa que unfoco parcempo comas complicated. Well, there are other ideas that I currently in this time, and exist there people who are dimensional is. Is y perdon is the relation of problems of detecting communities, or because communities is a group, not the community, and that is relaxation with the cluster problem. So, if you have vectors in the space, like a group with clusters, vectors that can be distributed, but where clusters are when clusters are a problem very. My common many areas of application, like group data, which has the space, so the number of clusters or what are the clusters are problems that are related. The others are different, but the problem are similar. So, how can we study a other and how relationship between the problems? Well, I think one Well, here we go. But in this article, this article that was published with Andres, there is other references and important models, and well, I think that could transmit a idea of these problems, and selection of models to redesign, and well, Y bueno general preguntas or commentaries are many. Bien mucha gracia freencia por tu presentación. No sesía el una pregunta commentario aquí el audiencia presencial. Y, Laura. Hola, Florencia. Muchas gracias. Hola, Florencia. Muchas gracias por la plática. Tien tienen en estudios similar inferencia para el model de la Gráfica plantada, del planted model. But all here, not the model that has two communities of symmetry, or two communities of economic community, also here. Or you can see that one is the graphic reni and agar una community chiquita y le put in a complete graph. But if the graphic reni es sufficient, then it doesn't podrías estar segura de que la grácica chiquita completaque es because the posiste tú or because the aristas. But especially two models like the same time as this detection. No, no, no, Cobien. I think it is y model, but not a filler escorte. I was thinking that it is a model that has two symmetric communities real communities, but when similar to it, that have a subgraph complete, no, no, thanks, Lorenzo. Gracias, Lucias. Gracias. More questions for aquí. No, go say the question in the Zoom. I have a question also very vacillating that models of graphos in community, the problem of detection of communities, like the estimation of numerous communities. Communities that are modeling. Well, in principle, it uses all of them. In general, the applications that we see in articles are applications a little artificial. Because they are in general, these articles that are articulated between literature more statistical literature in two generations, a general, because there are examples of how congressional is unidentified with the votations, like the Congress, like. The Congress, like one, and the relations, no, part of the votations, how determined as to the political parties, for example. Existence, we have some examples of graphos or graphos that generate with authorities of articles, and articles of relations because publican con law. With the same public article in conjunction, the data of social redesigns, but not existing application where architecture is very concrete, nothing. I have the body that types of icones, but it's a model that. where you buy the internet, you know, a social and ten usual and connections, or they exist today, that are data that are usual. So So, in principle, can model what type of data of these types, no, not and connections of a type. Claro, because I mean, Norancia in the peno que estas porín servita to moderate things, of organisms, vivo, animal, for example, where the contact, for example, others in fermented. Other than that, I passed in, and not a cosa of this tilo. Yes, I think in negotiations, for example, communities of negroes, in the cerebral, yes, what passes many, I think what can be very applications, what is difficult with an opinion, as you can see for. The model could serve to model various situations, but it is application in the practices because they are simple. Clara. But here we have a potential. Here we have a very important question. O la florencia buenos días. Zotamogos zo y muya experta, but But when sensible is the result that obtains the initial graph. If we don't have a question, but for these questions of robustness, not stability because you plant the initial con graphic and question this when modified with the graph that passes with the results. Grapho que pasa con los resultas que se obtain en duego, no en el modilo. Yes, no, good question, but not a studios uniamos. If you could think that difficult, like chambi, well, so the estimated community, like the number of communities, but not with us with work in the entire work. Travis that through more stability. If I was not with training, we have a here antima question. Okay, so we are bueno losing that move the energy in theory in this movie, the graph. Or observable two values of variables allows in cadaver. Your vases assume that you para cabin have a very noise where the What is going to happen with vertices are notice, but there are some categories that are the categories, it is a very queer fish. So, no vertices that can be in the city, the category. And that is going to connect with all the vertices that are going to be. The aristocracy is good change, but the new vertices will connect with what they are. So, if I was to go to the middle, Grafo se tamel red chambia because you're already, but we are interested that studies would focus, or that have many aristocracy because what happens is that the new vertices that go with a product connect, the mirror members can very dense because. Because I have more vertices, and what more, you have more chances of connecting more with what they will change. So, we have the greatest visit and proportional form with it. And I don't know what that passes because I want a graph superdense. So, what happens in the media that colour as vertices, the product of connecting. The product of connection, things like that, and a little bit for it, we have a lagoon of the sero so that razor, we have the cosa. That passando, but if there was the array because they say today, and a homo campomerio, is that. Well, we have this more, but the road of the champion is like ten cos finitas, but when you create the memory as a masano, like, well, like the deterministas, there was yule like you can consider. How sir you can consider how to problemas have futuros could not decide, but I think various problems is a model that studies and if they are to study, I do want to learn to various cosas alleged me the presentation. Well, Bueno. Mucha, Gracia Florence, for your presentation for presenting your work, Gracias at also here in the sitter aquí for Zum y bueno soram de la mañana connect.
