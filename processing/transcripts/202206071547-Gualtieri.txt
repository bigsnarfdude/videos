Okay, thank you to the organizers for arranging this meeting. It's a great opportunity, especially after such a long period of misery. So I'm going to talk a little bit about some recent advances conjoint with We've been working on understanding generalized Kalar geometry from the point of view of Morita covalent. That seems like a strange statement, but we'll try to explain what the theory is. What the theory is. So let me just begin with what is a generalized Kaler structure. So a generalized Kaler structure, what is it? We have a 2n-dimensional real manifold and on its double tangent bundle, the tangent plus the cotangent, we have not one, but... Not one, but two complex structures, which I'll call JA and JB. Each of these is a complex structure on this bundle, which is just T plus T star of the manifold. Actually, this manifold comes together with a closed three-form, a real closed three-form. And this three-form, as you probably know, is used to define a bracket on this number. And these complex structures have to be involuted with respect to that bracket. And the important condition for the Kayler condition is that these two commute. So these are commuting complex structures on this vector bundle. And the other thing about them is that we should be able to get from these two pieces of data a metric on this bundle. So what I've done is I have an inner product. I have an inner product, so this is the natural inner product on t plus t star. This is an inner product in which you just, the norm of an element is just its contraction against itself. And this inner product, this has split signature, 2n, 2n. It's a 2n, 2n signature orthogonal structure on Orthogonal structure on T plus T star. But when I put JA and JB, this must be positive definite. Okay, so we have a pair. It's actually an ordered pair. A commutator between them is zero, and they determine a metric. And they're also orthogonal with respect to the vector? Sure, they're also orthogonal with respect to the vector. They're also orthogonal with respect to this metric, as you well know. Although that's a consequence of being integrable. So, for example, we could take JA. This is the standard example. We could take it to be a matrix of this type that's acting on T and T star. Just writing it as a block matrix, where here we have a Where here we have a symplectic form. The symplectic form defines an operator that maps t to t star, and its inverse goes back. And if we take jb to be this, where i is a usual complex structure, then each of these is the standard example of a generalized complex structure. Example of a generalized quantum structure. And if omega and I, so i and omega form a Kayler structure, in other words, this is a complex manifold and this is a 1,1 closed 1,1 form, which is non-degenerate, a symplectic form. So if we have that structure, if it's scalar, then these two operators will commute. And this defines a normal. This defines a norm in this case, which would just be the norm, you know, if I take x plus, let's say the norm of an element x plus c would just be g of xx plus g inverse of c, where g is the Kayler metric, g is i is omega i, i minus omega i. So, because here we have a symplectic structure, a complex structure. The combination of the two defines the Riemannian metric, but it's the Riemannian metric lifted to this bundle. Okay, that's the example. I have a question. Yes, hi, Alan. Hi. Is that the inner product that you wrote, EJA, A D, is that automatically symmetric? Symmetry? Yes, this is automatically symmetric. This is automatically symmetric because basically the transpose, the adjoint of this operator is the negative of itself. So because we have two of them, when you take both of their adjoints, the plus, the minuses cancel out, and you get a symmetric inner product. So just like without the J's, this is symmetric, but the difference is that this is now positive. Okay. Okay, so in order to see the geometry of this, what we could do is look at t and t star. And the important thing is that because these things, these both square to minus one, so they have eigenvalues which are plus and minus i. Now, because they commute, that means that the eigenspaces of J A decompose into the eigen spaces of J B. Into the eigenspaces of JB. So in terms of eigenspaces, we have the eigenspaces for JA and the eigenspaces for JB can only be minus I and I in both cases. And we'll give these names. So I'll call this L plus, and I'll call this L minus. L minus, this is the complex conjugate of L minus, and this is the complex conjugate of L plus. And what we have is a decomposition of T plus T star into these four spaces. So the complexification of T plus T star is the sum. I'll write it like this. It's L minus R plus L plus is L minus. It's a sum of these four spaces, which are the common eigenspaces. And the point is that, so you see here, the L plus and the L plus bar, they both have eigenvalue minus. If you look at, they have the similar eigen space, eigenvalue, right? Eigenvalue, right? So they both have the same eigenvalue on L plus, and they both have the same eigenvalue on L on L plus bar. So that means that they are actually equal on the sum of L plus and L plus bar. And JA and JB are the same operator on these two spaces. And this sum is, of course, real because it's the sum of a space with its complex conjugate. And so that space is what I'll call C plus. This is the. C plus, this is the subspace of T plus T star on which JA is equal to JB. And then we have C minus, which is where JA is equal to minus JB. And the point about these subspaces is that this one is positive definite with respect to the usual inner product, and this one is negative definite with respect to the. With respect to the usual inner product. And as a result of this condition, that this must be positive definite, all of these four spaces get the same dimension. These are all of the same dimension. Now, I immediately gave a name to the common eigenspaces for JA and JB, but of course by looking at this, I could project down. I could project down and I could take the sum of these two, and this would be the plus I of JA. This is what I'll call LA. This is the plus I eigenbundle of JA. And this would be its complex conjugate, whereas this would be the plus I of J B, which I'll call L B. And then of course the complex conjugates are here. This is Conjugates are here. This is LA bar, and this is LB bar. Okay, so the integrability condition for these two structures is that this plus eigenbundle must be closed under the bracket, and this plus i eigenbundle must be closed under the bracket, and so therefore the intersections will be closed as a consequence, and all four of these will be closed. So you could call Of these will be closed. So you could call these half Dirac structures if you wish. These would be Dirac. This is a Dirac structure. And these little ones, you could call them little Dirac structures or half Dirac structures. So that's what the structures look like. Okay, and maybe to indicate these four, just remember that L plus and L plus bar, they give a decomposition of this C plus. Of a decomposition of this C when it's complexified. So hidden inside here, there are actually two spaces, L plus and L plus r. And hidden inside here, there are two spaces, L minus and L minus r. Okay, so it's not too complicated. It's just, it's only complicated by virtue of the fact that you have two operators, each of which have plus and minus eigen spaces. Okay, now notice that the projection map The projection map from T plus T star to the tangent bundle gives an isomorphism between C plus and T, and the same projection gives an isomorphism between C minus and T. This is because this is a positive definite subspace, whereas this is a Dirac structure. It's isotropic. So they have no intersection. This has no intersection with T star or with T. These are transverse, and so this projection is an isomorphism. And so as a result of this, And so, as a result of this, T, which decomposes in this way, it induces a decomposition of T. And so, what we get is that T tensor C is T10 plus T01 for a complex structure coming from C plus, but it also decomposes, I should give these a name, a plus decomposition and a minus decomposition. So what we get is a pair of complex structures on the manifold. Just by taking these half Dirac structures and pushing them down to T, and we'll get a decomposition of T into what we normally call holomorphic and anti-holomorphic vector fields. Okay, and the other thing is that this C, right, because Because it is sitting inside t plus t star, I could think of it as defining a map which takes a tangent vector and maps it to t star. And so this is actually the graph of a general homomorphism from t to t star, a general homomorphism if it's an element of t star tensor t star. And so this will have asymmetric and a skew symmetric component, which we call g and b. So this is the graph g plus b. graph of g plus b. And this guy is the graph of minus g plus b. So we can extract this c plus information is the same as defining a Riemannian metric and a two-form. So we end up with a Riemannian metric, a two-form, a complex structure, and another complex structure. And you can see clearly just from these identities that this complex structure, so That this complex structure, so these complex structures are orthogonal with respect to g. So we get what is normally called a bi-Hermitian structure. Okay, and this is the way that it originally occurred in the physics literature in 1984. The book, the year. So, and I should remember that there is a three-form here, which came at the very form here, which came at the very beginning. This governs the integrability of all the structure. And a good way of writing the integrability, the integrability condition, is just that if you take what is supposed to be the Kayler form, namely the composition of G with the complex structure, and we'll give those names omega plus minus, this is g i plus minus. So these are the things that would be the Kaler form if it was Kaler. One, if it was Kayler, these satisfy the condition that dc plus omega plus is equal to h, and minus dc minus omega minus is also equal to h. So we get basically the idea is that omega plus minus, the supposed Kayla forms are not closed, but they satisfy a differential equation that says that the complex derivative is h, and both of them are equal to h. And both of them are equal to H. So, this is a crash introduction to generalized Kayler geometry and the relation between this relatively simple definition and this nightmare of data of bi-Hermitian structures with this bizarre interability condition. Any questions about this? So let me just, okay. So the first thing that you can do, and the B here, what's the relationship with the other thing? Sorry, H plus D B. Sorry. It comes with H. There's a There's a sorry. There's H plus Dm points out that there is a gauge relation between V and H. You can add anything to B and subtract it from the BH. Stract its derivative from the BH. So if you look at this here, so the Courant algebra, T star, it has these four things in it, and these are all half direct structures. So what you could do is, and what are these half dirac structures? And what are these after app structures? They are mapping down to the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic. So one way of interpreting this is that, for example, let's take a look at this T01. So this is the anti-holomorphic tangent of this complex manifold. And this is, you know, when you say that something is holomorphic, when you say that a function is holomorphic, what it means. That a function is holomorphic, what it means is that the derivative, the lead derivative of that function in this direction is zero. This is the direction which dictates what holomorphicity means. And so to say that something is holomorphic, relatively, to say that something is holomorphic is to say that this Lie algebra acts on it. That's roughly what it means to be holomorphic. And And so, for example, like a vector bundle could be made holomorphic by equipping it with a partial flat connection in this direction, so that you can differentiate in this direction. Now, this thing, right, it came from L plus bar. It came from one of these half-duat structures that got mapped into T, which is right here. So the fact that the L plus bar is sitting inside T plus T star is basically telling you that this Lie algebra acts here. This Lie algebra acts here on this space. It's acting. All of these four Lie algebroids, deir act structures, are acting on the manifold together with all of its structure. So because this is acting, we could try to do a reduction by this action. That's what holomorphic reduction along L plus bar or L minus bar. Minus par. Okay, so what does it mean reduction? Well, it's like symplectic reduction, but this is for Corant algebra. So you should think of this as being like an isotropic. It has a perpendicular, which is a co-isotropic. So if we reduce in this direction, I'm focusing on L plus bar. So I'll call to this I'll give the name K, which is the direction that we're trying to quotient out. We're trying to quotient out. So, what we need to do is to take the k perp, take the symplectic orthogonal of this. And that is going to be exactly this, all of this. That's k-perp, because, well, you know, the point is that this thing is positive definite. So, L plus R and L plus, their inner product is non-zero, but this is perpendicular to this. So, all of these. Is perpendicular to this. So all of these have Dirac structures. They are orthogonal to these. So this larger space we call a perpet. So if we take K to be, let's say, L plus bar, then the reduction of Tm along L plus R is defined to be K perp mod K. K perp mod k. So this would be this mod this. So we'd be left with this and this. Okay, and the point is that you may not be interested, so you may want to keep track of the fact that this acts on this, and therefore we can take the holomorphic sections, that just means that we can. That just means that we can take the k-invariant section. So, in other words, we could consider the sections of this bundle which are killed by bracket against k itself. Those would be like the invariant sections along the group action. So, this is what I'll call E plus. And this is the reduced holomorphic courant. Courage algebra. And so now we have, and we can do the same thing for L minus bar. Similarly, we can produce over the x minus. I'm just calling x minus the manifold together with I minus. And this is just the manifold with I plus. We have two complex manifolds. And now by doing this reduction, we can obtain these. We can obtain these reduced holomorphic current algebras on both of them. But you can also see that because of the fact that this k-perp splits into these pieces, which are isotropic, you can see that these little pieces, they remain, they reduce along with this. This is that this is a holomorphic Courant algebra. Courant algebra here. These reduced algebra, they still live over the same manifold. They're over the same manifold, but I'm going to reduce this manifold as well, and I'm going to think of it as a complex manifold. So in other words, I'm going to think of this as a holomorphic vector bundle over this complex manifold, the complex manifold that came exactly from the same L plus bar, which gave me the I plus. So it's over the same manifold, but as complex manifolds, these are different. So in the complex manifold, These are different. So, in the complex category, I have to consider them separate. They could be isomorphic or not, actually. In some examples, they're not isomorphic as complex manifolds. Okay, but the point is that when you do this reduction, they obviously decompose into what used to be half-Dirac structures and what are now going to be full-dirac structures. So, this is going to be a sum of a plus plus b plus, and this will be the sum of a minus plus b minus. And so this is what we call a Mannin triple. So we have a pair of holomorphic Mannin triples. It's called that just because it's very, very similar to the study of Poisson groups by Poisson groups and Lee by algebraids and study by now. Let me just Let me just keep that in mind, that you have the R plus and F plus of R, R minus and R minus of R. Okay, so what this means is that we've extracted from this complicated differential geometric starting point of a GK, the generalized Kalar structure, we've extracted a whole bunch of holomorphic data, namely two complex manifolds. Namely, two complex manifolds equipped with holomorphic manned triples. That's the key idea. So we have a pair of holomorphic data of magnetriples on x plus and minus. Okay, sorry, could you remind me when I should stop? 430? Okay, good. So, right. Now, okay, so here is the here's E plus and E plus splits as A plus and B plus, and we have the same standing for. This is the data that we have. Okay, now, whenever you have man and triples, okay, I want to recall, you know, not everyone may be experts in man and triples, but what you can do, there's this fancy operation that you can do to Dirac structures, which is that you can take their sum and their difference, and you can even multiply them by. And their difference, and you can even multiply them by scalars so when you have two Dirac structures, you can actually form linear combinations of Dirac structures. So these are Dirac structures, which what is a Dirac structure? It's a maximal isotropic sub-level, invaluative sub-level of these current algebra. So if these are Dirac structures, then you could consider things like this. You could take X plus take x plus A C1 plus B C2 such that X plus C1 is in D1 and X plus C2 is in D2. So there's a funny way that you can actually take composites, compositions, there's like an arithmetic of Dirac structures, and this will be a Dirac structure. structure in t plus t star. Let's say this was Dirac. Suppose this was integrable with respect to H1 and H2. This would be, this sum would be a Dirac structure in the AH1 plus BH2 format. So you can see that there's this kind of categorical structures, like Tirat structures for one twist can be summed Can be summed to get the sum of the twists. And so one of the nice things you can do is you can take A plus minus B plus. We have two Dirac structures here, and they are in the same Courant algebra right. So this has some twist. Whatever that twist is, when I take the difference, that twist cancels out. And so this will be a Dirac structure. A Dirac structure in T of X plus. So untwisted correct. So why these things are exact coronaxeroids? Everything I started with from the very beginning was T plus T stars. They're all exact. But F C is a reduction? Yes. So it's a holomorphic reduction? Holomorphic reduction, and you can check that it's holomorphically exact. Mark, can you just explain a bit more why is this holomorphic? You're using which holomorphic structure in the beginning to make? Everything is coming from L plus bar, which is the anti-holomorphic vector fields for I plus. So that is what I'm reducing along. That's the group that's acting. Is the D-bar operator for I plus. And you are viewing T plus V star as holomorphic as well with respect. Holomorphic as well with respect to the other one? I mean, I only need this thing to have an action of the anti-holomorphic vector fields. I only need the K-perp module. So L plus, by bracketing against K-perp, it sends it to K-perp. So this becomes a holomorphic bundle. This is a holomorphic bundle. The quotient is a holomorphic bubble. So, okay, and there's a lemma, a useful lemma, which is that when you do this operation, operation when you take when you take the difference d2 minus d1 okay if you take the difference of two Dirac structures and you intersect it with T, because we're in an untwisted, we have the tangent bundle inside there, so we can always intersect. And it turns out that this receives a map from the intersection T1 intersect T2. Intersect the two. So under the condition, so there's a natural map, and this map is an isomorphism when D1 maps to T and D2 maps to T are transverse. So when the two Dirac structures, their image in the tangent bundle spans the whole tangent bundle, then it turns out that you can compute, you know, You can compute the intersection of this difference with t. And that will be the same as the intersection. But here, this is a man in triple. A plus and b plus, they intersect at zero. That means this is zero, which means that the difference must intersect t in zero. Which means it must be transverse to t, it must be the graph of the Poisson tensor. So this means that A plus minus B plus is the graph of sigma plus, whereas sigma plus is Where sigma plus is a holomorphic Poisson structure. Okay, and you can do the same thing with the minus. And so that means that on x plus and on x minus, we actually have something more classical, not some weird Dirac structures and nine and triples and all that. You can take the difference between these and you generate a classical structure of a holomorphic Poisson variety. Holomorphic Poisson variety. Similarly here, holomorphic Poisson manifold. So, and these are the holomorphic Poisson structures that were discovered by Hitchin. So these are the Hitchin structures. Okay? So this is how are they relating to the possible structures of the original generalized complex structure? Yeah, literally the next thing in my notes. Next thing in my notes is that very good. But the problem is that, well, no, it's okay. You can almost, you can get through any amount of material by simply increasing the speed. So, okay, so this okay, so this should be, this completes, okay, so I did this in a paper in CMP. Paper in CMP, which is called Generalized Kaler Geometry, and I described all this holomorphic structure. And since that time, it's been a project to understand what the relationship is between the plus side and the minus side. Because these are not isomorphic. These complex structures are not isomorphic. There is no direct map relating them. And what we did with Francis Bischoff and Maxime Zapzine. And Maxime Zabzin was to explain that in a particular special case, these were related by a Morita equivalent, holomorphic symplectic Morita equivalent. And that's the real relationship between the left and the right side. But this is what's making a strong assumption about the behavior of this manic triple. And what we've been doing with Yu Song is to generalize it to the general case. So the question really, the main question is: what is the relation? Okay, is what is the relation between plus and minus? Now, okay, I mean, this is, it seems, it seems like a strange question. I mean, we know what the relation is, we just constructed it. It all comes from the same data, so it's obvious what the relation is in one respect. But the question is that if we created these two things in the holomorphic category, which are just appearing out of nowhere in the holomorphic category, out of nowhere in the holomorphic category, we need to know what the relationship is in the holomorphic category. And it turns out that there is a nice answer to that question, which is that there is a kind of Mauritan equivalence between them. And of course it fits together with the previous work on these mannant triples because these man and triples are supposed to give rise to Lie, these are Liebi algebraids and they give rise to Poisson groupoids. There's a Poisson groupoid integrating B plus. Group board integrating B plus, there's a Poisson group board integrating A, and then there's a symplectic double group board integrating the whole thing. And so all of that is on one side, and all of this is on the other side, and then there are Morita equivalences between those big group points, which form some complicated diagram. But that's the main question of this topic, of these two topics. Okay, now back to Rui's question. You see, we use this nice trick of taking the difference. Of taking the difference of Dirac structures to produce a Poisson structure. This is, you know, for the Dirac maximalists, okay, this is what Poisson structures are. They're always the difference of two Dirac structures. So, you know, if your Poisson structure is nice, it must have two Dirac structures sitting around somewhere that give rise to it. But anyway, we can repeat. There are other parcel structures. And these ones are real. And these real Poisson structures are obtained by taking LA and LA bar. So remember, this was the plus I eigenspace of JA. And these two are transverse. And so I can take the difference between them. Yeah, this. So we get LA minus LA bar. LA minus LA bar, and I want to take, it's really the imaginary part, so it's like 1 over 2i times f minus f bar. That's like the imaginary part. This is the imaginary part of the Dirac structure. And this is the graph of the Poisson structure which I'll call QA. And it has a nice expression in terms like this. So QA plus I plus minus I minus GA. I minus G inverse. And you can do the same thing with Pv. So we have also Qv is plus angle genes. So we also have these real Poisson structures hanging around. And the picture that you should have in mind is the following. That we have the manifold, and we have... Oh, and I should write also this pitch and possible. Write also this Hitchen Pussel structure. So if we write sigma plus minus as, since they're holomorphic, they're kind of determined by their imaginary parts. I'll just call the imaginary part Q. They agree in their imaginary part. They have the same imaginary part. And this Q is the commutator of I plus and I minus precomposed with G in force. Okay, so we have three. So we have three, these are the three fundamental Poisson structures in GK geometry. And each of them determines a singular foliation. And the foliation of this one and the foliation of this one intersect in the foliation of this one. So you should think that there's a picture like this. There's a foliation, another foliation. Okay, and then Okay, and then the intersection of the foliation. So this is the foliation of QA, this is the foliation of QB, and this is the foliation of Q. Okay, and all of these foliations, so all of these, all of the foliations are holomorphic. One of them is obviously holomorphic. One of them is obviously holomorphic, namely this one, because it is a holomorphic Poisson structure. But these, although they don't form a holomorphic Poisson structure, they do form holomorphic manning triples. That Poisson structure, QA, comes from the A plus and QB comes from the B plus. I don't mean that these are plus, they're not, but they do determine foliations, and the foliation is the same. So these are, you basically. So these are you basically have a pair of trans a pair of holomorphic foliations which intersect each other in the symplectic foliation. Okay, so right so this is the picture that we we have and okay and now in order to explain the resolution to this problem and it so And it so let me say about what the form of this solution takes. So a couple of years ago with Bischoff and Zaxine, we investigated a special case. The special case was the case The special case was the case of symplectic type. And the symplectic type just means that one of these foliations is the whole space. The foliation QA. QA should be invertible. This is equivalent to saying that JA has the following form. Has the following form. It is equivalent to a symplectic structure, where beta is a real two-form. So it's B-field equivalent to a symplectic form. And so in other words, this is the same thing as saying that the QA foliation is the whole space. And this implies that the QB And this implies that the QB foliation is the same as the sigma plus minus foliation. So it simplifies this situation into having only one foliation, only one structure. That's the reason why we were able to more easily deal with this special case. And so the key point is that You know, the key point is that actually, see the way that, yeah. Okay, so the key point is that you see that there's a bunch of, so that I'm just going to write the equations here and And um and hopefully uh this will be uh helpful and L A remote. So I'm just recapping what I said before about how we got the Poisson, the Hitchen holomorphic Poisson structures, that they were obtained by taking A plus minus B plus. So it turns out that B plus. So it turns out that I could rewrite that just by using the plus eigen bundles in this way. Okay, so this is very similar to what I wrote earlier about A plus minus B plus being the graph of sigma plus. Okay, so it's a composite of these things. But now the difference is that because JA is symplectic, what it means is that this LA This LA turns out to be, in the symplectic case, it's the graph of beta minus i omega. This is another way of saying this, is that the plus i eigenspace of A, of J A, is actually the graph beta minus i omega. So it's actually a splitting. Another way of saying it equivalently is that A plus minus are splits. So I'm just reiterating the fact that I'm assuming that one of the two foliations is trivial. And so the nice thing about this is that we can use this Dirac calculus to solve for these. We can actually We can actually remove LA from both sides. And the reason we can do that is because LA, because of the symplectic A, because of the symplectic condition, this guy is transverse to everything. And so I can use the Dirac calculus with this against anything else. So I can subtract it from the both sides of this equation, and from the both sides of this equation, or whatever, I could actually express, I could cancel them out, basically. Out, basically. So I could. So this implies, in the symplectic type case, it implies that L sigma plus is equal to E to the omega. No typo there. There's no I or anything. L sigma minus. Okay. So this is the key thing that I'm going to do. This is the key thing that unlocked the problem because what it says is that in the symplectic case, the complex Dirac structure underlying this holomorphic Poisson structure is equivalent to, is gauge equivalent to, the complex Dirac structure defining this Poisson structure. And that means that we have a direct relationship between the Poisson tensors in terms of the B-field transformation. Field transformation. And there is work going back to work of Olga Radko and E.K. Berstein and Ri Fernandez, which say that if you have direct structures that are related by such an E-field transformation, then they should be more e-taggable. General idea. And so I will. I don't know why it hasn't rung yet. The bell should ring. But since it hasn't, I will continue. I will continue. So, this means that we have a holomorphic Morita equivalence between holomorphic symplectic Morita equivalence between X plus minus sigma plus minus. And let me explain what that is. So I have X plus sigma plus, and I have X minus sigma minus. And I have x minus sigma minus. And I have the groupoid integrating this. I'm one of those people in denial of non-integrability groupoids. So for me, every Poisson manifold is integrable. It's great to live in such a fantastic. Yeah, I agree. Okay, so we have this holomorphic symplectic group word. Okay, so here's the key point because this will tie into you. Key point because this will tie into Yu-San's thought. So we need to construct, what I'm claiming is that there is another space here like this and like this. So we have the holomorphic symplectic groovoid, which is Morita equivalent. This is a principal bibond rule for which this acts on the right and this acts on the left. And we need to construct this. So in my fantasy world, all of these Poisson structures are integrable, so I've got this. Are an integrable, so I've got this, but I don't have this. And here I have this because I can work on the minus side happily with holomorphic geometry and produce this, but I can't produce this. And the idea is that because these Poisson structures are related by a behold, what I can do is the following. I can do a magnetic deformation of this holomorphic symplectic form. I can pull back using either source or target. I can pull back. Source or target, I can pull back this B field. What did I call it? Oh my god. So I pull it back and I add this to this holomorphic symplectic form, changing its real part. So I can produce, I can do this. I can start with omega plus, and then I can produce omega plus plus s pullback of omega. And then I could even go further, and I could produce omega plus. and I could produce omega plus plus sorry this should be minus S star omega and this will be omega plus plus T star minus S star of omega. So in this case I do a magnetic deformation of the holomorphic symplectic form and I get a new holomorphic symplectic form which is omega Z. And if you do it by source and target then this thing will be exactly This thing will be exactly omega minus. Okay, so the question is: so the important thing here is that all that you needed was to integrate this guy, and you produced a holomorphic symplectic group of it. And then we do this B-field transformation to get this and this. And these three holomorphic symplectic spaces are all different. They're all non-isomorphic. The complex structure is modified. Is modified by this B-field transformation. Because the complex structure can be obtained as a consequence of this holomorphic symbolic form. Because remember, this is like, it has a real and imaginary part, and they differ by the complex structure. So if you know the real part and the imaginary part, you can combine them together to get the complex structure. But that real part has been changed, so the complex structure has been changed. And so again, the complex structure has changed. So what we should really be thinking is that what we're really doing is Is that what we're really doing is we're doing deformation theory of holomorphic symphylactic group weights. That's what we're doing. So in the second part, Yu-Tsang will explain that even in the general case where we need this Mauritian equivalence, we won't be able to do it by a B-field transform. We will need to deform this groupoid, which will be a Poisson groupoid, and we need to deform it by a Mauricartin element in the DGM. A Mora-Cartan element in the DGLA which controls the deformations of this thing. And the way that we're going to do that, as he will explain, is that there will be a relationship between Maura-Karta elements here and Maura-Karta elements here. So we're going to grab some geometry down here, view it as a Maura-Karta element, push it up to the groupoid, and then use it to deform. And it turns out that that was the correct way of interpreting this B-field transformation that we did in the previous paper. Did in the previous paper. Okay, so I'll leave it there. I just want to say one little remark. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to talk about this, but all of this is all holomorphic symplectic data. And so this is not about Riemannian geometry, right? A Riemannian Kehler metric is in C infinity, infinite, you know, it doesn't have this flavor of holomorphic geometry. So there is an extra ingredient in order to get the metric. And that extra ingredient is a very simple. And that extra ingredient is a very simple ingredient. You need to take this holomorphic symplectic Maurita equivalence and you need to choose a C infinity cross-section, which is Lagrangian for the imaginary part. This is what we call a Lagrangian brain. Brain bisection. And just by choosing this submanifold, which is a submanifold of this holomorphic symplectic gadget, it picks out a Kayler metric. It picks out a Kayler metric by simply restricting this holomorphic symplectic form to there. When you restrict it there, what you get is a two-form, a real two-form, and that real two-form, when you combine it with the complex structures n plus or n minus, gives rise to the metric and the p-field and all of the rest of the data. So the way you should think is that the holomorphic data in white is the Kaler class. We fix the Kahler class. And then within that Klor class, there's an infinite And then within that Kler class, there's an infinite-dimensional space of Kayler metrics in the same class. And that's what these kind of wavy things are. They're C-infinity objects that are swimming around inside the Kayler class. Okay, thank you for your attention. I'm sorry for going over. Questions? Does Laglerian bisect always exist? Well, there's a theorem of equivalence between this picture and a generalized catarmetric. So if you have a generalized catarmetric, then of course the section exists. But you could ask, if we only assume that we have a holomorphic symplectic diagram like this, can you show that this thing has a C infinity section? I never thought of that, but I think that, you see, this differs from these only in the real part. The imaginary parts are the same. So from the point of view of the imaginary part, these are all the same spaces, and this is a groupwood, so it certainly has a cross-section. So topologically, there's no obstruction to finding this cross-section. It's just a C infinity object. It's just a C infinity object. But there is a condition. You see, once you restrict this symplectic form to this bisection, you will get a two-form and you can extract from that two-form the metric. And then you always have to make this condition that the metric should be positive definite. And that's the thing that's not at all clear. If I give you such a diagram, if I give you a generalized K-look class, can you find a cross-section? Yes. Can you find a cross-section such that the restriction of this whole market symplectic form? The restriction of this whole mortgage symplectic form gives a positive definite metric. Yeah, that's unclear, totally unclear. But it's some kind of open condition. You have to know that you're inside this open region and difficult to say. I'm confused with one thing. So, in that diagram, the sigma plus and the sigma minus are holomorphic possible structures. Then, at some point, you say, And at some point you say that you think of the s of the G plus and the G minus they should be also root, not Wha why is that? So these are you see I was ex that's for Yu Tsang to explain, right? Because I'm explaining only the symplectic type case where there is no bi-algebroid, there's only one interesting algebra, and that's this one. So this is the only one that we really need to integrate. And so we get a symplectic. And so we get a symplectic group load. But in his case, he's going to have A and B to deal with. He has to integrate one of them. So he's going to pick A, integrate that, and you'll get a Poisson router. Then we're going to describe the relationship between the Poisson group void you get from A plus and the Poisson roupoid from A minus. And the similar picture will hold. And then, of course, you could have done it for B plus and B minus. You would have a similar equal dual picture, right? And then something which we haven't done is to do the double integral. is to do the double integration. That is still yet, you know, that's the 20xx problem. This one is 2022, so. That's tank or correct. I don't think that finally that's at the property.
