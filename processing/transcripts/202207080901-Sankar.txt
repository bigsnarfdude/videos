Okay, thank you. And thank you to the organizers for organizing such a great workshop. It was great, like both in terms of topics and the location. Can everybody on Zoom hear me? I have no idea how this is going. Can you hear on Zoom? Yes. Thank you. Great, thank you. All right, so today we're going to talk about curve class. So today we're going to talk about classes on threefolds of certain kinds and applications to rationality. And this is going to work with Sarah Frank, who was queer earlier this week, Lina G. Bianca, and Isabel Wood. It will be on the archive soon. At least that's what we're hoping. Okay. And since this came up yesterday, I want to say that there is another MRC happening next summer which has to do with earthbreak geometry. It's called Explicit Computations with Stacks. Explicit computations with stats. So, as we said yesterday, MRCs are places where you build small little working groups, give people explicit problems to work on, and they work on things. And this is also going to happen in the same location as the other one. This is called, so the title is basically the goal of this MRC is to somewhat demystify sex and also invite more people to the table in terms of sex. People to the table in terms of stats because, like, sometimes the barrier to entry, especially when you're a grad student, feels very high. And there are also other people who just work with stats and don't actually say explicitly that they do. So yeah, so the whole topic of this is like, you know, there's going to be like concrete problems to do with stats. And yeah, if you have more questions about that, I'm happy to answer them in terms of what kinds of questions there are. In terms of what kinds of questions there are. Problem, it happens at the same time as the other MRC that was advertised yesterday. However, I've heard that they happen at the same location. In fact, we might also have meals together. So if you're interested or if you know anyone who's interested in this kind of stuff, ask them to apply to both. And it's a buy one, get one feet kind of situation, right? So maybe you get into one and then you can walk over to the other anyways. Anyways, okay. Anyway, okay. So again, applications are not open. They open up around the same time as this one. Anyway, okay. All right, so the object of interest for today's talk is going to be the clonic bundle threefold. Threefold. And what do I mean by that? Well, there's going to be a map from x to w, where these are, so x and w are some projective defined over some field k. And I'm going to assume that the characteristic And I'm going to assume that the characteristic of k is not equal to 2. Okay. And so, well, you've got a surface. So w here is going to be a surface. I'm going to put some assumptions on it later. And x is the threefold. And the fibers of this map are going to be conics. So I'm not claiming that this map is smooth, so there might be some conics which. There might be some conics which, well, there are smooth conics, but there might also be a locus here where above this, your conics sort of degenerate into this into like two lines, right? So another way of thinking about the conic bundle of threefold is basically like Conic bundle of threefold is basically like if you look at if you let eta be like the generic point of w, then x eta is it's a conic. So it looks like you always want the discriminant curve to be smooth so you don't have any double lines? I was going to come to that in a second. Yes. Come with the fixed embedding in terms of projected buttons. No. No, it doesn't. Sorry? No, okay. So when you say Okay, so when you say the fibers are conics. Connex? Well, not necessarily smooth conics. Because you don't have some compatibility. You do, you do. So basically. Okay, so as I said, so if you look at the generic fiber, the generic fiber is iconic. So, okay, great. And so you're gonna have some good fibers, maybe you have some bad fibers. Maybe you have some bad fibers. So I'm going to let delta inside W be the locus where this is bad, locus where it's not smooth. And as Jack pointed out, when I assume that delta is smooth, right? In particular, that's going to mean that. In particular, that's going to mean that you don't have any double lines. Okay. I'm going to also make some more assumptions because later we're going to talk about rationality. And while some of our results hold more generally, it's just cleaner to state this way. W, I'm going to assume, is geometrically rational. So rational over the algebraic closure. And so associated to this tonic bundle, so associated to this bundle is something called the discriminant cover, which I'm going to denote as delta tilde. And what is this? Well, this is a two-to-one map. And it essentially, over each point of delta, it parametrizes these two components. So each point of delta. Components, right? So each point of delta tilde gives you one of these components of the bat fiber above it. So this is a two-to-one map. So we're also going to assume that delta tilde is geometrically irreducible and the mainstream. And the main reason for this assumption is because we have applications to rationality in mind and things unknown when it's not. Okay, any questions so far about the setup? Okay, let's see if I missed any assumptions. Right, okay, so of course, this assumption that delta tilde over delta, this is like all of these assumptions put together in particular also imply that this. Together, in particular, also imply that this map is unramified. So the map is unramified, which we'll be useful later. And in fact, it actually arises, delta arises as a quotient of delta tilde by this involution that switches between components. Okay, and so the main question, so this is the setup. And so the question that you might be interested in, since this workshop has to do with reconstruction, so you can ask to what extent does it mean that you can express the extra This discriminant cover determine x. Well, it doesn't really, but maybe you can ask, you know, does it determine x eta? Does it determine it up to some sort of birational math? So if I give you delta tilde over delta and then I add in some more conditions, can you con I added some more conditions. Can you conclude that X is rational, for example, over the ground field? Fixing the letting of delta at W? Yes. Yep. Absolutely. Thank you. Right? And so if you want to keep something in mind, you can, it won't hurt to actually just think about About w being q2, and then the question that you want to ask is: when is x rational? Give it the information of delta tilde over delta, right? And maybe some other stuff. Okay, and so what is known about this question? So let's start with, well, the case where With, well, the case where k is equal to algebraic closure, so what is known? So let's start with the algebraic closure. Well, Bovil in the 70s showed the following: that if you take the codimension two cycles, Mentioned two cycles. Well, okay, I'm going to write xk bar mostly because I'm going to forget that I wrote the algebraic, that this is algebraically close once in a while. But if you take tau2 of xk bar and you look at the things that are algebraically trivial, then this is actually isomorphic as a principally polarized abelian variety to the prime variety of delta tilde over delta. And so if you haven't seen the prime variety before, what this is is basically. Variety before, what this is is basically this push-forward map from Jacobian of delta tilde to that of delta. And that has a kernel, and the kernel has two connected components. The prime variety is the connected component of the identity, and happens to be a principally polarized Epian variety. Okay, so that's what Beauvail showed. That doesn't really talk about rationality just yet. But it does say something about corporate classes. And what I will remind you is about, is this thing called the intermediate Jacobian, which will be our way to relate these curved classes to rationality. Classes to rationality, right? So, what is the intermediate Jacobian? Well, you may have seen it defined classically in terms of quasi-theory. So, I'm just going to define it for a threefold. So, Miyar showed that, or he defined an intermediate Jacobian, so which I'm going to call ij of x, algebraically, as like an algebraic representative. As like an algebraic representative of code classes. So algebraic representative basically is some sort of like, it's an abelian variety that's initial amongst some kinds of maps to abelian varieties. And this agrees with the classical construction over C. So if you've seen a more If you've seen a more quasi-theoretic version, then maybe, yeah, that might sound that might make sense to you. Okay, and so what does this have to do with anything? So in the 80s, Shokarov showed that if you take W, so over C, if you take W to be a minimal surface and X common bundle over W. X is a product bundle over W, then X is rational if and only if this intermediate Jacobian is a product of Jacobian's errors. Alright, so we're all oversea, right? So Shokarov showed that somehow being rational is captured by this intermediate Jacobian. And you can give some sort of description of what these curves should actually be. And so in the algebraically closed case, this leads to the notion of what we call the intermediate Jacobian obstruction. Intermediate Jacobian obstruction. And so an obstruction is basically a necessary condition for something to be rational. So let's say you start off with something that's rational. So if x is rational, then you don't need to do cobian, which by Bob Will's result. Wait, so by Mobile's result, so this is all over for an algebraically closed field. Well, maybe you should say over C. Okay, so the intermediate Jacobian is a product of Jacobians. And this by Bobiel's result is determined by this description cover. Vice discriminant cover, right? So, somehow, this discriminant cover with this additional um oh sorry, yes. Curse. Thank you. Yeah. Right. So, somehow, this, the question of rationality, right, so a Chokarov's result is an if and only if result. And so, you have this obstruction which says that if If x is rational, then the intermediate Jacobian is a product of curves. And so you can ask if the intermediate Jacobian is a product of curves, is x rational, and over C, the answer is yes, right? So the obstruction vanishing, okay, so oh, that's a lot of work. So over C, artifact over an operating closed field, the intermediate Jacobian obstruction managing is enough to characterize rationality. Right, along with this data of delta to the lower delta. Okay, and so now you're continuing to assume that it'll be irreducible. It's minimal here, right? Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just in this case, right here. So in this whole setup. In this picture. Yeah, later I will remove that assumption. I mean, a lot of things work without that assumption. Lot of things work without that assumption in the later part. But for this particular statement, yes. The rapid side, so the definition of intermediate code here works for general three faults? Yes. And the criterion that rational implies, this general intermediate recovery, which recovery is also worth general, so it doesn't use this conic bundle, etc. So I think yes. Well, okay. Yes, definitely, but I don't know yes, if it's yes because of classical results or yes because of more recent results. So it's definitely true. Sorry, what statement is definitely true? Okay, so this is that if x is rational, then this has to be true. Rational, then it's an iterative blow about from p2 or something. From P2 or something. From P3 and then the lower class I also for P3. Essentials, yes. Yeah, okay, so I mean, so that does okay. Were you asking over an algebraically cl close field? Whatever fields you're comfortable with. Okay. 'Cause that that so that's one of the issues, right? So um So that's one of the issues, right? So the question, okay, so the natural question from here is what happens if k is not as break composed? And you can start off with just asking, well, what is even the intermediate Jacobian in that case, right? So you don't know. I haven't told you that the intermediate Jacobian descends to something that's nice over K. Okay. Okay, sure. So right, so the question so you have to make sense of the question, right? Okay, so notice that this question has two aspects in terms of what I've told you so far, right? It's one is there's this discriminant cover, and for Mobile, we know that this sort of determines curved classes. And then there's the second aspect, which is that rationality is somehow related to this abelian variety of curved classes. So over at k bar. Right, so the rationality is related. Rationality is related to this being a product of two tokens. Okay, so there are these two things, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to talk about both of these in the context of when phase not algebraically closed. So the first part of the talk is going to deal with this part, and the second part is going to deal with this. All right, so the first one. Well, what did we have in Boeil's results? We had that this particular thing was true, that other people think it's good. true that child q x k bar 0 is isomorphic to this over k bar, the frame variety. And now I'm telling you that there are two abelian varieties over algebraically closed fields and they're isomorphic to each other. What do you think is going to happen over the crown field? Yeah, I mean they are isomorphic over an isomorphically closed field. That's right, but can you say more? Maybe? They still are, yeah, they still are isomorphic. Yeah, but they could get better, in fact. Okay, I shouldn't have said that. So the guess is bas it's maybe. Maybe not only are they isomorphic over an algebraically closed field, but maybe their torso slide help. Right, so maybe instead of just getting a map between like the as brightly closed versions of them, you can get a map between the torsors. And the first theorem It's basically that the guess is correct. So this is a rough version of the theorem, and I'll tell you what I mean by any by all of this. Because if I have two isomorphic being right, of course they trolls the spine up via that isomorphism. Yes, I know. I'm gonna be more precise. Yes. Yeah. So, okay. Yeah, so okay, so the first theorem basically is going to be about a map from all of Chao 2 to something to more explicitly defined torsors here. So I will tell you what torsors they end up in, right? So not just some random torsar. So in order to actually write out a statement correctly, I have to define some things. So I'm going to Some things. So I'm going to def so definitions. So first of all, I'm going to define what we call the polarized prime variety as the visors inside delta tilde that push forward. Then push forward to, well, so this is the match from delta delta to delta. So they're going to be some divisor on delta. And so what happens, so basically this is, so for example, if you have something, so if you take m equal to zero, what you get back is the kernel of bar pipe, of the push forward. Of the push forward of Wi Pi. So one of the components there is actually the PRIM. So this contains the PRIM. If you take m equal to 1, essentially what you get is you get a divisor. You get divisors that push forward to something that lie on a line inside W. So this is the push forward on challenges, not like the line of challenge. The line of push forward. Line out of the corner. Okay. So this is some sort of like extended version of the Prim scheme. And as I said, this contains the usual Prim variety inside here. And this is defined over K, it has a scheme structure. And so a more precise. Okay, so wait. And so. And so, well, a precise version, the precise version basically says that somehow you can map torsars of this into the extended prime variety, this thing that we call the polarized prime variety. The OR1, then the OR M? Is that for W equals P2 now? Ah, that's a good point. Let's just take W equals P2. Because otherwise, I'm going to try to simplify notation and it's going to go around. Is going to go around. So let's just have W equals P2 in your mind. You won't lose anything. Maybe just think of W having a preferred projective embedding, and it's the whole form of that. And if you want to think of W as P2 and the identity is preferred embedding, it's the same. Sure. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Sorry, there's just like a lot of simplifying of notation. Simplifying of notation that I'm trying to do. But thank you for pointing that out. Okay. So. I'm sorry, what was the integer m again? I think you said I just missed. Oh, for some m. Oh, just for some. Okay. So as you create the set, you can vary over any m you block it. Right, so essentially, the kernel of this, right, has the prim, and then it has the other component of the kernel. And then for each, and then you have like a whole Z's worth of things. You have like a whole z's worth of things above the prim, and then you have a whole z's worth of things above the other part. So it's in integer m. Yes. And for each m you get a homogeneous space on each kernel, but it's actually yes, that's right. Oh, okay. Okay. And so in order to actually state the theorem correctly, I have to first tell you what it means to take this child to xk bar and actually descend it to k. Like, is that even possible, right? Like, is that even possible? And so the point is that it is. So, can descend chow 2 x k bar 0 to an abelian variety over k. So for a perfect So for perfect fields, this is due to after Castelina, Martin, and Real. And more generally, it's due to Benoit and Wittenberg. And in fact, what Benoit and Wittenberg do is they define this co-dimension two-chow scheme, which gives the scheme structure not only to the zero. Scheme structure not only to the zero part, but like all of chow two, right? So it's a scheme structure on chow two. And I will denote this. Okay, and so there are some caveats here. Like, what do you mean by scheme structure of a child two? This doesn't always exist, this only exists. So, what, okay, so essentially what they do by non-written work, What they do, Benoit and Wittenberg, is that they define this functor which somehow imitates this codimension two-cycle thing, right, using k-theory. And then they show that that functor is representable whenever x is geometrically rational. So the child took functor, or rather, let me simply define a child to functor That is representable, so this depends on x, representable by a smooth group scheme whenever x is geometrically rational. Sorry, can people see when I'm over here? Okay, great. So, in particular, what this means is that we have some way of talking about Things over k. So, a more precise version of this theorem is that first, if you just look at the codimension two cycles, there is a map from here to this extended vertical. To this extended version of the primarily over K bar, that is Galilei covariant. And in fact, this induces isomorphisms on the components. Right, so maybe that's not the right thing to say. Right, okay, so this is our objective map from here on to here. And this, in fact, expands Bobel's map. Right, so if you're only looking at the prim and only looking at child 2x k bar 0, then it's the same map. And v. And V, if X is geometrically rational, and remember we have an application to rationality in mind. And so if you want X to be rational, it had better be geometrically rational to start with. So in our applications, we're going to assume these kind of things. And so if X is geometrically rational, this is actually, you get a map from the scheme version. Um skills. So for this the the child two functor, I mean, are you imposing some kind of a provolts relation? I'm worried about like even for like if you have a curve. If you have a curve, and like pick one in the curve. Yeah, yeah. Pick one in the curve makes sense, but in some sense, it's not representable. Yeah, yeah. So I have a. So is there like an equivalent relation that you're opposing? Yes, absolutely. So here, they don't just define it as like, you know, take a t scheme and send it to tau to x to t. That's not the definition of the functor. It's defined using k theory. So somehow you take k0 of like x over t, and then you sort of take kernel. Then you sort of take kernel of this rank and determine map, but then you quotient out by this thing that causes a little confused, so in the statement A this is not a map of schemes over in the field? Over here? Statement A? I guess I'm trying to understand. I mean, if S. Trying to understand between B and A, so are you saying that in general this is not a lap of coming from a lap of C? Yes. So in general, it's not known if this is representable by a group star. And so this is basically saying it's the same result, it's just like this is the map of Sk. And that only so Benoit-Wittenberg, their child functor is representable only when x is geometrically rational. Rational. Right. And so I don't think I will have time to say much about the proof. So the proof is basically, there are two parts to it. One is analyzing the principally, no, sorry, the polarized print scheme. Sorry, it says change names a lot of times. Currently, the polarized print scheme. It's currently the polarized curm scheme. Okay, and this sort of comes about, it follows from work of Mumford on curm varieties. And the second part is basically upgrading the Wildmap map first of all to the entire child group and then to a map of schemes. So that's basically. Right? So that's basically what the proof is, and it will be completely unenlightening for me to go through it. Okay. Any questions? Great. But I'm happy to talk about this later if you have questions in like what went into this. So I did say something about the tourism. I did say something about the torsors of Prim, and so now you might wonder: now that I've defined chow2 in this weird way in terms of this functor that I haven't told you what it is, what do torsors of chow2x k0 of chow20 actually look like? Like what do intermediate to Kovin torsors look like? And the answer is, well, then I wouldn't work actually show this, is that if you have like the code, the torsors are basically cosets by elements in the Cosets by elements in the neuron sub-ary group. So it's exactly what you think it might mean. So torso on this side on this side are translates by elements of the neurons of Hary Group. Okay, so we have to think the gala line may be required, et cetera, et cetera. Okay. Okay, and so now let's come to the second part, which is about rationality. Right? So does the same kind of criterion, right, does it work over non-algebraically closed fields? Algebraically closed fields, and what is the criterion? So, for this section, I'm going to assume that x is geometrically rational, geometrically rational, and that it has a point. And w is going to be p2. And so, notice that these are like necessary conditions to be rational, right? So, if you have something that's rational, it'll be geometrically rational. Something that's rational, it had better be geometrically rational. And you also need a towel point, right? Okay, and so there's an analog of the intermediate Jacobian obstruction, which is called the intermediate Jacobian torsor obstruction. So there is That's this criterion. So this was introduced by Hashes and Schinkel over R and Ben Robert Wittenberg over arbitrary fuels. A lot of Hasa-Cchinkle papers have been mentioned in this conference already. It's none of the former papers. It's a different set of papers altogether. Okay, so I'm going to state a simpler version of this. Simpler version of this. So suppose there exists a nice curve, so nice is connected, smooth, proper. Suppose there's the curve of genus bigger than or equal to 2, such that, well, at least the intermediate Jacobian obstruction vanishes. So this is pig zero of this curve, right? Then we say that the IJTO obstruction, so I'm going to call this IJTO, right? So we say that this obstruction vanishes if If I look at parsers of this by the Neuron-Severi group, and they happen to be isomorphic, not just to any torsors of pig zero, but things that look like pig D. Pig for some D, for some D, and this is as torsors. So they're the same element in the wave battery group. Same element in the winter layer of fixed zero comma. So maybe you don't want to go there, but if if we're not in the case of P2, I guess the natural indexing is by the name W then I'm not sure how to formulate this condition. Or if we just have integers. Wait, sorry. Under right, I mean, so there could be multiple gaps. So, there could be multiple gammas that are isomorphic to the same 5D. So, for, okay, so, yeah, so for any for any gamma in the neuron-Severi group, sorry about this, so this is true. So, for some D, and there could be multiple gammas that are isomorphic to the same pick E, and like that will happen. So, you have to assume. Like that will help. So, you have to assume maybe that Galois and Siddhari is true. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, so this is going to be from the Galois and Mario part of the narrative, I think. Are there any other questions? Product of IC in the end, and then your rank of the group rose. Right, so I've stated a slightly nicer version of the intermediate Jacobi torture obstruction. A priority, this could be a product of curves and then. This could be a product of curves, and then this could be something that also has a product in it. And I think, as far as I understand, that gets a little more hairy. Turns out in our case, this is true. Like, this first part is true. So, life is nicer. Okay, so what am I going to do with all of this? So, why am I calling this an intermediate Jacobian torso obstruction in the first place? Towards our obstruction in the first place, right? So, why is it an obstruction? So, Hassan and Schinkle over R and Ben Marwittenberg over arbitrary fields show that if you have any k-rational threefold satisfying well, the niceness condition. Satisfying all the niceness conditions, smooth projective, et cetera. Then this obstruction actually does vanish. So it makes sense to call this an intermediate Jacobian torsor obstruction, because somehow this obstructs rationality in the algebraically non-closed case. And so the natural question is that over the complex numbers, somehow the intermediate Somehow the intermediate Jacobian obstruction was enough to actually show rationality. Is the same thing true in this case? Right? And so the question is that, is the converse true? And there's a lot of evidence for this. Right? So there's a lot of evidence for believing where this should be true. So, for example, again, Hasa Chinkel and Beno-Wittenberg over R and arbitrary fields respectively, they showed, so this is all between 2019 and 2021, is when these papers came out, is that if you have something that's an intersection of two quadratics in P5, Then, so x is an intersection of quadratics, then x is rational if and only if this construction matches. Right? So it's looking good so far. Later, I mean Kuznetsov and Prokhorov. So Kuznetsov and Prokhorov also showed that a very large class, I'm not going to go into all of the different classes of threefolds that they've proved things for, but these include things of geometric picography one, as well as some other ones for which they showed that x being rational is equivalent X being rational is equivalent to the intermediate Jacobian torso vanishing. Thorsen obstruction vanishing. I should say here that, okay, so this is what we're characterizing zero. Okay, so there was a lot of evidence for stuff like this. I'm gonna see something up about. Okay, never mind. I'm gonna add in another. Never mind. I'm going to add in another condition over here. Basically, to make sure we're not in the cooseness of Prugerov case, is that X is something called geometrically standard. Geometrically standard. So this imposes some sort of minimality conditions on X. It basically avoids this case of closeness of propanols. You don't have to worry about it too much. It's just there. There. Okay, any questions? We're getting there. We're getting there. And so now the question is, can we answer this question for conic bundles, right? So is the intermediate Jacobian torso obstruction enough to characterize rationality. Characterized rationality for conic bundles. And the answer, which I'm going to call theorem two, is no. Right, so it doesn't characterize rationality for coding bundles, right? So this. Doesn't characterize rationality for cloning bundles. So in particular, we have an example of a conic bundle threefold over P2, basically for which the intermediate to Kovian torso obstruction vanishes, but it has other obstructions. It has other obstructions, namely, it has a topological obstruction and therefore it's not rational, right? So maybe yes, so I'm going to say I'm going to state a more precise version. So there exists a conic bundle over R. So there exists that such that the idea the intermediate Jacobian parser abstraction vanishes. And xr is this connected. So this is a topological obstruction. If something is rational over r, then it has to be, then its real points have to be connected. And so what we can do is we can find an example. Is we could find an example where the real points are actually disconnected. And the example kind of looks like this. Okay, so maybe in order to actually write down the example, I need to say a little more. Write down the example, I need to say a little more. So the example comes from the case where the degree of delta is equal to 4. So delta is inside P2. And in this case, there's a paper of Niels Brown from 2008 that basically says that, well, you have a lot of nice things. You can write down equations for this. And if you like equations, And if you like equations, then this is great. So this basically looks like: so delta, which is a plane quartic, looks like q1, q3 minus q2 squared, where q1, q2, and q3 are quadratic forms and three variables. Delta tilde also has a really nice form. Well, it's an unramified double cover, so you can actually write down what it is. And r s to equals 2. And in this case, the intermediate Jacobian obstruction vanishes. So there exists a curve gamma of genus 2. So this is like a very nice hyper elliptic curve that you can write down equations for, such that the prim variety, which by our theorem is the intermediate Jacobian, is actually Is actually isomorphic to the Jacobian of this curve. So you're at least in a case where life is nice, or you can begin to ask this question. And for these kinds of x's, you can write down equations, and what you find is that it's actually Oh, this is fine. Thank you. Okay. So in this case, what you actually find is that there's a quadric surface fibr, there's an additional structure of the quadric surface vibration over P1. So for such X, have Have extra structure. And so these x's actually arise as this like double cover of P1 cross P2 and the fiber over P2, well, it's a conic, but over P1, it's a quadric. And our example looks like this. So if you take Looks like this. So if you take P1, so let's say this is P1R, you find four points. So these are four real points. So that above certain intervals, above alternating intervals, this quadratic surface has points, so it's isomorphic 2 of P2 and over here has no points. Has no point. And this is a signature calculation. So over R, all of this is a signature calculation. So you find a quadratic surface bundle that has the right signature over the right intervals, and this gives you what you want. It's not at all clear from this that the intermediate Jacobian torso obstruction actually does vanish, or how we even came up with this. The short answer, well, never mind. I can talk about that later if you want. But really, what's going on here, this might seem very unsatisfying. I just gave you a picture and I'm like, this exists. Okay, if you actually want to verify this, our code is on GitHub. You can actually go through and verify that all of this actually works. And that it also gives you a way of showing that the intermediate Jacobian torso obstruction vanishes. But what's really going on? But what's really going on is the following. So, this quadric surface bundle structure, right, so you've got quadratic surfaces over each point. Well, now let's say you took the generic, the part over, like the generic fiber of this thing, right, is a quadric. So, if you could find a section, so if there was a section Then, what you get is a point on this quadric, and so then you can show that that quadric itself is birational to P2, and so x itself is birational to p3. So, if you have the section, then you can show that x is rational. But you can you actually need something much weaker you basically need only Need something that's a multisection of odd degrees Because you're you're on a quadric and that has degree two points so you can always make the index one if you have a multisection of odd degree. Multisection of odd degrees. And what happens is that the intermediate Jacobian taurus are obstruction vanishing, right? So a priori, it feels very abstract, but what this obstruction vanishing does give you is that it gives you a geometric multisection of this kind. There's also got library. Okay, and so I don't have time to actually describe what each of the torses are in this case, but it's it's really nice. It it's got there are like four possible options on what the torses of the of your prim variety can be. Of your prim variety can be. And depending on what on the nature of each of these tarsars, you can literally write down what that gives you in the whole quadric bundle, quadric surface bundle picture. And the vanishing gives you a geometric Galois invariant multisection. And so now this basically sort of, so if you've thought about this, maybe you see why this doesn't, why this actually creates. This doesn't, why this actually creates a problem in why delta tilde over delta doesn't really determine whether or not this is rational. So why this doesn't, and the reason for this is that this sort of, this multi-section, so multi-section, it comes from a conic bundle surface. So it comes from a section on a conic bundle. On a conic bundle surface. And this is a Galois invariant section. What is the problem? Not all Galois invariant sections are represented over the ground field. So just because you have a Galois invariant section doesn't mean you have a section defined over k. And so the obstruction to descending The obstruction to descending this to something that's defined over k basically is a Brouwer obstruction. So, as a corollary of all of the things that we have, we get that if the Brouwer group of your field is trivial, so maybe not even that strong, if the Brouwer group of the field, if the two-target part of this is trivial, then X is rational if and only if the intermediate. If and only if the intermediate Jacobian turtle structure manages. And so, sort of looping back to the whole thing of like why is this related to delta delta over delta, so just to remind you is that this intermediate Jacobian torso obstruction vanishing is a consequence or it's a feature of this cover delta tilde over delta. And what this tells you is that this is not enough by itself, but if you Itself, but if you impose some other conditions, I don't know if you consider this a lot or not a lot, if you impose some other mild conditions, then you do actually get that the intermediate Jacobian for serve obstruction is enough to characterize rationality. So for example, by Lange's theorem, we can actually show that any any degree four, so x is rational, so here x is a degree four finite bundle. For a final bundle. This assertion that you're writing is for the specific determinantal equations that you wrote down? Yeah. Not for all degree-for-connect bundles. Oh, yeah. So any degree for Connect bundle, if this part holds, if the two-target of the Brouwer group of the Brown field is trivial, then it's birational to something that looks like this. Without determinant at once. Yeah. The determinants of ones. Yeah. To things that arise in terms of the equations that I wrote down. And so this any for any degree for conic bundle, in fact, does satisfy this. Right? And so I think I will end there. Sorry, I think I sort of left off in the sentence. Over a finite field, anything of this form is rational. Rational. So you like magnet wheels, so that's something. Bray some of these results about some kind of map of moduli space. Bundles to some kind of modularized space with numbrane. Property of this map. I think that you could. I don't know how to put this condition in a step. I don't know. I could imagine if the map is not parklaces, but maybe it's sort of. I'm just I'm asking. Yeah, I mean, so we haven't thought about it, so it I don't know. Yeah. Let's thank the speaker again.
