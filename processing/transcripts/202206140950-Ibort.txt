Okay, perfect. Now we can see what you are right. Okay. Okay. And the role of groupoids in this approach to the foundations of quantum mechanics. So this is a work that has been doing, we have been working on that for the last few years in collaboration, myself, of course, and Giuseppe Marmo. Marmo, and a few other collaborators. And the main idea, so let me give first a sketch of what I'm going to talk about. So first I'm going to say a few words about why groupoids. Then I will explain what is a measure of groupoid. and the role of algebras of observables in this picture, in this setting. And then, time permitting, I will speak a little bit about elementary quantum systems as one of the possible of the many elementary quantum systems. As one of the many different Different applications in more or less direct applications of this setup that I'm going to talk about. So let me begin with why group points. There are various ways, there are many ways of introducing or justifying the use of flu points in the description of fundamental ideas in quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics. I'm going to use the original one by Schwinger and has to do with the role of transitions in the fundamental picture of quantum mechanics. As you all know, there are various ways of writing the foundation of quantum mechanics. Let me select two of the most popular ones. One is based on the theory of Hilbert. And it's based on the theory of Hilbert spaces and linear operators, etc. The other one, which is more algebraic in nature, which is the use of sister algebras and the associated notions. In both of these approaches, the fundamental idea, the fundamental notion of quantum transition, as it was As it was originally thought by Bohr and Heisenberg. And later on, Schwinger himself gets diluted. And it appears only as a secondary role, some kind of outcome of Of outcome of the formalism. However, transitions are the absurd transitions of quantum system. They constitute a fundamental notion. And this was essentially what Schwinger did in his attempt to provide a self-consistent foundation of quantum mechanics. For Schwinger, the way to conceptualize The way to conceptualize a transition was to what he was calling a selective measurement. What was that? Well, you may conceive, so suppose you have a system and an observable A whose outcomes are real numbers, little A's, and then suppose that you have an observation device, some experimental setting. Let me. Experimental setting, let me denote it by this box M A A prime, such that if it takes as an input, the system, such that when you measure the observable capital A, you get little A, and then you measure after passing through this, say, filter, then you will measure again A and you will get the outcome A prime. Then, prime then this there is a natural composition law of these things and is that if you apply another one of these selective measurements you get another selective measure element that you can denote it collectively as M A second a so we have this composition law of Composition law of selective measurements and it is quite clear that if we compose say the selective measurement A prime A with M A A, this is the same as composing M A prime A on the right, on the left, sorry. On the left, sorry, by M A prime A prime, and what we will get in both cases is M A prime A again, where this selective measurement M A A prime is the selective measurement that does nothing on the state on the system we are observing. Of course, these symbolic operations, these symbols that we use, Symbols that we use to describe the transitions, then is what today we call well, these laws they have another important property, and is that given the selective measurement, then there is another one, which is the selective measurement that takes the output, the outcome A prime of the observable A and returns the outcome A. Returns the outcome A in such a way that when we compose the two of them, we get again this unit M A prime A prime. So with these symbols, what I was saying a moment ago is that what today, in the modern language, or in the language we use today, mathematical language, is what we call Mathematical language is what we call a group point, or to be more precise, an algebraic group point. So, let me write this and move into the next transparency. So, a group point will be a, let me say, a set of transitions. Now, this, well, there will be a space, let me call it OMERA, that will be. It omera that will be the outcomes of the observations of the experiments of the measurements we are performing on some system. Then, element here will be denoted by a, b, z, x, y, whatever. And gamma will be the space of observed transitions from that I'm writing in this, so to speak, categorical notation, indicating by this arrow that we are observing at the That we are observing a transition that takes the output A of the system into the output B of the system. And there is a partial composition law that will be if I have a transition from A to B and a transition from B to C. Transition from B to C, then I can compose beta with alpha, and this will be the transition from A to C. This partial composition law, the composition law of selective measurements I was talking about, will be associative. There will be units in this for this composition law. That means there will be transition, that means they're not. There will be transition, that means noted by one sub A, that will not change anything, simply will take the output, the outcome A into itself. And then alpha composed with one A will be alpha, and one B composed with alpha on the left will be alpha again. And finally, for any transition from A From A to B, there will be another transition that will take from B to A. This will be implemented, implementing what I call Feynman's micro-reversibility principle, the existence of the inverse transitions for any quantum systems, microreversibility principle. And such that this alpha minus one with alpha will be the unit at A, and alpha composed with alpha prime will be the unit B. So a group with is, say, an extension of the notion of a group, even if it's much more flexible. Let me give you some examples so that you can put this notion in This notion in the framework of, if you were not familiar with it, with your with familiar with mathematical notions, which are for sure familiar with all of you. For instance, let me discuss first the root point describing a qubit. In this case, the space of outcomes will be consisting just of two symbols. Let me denote it by plus or minus. So let me draw a diagram. let me draw a diagram and there will be a transition alpha passing from minus to to plus from plus to minus and the inverse transition from minus to plus and the two corresponding units one plus and one minus in a more schematic way this is we can draw this root point as this dinking diagram a2 so let me call this root point a2 right Right, the notation when we write a group point, I'm usually using this double arrow from the space of transitions into the space of objects, indicating by that the source and the target of each transition. So S of alpha, if alpha is a transition from A to B, will be A, and the target of alpha will be B. Another example is just a group. So suppose that G is a group. A group. So suppose that G is a group. Then a group is a group with just one object. The space of outcomes consists of just a single element that we can identify with with the neutral element. So in this sense, the diagram of a group as thought as a group or it will be here will be the neutral element and then the transitions which are corresponds to the elements of Elements of the group themselves. So, from this point of view, this diagram is not very illustrative of the structure of the group. The composition here, of course, is the composition of the group. Another example could be, for instance, the harmonic oscillator. Groupoid. Of course, here I'm not giving a dynamical content yet, so this is purely kinematic. So, this is purely kinematic, right? But in this case, the harmonic oscillator, the space of outcomes, could be thought as being the natural numbers. So, here will be 0, 1, 2, 3, n, n plus 1, and then there will be all these transitions alpha 0, alpha 0 minus. Alpha 0, alpha 0 minus 1, alpha 1, alpha 1 minus 1, and so on. Alpha n, alpha n minus 1. So in a more schematic way, this corresponds to the Dinking diagram, A infinite. So we will have this groupoid. Another groupoid, let me call it, for instance, the trivial one. The trivial one is this. Any set, omera, is any set is a group of in this case. The only transitions, so these are the elements on the set, the only transitions are the units. So any element in the set has a transition from the element B, C, D into itself. So in this sense, the source and the target of this group. The source and the target of this group point are the identity maps. So, this is a sample of what we call a totally disconnected groupoid, because there are no transitions from the different outcomes of the groupoid. Disconnected. Another example that we passed to a con to that's apparently much more elaborated example. Let me call it the point or a the sample let me call it the point groupoid here the space of outcomes will be minkowski space-time with the standard metric minus plus plus plus and the consider the group the point group whose elements are pairs of lambda which is a lower Of lambda, which is a Lorentz transformation, and A is so lambda belongs to the Lorentz group, and A is a point on element in R4. And now the group point, so let me move to the next transparency. So the group point that I will denote by RANMA of P omera is just the Cartesian. Is just the Cartesian product of P times omera. So the elements here, the transitions, are going to be elements in the Poincar√© group and points in Minkowski space. What is the composition? Well, of course, the source and the target maps. So here we have to decide what are the source and the target maps over Minkowski space. So the source map. So the source map is going to be just x, and the target map is going to be the transform of the point x under the element on the Poincar√© group, lambda a. So this is lambda x plus a. Now, the composition of two of these elements of two of these transitions is given by Is given by the following expression, lambda prime lambda. Of course, the composition can be only performed if x prime is the target of the element on the right. So if x prime is lambda x plus a. So the composed element under these circumstances will be lambda prime times a plus a prime x. Now it's easy to check that this composition law satisfies the properties of a group point and the units are given by the unit corresponding to x is just the element, the identity 0x before. So this is an example of a class, a general class, which are action calling called action group points. Called action group points. So suppose that we have a group G. So G is a group that acts on a space Omera, a set Omera. So there is a map, if you wish, G times Omera into Omera, that assigns to any couple of elements, an element in the group, another element in the set, another element that we will simply denote G. element that we will simply denote g times x the transform of x by g and this is action satisfies the usual actions now associated to such an action there is a group point that we denote by gamma of g omega which is nothing but the partition product of the group g times omega the source and the target map Source and the target map are given as in the equations here above. So, this is the source map. This is the source of Gx. And the target map is going to be Gx. This is the target of the transition determined by the elements G on the group, X on the set. Then the composition law of two of these. Two of these transitions, they, of course, two of these transitions can be composed only if x prime is equal to the target of the element on the right. And in such conditions, under such circumstances, the composition will be given by G primes composed with G with the group law X. Then again, the unit corresponding to the element X is going to be To the element x is going to be the neutral element of the group and x itself. So, here you have a few examples of group boys, but before saying something more, we have to put some analytical flesh into the picture. So we have to talk about the observables of the theory, states, and everything else. And for that, we have to talk about measure group points. And algebras of observables. Well, here the point is that when we try to describe random phenomena, when we want to describe the observation that we do, the experiments we perform on random phenomena, we use extremely successful ideas. we use the extremely successful idea introduced by more than almost 100 almost 100 years ago by Kolmororov and is to use what I call a Kolmororov space which is nothing but Kolmororov's space which is nothing but a probability space it means a set of sigma algebra B and a probability distribution The distribution P on omelet. So this is a sigma algebra of sets of omera and this is a probability measure. But of course, if we want to describe system and not just thinking that the outcomes are random, outcomes of random phenomena, but the transitions too, we would like to do the same to extend. The same to extend this notion of a Kolmogorov space into the context of group points. So, if I have a group point gamma over omega, so I'm adding to the outcomes omega the transitions alpha. What will be the analog of the extension of a probability measure on omega? Well, there will be, of course, a probability measure new on the space, on the total space galma, but this. On the total space random, but this new has to have some additional natural structure. There are various ways to do that. Actually, we can use the original insight provided by the work of Maki and many other people and more and many others in the sixties and the seventies of the last century. Of the last century. And or we can use an equivalent alternative way of introducing this measure structure on root points, which was coined by Alain Kohn in a completely independent way, also around the 70s of the past century. The idea by Kahn was to consider what he call a transverse function. What we call a transverse function. A transverse function is nothing but enriching the idea, the notion of a function on Omera. A function on Omera is an element that to any element in Omera we assign a real number in particular. Well, Kahn's idea was to assign to any A a measure, let me denote by new upper A, which is a New app array, which is a measure on supported. Oh my god, excuse me with support on the inverse image under the source map of the element A. Maybe I will make a little Maybe I will make a little picture. So, for that, I will move to the next transparency. So, if we draw our group point, this is the space of outcomes. Here I have the space of transitions. So if A and B are two outcomes and alpha is a transition from A to B, I will denote this. Denote this alpha, and then the source map is given by this map here. So this alpha lies in S minus one of A that I will denote by gamma sub A. On the same vein, if I will denote the target map by the map by this arrow here, all this dotted line will correspond to t minus one of b that I will denote simply by gamma upper b, right? So imagine that, so what I was saying is that a transverse function is nothing but the assignment to any element on the group point of a measure which is supported on. On gamma A. Sorry, before I was saying it was in the inverse image with respect to the source map, it's in the inverse image with respect to the target map of A. So the support of my the support of the measure, new A, will be this. will be this red line that i'm drawing here now suppose that i take another transition beta from c to a so i can compose my transition beta i can compose on the left with alpha so i can compose beta on the left beta on the left with the transition alpha making it to a transition from C to B this will be alpha composed with beta right so this will mean that all beta is here so beta is lying on the inverse image with respect to t of inverse image with respect to t of the element a. This is t minus one of a. So this composition on the left by alpha is transforming the preimages under the target map of the element A into the pre-images under the target map of the element B, mapping beta into alpha. beta into alpha composed with beta but here on new a sorry this was new b here on the inverse image with respect to the target map of b there is a measure new b and in the inverse image with respect to the target t of a there is another measure nu a so the measure nu a can be pushed forward Can be pushed forward with respect to this left translation to become a measure on gamma b. We will say that a transverse function, that initial assignment of a family of measures to any outcome of the theory, is left invariant if this push forward is just the measure on new b. So, this is Kant's idea of a transverse function. It's a family of functions of A family of functions of measures supported on the periimages of the target map of the group point, which are left invariant in this sense here. Now, this plays the role exactly of the hard measure on a group. So when we have a group, because there is one single element, a transverse function is nothing but a left-invariant measure on the group that we know that under very mild conditions. My conditions always exist, and we call it the left invariant hard measure on the group. Of course, there is a completely dual notion corresponding to actions on the right, but I'm going to elaborate into that. So this idea was developed independently also by Renault that called these families of measures a system of are measures on the groupoid gamma. Once we have the existence and essential uniqueness of these families of left invariant hard measures on Yamma are guaranteed provided that the outcome space satisfies some mild measure theoretical properties, right? Theoretical properties, right? Of course, what is free is going to be the measure we choose, the probability distribution we choose on the space of outcomes. But once this measure is determined, the system of left invariant hard measures is essentially unique. And then we can construct a measure which is the integral in the appropriate sense. In the appropriate sense, of this family of measures of omega with respect to this probability measure on the space of outcomes of the theory. So a measure group point will be a group point equipped with one measure that has this integral structure. It corresponds to the integral with respect to a measure on the basis space. On the basis space, on the space of outcomes of the theory of a system of left-invariant hard measures, or what we call also a Kohn's transverse function on the group point. Once this is done, we can construct easily the algebra of observables of the theory, of the system we are describing. Because, of course, for any for anyone. For any one of these sets, gamma A, all transitions that end at the point, that have the same outcome, target outcome A, there is a measure, mu A here, so we can construct the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on it. So we can integrate that. We can take the direct integral on Omera using the measure P and we construct, we have our And we construct, we have our Hilbert space, the Hilbert space of the theory. We can also construct the operators lambda alpha that transform the space galma beta nu beta into the Hilbert space supported on galma A nu A and that maps any function here. maps any function here into the left regular transformation of that. It will be simply psi of alpha minus one composed with beta. So these operators, this lambda alpha define unitary operators that can be integrated and they generate A von Neumann algebra. Let me denote this von Neumann algebra nu of Galma is the von Neumann algebra associated to the measure group of Galma with respect to the measure nu. And it's nothing but this lambda alphas double commutant, which is a subalgebra of the algebra of bounded operator. Of the algebra of bounded operators on the Hilbert space H that I was constructed a moment ago. So, this is the algebra of observables of the theory, the von Neumann algebra generated by the left regular transfer representation or action of the blue point onto itself. Let me show you, to give you a few examples just to fix and to help you to connect. To connect with the ideas, your own conceptual formulation of quantum mechanics. So, in particular, for instance, then for the case of the qubit, the von Neumann algebra of the qubit groupoid A2 is just the algebra of two by two complex matrices. In the case of a group G, the volume. A group G, the von Neumann algebra of the group is just the group algebra. If you wish the group convolution algebra, let me continue. Moving number five. For the case of a set, remember the group O, the trivial, totally disconnected set. So the von Neumann algebra of this, the von Neumann algebra. The von Neumann algebra of the group is just the culminative von Neumann algebra of essentially bounded functions on omera with respect to the probability measure. So this is an abelian von Neumann algebra in the case of the harmonic oscillator Oscillator. Then can be checked that the von Neumann algebra of A infinity is just the space of all bounded operators on little L2, if you want, the Hilbert space generated by the natural numbers. The case of the Poincar√© groupoid groupoid then the von Neumann algebra corresponding to the groupoid the action groupoid corresponding to the action of P on M is what in the theory of operator algebras is called the cross-product algebra of the algebra of essentially bounded functions on Minkowski space. Bounded functions on Minkowski space with respect to the action of the Poincar√© group P. Actually, in general, for any group acting on a set which has a probability measure on it, then the von Neumann algebra, I will omit the grammar, you will simply write the ingredients of the group of the group oil defined by the action of G on Omera, is nothing but the cross product alpha. but the cross-product algebra of the group G acting on L infinity of omega. So these are a few examples of what you can expect from now. The point will be to introduce the notion of states, dynamics, and everything else, but I'm going to spend my last five minutes talking about a simple application, which is the notion of elementary systems. The notion of elementary system in quantum mechanics has its origin in Wigner's theorem, actually in Wigner's theorems that permits us to describe symmetries in terms of unitary or anti-unitary operators. Of the Hilbert space of the theory. And then, following this idea, Bigne's program was to consider irreducible unitary representations, unitary, well, actually, projective representations. Of the Poincar√© group, and this was the notion of a quantum elementary system, right? Of course, these representations are labeled essentially by the mass, real number, the mass of the system and the spin of the system, right? And this was a major achievement in the understanding of the foundation of quantum mechanical systems. The foundation of quantum mechanical systems. Of course, the way to construct or the way one of the ways beyond the original work by Wigner, the construction of irreducible unitary projective representations of loops, is by means of Mackey's imprimitivity theorem. So let me say very briefly what So let me say very briefly what is this. Suppose you have a group that acts for the purposes of what I'm going to say now, G could be just a Lie group and Omera could be a manifold, a smooth manifold, covering some probability measure, as always, right? And the group acts smoothly and preserving this probability measure, right? So a system of A system of imprimitivity consists on various things. First, it's a representation, a unitary representation of the group G on some Hilbert space. Unitary representation. And T, I'm going to use the same. And you're going to use the same letter because they amount essentially they are deeply related. P is a spectral measure on Omera with values, of course, with values in projectors on H and the Hilibert space H, such that it satisfies the covariance. It satisfies the covariant condition, which is this: ug P of delta, ug dagger equals to pg delta, where delta is a measurable set in omega and g is any element on the group. So Mackey's imprimativity theorem was one of the way to Was one of the ways to state that is that if the action is regular, this means that essentially the orbits are properly embedded some manifolds of omera, then there is a one-to-one correction. A one-to-one correspondence between in primitivity systems and pairs O U H where O is an orbit. Orbit of G and UH is a unitary representation of the isotopic group H of O, of the orbit O. So in this way. Bit O. So, in this way, we have this transformation. This correlation is essentially, well, it's functorial. I mean, it presents natural operations, for instance, the decomposition in self-representation. So this establishes a correspondence between, this allows to establish a correspondence between irreducible representations of, in this case, of the In this case of the overall structure, there will be the group boy determined by G and omega and irreducible representations of the group H. Actually, what we have is that in primitive systems of imprimitivity in primitivity are in one-to-one correspondence. With non-degenerate representations of the cross-product algebra of G on L infinity of omelet. Infinity of omega. But remember that this was nothing but the algebra, the von Neumann algebra of the group point determined by G acting on omega. So this is the classical theory. So the connection with what I was saying before is that the action of a group on a set is nothing but a particular class of a group boy. And then the point is that And then the point is that this theorem by Mackey can be extended to groupoids. Actually, if we replace G acting on omega by a groupoid, gamma over omega, actually, to be correct, a measure of groupoid, then an imprimitivity system, McKisson primitivity system. And nothing else but unitary representations of the groupoid, which are in one-to-one correspondence with the non-degenerate representations of the van. representations of the von Neumann algebra of the group OI. Then we can simply state, I'm not going to prove it, but just to give you the taste, the flavor of it is that there is a one-to-one, well, for that, if gamma omega, let me write the statement properly, is a regular A regular root point, this means that the orbits of the root point in Omeva are again regular in the sense that they are proper embedded sub-manifolds, then there is a one-to-one correspondence between unitary representations. In particular, irreducible unitary representations of gamma and pairs O and U H, where again, as before, O is an orbit and UH is a unitary. A unitary representation of the isotropy group of the orbit. So in this vein, in this setting, we can extend Wigner's principle saying that a quantum elementary system is nothing but a A irreducible unitary representation of a group point, but let me say a kinematical group point, meaning by that, that it's a group point that contains in some sense, which is defined over. Defined over some space-time M, or is related to some space-time M, as before. Notice that in this case, we don't need to assume that we have a background which is provided by Minkowski space-time, which was the case of the description or the classification of elementary quantum systems provided by the original Wigner's theorem, because the group, the Poincar√© group, does. The Poincar√© group does can only act on the flat Minkowski space-time. If we have a spacetime which is non-flat, there is no, if we have a space-time which is non-flat, there is no Poincar√© group. And any attempt to describe or to consider elementary quantum systems in this situation fails. Systems in this situation fail. However, group points are much more flexible. So we can actually consider group points for space for arbitrary space-times. Just let me finish telling you the simplest case where we have just one minute more. Yes, I know. So consider any space-time. Any space-time M and now what I call the Poincar√© group point of M, which consists of all linear maps, dy x, from the cotangent bundle at the point x of the space-time m into the cotangent bundle of the space-time y, and such that it preserves the metric. The metric. So it pulls the metric at Y into the pull into the metric at X. So you want isometries between the cotangent spaces, the space of covectors of the space-time. This is clearly a group point with the standard composition of maps. This is the standard composition. And here, this And here, this group point, look, what are the orbits of this group? Well, the orbits of this group correspond to the pairs x p's, where p belongs to the cotangent space at the point x, such that p mu, p mu is a constant, m square, say, right? So the quantum elementary systems over Elementary systems over this group point are in one-to-one correspondence with pairs, which are these orbits, and representations of the isotropic group. But the isotropic group is nothing but the Lorentz group. So unitary representations of the Lorentz group as it should be. So we extend the standard classification of irreducible, sorry, of elementary quinton systems to the case of Systems to the case to the case of arbitrary space-times. Of course, this can be extended and make much more general, considering much more general group points. But just to give you a taste of what we can achieve. So thank you for your attention. I will stop here. I think I'm still within my time. And if you have any question, I will be very glad to try to answer you.
