Right, so what I'm going to talk about today is going to be a summary of recent work that I've done in this area, and I've not done that on my own. Been lucky enough to collaborate with these people here. Okay, so let's get going. I should probably be quite fast on the motivation. My main motivation is linked to scattering problems. To scattering problems, which consist in effectively solving the Helmholtz equation, sending an incident wave onto an obstacle on which boundary conditions are implied. They can be of the Dirichlet type or of the Neumann type, for instance, but they can also be more complicated. And for this type of problems to be well posed, we need some radiation condition at infinity. If the obstacle is not very smooth, we might also need some tip. Move, we might also need some tip conditions as we've discussed this morning. Here we have a total field, incident field, and scattered field. And of course, we talked about acoustics, but this type of Helmholtz equation occurs in a lot of places, including elasticity, electromagnetism, and more theoretical physics things. Okay, so and in particular, there's some canonical problems that led to Problems that led to, well, good developments in complex analysis that have been used to solve this interesting problem. The most famous one that we've heard about already today is the half-plane problem or Zummerfeld problem. But then we also discuss wedges, a diffraction by a wedge. We also discussed in the first talk media with different material properties. So here you can have a wedge with different properties inside. A wedge with different properties inside and outside, for instance. And we've not really done anything in 3D so far today, so I'm gonna start. And this is a problem that I really like, the quarterplane problem. So you can think of an infinitely thin sheet with a corner and two infinite edges that go on however. And also, another thing that we have discussed so far are discrete lattices, so discrete wave problems, but you can also Wave problems, but you can also think of continuous yet periodic problems. So, this is the typical of a phononic crystal when you have scatterers that are periodically distributed in an otherwise continuous media. All right, and what's interesting is that this type of problem, the first two have been solved a long time ago. This one and this one is not quite clear to write down an exact explicit solution, but that leads to some interesting work. Some interesting work, and there's still some things that are interesting mathematically in this kind of problems as well. And I will hopefully have time to say a few words of these about those. Okay, so now in pretty much all the talk we've had so far, at the end of the day, the solution to the problem was written as an integral of something. Okay. And so, and we've seen, we've heard at least that some. We've heard at least at some stage the word limiting absorption principle, and effectively, this is what's going on. You take your wave number k, you give it a small imaginary part, positive, that I call kappa here. And then often you end up with a physical field u written as an integral of some function f times some exponential thing where xi is understood as a complex number. Number, but we sort of integrate in that case over R, for instance. And these integrals are well defined as long as kappa here is strictly positive. But this is generally what happens for 2D problems. If you go in three-dimensional, it can be beneficial to instead taking two Fourier transforms, so in two different directions, for instance, x1 and x2 direction. If you do the same thing, you end up with a physical field here that can be written as a. Field here that can be written as a double integral of another function f that can be thought of as a function of two complex variables ψ1 and ψ2 that are here. So you can get either sort of simple, this is an inverse Fourier transform, or something slightly more difficult when you have an extra function in your exponential. And generally, all of the type of solutions that we get at in diffraction theory look like those. Now, what's interesting is that all of Now, what's interesting is that all of these integrals are perfectly well defined when kappa is strictly positive. And the reason for that is that when kappa is positive, this function here and here, or this one and these ones, don't have any singularity on the real line or the real plane. When kappa goes to zero, the singularities of these complex functions hit the surface of integration or the line of integration. And basically, here, I'm just going to explain. And basically, here I'm just going to explain what to do in this case. The nice thing, I mentioned some cases in periodic media, is that if you replace r by a finite interval here or r squared by this square here, this is exactly the same kind of integrals that you recover either in discrete phononic crystal, etc. So, this is quite general in nature, what we're looking at here, right. Right, so what do we want to do? The first is to explain that, okay? What to do when the singularities hit. So, the first thing, and I'm going to throughout, illustrate what I'm trying to say through the 1D complex analysis and explain what we do when we have more than one complex variable. So, if you have a single integral, the classic thing to do, and we talked a little bit about this with Dave, and in fact, About this with Dave, and in fact, what he does is not start with R, you already start with a sort of indented domain from the get-go, but that's the same. So, here's the situation: you have your contour integration R, perfectly valid when kappa is positive, and you've got some singularities in purple here. And when kappa tends to zero, the singularity hits R. And one traditional way to deal with this is just to deform your contour in R into a contour gamma that avoids this singularity. That avoids this singularity. So it bypasses them either from above or from below here. And so we deform a one-dimensional contour to another one-dimensional contour. They both live in a two-dimensional space, and we try to avoid singularities that are points, so zero-dimensional objects. If you have two integrals, then you do the same thing, but you will deform R squared, which is a two-dimensional surface, to a contour NC squared, so another two-dimensional surface. C squared, so another two-dimensional surface in a space of dimension four this time, and we will try to avoid singularities. And singularities of functions of two complex variables, we will see that in a bit more detail later. They have dimension two. Here, by dimension, I mean real dimension. And this, of course, it's much more difficult to draw on the board. Okay, so this is the first step. So what effectively what I've done here is to make sense of that limit, kappa goes to zero. Of that limit, kappa, goes to zero by expressing a field as an integral that has sense that exist. Now, the second step, because this is not enough, because this integral can still be complicated to evaluate because the TK might not be high enough, they can still be oscillatory and this kind of stuff. So the second step is to deform the surface of integration that we've obtained here into onto a new one where effectively your integral is exponentially decaying. Is exponentially decaying almost everywhere when your physical variables here go to infinity. So, in the far physical field, the integral should be exponentially decaying everywhere. And so, this is typically of the one 1D situation when you deform your contour into some kind of stationary phase or steepest descent if you want to go further. But then there are some points like this where you cannot do that, even in one complex variable. And they're typically suddenly. And they're typically saddle points in one complex variables. Now, this is the same is true for higher dimensions. And basically, we do that business and we select the points around which this is not possible, around which we'll never achieve exponential decay in the neighborhood of these points. And these points, we call them special. And these special points, we will show that they are responsible for the physical behavior of your wave, okay? Behavior of your wave. Okay, each bit of your far field can be associated to one such special point. And if you think about it, the same is quite true in 1D complex analysis. We all know that the pool can be a reflected wave, that the branch cut might be a diffracted thing, etc. Okay. So this is the big picture. Now I'm going to say a few more details about how we actually do this. So, and to do this, I just need to design. So, and to do this, I just need to discuss a few things about singularities in several complex variables. And we're going to do that in that slide. So, first of all, we define a singular set. So, if you take a function that is nice, nice in complex analysis means holomorphic. And basically, a singular set is all the points where your function is not nice. It's not holomorphic. Now, f that we discussed before is a solution to a problem that depending on To a problem that depends on the value of kappa that we have selected to be strictly positive and also on the real part of the wave number k0. So it makes sense to define the singular set as explicitly depending on k0 and kappa. And it turns out that this object, there is a mathematical theory that describes these kind of objects, and you should think of them as a union. Should think of them as a union of one complex-dimensional complex manifold. Okay, so as a union of smooth surfaces that might or might not interact with each other, but there's a finite union of such objects. So this is quite well behaved. Now, the reason why my integrals work well is because this set intersected with the real surface of integration is the empty set when kappa is strictly positive. kappa is strictly positive. What happens is when kappa becomes zero, this is not true anymore. And so we're going to give a name of that intersection. So when kappa goes to zero, I'm going to call the real trace of the function as being the singular set when kappa is zero intersected with the surface of integration. So this is the places that we don't like effectively when we perform the integration. And what is for the same reason what happens is we can see that Reason what happens if we can see that these real traces will be a set of nice curves in the reals in R squared. And each of these curves, we will call them irreducible components of the real trace of F. All right, so this is most of the sort of jargon that I'm going to introduce. The easiest way to convince yourself that this kind of makes sense is to look at a typical example. So if I take a function here that Example. So if I take a function here that I've made up, but not completely made up, then you can think of what's the real trace of that. So you first look at what happens when you k you write it like this, then you let kappa go to zero, and you look at the singularities that intersect the real surface. So when is it not defined for xi1 and xi2 real? And what we see is that you should obtain a drawing like this, where the circle here corresponds to the place where this bin. To the place where this inside of the square root is zero, there, and each of this pool here corresponds to one of the straight line. And so, this kind of diagrams is really essential in what will follow. So, how we deform surfaces? We will deform them a little bit for now. And we're going to follow this approach here. So, we're going to write our surface gamma as the set of all points in C squared that can. All points in C squared that can be written as psi plus some imaginary part eta of psi. And psi here is assumed to be real, and eta is also assumed to be a real vector field. Okay, so effectively, this is just parametrized above the real surface. So this is exactly what we do in 1D, but here we just use bold letters instead of using not bold letters. And then we have that the real part of this point is just That the real part of this point is just ψ, and the imaginary part is just it eta. So basically, our whole deformed surface is just a vector field. And so you can get this type of picture. Here you have a real trace in plane and then the vector field of a valid deformation of our surface superposed onto it. What is neat is that you can show that if your vector field is never zero on the real trace and never tangent to it, then up to some scaling, Then, up to some scaling, your surface, your deformed surface, will never intersect the singularities of F. And this is not trivial because the singularity of f lie also outside of the real surface, right? They're not isolated to the real surface. And for this reason, as for the 1D case, there is only two ways to bypass a given singular component. Either the vector field eta. The vector field eta points outside of it or inside of it. Yeah, there's no in-between because otherwise we'll need to either be zero there or tangent to it to change from one to the other. Question is, how do you choose the good one? Okay, because choosing the good bypass is very important, as I think we know both from 1D and some other consideration. What happens is that you just look at the real trace for a given real value of k, you pick a Of k, you pick a point on it, you increase ever so slightly k. This gives you a new real trace, and then this gives you, in some sense, the direction of what we call the group velocity. And the rule is to choose the vector field eta opposite to the group velocity, such that your bypass is done properly and satisfy everything from a radiation condition point of view. So, in other words, Condition point of view. So, in other words, here, what I'm trying to say, there's the link between the radiation condition and the bypass. To me, radiation condition could be interpreted as the right choice of bypass. Right, what can I say about results? First of all, I talked to you about special points before and we've tried to classify those special points. So, I'm going to try to clear a few results in the case of just the simple double inverse. Of just a simple double inverse Fourier transform. So, if your point is not on a singular trace, then it isn't special. So, you can easily deform around it to something exponentially decaying. It won't lead to any field at infinity. If the point belongs to a singularity, but the direction in which you are looking, so x tilde is the observation direction, if this direction is not perpendicular to the singularity, then there's no problem. It's not special. No problem, it's not special. However, if this observation direction is perpendicular to the singularity, then your point is special. You can deform freely around that point, and it leads to a four-field asymptotic. This point, we've named them SOS. If you have two components that cross, again, these points are special and leads to some asymptotics. If two real trace Two real traces touch but don't cross, then these points are not special unless the direction X still is perpendicular to it. So this is the sort of main type of results. Now, if you're interested in numerical analysis, computing oscillatory and singular integrals is not trivial. And to do that, here we propose a way of doing by giving explicit construction of this nice deformation on which you Nice deformation on which you can use if you wish your favorite quadrature in the neighborhood of the back points. So, if g is not zero, so if the exponential is slightly more complicated, we have similar classification. I'm not gonna go further. Right, and I said that we get asymptotic. So, here again, I'm not gonna do the detail, but imagine you have a point that is an SOS, so the observation direction is perpendicular. Direction is perpendicular to the singular to the real trace, then if you assume that your function f, so the integrand, behaves like a certain power of the function used to define that real trace, they are generally defined by a holomorphic function being zero. Then you can explicitly find the far-field behavior of your physical wave field in terms of In terms of parameters that depend solely on the observation direction and on the type of singularities you have. Okay, mu in particular does not need to be an integer, you can deal with branching, it doesn't need to be pulls, etc. And you can have a very similar result for crossings. For crossings, you also get explicit asymptotics. And what's interesting is that then you can divide the space around that point into four. The space around that point into four quadrants, and the wave that it generates only lives in one of those quadrants. So, this gives some directionality to the problem. Right, example of applications. So, this was so far very general for all of this type of integral that I've described. And I'm going to go to now some problems, diffraction problems. So, this is the quarter plane problem that I've mentioned at the Quarterplane problem that I've mentioned at the beginning in three-dimensional, and it is quite complicated. The structure of the far field of this problem is difficult. You will have waves that can be reflected from the flat surface, some that will be diffracted by each of the edges. You get some that are diffracted by the corner, and you can even get some that are diffracted by one edge, and then the next one, etc. So, there's loads of different fields that make up the four-field asymptotic of this problem. The four-field asymptotic of this problem. And if you look at this from the theory that I've just described, you can write down the you can plot the real traces of the singularity of your function, of your complex function, and you can associate special points to each of these far fields that you would get from, for instance, geometrical theory of diffraction. And you have, if this is on the extra. If this is on the x tree equals zero plane, but you can also do this out of it. And each of these points will be associated to a specific asymptotic formula, and then you add them all together, then you get the far field of this complicated object. I also mentioned the penetrable wedge, so when you have two different material properties inside and outside, and then the same way again, the field is slightly complicated. You've got some corner diffractive. Got some corner diffracted waves, some transmitted, reflected. You've got some lateral waves that happen here to match the different in material properties. And again, here, if I look from the real trace perspective, then this is what I see. And each of the special points for the singularities will be one of the far-field things that I've mentioned here. And for all of this, we can write explicit asymptotic. We can write explicit asymptotic as well, sometimes with an unknown constant, but otherwise it is very close form. And so I've not mentioned Winnehop so far. We are in a Winnehof workshop. The main motivation behind all this work had been from the start an attempt to generalize the Winnehof technique to several variables. Okay, as far as I know, Okay, as far as I know, there's no such thing, right? So, if you functional equation, we've seen some with one complex variable, we've seen some with some matrix kernel, but we've not yet discussed a Winhof equation in several complex variables. And that was the motivation as well behind this. And I can give you a little bit of a link between what I've shown so far and the Winhof technique in two variables at least. So, if you start, so this here is the quarter plane, this is on the penishable wedge. If you start from the value point, If you start from the boundary value problem, you can do the usual trick Fourier transform in both directions, or you can use Green's theorem if you wish, and you reduce a boundary value problem in the physical space to a functional equation of the Winhof type in two complex variables. Now, the problem is that there's no really known technique to actually solve it. Even the usual thing, you factorize the kernel, then you split the thing in. The kernel, then you split the thing. It doesn't really work so easily. But what we can do from those is to perform an analytical continuation of the unknowns. And from that, we can determine their singular behavior. And in particular, from this step here, we arrive at the figures that I've plotted, at the diagrams that I've plotted. Even though we don't know exactly the solution to the problem, we can still conclude regarding their singularity. And then once. Singularity. And then, once I have this, we can apply everything I've just told so far to get the four-field asymptotics. So, we are not yet solving the Winne-Hof equation fully, but from that, we can still extract meaningful information. Okay, so what I want to say next, I still have a few minutes, so I can talk about discrete, for instance. So, if you have a discrete problem, here I'm just going to try to solve fine. Just going to try to solve, find write down a Green's function of a discrete lattice. So I'm forcing that point in red here, and I'm solving the discrete Helmholtz equation that Elena talks about earlier this morning. And if you do this, so this is the equation where these are some unit vector in y and x direction. And if you apply, so we all call it differently, right? So, we all call it differently, right? So, so far, we've had discrete transform, we've had Z transform, I'm going to call it block-block transform. It turns to be quite a standard terminology in the periodic community. So if you apply a double, this type double, because that's the point of today's talk, double floke block transform to the problem, you can then, as I mentioned at the very beginning, recover your field U at some nodes, MN. Some nodes, mn, there are integers, as a double integral of some function f. And it turns out that in this specific case, the function f can be found written down explicitly. Now, this is just one of this stuff. And because of this, it is quite clear that f is analytic, because there's just some usual functions. And also, that there is no singularity on minus pi pi squared if your wave number has. Your wave number has a small imaginary part. Okay, this is quite clear because this, if you understand this is real, this is real, this will be imaginary, so no chance that the denominator is zero. However, if kappa goes to zero, then this is not the case anymore. Okay, and in that case, the interval of possible wave number is limited due to the discrete nature. But what's happening here is that you can see on that plot the evolution. On that plot, the evolution of the real trace for a given k-note as k-naut evolves. You start off with a small circle, the circle grows, then somehow there's some weird thing happens, something collapse and turn into other circles around special points. And the thing where weird stuff happens, we are called them degeneracies. I will say something a little bit about it. There's some sort of change in topology of the real traces at very specific. At very specific values of k-nautes. And this is very topical of a periodic problem. You don't really see that in continuous diffraction problems. Okay. So I'll just, I'll skip this, but the message is if you're in the phononic crystal case, you can do exactly the same. You can show that your transform here is singularity free for a positive value of kappa, hits the singularities. This can be the this is analytic, etc. If this is analytic, et cetera. So you can play the same game there. And this is what I wanted to mention. Degeneracy in periodic systems is when you take a specific wave number, and at this specific wave number, your real trace degenerates. So you can imagine a circle that becomes a point, for instance. So you don't have the same thing. So this is typically what's happening, for instance, if you have a local extremum of your dispersion diagram. Tremum of your dispersion diagram, you've got something like this. You cut it at the frequency in ψ1, ψ2 space. You go circle, it gets smaller and smaller till things disappear. Okay, change of topology. Dirac does the same thing. You go circle, shrinks to a point, reopen as another circle. And this, what happens in the theory that I've presented so far is that at these special points, the surface that we've described as a deformation to C squared. To C square become pinched by singularities. Okay. And that means that there is at these specific values of real numbers, there is no way for me to actually write the integral in a meaningful way. No way. There's no deformation possible. And this is, in a sense, what I a resonant phenomena. Okay. And I mentioned earlier the link between deformation and radiation. The link between deformation and radiation condition, and surprise, at this point, it's not possible to formulate a meaningful radiation condition. Okay, and the link with the deformation, I hope, should be now more obvious to you. So, if you want, you can play, go back in time domain before you do your time harmonic stuff, integrate, and you'll see that if you excite your point, it might grow at infinity when time grows. A little bit like the little spring. the you know the little spring that you that you that you force okay but what we can do is with this method you can obtain asymptotic results when both yeah k goes to this degenerative wave number and we are going far away in the so there's a two parameter asymptotics here close to the degeneracy and far in the far field and you can still get some decent asymptotics in in that case but i'm not we're not the first one to have We're not the first one to have looked at these kinds of things in a totally different way. They've also tried to do this in this paper here. Okay, I'm almost on time. Conclusion. Summary. What have we shown? So I've just shown here a general procedure for deforming surface of integration onto the complex plane C squared. And I've also introduced the idea of locality principle. That means that. Principle. That means that most of the meaningful physical behavior of a field is due to a certain finite number of points in the two-dimensional complex plane. We've associated asymptotic results to each of these special points and said that, well, you don't need to do asymptotics if you prefer numerics. You can just use that deformation, mesh it, and compute to integral. In fact, to check our asymptotics, this is exactly what we have. Check our asymptotics, this is exactly what we had to do. I'll mention applications in wave theory. Now, perspective: here, I've not yet mentioned pathological cases. So if you have two special points that merge with each other, we all know that it's a pain. When your saddle points in Wendy start merging, branch and saddle merge, this is very difficult. The same difficulties can occur in higher dimensions. Another thing that I've not said anything about is. thing that I've not said anything about is optimal deformation. In 1D, we know that the best way to deal with such an integral is to deform your contour to the steepest descent contour. It is very suited for numerical integration, very suited for asymptotics. And on Thursday, Andrei Shannon will discuss how to do that in our case. I've not gone so far in this talk. And then we can, of course, keep increasing the dimension. And everything I said, there's no reason why it wouldn't work for. There's no reason why it wouldn't work for triple integrals. So, thank you very much, and Nassau.
