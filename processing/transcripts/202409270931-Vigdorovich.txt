I want to go back to a long time ago, to day one of this conference. Cyrill stood here and presented this program and said if you have a higher ink lattice, so inside L infinity you have the positive definite function or states, then you have the conjugation invariant ones. This is a simplex and you take the extreme points, this is called characters, and the program consists of two. And the program consists of two steps. One is classification, classify all traces or extreme points of gamma. And the second is stiffness, which I call stiffness. So when gamma acts on this space by conjugation, show that each subset, a gamma-invariant subset, closed convex subset, has a fixed point. Fixed point here is, of course, a trace. And as I mentioned, two is basic most basically completed, at least in this framework. One is completed for many cases, but not all. And what I want to do today is first of all to elaborate on this, especially on the second one, which maybe seem a bit curious, for why is it an important condition, and especially why the two together are very powerful. And I'm going to also do it in a much broader And I'm going to also do it in a much broader perspective. I'm going to kind of really zoom out for a moment. And towards the end, I'll really come back to this particular problem. So I want to talk about dynamics, and I'm going to start with the commutative case. So you have this classical setting of a topological dynamical system. And as you all know, once gamma is amenable, there exists an invariance measure. Measure. And this is very useful because now, from this system, you can now apply erodic theory and also spectral theory, harmonic analysis, you get representation, and there's a lot to go from there. What if the group is not amenable? So, of course, you may have no invariant measures. What you can do is the following: fix a probability measure on the group, the acting group. Group, the acting group, and you assume that the measure is somehow large enough, maybe fully supported, or at least as a support generates the group, so it somehow still captures the group. Then, you say that a measure on your space is stationary with respect to the measure on the group if it is stable under the averaging operator that this induces. So, say maybe it's not invariant for each particular gamma individually. Gamma individually, but somehow in average, it is invariant. This is called stationary. And stationary, while invariant measures don't always exist, stationary measures always exist for the exact same reason that for amenable groups, invariant measures exist. You can just take a sequence that becomes more and more stationary and take a weak side. So, this brings us back to the game where we can apply an ergodic theory and So let's formulate this in some ways. So first of all, just note that every invariant measure is of course stationary. When the converse holds, we say that the action is stiff. The action is said to be stiff with respect to the fixed measure mu. And sometimes I'm going to suppress this mu because we sometimes choose one mu for one need and another mu for another need. So you say it's sticking. Another day. So you say it's stiff if every stationary is actually in that. So, what could be a program in this context? So, you have an action, so classification, classify all invariant measures, sustainable system. And stiffness, show that any stationary measure is in fact invariant. And I want already here to try to explain why these two together These two together are powerful, and I want to do it with a particular example. So, let's take this very nice system. We have the torus. The group of automorphisms of the torus is more or less SLNZ, so it acts on it by automorphisms, and in particular by homeomorphisms. And so, let's start with classification. There is indeed a classification of invariant measures. So, of course, you have many periodic measures. You have many periodic measures corresponding to rational points. You have the hard measure, of course, and nothing else. What about stiffness? We also have stiffness. Every stationary measure is invariant if you choose mu in a particular way. And for this talk, it really doesn't matter too much what is the mu. Mu is a tool just to kind of aminibalize the group, the non-aminible group. So, I want to now try to a bit demonstrate why this is powerful. For example, just it's really a baby case, but just to kind of try to, because later it will come into play. So, you have the space X, and suppose now you want to classify minimal subspaces, something in topological mechanics. Take a minimal subspace, Y and of course, probe Y, which is gamma invariant. Is gamma invariant might be empty, could be. You have no idea what y is, but mu stationary always exists. So you choose a major, so you can always choose a mu stationary measure. Now you use stiffness. This mu stationary measure is actually invariant. So it is an invariant measure. Now you use classification. Oh, I know what this is. You can choose this measure to be ergodic if you want to. It's either the hard or the atomic. The atomic. It can't be the hard because the whole space is not minimal, but so you're left with atomic. Ah, it's just a finite, it's a period. It's just a finite salt. So this is just to give you an example of how these two interplay. Of course, this kind of concept was vastly generalized and with a lot of very interesting results in this kind of thing. I want to now present a generalization these two things of the dynamics on torque. I want to present a generalization of this. So for this, I need to just remind what is an arithmetic group. If you know, you know, but if not, I'll just give a rough definition. Basically, arithmetic groups are groups that arise from arithmetic constructions. We take groups that arise as integer solutions to polynomials, rational polynomials. Let's just Polynomials. Let's just look at examples. So S and Z satisfies that determinant polynomial, integer solutions. Z to the N is definitely arithmetic. Eisenberg is the arithmetic. And of course, you can construct all kinds of semi-direct products to get more general arithmetic groups. In particular, I'm not only focusing on semi-simple. I'm talking about arbitrary arithmetic groups. And it's not semi-simple, you may have in particular an amino. But you may have in particular an amenable normal subgroups here. I think you can identify them. This is the one here, and this is the one here. And now you get an action, so gamma acts on this normal subgroup by conjugation. And this is induced as a dynamical system. Gamma acts on the space of characters, like the spectrum, if you wish, on the aminable radical. So you get this dynamical system, and the theorem I want to first. The theorem I want to first present is that when you consider any arithmetic group whatsoever, and you consider this dynamical system, there is, so first of all, classification. Only invariant measures are something I call algebraic. So they come somehow from this, this all comes from this algebraic group, very a lot of structure, and you have some kind of obvious measures that might arise from this, and these are the only measures. From this, and these are the only measures. And stiffness, every mu stationary measure is invariant. Let's just take one example. So if you take this particular example, I want you to note that this is, you recover the previous slide. So the dynamical system that arises from this particular example is S and Z acting on the character space of Zn, then it's the torus. Classification plus stiffness, this is exactly. Specification plus stiffness, this is exactly recovers on the previous slide. But of course, you get more examples. This is like the very basic example. So a group of automorphism, actually, at the Heisenberg is SL2Z, so it acts on it by automorphisms, and you get this dynamical system, and you get that it's stiff. Now, I think you all know how the dual of this looks like, but I don't know if you ever saw. Like, but I don't know if you ever saw how a character space of a non-abelian group looks like. So, and in order to prove this theorem, we actually really had to get some hold of how those spaces look like in order to get some intuition and to prove things about them. So the space of, after analyzing how it exactly looks like the space of characters of Weisenberg group, it turned out to look like this space. So this is a fiber over the surface. Fibered over the circle, and the fibers are all tori, and they're of different size. And the size is prescribed by this function, which if you recently taught a calculus course, you probably might have given this as an example of a function which is continuous exactly in the irrational points and discontinuous exactly in the rational points. This is the classic example. And this function actually prescribes, so here you have a big torre. So here you have a big tora, in the half you have a smaller, and it goes smaller and smaller. And in the irrational points, it just went. And we were quite amazed when we encountered this object in such a natural way. So this is for the commutative setting. I want to now go to the non-commutative setting unless you have questions so far. So let's do non-commutative. So let's do non-commutative. Non-non-commutative setting will be, of course, where we have a group gamma acting on a sister algebra. And instead of them invariant measures, we look at invariant states. Once again, this space may very well be empty. We do the same idea. We take a probability measure on the group, which is large enough. And we say that a state is mu stationary if it is not invariant necessarily, but invariant in average with respect to the measure mu. And of course, stationary states always exist for the exact same reason. While of course, invariant states don't always exist. What could be a program in this context? We have an action of gamma and A. Action of gamma and A. Classification, classify all invariant states. Stiffness, ensure that any stationary state is in fact invariant. Which kind of implications you get to it. So actually, this is relatively new, this kind of study, and there are quite a few implications, actually, quite remarkable implications, but still, until now, quite a few. But actually, after Camila's talk, it made me think also. But actually after Camilla's talk it made me think also about like it's very like before I give an example of how to stationary dynamics to find subsystems of your space, so it seems very natural that if you want to understand ideals and cross products, maybe stationary dynamics will be relevant here in this particular program. But I want to now present some implications which were studied in the last years. So let's start with the most. Let's start with the most so I have two very natural dynamical systems which you consider. The first is where you take A to be the reduced system algebra In such a case the invariant states have a different name. It's just traces of A and with this with this notion the unique trace property is saying that this regular state on the sister algebra is the only invariant Is the only state which is invariant under the action of gamma preservation? And then Halpan and Kalenthal, they started studying stationary dynamics and they obtained the following very nice characterization. So gamma cis star simple if it satisfies the stronger uh equitarians, not only that phi lambda is the only invariant state, it's actually the only stationary state. It's actually the only stationary state. Okay, the next example would be taking A to be the maximal sister domain. Once again, here states of A is, you can think of it as also functions of gamma, as positive definite functions in gamma, and that invariant states are traces in gamma. And then you can talk about me. Then you can talk about stationary states, which I'll call stationary states, but some people call it stationary traces or even stationary characters. Well, you can choose your best notion, but they all mean exactly the same here. And let's revisit the program now. We talked and see how it actually is basically the same program as Lila presented in the beginning. So we classify the invariant states. That's the classification. That's the classification, and stiffness show that any stationary state is in fact invariant. This was exactly how Cyril presented it, the first one. The second one is a bit different. It was a bit weird. It's actually a better notion, but still I prefer to present it this way. Every subset which is of the positive definite functions, which is gamma-invariant, Definite functions, which is gamma-invariant and closed and convex, contains a church. But this is a slightly stronger notion. Because stationary states always exist, you can always find a stationary state inside this subset. And then if you know stiffness, you actually find that trace. So it's more or less the same. It's just a different way of that I want to present it here. So now let's focus specifically on. Focus specifically on higher rank lattices. So you have a higher ink lattice in this setting. Classification goes by the name of character rigidity. So under this property t-assumption, Peterson showed that every character is either the Tirak or the finite dimensional ones, but nothing else. What about? What about stiffness? And this is a theorem by Boutonier that indeed says that every stationary state is in fact invariant, namely it is a trace. Actually, curiously, not only that they prove stiffness, actually they showed how using the stiffness you can actually also get the classification. So sometimes those two can actually help each other. Help each other. Of course, a natural question that arises if it's true for all mu. They did it for a very specific kind of mu, which is usually good enough because you just use this mu for to get stuff, but still it's interesting to see if you can get it for more, let's say, natural mu and not like fine-tuned mu to help you to solve a problem. So, here is the theorem I want to present. So you have again an arithmetic group, and I emphasize it's not necessarily semi-simple method. The semi-simple case was that was the previous slide. Now I'm talking about a non-semi-simple case. So like groups like S, L, and Z, semi-direct product Z to V and the name of the setting. So we show that this stiffness indeed extends to this general setting. Yes. This is on the maximum system? Yes, this is on the maximum. Yes, this is on the maximal zero. So whenever I say it's a trace on gamma, it actually means it's a trace on the maximal sister algebra. So let's just say more or less what is the proof. Well, you have this obvious exact sequence, you have this amino radical. This part you can kind of, you can, up to maybe funny things, you can realize as. Maybe funny things you can realize as a lattice in a semi-simple. So you can think of this as a semi-simple part, and this is the amenable part. The semi-simple part is already completed. So let's look at this amenable part. So you start with a stationary state on gamma. First thing you do, you restrict it to the amenable radical. What you get is a mu stationary state. So you get a state on the amenable radical which is stationary. minimal radical which is stationary with respect to the measure μ on the whole group. Now you, this is my, even if this was extremal, this may be not extremal, but you can decompose it into the extreme ones and by Schoquette theorem you get a probability measure on the extreme points. Now we found, now we're in like in a classical dynamical system. So we can use the theorem I presented before of stiffness. Theorem I presented before of stiffness. So, as the theorem I said before, that whenever you have an arithmetic group, the action on the space of characters of the amenable part is always stiff. So, you get that this measure nu is actually invariant, and therefore this state is actually invariant on the aminable radical, and this is how you proceed. So, actually, of course, this was our goal. The theorem I presented before was the way we proved the Was the way we proved the theorem. So, as I said, those things together have a lot of implications. I didn't present the applications of these two things before, I'll just present it now. So, Madame Boutenero and Dean Peterson, they really formalized it in a nice way. They coined this notion of terminability, and that's where you can really see how those two properties, classification plus stiffness, give you a lot, a lot of results. Give you a lot, a lot of results. And using this kind of framework, we more or less immediately get a bunch of corollaries about the group. I'm not going to read them all out, but I would like to. How much do we know about the positive characteristic? Positive characteristics, if in the semi-simple case it's completed by Butan LBA and button. Non-semi-simple, I didn't think about it yet. I mean it's very natural. I I I do know to do now the S arithmetic case, but two sets zero. Uh positive characteristic. Characteristic something one needs to know how to work with all the car charm and ability or charm and ability? I I think it's charm and ability. If you ask Oli for sure and I think you agree. Yeah, it's it's charm and ability. It's more like uh charm and Pokemon. More like a charmander, Pokemon. That's the origin of the name, I think. A question about number two there. When you say that every character is either amenable, do you mean is it amenable trace? Like in which sense it's amenable? In what sense? So actually, it is amenable in the strongen sense. In the strongen sense, so it is the Fonnet algebra that's generated, but the genus will be amenable. In particular, it will be amenable in the sense of Becca. And I think also amenable in the sense that you are considering. Maybe. Maybe not. I don't know. Okay. Like amenable in a sense of approximately three buckets.
