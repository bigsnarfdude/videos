The right conditions. Okay, so this is just a satellite image from Google Maps in like probably Ethiopia or Somalia, I forget where I got it. And basically in these dry land environments, there's not enough rain inputs to get uniform vegetation. So instead, you end up with patchy vegetation, and under the right conditions, those patches end up being self-organized in some way. Okay, so here what I want to emphasize are To emphasize, the idealized view of this is that I have these black bands, that's where the vegetation is, and then that alternates with bare soil. That's the orange. So it's just this alternating pattern of vegetation and dry soil. And it's on a very large scale, like maybe there's 100 meters between each of the vegetation bands. What I want to really advocate for today is thinking about Is thinking about the time scales carefully that are involved in this, the process time scales, because these are things that arise in these dry environments where there's not very much rain inputs and the storms are short-lived, and the vegetation is long-lived and has a completely different time scale. So, I want to advocate for thinking about these time scales. There's a lot of heterogeneity in this problem, as you can see in this image. Problem as you can see in this image, which is also interesting. I'm not going to be talking about the spatial heterogeneity, but I will be thinking about the temporal heterogeneity and the fact that rainstorms are rare and they have a lot, they're highly variable, and there's climate change going on, so that could be changing as well. Okay, so let me just start with the time scales. This is an image from an old paper when this phenomenon was first being investigated. Being investigated. So, this is a ground-based study by Hemming. And he makes the observation that about time scale of this problem, which is that these vegetation arcs will end up advancing upward very, very slowly. So he says it'll take maybe 60 to 120 years for this arc, which is 18 meters wide, to move its width. Its width. Okay, so there's things are being fed at the leading edge. That's arrows pointing the downslope direction. So rain comes in and feeds the leading edge and things die off at the trailing edge. So that's the time scale. You know, you can go ahead and measure these things, compare the old images with present-day ones. So here's one that we did. There's this whole study of these by this group looking at different places. Looking at different places, and you can take these two images. And if you do a false color overlay on these after doing the referencing, you can see that in that 50-some years, it advanced about one bandwidth. So that's the time scale that we're thinking about for the vegetation. Okay, and then the other critical player in this is the water inputs. Okay, so here's from another study in Mexico, and the top row. The top row is just showing a year's rainfall, and the rainfall events are just indicated as these spikes there. And then, what they also did was look at the water in the soil that feeds the plants. And there's two things I want to point out here. One is that if you look at that, you see that this sort of like abrupt rise there. So instantly, the water goes from the surface into the soil, and then it's decaying maybe over weeks or you know. Over weeks, or you know, or a month. The other thing that's nice to point out in this is that they're looking at the soil water content at different regions within these bands and outside of them. And so you can actually see very clearly this infiltration feedback that's important to this process, which is that in the regions where there's vegetation, a lot more of the water gets into the soil there. And then, like, you look at And then, like, if you look at the bare region after the band, there's hardly any water infiltrating there. So, there's this infiltration contrast that's important for this process. And then, here, I just want to point out the type of variability that's associated with these rain events. And this is reanalysis data from this region in Somalia that has this phenomena. And so, this is showing five. So this is showing five years of rainstorms. This is looking at annual means or the annual rainfall in each of these years. So there's variability there. There's seasonality in this region. There's two rainy seasons. So that's when the rain comes in. These are long and short rains. And then also in the actual rain events, there's a lot of variability as well. Okay, so here are our cool Our goals, this is going to be a talk about modeling. I want a simple model and two things that I want to come out of this simple model is one is that I'd like it to lead to some insights about pattern characteristics. There isn't a lot. I'm going to be just thinking about this as a one-dimensional problem. So there isn't much in the pattern formation problem. There's the spacing between the vegetation. The spacing between the vegetation bands, and maybe you could also think about how wide are the vegetation bands. That 18 meters I was talking about, and the 100 meters between them. So I'm interested in that. And then the other thing that I want to have a model where I can put in this, some kind of stochastic rainfall model. So I need to be able to do lots of that. So it's got to be quick. So it's got to be a simple model. Simple model. So, those are the things I'll show you. To start with, we're building on other people's models, so I'm going to just mention two models that have been influential and that the mathematicians and the theoretical ecologists seem to like. So this is one from Klaus Meyer, who was a theoretical ecologist. And basically, he just said, okay, I'm just gonna write down an infection, reaction, diffusion model. Reaction diffusion model looking at water and biomass interactions. It just has one nonlinear feedback there that's aimed at capturing this infiltration feedback. So if there's more biomass, then more water is going to infiltrate. So he captures that by having it be a B squared rather than a B there. It's with the mean annual precipitation, so he's thinking about. Mean annual precipitation, so he's thinking about it on the time scale of the vegetation. And the other thing I want to point out here is that I put water in quotes because he's got like lots of different water processes all captured by this single variable. So some of it is soil water, some of it is surface water, some of it is the rain input. Okay, so another model that's going up in complexity is this one due to Rieker, who's a theoretical ecologist. Ecologist, and basically, what they wanted to do was really separate out the water into water that's on the surface and water that's in the soil. Okay, and then you can really think of it, start looking at this infiltration feedback, which is acting on those water variables. Okay, and there's some dependence on the biomass, so F is a small parameter in this. You know, they usually use like one-tenth. So, this, like, one-tenth of the water will go into bare. One-tenth of the water will go into bare soil, and the rest goes into the vegetative regions. And I had a conversation once with Bondicoke, one of the people on this, and he said, well, we put in an accelerator on this. And what he meant was it more like a decelerator that they do is they still are thinking about it on the plant time scale. And so they slow down the processes so that things can happen, so that your water. Things can happen so that their water will stay on the surface all year, and again, they can work with an annual meeting. So they're still thinking about processes that happen quickly, but sort of slow them down so they can capture it within this model. Okay, so here's our modeling approach that's going to take some things from these other models. I circled Pune Gandhi, he's like my main collaborator. Gandhi, he's like my main collaborator. So he's like the first author on these projects. And I'm going to be focusing on this results in this paper that was also with an undergraduate at University of Chicago, Lili Yu, and it built on an earlier paper we did where we ended up collaborating with some ecohydrologists to sort of understand how to choose the parameters and how to model this. So that was Sarah Bonetti and Amilkari Poberado, and also with my clients. And also with my collaborators Arrheim. So, here's schematically what the model is. I'll show you the equations in a minute, but the idea is that when a rainstorm happens, there's precipitation that's coming in, that lands on the surface, and that surface water needs to get redistributed into the soil. And that all happens very quickly. Okay, so and then once the storm is over, you go into the slow system, which is just like the cloud. Is just the like the Klausmeyer model. I'm just going to look at the interactions between soil moisture and plants. Okay, and then when the next storm comes, I will take that plant distribution or biomass distribution on the surface, which determines the infiltration, and feed that in to this arrow. Okay, so schematically that's our model. I need to tell you how we want to treat the precipitation, and here we're taking our inspiration from this time series. Inspiration from this time series. We're going to treat the rainstorms. Okay, we've modified this recently, but for the purposes of the results I'm going to show, we're going to treat the rainstorms as instantaneous pulses to the system where there's just instantaneously water of height H deposited on the surface. Okay, and we'll have the rain be in two rainy seasons. The rain be in two rainy seasons that are identical, an exponential distribution for the storm depths, and these arrival times also follows exponential distribution. That's the precipitation model. One slide with all the equations. Okay, so let me, so I'll just go through this. I want to have a second slide about how we chose that. How we chose that fast system. But let me start down here during a dry period, so maybe in that dry season, between the rainy seasons or between pulses coming in, we take something extremely simple. So this is like a, say, something like a Klaus Meier model, where now we're thinking it's just the interactions between the soil moisture and the plants. Okay, so we'll have the evapotranspiration, which was that. Evapotranspiration, which was that slow decay over weeks, would be captured within this. We find that the soil diffusion parameter that people often put in, we don't actually need that. It doesn't seem to do anything here, but we do have seed dispersal captureness and diffusion. Okay, so that's the slow system. When a rain event comes, we take out an initial condition for out an initial condition for the soil moisture and we take out the biomass distribution. And that's the biomass distribution we consider to be frozen for the purposes of a storm event. And that becomes input into this fast system and there's a pulse of rain that's deposited on the surface. That becomes our initial condition for the surface water. And then we run that system and it's in the And then we run that system. And it's in the, something I want to emphasize here is that these feedbacks that are critical to this process are happening in this fast system. It's about the infiltration contrast. Okay, so we just have this infiltration function. And then another feedback that happens is that we care about the, we're on a sloped terrain and we care about the surface transport and the water is going to flow more rapidly over the bare ground and it's going to Over the bare ground, and it's going to flow through the vegetation. So, there's another feedback there. The form of these equations, and I'll show you on another slide, they were chosen to be as simple as possible so that we could just solve them. So, they were set up so that we could just use method of characteristics and write down a closed-form solution. So, that's this slide. And maybe I'll just focus on the graphical representation. So, this is, you know. Representations. This is, you know, some biomass distribution. Things are slanted up. I didn't rotate it, but you should think it's on some gray. And what we do is we just integrate along the characteristics and the amount of water, like here, it's just highlighting two characteristics there. And what you want to do is look at the area between those that's under. Under the initial desire. So, this integral that we have for solving for the amount of water that's deposited into the soil, we convert that to an integral along the characteristic variable. So all you have to do in the numerical thing, or what Punit does in the numerical thing, is he just integrates along this characteristic, keeping track of the length of that to figure out how much water is going to be deposited at that location for the storm. At that location for the storm. Okay, so if you run this, you get something kind of reasonable. Okay, you know, you put it in and turn it on, and you'll get these, you know, so here's the rain events, this is for two centuries, just one realization. This is the soil water content in a space-time plot. So X, horizontal is the spatial variable. The spatial variable and then time on the vertical, and these bands are translating upslope. Okay, so that's what we get. I want to emphasize that for this pattern formation problem with this model, there is an inherent length scale in the problem that's important to think about. Now, length scale is how far can water on this How far can water on the surface travel before it infiltrates? So it's moving downhill and it's constantly infiltrating. There's a characteristic length scale for that. And the way that we came to realize this was that we did a linear stability analysis for spatially uniform vegetation, looking at its stability to sinusoidal perturbations on the surface. We consider We considered the idealized case where each storm is completely identical to the next one. So, periodic rainfall, so we could just calculate flow pay multipliers for this problem. And what we ended up finding in this is that, okay, so on the horizontal is the mean annual precipitation, the vertical is the wave number of the perturbation on the uniform state, and we find the Uniform state, and we find these resonance tongues. So this black boundary is where that floke multiplier, the leading floci multiplier, hits one. And so there's a sequence of resonance tongues, and that back of the envelope calculation is the white curves, meaning like this is how they're spaced. Okay, and but there was something disturbing to us when we did this, which is that Which is that what's happening is these flochium multipliers are complex and they're kind of executing these circles in the complex plane. Here we just plotted their magnitude and their phase. And the phase determines whether things are going to be translated upslope or downslope. And what we found when we did these calculations is that it was quite sensitive. You know, like we have one wave number, it's translating upslope. We have a different wave number, slightly off, it's translating downslope. Slightly off, it's translating downslope. And the one thing we know from these investigations is it should translate upslope. Okay, but having built this apparatus, we didn't want to just give up at that point saying it was off, so Pooney said, let's just go ahead and run the stochastic version. And so, what this is, is comparing the periodic to the stochastic rainfall model. And what he's doing in this is he's looking at different size domains. So even though they look like they're all the same width, he's squishing it, okay, and seeing what happens. So he's adjusting the wave number that he's going to observe. And sure enough, you see under periodic rainfall, it's traveling upslope. Then you do it on a smaller domain, it's traveling down slope. But in the stochastic case, it just tended to do. Case it just tended to do the right things. I don't understand that, I'll just say that that was our observation: that even though the periodic rainfall would lead to one thing, when we made it so fast, it did something different that was consistent with what we were hoping to see. Okay, so the other thing we could do that was we did that linear stability analysis, but these states are highly non-linear. It's like uniform. It's like this vegetation, bare soil vegetation. It's not like a sine wave on a uniform state. Okay, but you can still think about that distance that the water travels. Numerically, you can go ahead and extract that. And so in this case, what is plotted, sorry, this color isn't great, but what is plotted there is the distance the water travels on the surface before getting infiltrated. The surface before getting infiltrated during the last year. So it's just represented during the last year. There's a bunch of different storms. There's a big storm, a small storm, but he's gone ahead and indicated the mean distance. And it's here, one wavelength is about twice that mean distance. So that's what we found from the linear stability analysis. So it sort of carried over that that was an important length scale in this problem. So the way we think about it is that the band wants to. About it is that the band wants to harvest the water that's upslope from it. It doesn't want to be harvesting from the next band up the slope. So that would be the next of those resonance tongues. It would prefer to be in this more efficient regime. Okay, good. I have some slides after this. I was worried I would have to stop. But okay, I want to just go to my conclusions, and then I'm going to show you some things that we're working on right now. Working on right now. Okay, so this was my thing. So, what we claim from this model, at least, is that these storm characteristics matter. I'm saying, like, how far can the water from a storm travel? That's something that depends on a storm characteristic. And we've done a bunch of, once we built the model, we did a bunch of experiments. I'm not going to go through those here. I just wanted to get through what the model was. Get through what the model was. But here's just one of them where what Punit did was he said, okay, I'm going to keep the mean annual precipitation the same, and all I'm going to do is very slowly change the mean of the pulse. Okay, so he has this exponential distribution. I'll change slowly that parameter associated with that exponential distribution and see what happens and what we would expect. And see what happens. And what we would expect, based on our understanding of this process, is like if you have much stronger storms, the bands are going to want to be further apart because they'd travel much further. Okay, so here he's increasing that mean storm depth and you get this kind of coarsening that goes on. And then here he started and decreased it, and you get this band creation going on in that case. And then, you know, he has to do lots of really. He has to do lots of realizations of it. So, this is in the band number space, and you can see there's the hysteresis within this. So, this is a huge amount of dependence on initial conditions for these problems. There's lots of different states, and it depends on the history. Okay, so in the last few minutes, I'll just indicate what we've gotten interested in now. So, this is Burke. Now, so this is work in progress that's just started. So, we found this paper by a couple of ecohydrologists that think about these water processes very carefully, and they actually want to think about surface water flow as I've got shallow water equations that I want to run over this rough surface with all this infiltration contrast. And then I want to couple it to this biomass model. They use a more complicated. Model. They use a more complicated one than we use. And they say, okay, if we want to run that original system, it's you know to do 632 storms takes us two months on a supercomputer. Like, we need things that's like half an hour with many more storms. But he's doing a one-dimensional problem that they have two-dimensional. But what they found, so they built some kind of emulator for this. Emulator for this for the for these storm for the to replace the St. Benon equation. So they have some kind of statistical model for that that they built and they used that to explore it. But what they found was a similar thing with their model, which was quite different from ours, showing that as you increase the storm depth, how much is deposited in the storm, the band spacing increased. So they got that. But the other thing that was interesting is that they also had storm duration. We didn't have that in ours. We didn't have that in ours. And storm duration does matter. We just said, okay, instantaneously, I don't, you know, it's like so quick. It's like a storm. It's over in half an hour. We'll just treat it as a pulse. But actually, it matters. So just to indicate the kinds of things we're thinking about now, and so we've teamed up with Octavia Crompton, who is one of the people on that paper, trying to sort of get us to come to some middle. Get us to come to some middle ground on the complexity of the model. So, we're doing comparisons between our really idealized model that we've solved with method of characteristics and her model involving St. Benon equations. But what I'm trying to indicate here, which relates to how storm characteristics determine properties, so this is on a domain, like just putting in, so what Puni Debbie's putting in. So, what Puni did was put in a square pulse of vegetation on this domain, and he says, Well, if I make that pulse too narrow, and I just look at what happens with one storm. Okay, so this is very quick. If I just have one storm and I have a narrow pulse, I can see that the water doesn't get fully deposited in there, it's going to keep going. So, that's too narrow. And if he widens it, in this case, it's too wide, it's get used up before it gets. Wide, it's get used up before it gets to the end of the band. So you can choose a band width that matches that so that it just depletes the water by the time it gets to the end. Okay, so he puts that in on initial condition. It seems to work pretty well in predicting what might happen. It ended up that was like a little bit more narrow. So that's from this, comparing with this simulation. From this comparing with the simulation, I'll just end with maybe it's an interesting pattern formation problem, or I think it is, which is with this stochastic input. So here, what we're doing now is varying the intensity of storms and duration of storms as one of our random variables and also the depth of the storms. So this is with the idealized periodic case, just picking out one point and having it do there. One point and having it do there, we get this. But then, if you run it with this stochastic model, you get just a lot more variation, and that seems to be very much, you know, maybe there's just much, many more states there. And so I don't really know how to do anything with that pattern formation problem, but I thought I would end with that since I got to speak in the second slot of a week-long workshop. Okay, thank you. When you showed equations and you introduced this BuzzOp process, which is the rate, then you showed these kinds of pictures. For example, I was expecting to do something like that for almost surely for all of the rest. Surely for all of the rain patterns I get this pattern formation for with high probability something. Right, well I'm you're you don't know me to I think you're expecting too much from me. I'm not going to be able to say that. I was so this is a computational model that I set up and I don't I'm not capable of making some statements. Of making some statement out of the head. Or are these questions at all interesting? I think that they would be. I don't think that the ecohydrologist is going to be interested in that. But I think it could be interesting. I don't think it's easy, though. Yeah, when I said you don't know me, I meant like that's too hard of a problem for me to choose what I meant. So if you have some ideas on that. But I don't, you know, it's like made-up models. You spent a number of years trying to come up with a precise statement about this, and people will have moved on. So I guess that's always the challenging. So if you can find something of interest in the Of interest in the pattern formation realm with that, I think it would be an advance. So, considering the difference between the deterministic and stochastic models, do you know which is more important, the randomness of the timing of the rainfall events or the randomness of the amount? Have you considered those separately? I think they're both. Okay, the timing I don't think is important. In fact, a lot of times what we would do when we were also looking at collapse events, like when it would collapse, because these are, you can get these in where you have a pattern state coexisting with a bare soil state. So you could get a collapse event. So we did investigations, numerical investigations, into how when those would happen. But a lot of times for those, we would collapse. But a lot of times, for those, we would collapse all of the rain happen at the same time, but with that sequence. So we didn't do rye in between. We just said there's pulses. So the pulse height matters. I also think the storm duration matters quite a bit. So I don't think that low intensity rainfall is going to lead to body formation. You need runoff. So there's, you know, if it's just drizzling, it'll just. If it's just drizzling, it'll just infiltrate. So, yeah.
