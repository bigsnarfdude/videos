Later, I have a chance to attend the real meeting at the Banff and hope to have a chance to meet most of you at the Banff. And anyway, it's also a good way for the online meeting. And some of my students can also have a chance to attend the conference, attend all the lectures. And thanks for the organizers. Okay. And my talk is about the My talk is about the spectrostability of bacterial pulse waves for calcium hematite model. It's a joint work with Professor Yi Li and US Zhang Jae College of Criminal Justice and Professor Yung Li in Beijing University of Technology. He's also my first master's student nearly 20 years ago. And also Haojang, he's my recent doctor student. Students and okay, and the model is and we are invested. It's the can you make it full screen your slide? Is it completely okay? Okay, I'm sorry. Okay, it's okay, it's better, much better. And the model where you see the is the maybe the first. The maybe the first chemotechnic model, which is proposed by Keller and Siegel, and the model is closely related with the famous Aderas experiment. And the experiment is published the paper on the experiment is published in 1966 describing the chemotaxis bacteria. And in their experiment, In their experiment, a band of E. coli have been observed to travel at some certain speed. And in this photograph, I can see two point lights, which means two bands of equality and with two speeds. One is faster, another is slower. And I'm sorry, I didn't have enough. The experiment. Anyway, the wave phenomena or the bacterial pulses are under the influence of the attractant of the oxygen and the nutrient. And so it's also the phenomena of chemotactic. And to describe the experimental And also we phenomena bacteria at Kala Siegel, they propose the PB bacteria chemotactic model. Okay, this is the first model. And anyway, and here, the B is the density bacteria, S is the concentration of chemotectant, and the chi is called the chemosensitivity function, and the Qi is the chemotected coefficient. This is the This is also the classical and the Calisego chemotactic model. Here, this term is also usually called chemo-checked terms. These are quasi-linear cross-diffusion terms. Here is a classical. And in their model, to describe the wave phenomena, they consider the simplified cases. And here, The chemical has no diffusion. Okay. Here, consider, I'm sorry, this is not, and for the cases, no chemical diffusion. This is the simplified cases. For example, this is the logarithmic chemotactic. This is the simplest cases. And the India model, for this simplest model, they Model they prove the existence of China waves and which can be obtained easily and with explicit depression. Okay, this here the C can be any positive number and the S tend to S infinite and here S infinite can be any positive number and they can prove that there exists a traveling front but on turning waves here the B is a pulse as The B is a pulse, S is a front. Okay, these are the placid forms. And this is the profile of the waves. And this is bacterial. And this is the front of the chemical. And this their work, it may be the first theoretical work on the training wave corresponding to the phenomena bacteria observing pyramid. And it is said that the profile of the wave features. The profile of the wave fits well with the experiment and the wave in the experiment. Okay. And for the other cases, when the parameter beta, here, beta is the, here is what's beta. Beta is the chemo checked and parameter, which means the check tent of it. Membet is very large, means the check tent is very strong. And beta is small means check tent is small. Is small. And for the cases, beta is less than one, they also obtain the explicit triangle waves, but not smooth, but continuous. So in their paper, they obtain the explicit form by solving all the ordinary differential equations directly. Anyway, and also for basic plus one, they also obtain the other type of straining waves. Okay, here. Okay, here and S and B tends to there, not ponentially, but first ponentially, like a decay, like a double potential function. Okay, and for the more general Calaxigo model, also with zero chemical diffusion, later Keller and they also obtained some mathematical results on sufficient necessary conditions on the existence of smooth training waves. For example, if we consider the GG is a power function and this. is a power function and this is a and this is also some also the similar uh how to say it's a it's some s minus p p is larger than one there exists a smooth trend waves if and only if r less than one p larger than one and here and also there are some other works about the calasigo model but one of the work is about existence and for the cases when the model has a small chemical diffusion Has a small chemical diffusion. And Nagai and Akida proved the existence of Chini waves for the Calacio model with a small diffusion, chemical diffusion. Epsilon is larger than zero. They also prove the existence of China waves. But they applied a different approach based on nonlinear transformation. And after transformation, the system of waves can be reduced to a feature type of nonlinear equation. Then they prove the existing. Then they prove the existence of waves with minimal speed. And anyway, their work on resistance doesn't imply the it is also still open problem. Their work, the existence training waves with a small chemical diffusion and may tend to also, or it's a small perturbation of the calcium model with a zero chemical. So it's a slow open problem, just a mathematical problem. The mathematical problem. When epsilon tends to zero, the speed, the result on the speed a little different. But the speed depends on epsilon, also, the transformation depends on epsilon. Anyway, and as for the stability of instability bacteria, which may be more interesting, because if the stable bacterial houses imply that the wave phenomena mathematically can be, the mathematical channel list can be observed in the real world. In the real world or in the experiment, so here we just focus on the investigation and the stability of bacteria for calcium mode for the simplest model. Okay, for this model, okay, here as alpha, alpha can be in some region, okay. This is the assumption for the existence of the smooth trend waves, but after some transformation, and this model can be reduced to a very Be reduced to a very simple or simplistic cases, my alpha equals one or alpha equals zero and beta larger than one. Okay, so here, so for this model, here in the folding, I just consider this model. And this model can be, after transformation, can be introduced, reduced to the simplic cases, and alpha equals to zero. And also after some transformation for the existent Turley waves for C can be any. Trailing waves for C can be any larger, can be any positive number. Okay, so here we can often measure consider just the speed is one and S infinite is just one. Consider the stability of training with specific training waves with speed one and S infinite and one and alpha equals zero of transformation. And the specific trend waves, okay, this is the form. Okay, in this case, the Okay, in this case, the waves decay potentially. Okay, so this is the model, and here I interested in the stability of training waves. And I first listed some work on the stability. Before stating the stability results or some known results, I first give some comments about the model. The model with the chemoactive terms. The chemo attacked terms, but with no diffusion, chemical diffusion. And this model, in fact, is a couple the parabolic and but cross-diffusion, with cross-diffusion terms with and also with the ODE ordinary differential equation. But considering the immoving coordinate, if I consider stability of triangle waves and the immoving coordinate, and the system just can be written in this form. in written in this form and here after the trans moving coordinate moving coordinate this model is no longer a coupled parabolic ordinary differential equation but it's a coupled parabolic hyperbolic system so it's a coupled parabolic so and for this model the local verposness and the existence and the uniqueness of local classical solution is also unknown. Is also unknown. I think it's also unknown because the classical theories based on some Alexander group or parabolic system can be applied directly. So, and for example, if the linearized system around the triangle is this one, and this linearized operator also is coupled by hyperbolic linearized operator. Okay, here, and there are some known results of stability and the instability. Results of austerity and the instability factor. But anyway, there are some works contradictory, a little contradictory. And some works, earlier works, are based on numerical simulations. So their work, some work in 1974, the numerical simulation implied that the trending waves seem to be stable. You select some initial data near the trending waves, they see the solution moves like a wave. And also, And also, in 1976, Caller and Audio also proposed a conjecture. When beta is larger than one-half, beta less than one half, they are stable or unstable. These are just conjecture. And also, sorry. And in 1989, there are two mathematicians, they invest the location eigenvalues within our operator, applying WK-BNSAS and some numerical simulation. They claim that the waves are spectrally stable, which means. Are spectrally stable, which means that zero is a simple eigenvalue, and all the other eigenvalues have negative real parts, but they have no rigorous proof and no investigation on insights or spectrum. And Nagai Nakinier's paper, their works are based on, focused on the model with a small chemical diffusion. They also investigated the stability of China was, but they investigated essential spectrum, a linear operator in standard Hilbert space. In standard Hilbert space and in some potential weighted space, they claim that the waves are unstable because they select some special potential weighted space. And in fact, the extensive spectral rates are still true for the Keller sigma model with zero chemical diffusion if they selected special appropriate, a special exponential weighted space. And so I first explained why we are interested in this model. And here, because there are some results implied in Some results indicate that the waves are stable. Some theoretical, but especially Nagai's works on the essence spectrum analysis implies that all the solution, all the waves are unstable. And some numerical and the answers imply that the waves may be stable and some conjecture. And here we try to apply some detailed theoretical spectral analysis, including the extensive spectral analysis and isolate eigenvalues. And isolate eigenvalues, and also applying Eigen's function method, and also combined with some numerical simulation, but try to prove that at least in some range of beta, the waves are spectral stable. And here, just say spectral stable because it's a coupled parabolic-hyperbolic system. They just say it's stable, but zero is a simple eigenvalue, or zero is not an eigenvalue. Okay, and all spectrum of linear operator have negative reparte in some appropriate exponential weight display here. The potential weight is space here, the potential weight must be different from the weighted space selected in Nagai's work. Or we interested in it to prove that in some range of beta larger than one, the waves may be spectral unstable in any exponentially weighted spaces. And the stability of waves in property sense are more interesting than the stability result of waves in some other potentially weighted. Ponentially weighted spaces. I think we are more interested in how to prove stability of the waste in some appropriate sense. And as for the local existence uniqueness, and we to get the existence, the local classical solution, we return to the original model, not the moving coordinate. If we return to the original model, the coupled system parabolically with the prostitution term and the ordinary differential equation. And the ordinary differential equation, it's still related with NSM growth. So we apply the NSM growth theory and combined with some special transformation and some argument related with a fractional power spaces and some assumptions. Because here, this model has a B over S. Here, S contains to zero. Okay, S is larger than, but has no positive lower bound. Okay, so we need to. Okay, so we need to add some assumption on the initial data to avoid the zero of the solution at the finite time. Okay, so here is assume that the initial data of the S0 larger than zero, B0 can be non-negative. And the S0 is sufficiently smooth. And also we have some unit boundedness. And we can prove the local uniqueness classical solution, but it's just a local existence. And under this assumption, we can prove. And under this assumption, we can prove that it's a classical solution. There exists a local classical solution which is unique. But to prove the stability, we need to consider the long-time behavior of the global existence solution. And instead of investing the global existence, we consider the spectral stability and also the non-linear stability. And I also like to, you know, And I also like to our local things also and the assumption also how to say if the consider the stability if the initial data is a small perturbation of the training waves in some potential weighted space which just guarantee the initial data the sample initial data is valid it's just true so here so if you consider the initial data is positive on that negative b0 is non-negative On the negative of B0 is non-negative, but the small perturbation training waves, then there exists local classical solution. Okay. And now I consider the symptomic stability trailing waves because just we don't have only a few minutes, I'm sorry. And after some transformation, we rewrite the linearized operator. We consider the spectral analyze linear operator for beta larger than one. And if And if there are no potential, it's easy to see that there exists a positive or unstable sensor spectrum. And you consider potential weighted space at both ends, we have potential at both ends, then we can find that the beta larger than for MA potential weighted space, no, there exists unstable sensor spectrum. But for the beta less than or two, for theoretical, you can prove that when beta is less than 1.6, there exists a Six, there exists some exponential weighted spaces. Okay, there is especially at the minus infinity. Here, I don't have enough time to explain the details. And here, this is the range of beta, okay, 1.5 and 1.6. And also, we have numerical estimate, you can verify that there is a critical parameter beta, and beta is star is less than. Is less than 1.62 and the if beta less than 1.19, and there still exists some weights at both ends, and the extension spectrum are stable. And there are some numerical simulation on the upper and the lower bound of the potential weights, okay? And here, and we can verify numerically and also to get the isolated eigen. Get the isolated eigen location isolated eigenvalues. We also use the Empanz method and which requires some spectral gap condition of the constant matrix, okay? And which is also helpful for us to get to prove the existence of weights for the essential spectrum, okay. And here, I don't have enough time here, I can sign that when beta. So, this is our So, this is our numerical schemes to get to prove the existence of some potential weights. Here, and this also for beta light, you can see no spectral gap means no existence of potential weights appropriate to get the stable essential spectrum. And as for the location, isolated eigenvalue of applied eponympt method. So, under the assumption adjusted when beta is. Assumption or just when beta is less than 1.61, we can prove that there exists two types of m function. And here, the zeros m function just corresponds to the eigen isolated eigenvalue of Liener operator in the ponential weighted spaces. And before applying, before considering the location eigenvalues, we first prove the bounding is unstable eigenvalues, and which is And which is not obvious because the linear operator is just related with zero semi-current, not n-semicron. So we need to prove that bounding is uniform, unstable eigenvalues. Okay, so it's a long proof theoretically. Here, I don't have enough time to prove to show the sketch. This is the result. Bounding is unstable operator. Okay, here, no weights is also okay. Beta larger than one. Beta larger than one, and here when the absolute lambda is large enough, L has no eigenvalues with a non-actual part. So this is the result bounded in this. Okay, there are proof is rather long here, just sketch, skip the sketch proof. And also we can get the theoretical estimate of two types of m function. And also, especially for this star, and we can get the theoretical. A theoretical exact value, okay, here the exact value of d star is beta over beta one. And also, we can get when lambda is real and very large, we can get d star is positive, which also verify the and our okay, helpful for us to check our numerical scheme. Okay, and here this is our numerical, it's a agree with our new theoretical results. Theoretical results. Okay. And also, we consider the location of unstable eigenvalues on bounded region. For the it's not easy to prove the location or non-existence unstable eigenvalue theoretically. So in the bounded region, we apply Ems function method combined with a numerical scheme, numerical simulation, and we can compute the widening number of n's function along some simplified connected curve. simplified connected curve. Okay. And the widing number is zero, then which means spectral stable. It's unstable because zero is not an eigenvalue here of the transformation. Okay. Here we can and here just show some numerical. There's a numerical work about the location. Here means that our numerical results means that the widing number is there in bounded region. Number is there in bounded region. And here, beta is 1.1. This argument is zero. Okay, means the difference argument is zero. So here means the widening number is zero. Okay. And for beta one, six, nine, until all this widening number is zero, which means the spectral, no unstable, isolated eigenvalue in the exponential weighted space. So this is our conclusion. Double beta is less than 1.5. Double beta is less than 1.69. All the waves with the C NaC larger than zero and S infinite larger than zero are spectral stable inside potential weighted space. But for the beta larger than 1.6, all the waves are spectral unstable in any potential weighted spaces. And our future worker considers non-linear potential because it's coupled parabolic. The spectral speed doesn't imply linear, non-linear. We need to prove that linear non-linear potential. Prove the linear non-linear potential space after some detailed investigation. And also, spectral stability, which imply non-linear connection for the model with a small diffusion, chemical diffusion. Here, the singular perturbation structure is not unclear. We guess that there is a small perturbation on slow manifold. And also, we try to apply M's function method and special single perturbation method to get. Perturbation method to get the ongoing work. And sorry. And thank you for your attention. Hope I'm sorry. I may be using too much time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, Professor Uya Pim, for your very interesting presentation. Are there any questions or comments? Please show your face possibly. Your face, possibly, if you have questions and wave your hand. Are there any questions? Oh, and is it did you raise your hand, Aninomiasa? No, okay. It's just a classic. Okay, any other, any question? So you said that you used the different weight from what was used by Nagai and some other people. And some other people, and is it an improvement? So, you said that you use different weight, different yeah, we theoretically use different theoretical analysis and also numerical, we didn't know how they do numerical, but based on m function and also essential spectrum, we applied the related numerical schemes. And we do it for more than 10 years, I think. We change our approach. Yeah, our approach. Yeah, just recently we finished our main work. Okay. Okay. So congratulations on numerical simulations. Successful computations. And pictures you showed, mu1, mu2, mu3, or something, was a very interesting, beautiful picture, yeah. Even at this point, yeah, okay, okay, you mean. Yeah, okay. Okay, you mean you mean to show the okay. I didn't understand what it was in the picture. Yeah, here it's also important here. Here, I mean here before there was some colorful picture. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is just uh, yeah, this one. I'm sorry. This one, I'm sorry, here, and you said that it here, here, right. This is the inbounded region. There are two, three, there are three eigenvalues of the matrix. The constant matrix, we can't get the implicit of the eigenvalues. For the three eigenvalues, we can't get the explicit expression. But numerically, But numerically, we can get the location. But at some special point, we can get the explicit value or the exact value. But for the any lambda, we can get precise. So it's also the difficulty, technical difficulty, how to choose the potential weight at the minus infinite. That's also the region. Okay. So based on a numerical simulation, we can explain why the We can explain why in some cases there exists the exponential weights, in other cases, no exponential weights. For example, 1.69, it touches. There is no spectral gap. In this case, the n function method can be applied to isolated eigenvalues. Yeah. So it's analyticity is not true. You're not correct. It's very detailed deep analysis, and I sent. I thank you very much for your interest. Thank you. Any other question? Henri has a question. Yes, yes. Can you hear me? Please, can you hear me? So thank you, Japing, for this very interesting presentation. It's very nice, Ivoshi, to see you in MAP, by the way. Oh, yes. It's very nice. Of course. Of course, you should look summer. I just want to ask how about the professor. I was just curious about, you know, this result where you say that when beta is between one and some other value, it's uh stable and if it's above another value, it's unstable, right? Above another value, it's unstable, right? So, yeah, right, right. So, the question is: what happens in between? So, I understand from the previous answer you just gave that it's related to the method, but maybe with another method, you could directly see if it's stable or unstable. Do you have some conjecture? Why can't you say something, you know, if it's numerical? Why can't you decide also about for these integrated values of beta? Yeah, beta is. Yeah, beta is, how to say, beta is, we find the critical data of the beta. Okay. Yeah, beta is around 1.62. Less than 1.62 is stable, spectral stable, larger than okay. Okay, so I missed right. Sorry. So I missed the misunderstanding. Okay. Thank you. It's based on some numerical simulation. Yeah. With the help of the majority of the. I was just curious about this. The help is curious about this. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. So, I think the time has come for a break, a short break. And we thank you again, Professor William, for your wonderful lecture. So now we have a five-minute break before the second talk starts.
