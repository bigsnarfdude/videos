No, there is a slight change in the program. One of our colleagues had some critical issues with his computer and his presentation, so he was kind of stressed out and he decided not to give the first talk. So the first talk would be given by Fernando. So he was second, the second was first. And so we're again we're going to leave early today since one talk would be the other talks would be The other council which without further ado, let me introduce you to Fernando. Fernando Guerrero Povette will speak about a prototype of matter control population inversion. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. After all, I want to say thanks to the organizers. I'm very glad to be here. Well, as you can see, the title of my talk The title of my talk changed. Many things have changed. This is an ongoing work, so that let's just start. Well, the outline of my talk is as follows. I will talk first about the population inversion phenomena, which is a special case of quantum control. After After we introduce this phenomena, we want to propose degenerate to generic system. We will explain what is this and in the last part we calculate the invariant state and give some conditions and ideas of how to get this phenomenon, call it invariant population. Population. Okay. Our starting point is a quantum system with this Hamiltonian, where we have the agent values of the Hamiltonian ordered, which is important, and the initial state rho s and we define in this way the mean population in the energy level. And energy level in the state row as this trace. This will mean the mean population. Now, population inversion refers to the phenomenon where higher energy levels, many models, have higher population than of excited atoms compared with the lower energy levels. Namely, this is population immersion. This is population diversion. The mean population in the N level is greater than the mean population in the M level. For some N greater than M in this order. A well-known fact is that in quantum systems in equilibrium temperature, always we have more population in low energies than in the higher ones. This is true. This is true for equilibrium temperature. The immersion population, of course, means the opposite inequality. And in order to obtain population immersion, we have the following scheme. One couples the system with an environment and choosing appropriately the initial state, the environment. State, the environment, the evolution, the interaction also between the system and the environment, such that the semi-group obtained it from the stochastic limit, whose generator depends on all these Hamiltonians, the interactions, of course, and of the in the in a central state, has a dynamical equilibrium embedded state for which population inversion. For which population in Bossina phenomena takes place. Okay. This is what we understand as a dynamical equilibrium, the limit of any initial state on the reaction of the semiconductor. Okay, population inversion is always widely studied. Or was widely studied in many areas. Of course, in quantum abilities, they have a lot of results related to the quantum control. The typical goal of this control is to obtain a dynamical equilibrium state for which there are reduced. Which the reduced dynamics exhibits a population inversion for any coming and choose of this level. Okay, the framework of this work is the weak coupling limit type quantum macro semi-groups. Always we are talking about Talk about related to this framework. The quantum Markov assembly groups have a generator whose visual representation has the following general form, which in the generic case, it means that for any bore frequency, there's a unique pair of energy labels such that the difference is equal to 8. Is equal to A. And the projections in the spectral decomposition are ranked one. So, in this, under this assumption, the generator in the generic case can be rewritten in this way, where DMN is this inner product and simplify this notation putting this new variable. This new variable. Okay, each one of these coefficients in this expression is called a current. If the invalid state satisfies the condition that for all terms, this quantity is equal to zero, then we say the state is an equilibrium, invariant state, or simply equilibrium state. As we will show in this basic example, to get to obtain population inversion is not so easy. Let S B, a quantum system with this Hamiltonian. We have a two-level system with this Hamiltonian. And epsilon m is less than epsilon n. Is less than epsilon n. Then, under this framework, there is no quantum Marcus semigroups that can produce population inversion. Okay, this is a very, very, very long, but straightforward calculation that can show that the action of the semi-group is splitting the state into off-diagonal. into off diagonal and its diagonal part we have this result the action of the semigroup in the off diagonal part of this state has this form which goes to zero as t goes to infinity operator yeah it's general It's general. It's general. And in the diagonal part, we have the following result, which we can observe that this part, well, letting t goes to infinity, this converts to this diagonal state for any initial state. If we observe here, If we observe here, the interaction disappears. So it only depends on the susceptibility, not in the direction. The interaction disappears and it is related with the gap spectral. Now, in a physical meaning, okay. Well, we have this. In the physical meaning, these quantities called the generalized susceptibilities have the following form. Gamma minus is equal to this, and gamma plus is this, where beta is a measurable function interpreted as local inverse temperature in momentum k. As often, we choose the cut of function as a function of the omega, the energy level. So we can have this, which shows that always gamma minus is bigger than gamma plus. Even more, if we choose beta as a function of omega, we have this. Omega, we have this hence. Let me go back in this state. We have gamma minus gamma plus. So always we have this inequality. It means no population inversion can be exceeded. And we didn't make We didn't make some equilibrium assumptions. Okay, even more. In the generic case, we have the following. If the diagonal state is in equilibrium state, we have no population inversion phenomena. I want to say equilibrium. I want to say equilibrium means non-population inversion. The proof is very, very easy. Equilibrium means that these quantities are equal to zero, which implies that this quotient is equal to this. And as we can see, as we see, just see, this is greater than that one. It means that we have always. We have always this relation. So, if we want to exhibit the population inversion phenomena, we must deal with the model with the non-equilibrium dynamical equilibrium. This is important. Okay, in this framework, we have two types of degeneracies. The first one is The first one is related to the Arboson spectrum, which is basically the set of barbed frequencies. If for some element, for any for some board frequencies, we have. We have at least two couples such that the difference is equal to omega. We say that the absence spectrum is degenerate. Also, we will say that the frequency has is n-generic if it exists exactly n couples in the In the have the same product that gives a rise as a difference omega. And the other degeneracy is related to the dimension of the projection in the spectral decomposition of the Hamiltonian. Well, as we say, in the quantum optics are why. are widely spread some configurations in the three level in a three-level system some of the some of them are the lambda configuration it has this in and the big configuration nevertheless we have some transitions forbidden not voluntary Not all interactions are possible in this kind of model. Now, we need, of course, as we show, we need at least a three-level system for exhibit population inversion. But we don't want forbid some interaction so that we propose. We propose this model that we call two generic and degenerate. It means the set of ball frequencies give arise a frequency omega, which is obtained as this difference. Here we have a difference of energy omega here also, and we have. also and we have add to a couple of the energy of the energy as this difference we have a I mean two both frequencies omega and two omega so this model is present both the general is two generic because we have two Two couples that give rise to the same bore frequency, and this projection is rank one, rank two. Okay, okay, first step is to compute the balance state. Well, step four. Computation shows that the L Shows that L omega has this form, L2 omega has this form, and due to linear independence, this equality, L rho equal to zero, becomes this linear system. Okay. Okay. Now, in order to do the things easier, we split the state into the part supported in the diagonal algebra and the of diagonal subspace in this way. In this way, and taking the Hamiltonians, effective Hamiltonians, as the independent commutant of the Hamiltonian, then we have that this function is equal to zero. So we have this these linear system to solve these linear systems. This linear system. This linear system, of course, means L of rho equal to zero. And this one. Well, okay, how we will solve this system? First of all, we introduce some notation. G and N means the current related to the levels M. Related to the levels m and n. This is j p sub omega means this expression p to omega this and in the lexographic order we have the the first the four first equations above can be rewritten in this way okay how we solve this system okay you can check easily easily can check easily easily easily way that this is a a particular solution so we get the solution to the homogeneous system which is obtained as following we observe that this matrix is equivalent to this matrix which has the structure of a incidence matrix using the well-known fact in graph The well-known fact in graph theory, we see that the kernel of this matrix has two dimensions, is two dimensional. And a basis for this kernel is this cycle, this cycle. So the full solution to the linear system is as follows, where this is the coefficient of the Of the cycles. These quantities are related with the current in the power epsilon m epsilon n. So this is the solution. For the last equation, we have this condition with this notation. This notation, this can be written as this, where T is this matrix. As you can see, this is very difficult to get some condition on the invertibility of this matrix. So that we use the following trick, which is decompose this matrix in this way. And if you remember, the inverse. The inverse of a zoom of matrices can be obtained as follows. By this observation, we get that the inverse of this matrix can be written alone. Now, this is the result that we obtain under assumptions of project. their assumptions of progeneric with the generosity pre-label system if this number is different from zero also this number and this polynomial is different from zero observe here this is the characteristic polynomial valued on p this is the formula then Then the invariant state supported on the diagonal algebra is given by this, where these quantities are below here and here. Okay, the proof is basically what I just said: plus the trace condition and And clearing some equalities about. That is the problem. Also, this is very complex to deal with this. So I think that this is time to some assumptions. The weaker assumption that we get is the following. Get is the following is this related to the transpose coefficient so if this is our assumption the state becomes in this where these quantities are much easier much more easy I couldn't this topic. Okay. This is a brief sketch of the proof. This hypothesis implies theta one is equal to zero, also theta two. And this system, this return system. This system, this learned system, is reduced to a homogeneous system. And this hypothesis implies that T is invertible. So the real part of rho, also the imaginary part, is equal to zero. This is an important remark. The positivity of the state allows the given. Allows to give some inequalities for these parameters, which remember they are related with the current. They are the values related with the current. So we have these inequalities and this one. These inequalities have solutions in the region bounded by the straight lines given by these expressions. That is essentially this. that is essentially this region. In this region we have the acceptable values for alpha and beta, the coefficients related with the currents. Okay, if you want to get inversion population, population inversion, we have to look for these parameters in this The parameters in this region. That is the concept. Okay, population inversion in this model. Under the assumptions given above, we cannot have full population inversion. This is all inequalities. And the proof is very easy. It's only to see, observe that if, for example, row one is bigger than row C. row one is bigger than row zero at least one of these parameters must be negative which implies that for example row is less than row zero it means we can get we can have population inversion phenomena in this model but we can have a weaker population inversion for example in this In this case, this is our condition that we obtain by inequalities above. So, in under assumption, in terms of and choosing interaction and generalized susceptibilities in such a way that this satisfy this inequality, then we can obtivate population inversion between row zero and Between row zero and rho two. This is because this inequality implies that alpha must be greater than this quantity. And this quantity is positive because gamma minus is always bigger than gamma plus. And because alpha is bounded by this quantity, as we see in the previous figure. In the previous figure, we have this inequality. This is also true for even true for beta. Beta is a function of alpha, so that I think that we there are missing some additional conditions. But remember that this is ongoing work so that we have to get to get the much more nice condition for get to obtain population inversion phenomena okay this work is a joint work with luigi roberto julio didn't know where is he but okay that's all for for me That's all for me. Let's thank you, Speaker. So, do we have any questions for the audience? Yes, please. Not sure I got like the last result. So, basically, you managed to show that there can be some weak population inversion for central choices of the parameters, but what you are not sure is that you really identify. Identify all the possible parameters that induce this correct U-Heavy, right? For some voices. This selection of the parameters, the interaction and the generalization such that they satisfy this inequality, we can get a population diversion, but only between this. Only between these taken values of the state. Just between them. May I ask? Yes, please, Alexander. Thank you for a very interesting talk. Do you know, are there some connections of your results with so-called resource theory, passive state? Source theory, passive states, and so on. I think it's very similar concepts sometimes in quantum thermodynamics or quantum result theories, which are passive states is exactly the states without inversion. So I think there should be some deep connections. I think you have some kind of refined version of such result theory. Theory. Do you see something like that or not? Yes, I think this is closely related, but this is my first step in this direction so that I have no idea of how to connect this work with other ones. Okay, I say, thank you. I mean, possibly, well, typically they consider just. Well, typically they consider just genu j any completely positive trace preserving uh maps, but you have uh uh explicitly recoupling limit type, so possibly you can see some works on something like no, just see passive state or something like that, and you can refine their results by your result. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry, you have. Sorry, you have questions. Okay. I want to do a comment. Can you show any your equation number seven? Yes, you see here in the imposition. Here, in the impossibility theorem, is very important the difference between phenomenological models and the duct models. If you see this inequality, which is the inequality of the impossibility of inversion, it very, very much is a generalization of what the physicists knew before. Because in Fernando talk, Fernando toll, it was written that in equilibrium, the feces never expect inversion. So, as you see, this is a generalization. Why? Because in our case, we have a local equilibrium state, because beta, the temperature, depends on the momentum. So, it is very essential that the sebiggroup is often. That the semi-group is of weak coupling limit type. Because in the weak coupling, the structure of the susceptivities is deduced. As you see, they depend on beta, which is the initial state of the environment. They depend on omega, which is the energy density of the field. And what is interesting is that the susceptibilities do not depend on the interaction. Okay, so, but mathematically, if you do a phenomenological model and then you are able to define arbitrarily this constant, of course you can have inversion. See, so this my comment is to underline the relevance of deductive models against Against phenomenological model in which these constants are put by hand. I think that a lot of research in quantum Markov semi-group goes in the direction of abstract theory. But this kind of investigation is to underline that if we want to make a real bridge with physics, we have to pay attention to the findings. Attention to the fine structure of even simple semi-group like this. And as you see, even in simple semi-group, some very hard problem can come out. Thank you. We have any more questions? I have just, I'm wondering, the population inversion, so you have. So, you have strict inequality. Do you allow equal equality? So, if the population is equal in every energy level, let's say, does that count as some kind of inversion or not? You have to have strict inequality. Strict. Because the equality can be arise in the if you have a did you generate a Projector, projection. In that level, you can get easily the same population. Thank you. Well, we don't have any more questions. Let's thank the speaker again. Thank you.
