Yeah, I'm going to be talking a little bit about our work that we've done with shelter vulnerable people, homeless people, and that population. I focus a lot on kind of the idea of storytelling through modeling, so that's kind of the theme throughout this. Acknowledgements really quick first, so I just want to acknowledge Dr. Osgood, my supervisor, Cadmod, and the funding that let us do this research. The CIFOL lab members, specifically. Specifically, Wade McDonald and Larissa Sterling. Some of our colleagues in Edmonton, Janetta and Harry, and then Les, who is a consulting elder that worked with us on some of the projects, kind of led into this one. So COVID-19 and homelessness. The homelessness population, they have a pretty unique pattern of movement compared to normal people. They have a pretty unique social structure and in general are just at a disadvantage. At a disadvantage to access regular resources and all of that stuff compared to you and me. So, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit and regulations and the response measures were put in place, this population was really, really affected. It tended to actually create perpetuating homelessness, like it caused people who were homeless to stay homeless longer. And it actually shifted people who might have been more at like a tipping point. Who might have been more at like a tipping point in their life to fall into homelessness when they might not have before? How did COVID-19 actually change that tipping point? So things like job loss, right? You lose your income and you can no longer pay for rent. There was evictions. There was stigmatization, right, associated with when you do get COVID, people tend to kick you out of where you're living at times. There was the isolation factor. The isolation factor that increased the opportunity for you to suffer spousal abuse, right, and things like that. So, this population of at-risk and homeless people really suffered greatly from the proper and good response measures that were awesome for the general population, just not as good for them. And right down here is, I'm just stated that this is kind of the Stated that this is kind of the definition of homelessness according to the Canadian Observatory on Homelessness. It's the situation of an individual, family, or community without stable, safe, permanent, appropriate housing or the immediate prospect, means, and ability of acquiring it. So when I talk about the homeless population and who are at risk, that's kind of the definition that I'm working with. Models and storytelling. So this population is pretty interesting. Is pretty interesting. They consist of a pretty heavy indigenous population, so storytelling and being able to talk to them can be pretty important. When we talk about the data that's already available in this population and about this population, there is lots, but they tend to be pieces of a picture, right? So they're generally estimates, and when they're estimates, it doesn't necessarily count. It doesn't necessarily capture some hidden nuances. It doesn't capture how they move through their environments, the transitions they make. As well as there's these things that are like snapshots. So research will go out and they'll do like a, for one day, look at the whole community, do some interviews and stuff like that, and get a snapshot for a single day. Again, that gives you a really good idea of the numbers for that day. They actually are able to at least They actually are able to at least estimate what is called hidden homelessness, so people who are couch surfing and stuff like that, not usually documented by shelters, but are still important, as well as people who are kind of living in the environments, right? So that's what the snapshots can tell us, but that's one day out of 365, and if it's done in the summer, it looks very different than in the winter and all that sort of stuff. So all of that is, you know, data was a good place. You know, data was a good place to start, but it wasn't enough. We really needed to capture the stories of these people to be able to add it to our models and to figure out what we need to do next. How do we dialogue? How do we do that? What does modeling with people with lived experience look like? We did causal diagrams in agent-based models, and I'm going to go through a couple examples of kind of, I guess, case studies almost. I guess case studies almost of projects that we've done that have really impacted the way that we approached the modeling project for this set of like this project as well as used kind of some of the key points there. So the first project that I want to talk about is one that was done with Janetta Salvagio. She is a doctor and researcher in England and she kind of started And she kind of started this initiative of addiction recovery and community health program at the rural Alexandria Hospital. And what that program did, ARCH, was it went into the ER and it kind of was an intervention point. So these people who had been suffering from substance use or mental health problems or were repeat ER people, they would go in and they would offer to give them support. So to fix, to help fix or to help. Fix to help fix or to help give them support so they wouldn't end up in the ER again. So they did that and they worked through that program and it was really successful. It's still, I think, going on there too. But they wanted to evaluate and look at, okay, what worked really well with this program and what could we do better. And we came in at that point and they came and we kind of did like a workshop with them. And they brought in an elder, his name was Les, and he was. And he was the most amazing individual. He had so many stories and so much to share and like contribute to this work. And he actually was somebody who had gone through the ARCH program himself too. So he really knew and had a good understanding of this community. I got to work with him and we developed what I would call a trust-based model. So he pinpointed that trust and fostering relationships. And fostering relationships with these people in the community, these vulnerable people, was so important that if that trust and that foundation wasn't there, they wouldn't probably go through with some of the interventions that were being put forward. Whether that was, you know, getting them a job interview, getting them a general practitioner. You know, they might try for a little bit, but if the trust wasn't developed and fostered, they'd fall off the trail and end up back in the ER or like the cycle would continue, right? Like the cycle would continue, right? So we identified that this whole idea of building trust and identifying trust was really important for stopping some of these cycles. How did we quantify this? We worked with him, identified stories, he helped give different kind of factors that he identified as really important. He gave different situations that helped foster trust versus hindered trust. And we helped work that into like an agent-based model. Like an agent-based model. And then, how do we take this and now apply it to COVID, right? Because this was again very, it's in the vulnerable population, but it wasn't really relating to COVID, it was relating to some of these interventions to get them out of the vulnerable population. And if we think about it, it stems to, you know, things like willingness for vaccines, right? If you trust your GP and they say you should really think about this, you are a lot more likely to uptick that vaccine than if you don't trust doctors and you don't trust those. You don't trust doctors and you don't trust those like authority figures because they've kind of done you wrong before. It helps to destigmatize that population, too, right? Again, all of these things help to build that trust. So that was that story, and that's kind of what we came into this model going, okay, we know that this is really important. We know we have to learn the stories and figure out where trust is going to be involved. Another project that we worked on, and the research was And the research was done by Wade MacDonald, and he worked with the Yellow Quill First Nation Elders in Saskatchewan. I think he's in Saskatchewan. Yes. And he worked with them and looked at water futures and holistic human health effects kind of on that population in that community. What came out of it, there's a lot of things that went on in there, but what came out of it that we were going to pull into this model that we really felt connected strongly was. Felt connected strongly was this idea of storytelling, right? This community that is heavily indigenous, they really connect with storytelling. And Wade developed what is a storytelling module, and it's a way to take the results from your models and any logic and agent-based models, and kind of present them in a way that is familiar to people, and then they can really resonate and connect with, right? So it was producing a way to give a meaningful result. A way to give a meaningful result back to the community, which was so, so important, right? If you don't engage with the community, you know, you can do all the work up front, you can work with people with lived experience, but if you don't, on the flip side, give them something back, it tends to make that trust harder to gain in the future and not really get them to buy into what you're telling them to do. You want them to feel valued and that their perspective has been seen and heard. So, that's kind of the two. So that's kind of the two big projects that have given us a lot of insight into where we were going and what we wanted to do. Another component that I didn't really mention yet is the idea that just working with these people with lived experiences, working with these elders or people who have gained great respect in their community, right? They know lots of people, people look to them, they listen to them. If you can get them on board, it is. It is incredible what they can do once they go back to their communities, right? They go back with stories, they go back with, hey, you know, like I worked with this team of people and we came up with these interventions and they listened to my ideas and this is what we have to do to help our community, right? And they can like develop this buy-in and this excitement that they have and bring it back to their communities, which is a whole different, like, I don't even think we've really looked into how. I don't even think we've really looked into how much, how effective that is, but we've seen that happen and it's very, very cool and very, very powerful. Okay, so our model. We started with COVID-19 and we based that on ABMs that have been already developed in our lab. I didn't want to start from ground zero, that made no sense to me. So we have a very strong COVID-19 ABM that was developed right at the onset of COVID. Right at the onset of COVID and has been continuously worked on and progressed. And it's used for decision making in Saskatchewan, Australia, and the UK too, I think. For those of you that don't know what an ABM is and an agent-based model, what that looks like, this is an example. We have state charts, which is what those big boxes things are here. And each individual agent has essentially a copy of this. So it So it tracks all of this information. So this one here is like a disease. So susceptible, exposed, infectious, and then there's like a bunch of symptomatic options in here too, right? And each person goes through these state charts at their own pace, depending on where they're at on their journey, if they have been infected or not, and all that sort of stuff. There's things for figuring out where they're at for vaccine and vaccine uptake and all that sort of stuff. And the really cool thing is that this is so individualized. So individualized that you can look and get that heterogeneity that can really be desirable when working with this sort of population. Where we wanted our model, like what we wanted to build on top of this whole COVID-19 stuff that we've already done, is we knew that we needed to depict the homelessness population and how they flow between different locations. And that included how the networks might change and are impacted by focus. Might change and are impacted by COVID-19 and the spread of COVID-19. But we also wanted to develop this framework that allowed us to consciously prepare for the next pandemic around this population. So when we talk about the interventions, right, and how they negatively impacted this community, we wanted to be able to say, hey, we're looking at putting in this intervention. How can we change it for this community? How can we change the wording? How can we change the little bit of rules that we have for the general population? Rules that we have for the general population, and at least, at the very least, not make this community in a worse-off position. We also wanted to look at chronic homelessness versus episodic homelessness, substance use and mental health, and we kind of drew on insight again from other models that we've built on kind of that area. We wanted to look at how we can represent trust, like I had said, in the vulnerable population and the system they have and those around them. And then there's an idea here that I haven't quite introduced yet. An idea here that I haven't quite introduced yet, but I will get to it in a couple slides: is the idea of there's stages of interpreted risk to becoming homeless. Okay, I'm going to breeze through these ones really quick, but these are essentially our agents that we have in the model, the pieces that work together. The agents are people, and they're the vulnerable people. We keep track of a whole bunch of characteristics. Each one kind of like takes care of that themselves. They're assigned some at the beginning of the model, and they Of the model, and they like depending on those characteristics can actually impact where they can go in the model. For example, if a shelter is a woman's shelter, you know, their characteristics will impact if they're able to go to a woman's shelter or not. There's other things too that are kept track of, like if they're a substance user or not. And again, if you are a substance user and you rely heavily on that and a shelter does not allow that, that does not look desirable for you, right? That does not look desirable for you, right? So then you're probably gonna choose one of the other options. This is the really big state chart, and again, this was just like kind of the piece that we're focusing on right now. But there's a lot of interactions and changes and things that happen inside of the agent. The next set of agents are locations. So those were in the previous slide as well, but it's like the encampments, shelters, sleeping outside or sleeping rough, and then with family and friends. Sleeping rough, and then with family and friends. The idea of putting a location as an agent is you're able to look at the network and the flows in and out of those locations, and you're also able to kind of like cut them off from the network when you need to. For example, here, I have a, oh, let's see if this video works. I don't know if it'll work. We'll see. We'll make sure it's not loud. Okay. As this goes through, it's just a picture of what the model sort of looks like when it's running. It's just a really brief It looks like when it's running, it's just some really brief examples, but not a lot. But the idea is that if we're modeling these networks and all of these locations and all that sort of stuff, is that when we apply interventions, and over here is family and friends. So if we say, hey, we're working on, you know, we're putting in isolations, and so isolation measures and all those sort of things, and we cut off family and friends from this network of people. What does that look like? Of people. What does that look like for the outcomes? Like, how does this affect them? And as well as we can look at increasing measures in shelters, right? Like, if we increase masking measures, we can apply masking to shelters, right? And increase masking and things like that. So, with this flow and the network and the evolution of it, we're able to really capture some of those pieces that we really want to look at and ask the questions. We really want to look at it and ask the questions from the model. There, okay, risk level. Okay, this is the piece that I've had mentioned before, but we want to not only look at the homeless population, because as we were doing our research and doing our literature reviews and things like that, we recognized that there's that greater at-risk population. Greater at-risk population. And again, we're talking about tipping points, right? When we talk about COVID and we're talking about when restrictions are put in place, people who were in the at-risk population fell over those tipping points and became homeless. So we were looking at how do we put that in the model, right? How do we simulate that? What does that look like? In literature, generally they take a three-ring approach. General, at-risk, homeless. That is not fine enough for us. Is not fine enough for us in terms of at-risk population. When you look at that, it's so broad. It's if you've ever had any adverse childhood experiences, you now become at-risk, right? There's a lot of literature that says, well, the more factors you have, the greater risk you are. Okay, but what does that look like? You know, like, is there formulation and all of those things? And there's not because people are so relational and everybody is different and all of those things. So, this is where we are working on this. We are working on this process and recognizing that we have to go back to our people with lived experience and with learned experience and talk to them and say, Hey, when we look at risk, when we talk about risk, what sort of things do you find are the tipping points for you guys? What stories do you have? How can we put that in the model and how can we represent your journey and your stories here? So, that's kind of the idea for Risk Bubble. I'll show you how we're at least thinking about We're at least thinking about putting it in the model and kind of play it with. The bottom stuff here, very agent-based. This is normal, it lives in a person. You have, you know, if you're homelessness, and then you transition through like these different risk categories according to some sort of criteria. This one up here might look more familiar to other people who are not agent-based modelers, but it is a stock and flow model. And it actually is embedded within the agent-based model, making it hybrid. And we don't care about knowing all the little bitty details of general population, low-risk population, and moderate, like if we think about risk being kind of in stages. But we want to know how they transition as a whole, and when they get to high risk, we want to know how. And we signal: hey, model, somebody's in the high-risk float stock bucket. Let's make an agent. And now let's track them, and let's look at them and let's work with. And let's look at them and let's work with them. And at that point, now we're not only modeling homelessness, but we're also modeling the high-risk people and tracking their journeys. And we could apply potentially interventions at a high-risk point instead of a homeless point, right? Which is pretty cool too. Overall, then, what interventions are we interested in modeling? Like, what can we do with all of this? This is a very long list of many things. I'm just going to highlight a couple. Kind of put it into categories. Kind of put into categories of like where we're at in the modeling process and how much more work is going to take to actually do these pieces. The basics is, I like, could be done tomorrow. Impacts of masking, right? We've got networks, we've got flows, we've got people, and we've got shelters. We can look at how masking or levels of masking might impact shelters, what different mandates we provide, what that looks like, impacts of ventilation. So shelters that are outside have a high or sorry, not shelter. Outside have a high or sorry, not shelters, but encampments, which are outside living spaces, have high ventilation, right? So we know that. What happens if we improve air flow or circulation inside shelters that are inside, right? Does that actually improve things? What does that look like? We can look at vaccinations and testing measures, all that sort of stuff. A little bit further downstream, there's two here that I really like, that I don't know, I really like. All of them are great, but I really like, is this one here is when there are. This one here is when there are restrictions in place and you know family and friends become not an option anymore. What does that look like in the system? How does that upset it? That cuts off a support system for people to get out of homelessness as well, right? So how much longer are those people going to stay in homelessness if they lose that support system? As well as this one's kind of a different one that you might not think of, but we're actually able to simulate what it would be like if we could put wastewater testing. Be like, if we put wastewater testing at a shelter facility, right? And if we see an increase in pathogen in the wastewater testing, what happens if we at that point introduce more regular testing and swabbing of people? We can look at how much that actually stops things or, you know, like, or we introduce high levels of masking when this happens. We can kind of look at different points in the system and intervene at different options. Further still, Further still, and this includes that risk category situation, right? So that's quite a little bit away, but I can see that, you know, I can see the goal, but we just have to get there because we have to work with the people with lived experience and all of that brings a little bit of complication. But we can work towards that end, work towards achieving having that whole idea of risk category structures, looking at when you increase homelessness due to the past. Increase homelessness due to the pandemic, where that shifts that risk category and that tipping point, and all of the things that kind of are associated with looking at it in a risk category mindset. Next steps for us is doing that, is getting the feedback from people with lived experience, going back to our partners, seeing if there is any data that we don't have access to in the general web, that they might be able to help fill a little bit of the data gaps that we have. That we have, and we're planning an event that is going to be a group model building session about homelessness and vulnerable population. And this event will bring together those people with lived experiences, experts in the field, whether it's doctors or people who work in shelters and things like that, and modelers. And what we do is we work with them and we start with a causal lithium. It's almost going like a little bit more higher level. Like a little bit more higher level, it's a lot more easier to explore some of those core problems and depict that, like, causal pathways that might be related to this project. From experience, it's a really, really good way to tap into like that lived experience and gives people a sense of involvement. And you can take that then and go into modeling. And the people who want to, you know, follow you through in that process, you keep in touch with, and you continue that cycle until you end up with your results and your. Results, and you're, you know, you show them this is this is what your hard work did, right? So, yeah, thank you. That is
