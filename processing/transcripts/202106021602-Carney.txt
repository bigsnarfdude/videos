Yes, so this is the I mean for me it's the third day, for you guys it's the end of the third day. And yeah, so now we have Daniel Carney at Berkeley Labs and he's going to talk about test and application of Newtonian entanglement. So Jen, you got 30 minutes, 25 plus 5 and I'm going to give you like a couple of minutes warning before the 25 and after that I'll tell you like And after that, I'll tell you like the five minutes for the questions. And I guess we give a couple of seconds to Flaminia so she can start the recording. And after that, you can go. Remember, I guess, Flaminia, you're going to unmute us all and turn the videos off. And I guess we're good to go. Yes, go ahead, please. Oh, is it recording? Or sorry, I didn't see. Oh, okay. I didn't see. Oh, okay. Yeah, so thanks for the invite. So I think Holger Mueller was going to speak and originally, but he's very busy, I was just saying. And so I will do my best to mostly focus on work that we've done jointly, but I can't resist at the end. I will briefly talk about stuff that's more in my normal wheelhouse. So part one is going to be 20 minutes and part two will be three, but I'll get to it at the end. So yeah, the first bit of this is. So, yeah, the first bit of this is an experimental proposal that Holger and Jake Taylor and I put together. Jake was my boss at NIST. I recently left NIST and Holger is faculty at Berkeley. So we had a lot of talks in the morning, and I think a lot of people are familiar with this idea, so I will not sort of repeat the whole program. But there's this idea that's been bouncing around for some time now about looking for some kind of distinctly quantum. Kind of distinctly quantum effect in a Newtonian gravitational system. So, this is the cartoon I tend to draw. Um, where you know, what exactly are the kind of things people are looking at? This is the one I'll focus on. You know, this is a cartoon where I imagine I have some sort of a mass, which I can think of one as a source and one as a probe. It doesn't really matter. I sort of picture a source mass, and that source mass comes with some space-time curvature. That's what these little wells are in this cartoon. I mean, really, Cartoon. I mean, really, in the limit that we're going to be working in, this is really just the Newton potential source by the mass here. And the kinds of experiments people have been talking about doing are basically to see, can I entangle the source mass and the probe mass in some precise sense? And then you have to make some further steps to interpret this in terms of, say, the metric degrees of freedom. And that's what I'll talk about at the very end. But schematically, the idea would be that I do. Idea would be right that I do something, for example, I prepare a superposition in space of one of these masses, which I believe then would, you know, you might test what you're really doing is testing the idea that the gravitational field goes along for the ride. So now the metric here is superposed in two different configurations. And then, you know, then the question becomes, how do we actually know that we did this superposition? Well, we need to sort of have a probe mass talk to this thing and fall into this superpose potential. And so, you know, the general And so, you know, the general idea would be that if the Newton interaction can entangle things, that what this would do concretely is produce some entangled state of, say, the two masses. And if you want to sort of include the Newton potential as a sort of degree of freedom here, you could sort of write it in the cat as well. Okay, and so I just flagged we wrote a review paper with this and its relation to other similar tests like Penrose Collapse and stuff like that some time ago, and that's where this picture came. Some time ago, and that's where this picture came from. So, since I actually, this conference starts at six in the morning in my time zone, so I did not see Sogato's talk, but I am 100% sure he talked about this picture. So I will not review it in great detail. But so these guys propose this really nice conceptual and possibly practical method for testing, sort of implementing that cartoon I just showed. So just in brief. So, just you know, in brief, what you do is you take two diamonds. The diamonds have nitrogen vacancy centers, which just means their masses of the spins. And you can do nice things like you can imagine shooting it through String Gerlach, making your spatial superposition of the mass, but then measuring various things like the correlations and the spins at the end of the day. And so, this really has all the ingredients to do one of these Newton gravity entanglement tests. And it's straightforward to see the It's straightforward to see the prediction. If you believe that the Newton interaction entangles, like you might expect if it just acts like other operators, like the Coulomb interaction, it'll generate some entangled state of these masses. And the scaling for the size of the entanglement, I think a nice way to parametrize it is a relative phase that appears in the joint wave function. And the size of this phase is small. So I put in numbers here to show you what you need to get a sort of an order one phase. To get a sort of an order one phase. You know, you can measure a phase smaller than order one, but not a lot smaller than order one without doing many, many, many experiments. And so, this sort of highlights how hard this will be in practice. What you need is sort of large masses, so you know, macroscopic masses. You need superpositions that are sort of, you know, at least micron. And really, this is, you know, it would be better if it was a little bigger than micron. And the other thing is that you need a long time. So you need this thing to stay alive for a while. This thing to stay alive for a while. So, there were some discussions earlier in this workshop about what parameters can you push to make this better. And so, of course, it's obvious you can make a bigger mass or you could superpose it over a longer distance, but one that is also important is you could try to keep the superposition alive for a longer time. Of course, all of those things are hard. And so, you know, we have been, I and Jake, and other many people have been thinking of alternatives to this sort of experiment. This sort of experiment to see if you can get around some of these problems. So, I want to just briefly describe something we had proposed. To do it, we had to think of a sort of a different way of testing entanglement. So here, you test for the entanglement in the masses by doing a spin correlation measurement in the NV center spin. So, you can literally implement the Bell test as Bell himself wrote it down on Tuesday. Bell himself wrote it down on two state systems. So you have to do a non-local measurement, one on each diamond and so forth. So we were thinking about maybe alternatives to this that might be more robust than noise. And so this is a very formal slide. The rest of this will be really how do you implement this, but just to give the setting, and we gave this idea some name, interactive quantum information sensing. It just means time-dependent bell test, basically. So the idea is the usual setting. The idea is the usual setting is the same. So I imagine I have a bipartisan Hilbert space. And the question we're going to ask now is a dynamical question. It's not just a question about the final state per se. I'm going to ask, you know, so I imagine that there's some channel that describes a time evolution of this total system A times B. And I'm going to ask: if I put in a separable state, so some ensemble of product states, does that channel always evolve? Does that channel always evolve my state into another separable state? And if that was, if that happens, sorry, if that doesn't happen, that's the way I wrote it in the slide, then what that means is it's going to take some separable states into non-separable states, which is just another way of formalizing that entanglement is generated. So the idea is you can actually exploit the fact that you're looking at a time evolution to do something that's a little more robust in noise. The way we're going to encode. The way we're going to encode this is that there's basically going to be some operator that acts only on one system. And then, under some simple assumptions about how this time evolution works, you can prove that if there's some entanglement that you can prove basically whether or not there's entanglement generated by some evolution as read out only on a single degree of freedom. So, this isn't totally unique to us. There's a nice review by Victor Poth, which has some other similar types of witnesses. Of witnesses, but this specific one you can see described in this paper. So, just to give you a sense of what, okay, how does this actually work? So, this is actually sort of a model of the Serge-Hirosh atom in a QED cavity experiments that got them the Nobel Prize. So, you imagine I have an oscillator, some periodic system, so just a harmonic oscillator for simplicity, and I'm going to couple it to a two-level system. And here we'll choose the coupling to be just the spin Z of. Just the spin Z of the qubit coupled to the position of the oscillator. Okay, and what's sort of the scheme? So I prepare some unentangled state of the qubit and the oscillator. And then, excuse me, sorry, this really just means a beam splitter. This H and this H are different. So this H means beam splitter. This U means e to the IHT. Okay, so the idea would be: I do an interferometric experiment on just the qubit. So I prepare the qubit in zero plus one, say, I let this interaction run. Say, I let this interaction run, they get entangled, and then I, you know, I do some interferometric measurement of just the qubit population. And what will happen, it's easy to work out with this Hamiltonian, you can just exactly solve this. What will happen is as time proceeds, so in the initial state, you have no entanglement, the interaction turns on, and now the oscillator starts moving in a direction basically, conditioned on whether the qubit is up or down. And so now I prepare. And so now I prepare what I'm going to generate then is an entangled qubit oscillator state. But since it's a periodic system, what happens is I start by generating some entanglement, but then I go back to the initial state, and then I have an entangled state, and then I go back to the initial state. And so if you only look at, say, the qubit, what you'll see is oscillations which are explained by basically periodic collapse and revival of the wave function of the qubit. So at half. The qubit. So at half of a period, you know, the qubit and the oscillator are maximally in the sense of they're as entangled as they're going to get from the experiment. But then after a full period, they're unentangled. So the purity of the wave function goes back to one and just repeats. So the idea is this periodicity can actually be proved under some assumptions to necessarily require this U to be an entangling operator. So, you know, I won't show the whole proof, but I do want to say just exactly what are the assumptions. There's sort of two key points. So, the one thing you have to assume is that you have a Markovian environment. So, you're not allowed. So, we're going to just say that we believe that there's not a Maxwell's demon or some nasty experimentalist who's secretly performing classical control on one of these systems in a time-dependent way to mimic this collapse and revival. You could certainly imagine a Collapse and revivals. You could certainly imagine a noise or an experimentalist who would do that. But we're going to have to assume that there's not. So you can ask: can I prove, for example, that the noise in a system is either Markovian or Markovian enough to make this work? And that's a whole topic. But that is one of the assumptions. The other thing that's important is sometimes this is confusing. The thing you're going to measure is this is a non-Hermitian operator. So you actually have to do two sets of experiments, some where you do interferometry and sigma x. Where you do interferometry in sigma x, and some where you do it in sigma y, and you have to add these. So, this is where the sort of the Bell inequality type of setup comes in. I have to be able to measure, you know, different non-commuting observables. But nevertheless, so there's a theorem we proved in the paper, and it basically just says if you assume that there's none of this external deterministic time variation, then if you see this sign of kind of collapse and revival in the just the qubit, you can conclude that this is the channel that acts. This the channel that acts on this two two you know two body system, the qubit and the oscillator is entangled. Good. So that's quite high level and formal. Let me show you how this would actually be implemented or one way you could implement this. And this is what we're trying to do in Holger's lab now. So what you imagine now is you take an atom interferometer and you couple it to some kind of mechanical pendulum. It doesn't have to be a pendulum, you know, some kind of mechanical. It doesn't have to be a pendulum, you know, some kind of mechanical heavy oscillator. So, in the way I've drawn it here, what's going on is I literally think of this as a mechanical pendulum with some frequency. So it can swing. That's the oscillator. This pendulum you think of as being large, you know, it could be, say, a milligram and probably slow, say like a hertz. And then these little double well thing here. So this is not a fountain atom interferometer. This is Holger has this in his lab. This is Holger has this in his lab. It's an interferometer where you put a static laser field, which kind of looks like an egg carton. And then you can put the atoms in different wells. And in particular, they have very fine control over this. You can superpose an atom in one well plus another well. And in fact, you can superpose a whole cloud of atoms in one well plus another well. And even better, you can keep it there for actually quite a long time, sort of order seconds. And by keep it there, I don't mean keep it in the trap, I mean keep it coherent. Keep it there. I don't mean keep it in the tramp, I mean keep it coherently superposed for order seconds. And that's really what we're leveraging here with this proposal. So, this cartoon, the setup would exactly implement this Hamiltonian. Okay, the coupling is just some G Newton m squared kind of thing, like you would think. And the zero point motion of the oscillator shows up as a parameter here. And it's kind of cute. So, it sort of gives you a sense of how hard this is. Is. The qubit is just the atom. So it's either in this well or that well. So the sort of left-right location, like you see in Sogato's talk, for example. Good. So what's the actual protocol? So the protocol would be, I start with everything just kind of sitting there, and then I prepare the atom in a superposition of two states. So there's my little beam splitter, my Hadamard gate. Now I let these things interact rather. Now, I let these things interact gravitationally for a while. And what's going to happen? Well, the pendulum will very slightly move either to the left or the right, conditioned on where the atom is, left or right. So this is obviously an exaggerated picture here. The relative motion is extremely small. However, it's not zero. And then what you're going to do is at some point, you're going to do the inverse beam splitter and you're going to measure, say, the atom population in the up or the down state. So this is exactly the sequence. So, this is exactly the sequence of operations in that circuit I showed. And the prediction is therefore exactly what I was suggesting. What will you see? So, initially, these are an unentangled two-body system. At intermediate times, there's an entanglement. The entanglement is sort of periodic simply because the oscillator will revert back to its initial state periodically. And so, if I'm looking at just the atom, there will be a periodic decoherence and recoherence of the atom wave function. Atom wave function. So, if this was an in-person seminar, we'd stop and take questions, but I think maybe I'll just proceed. And if you have them, we'll do it at the end. Although, if anybody has a pressing question, this is a good time. I mean, this is basically how this works. All right. Can I ask? So, so the idea is the gravitational attraction between those, that superposed atom basically puts. Superposed atom basically puts the pendulum in superposition, and then these oscillations themselves oscillate. And that's a signal that gravity had to do it. Is that the idea? Correct, yeah. How heavy is this pendulum? How big is it? Yeah, so I'll show sort of some parameters that are reasonably optimum, but big, you know, not LIGO, but let's say a microgram. Okay. So, indeed, you know, it's an interesting thing. You would think, well, so what's happening? Am I really moving this thing? And this is an interesting question. So the metric that you will have to worry about is not per se how much you move it, but it's the overlap of the wave function in time. And that is, well, I'll show you the formula. But yes, that's the idea for sure. So, indeed, and indeed, so. So, indeed, and indeed, so, okay. So, if this really was what we were going to do, and we say started everything in the ground state or some very low noise state, then in fact, the signal is insanely small. It's just because, as Rob is hinting, right, you know, I'm talking about an atom and an oscillator, that the movement is not large. This is a very weak coupling. So, there's a really kind of shocking but true thing, which is that the effect can be enhanced by using a hot oscillator. Oscillator. So we didn't go looking for this. It came out of a calculation. I was trying to do a noise calculation to prove that this could never work. And then you do it nine times, you keep getting the same answer, and you realize you've actually found something. So what happens is, suppose the oscillator is actually in a state with some large occupancy. So say a thermal state, right? Everything I said before is still true. So what will happen? So now I have this thermal state. I have a very messy blob in phase space. I turn on the interaction. I turn on the interaction by superposing the atom. Now, everything in that phase space blob for the, you know, the state of the oscillator moves periodically. So at half of a period, what you get is a totally incoherent dephasing of the atom. Okay, so this V means the visibility in the atom. And what I'm showing is that there's an exponential decay. So this exponential is just a sort of usual thing. I have an overlap of two Gaussian states of the oscillator showing up here. States of the oscillator showing up here. Lambda is the coupling. This is the gravitational coupling in units of the oscillator frequency. And then this n-bar is the thermal thing. So, in fact, the atom will dephase very rapidly if there's a large thermal occupancy in the oscillator. So, you think, well, this will just destroy everything. But the amazing thing about a harmonic oscillator is it doesn't matter. Thermal state is still a periodic thing. It will go right back to where it started. And so, actually, after exactly a full period, Exactly a full period, the visibility of the atom goes back exactly to one. So, what happens is the relative size of the purity, if you want, so the probability, the visibility in the atom, it will still be one at every period, but it will be some now much lower, some bigger dip at the wells in the half period. So the oscillator will strongly dephase the atom. Strongly dephase the atom. So that makes it actually easier because what you're looking for is the difference between the bottom of this and the top. And so this actually strongly enhances the system and the signal, and it enhances it by a factor of the thermal occupancy. So that's quite remarkable. So this n-bar can be, you know, 10 to the 15 or whatever in a, say, room temperature, simple oscillator. Oscillator. There's another thing, and I think I won't belabor this too much just in the interest of time. But, you know, so one thing that is a little weaker about this than, say, the two-sphere superposition that Sogata had proposed is that the effect is actually quadratic in the small coupling naively. So that's this exponential to the negative lambda squared, right? This is G Newton squared, basically. So, you know, G Newton is bad enough. G Newton squared, you really don't want. Don't want. So, you have to think of a smarter way to do this so that you can make it at least linear. And there is a straightforward way to do that, which is to just entangle the mirror and sorry, the pendulum and the atoms at the beginning through some other interaction. So there's many ways of doing this. People do this now kind of routinely, just entangling a BEC with an oscillator. You can use a magnetic dipole coupling, for example. And so, what you can see is that what that'll do is that'll actually make. Can see is that what that'll do is that'll actually make the initial phase of entanglement much stronger. And so you can work it out. Basically, you can make the relative contrast, the thing you're looking for, the difference between the visibility at the bottom, at the maximally entangled state and the minimally entangled state. You can make it linear in the coupling at the penalty that you have to do something a little harder. So if you put these together, If you put these together, then you actually, you know, I don't want to overstate this. So if you put it together, then on paper, this looks like something that is plausible, you know, reasonably plausible. So what you find is that the sort of the relative change in the visibility, so the literal signal strength you're looking at, goes like the coupling, which is some number I put here, times this root of n-bar, where n-bar is the thermal occupancy of the oscillator. And so then you can just And so then you can just, you know, mess around with these numbers and sort of try to make it visible at order one. And what you find is that with, say, so I think here I'm using a milligram oscillator at a hertz natural frequency at room temperature. Then you sort of now with 10 to the what? I mean, you didn't mess around with these numbers, but at that kind of scale, this is not totally crazy. It's better with a slow resonator, which has its own technical. Which has its own technical difficulties, but so be it. Kind of incredibly, this is pretty robust in noise. And I want to highlight that because one of the hard things with this idea that you're going to levitate or drop microspheres is that they will decohere very rapidly due to things hitting them. With the pendulum, it's actually kind of an interesting advantage. Actually, kind of an interesting advantage. So, the displacement, as Rob was hinting at, of the oscillator is very small. And so, in fact, this state winds up being really robust to typical decoherence sources. Basically, you know, imagine a blackbody photon, you know, hits this thing or is absorbed by it. The blackbody photon's wavelength will be much longer than the scale of this sort of state here. And the blackbody photon can't measure what this mirror is doing. Is doing. So it actually can't decohere it. So, you know, that's a little hand wavy. You can actually do the calculation and it's in the paper. But we don't know every source of decoherence that would affect us yet. But the sort of obvious ones, the state is sort of protected from many of them. So, okay, that's exciting. I mean, we're excited and we're sort of digging a little bit more into the details of what are some other noises you could expect, but you know, on paper, this looks not. Could expect, but you know, on paper, this looks not totally wild. Um, okay, good. So, I that's that's what I want to say about this proposal. So, this is you know under a lot of development still. So, we wrote the first proposal and we're now thinking about sort of, like I said, more details. So, with that, I want to take off my experimental hat. And I think I have maybe like two or three minutes left. And I want to just turn to some comments on Theory implications for these kinds of experiments. So, yes, you got a couple of minutes. Perfect. I have two slides. Perfect. Good. So there's been a lot of discussion about this. What do these experiments mean? So what you're going to do is you're going to entangle two non-relativistic objects through the Newton interaction. And so, you know, you can put some words on this: like gravity is communicating quantum information, gravity is entangling it, blah, blah, blah. Okay, but what, you know, what everybody I think secretly wants this to say is that the graviton exists. And there's been a lot of interesting work trying to make that precise. So I want to just add my two cents to this sort of story. So, you know, there's a set of nice papers. You know, Alessio reviewed their paper this morning, and there's nice work by these groups also. What these all sort of say. What these all sort of say, you know, to paraphrase in a sentence, so excuse me, it's not as precise as the papers. Roughly, they say: if the Newtonian entanglement can happen, and if there wasn't something like a graviton, you're going to have some problem. You're going to violate causality, you're going to violate unitarity, you're going to signal faster than light, you know, something awful happens. And so it really begs the question: you know, is it enough? Does the graviton actually have to exist if I can do this experiment? If I can do this experiment. And I just want to point out that the answer is like no, in an almost stupid fashion, but it's almost true. So the logic from a field theory perspective would be, if it's a graviton exists, okay, what does it mean? So it means that, you know, two masses can sit around exchanging. You know, you would think of them as virtual gravitons, if you want to put it in field theory language. So it's obvious that if the graviton exists, the entanglement will be observed. But, you know, okay, so two comments. So, so one is that it is possible to prove a conditional statement of the following form. If I assume some things, so if I assume Lorentz invariance, unitarity, and microcausality, and I'd have to be a little more careful saying exactly what I mean by these, but there's a statement of this form that if you assume this, then the Newtonian entanglement requires new massless radiative bosons. So, by radiative boson, I mean not a virtual bonus. By radiative boson, I mean not a virtual one, I mean something that actually can like fly away from an experiment and have entropy and carry it away and all that stuff. You know, really like the photon flying out of my screen right now. I put a star. It actually doesn't have to be massless. I think this is something kind of overlooked in these experiments so far. These experiments are all done at sort of micron or larger scales. So actually, there's nothing in the experiment that could ever tell you if it's truly massless or if it's in fact just a light, meaning sub-micro. Meaning sub-microelectron volt actually mediated particle. So that's just a caveat. A sort of less annoying caveat is there's sort of obvious options beyond the graviton that could explain the Newton entanglement. So I just list two options here just to point it out. So the top line is how you would calculate something in the graviton model. So I have a perturbative, you know, a metric perturbation, h mu nu, that's the graviton, a couples of the stress tensor like usual. The stress tensor, like usual, and if you work out sort of the effective potential that will generate between two masses by just doing some, you know, scattering calculation, for example, you know, you get the Newton interaction in the non-relativistic limit. So meaning when all these particles, the rest energy dominates over their kinetic energies, this thing is exactly just going to give you the Newton potential. It's the Fourier transform of the Newton potential, which is just the first Born approximation given a one over R interaction. Interaction. But an almost trivial counterexample to does the graviton exist is this model. So this is a scalar graviton model. This goes back to Nordstrom and people before Einstein actually were trying to do this. So here's a concrete implementation. I have a scalar field, phi, it's massless, and it couples to the trace of the stress tensor. And you would say, well, this model sucks. You know, this, you know, this doesn't explain LIGO, blah, blah, blah. True. However, if you're just doing these tabletop. However, if you're just doing these tabletop experiments, this completely explains everything you're going to see, right? It, in fact, gives you exactly the Newton potential in the same limit. So, you know, it's kind of interesting. I mean, so the point I want to make is that I think I'll leave it on this slide. I think the point is the experiments can almost tell you that graviton exists, but the almost is kind of important. I think it deserves more thought. The almost means you. That almost means you can only make a conditional statement. So, if I really could just detect a click on a graviton detector, I would be done, right? I'd say, graviton exists, I detected one. You know, that's what I mean by the graviton exists. These experiments, what you're going to have to say is, well, I did the experiment and I assume some things like Lorentz invariance, unitarity, causality. And then I say, well, okay, then the graviton exists. And in fact, I'm saying even with those assumptions, you still have to do a little more work. You know, these models both obey unitarity, Lorentz invariance cause. Unitarity, Lorenz invariance, causality, and everything. And made it then. Perfect. You know, to rule them out, you have to invoke something beyond the Newton experiment. So you could imagine maybe doing a tabletop experiment that's somehow sensitive to the spin, or you could say, well, LIGO has seen tensor modes. And okay, you know, but you have to invoke some information beyond the Newton tabletop experiment. So, yeah, good. That's all I wanted to say. So thanks very much. Cool. Thanks very much. Cool. Thanks, Dan. That was a very interesting talk, actually. Yeah. Awesome. So we have a couple of minutes for questions and we can go into the discussion. Let me see if I can see people's questions. So Gary is saying cool experimental proposal. Any questions besides the question that Rob asked before? Yep. So that guy's faithful. So i your proposal, it seems like you have the chance to tweak a lot of different things to see that you to make sure you're getting the the signature uh. The signature, the gravitational signature, rather than coupling to something else that may not be the right thing. I mean, is that the case? Is your experiment tweakable? So if you do this experiment and then you vary various things, will you have a stronger evidence that this is really gravitational than some other source? Yeah, good. So thanks. So in our proposal, and also I think all the other ones that I'm aware of, you really have to. That I'm aware of, you really have to do some variations where you'd say, I move the masses relative to each other and do it over and over and make sure I get like, you know, a one over R law, for example, and make sure I'm not getting the Casimir course or any of the other 8 billion things that couples these objects. What I don't know how to do, and I think this is a cool question, is: could I vary something such that I would actually be sensitive to the tensor structure of the interactions? That's sort of what I'm asking. That's sort of what I'm asking here. Could I tweak something to see the difference in these couplings? And it's not obvious how to do it, actually. Well, there are some simple ways. What's not obvious is how to do it in anything remotely practical. Okay, text. Perfect. Okay, we have time, I think, for one more question. So maybe, Gary, you want to ask one? Tim, I know that you have your and Magdalena, but. And Magdalena, but yeah, let's do it. We get one question for Gavin and remember your questions and we ask them in the discussion. Yeah, okay, cool experimental proposal. Yeah, I have lots of questions, but I don't know which to ask first. So could you say like actually how big the distance is for the large mass moving? Can you put a number on it just so that you can picture it? Yeah, so I definitely make an estimate somewhere in the Estimate somewhere in the paper, but it's sort of of order, you know, if I remember correctly, it's like a proton size or so. You know, it's very microscopic. Yeah, yeah. And are the atoms ions or does Holger do it with neutral atoms? Yeah, he uses neutral atoms. So I think rubidium is a kind of an obvious choice here. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, then the more neutral, the better, because you really don't want to couple these things. Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, yeah, yeah. Yeah, well I'm gonna look at the paper.
