Alright, so I'm going to tell you about colour decline homology, SUN representations. And we're going to start off with Covano homology and SU2 representations. I think it's a very nice and pretty story. And then we'll talk about a generalization to SLN homology. And then afterwards, we'll talk about a further generalization to cover this plugin. Okay. So the story for Covano homology is for any link, I'm going to tell you a space. And so let's take an oriented link L, and then we'll consider the space of homomorphisms from the fundamental group of the link to SU2. And we're going to require that every meridian of the link is sent to a matrix which has traces here. Matrix which has traces here. So it's just some subset of all of the spaces, all of the homomorphisms from the fundamental group into SU2. And we're not quotienting by conjugation. So it's literally just a set of these homomorphisms. And on the next slide, I'll give you a very concrete model of what this thing is. But for now, I'll just tell you some examples. So for the unknot, you just get S2. And so for the unknown, What we're just doing is we're taking Z and mapping it into SU2, and the generator needs to go to a traceless matrix, and the space of traceless matrices inside of SU2 is actually just a copy of S2. For the unlink, the two-component unlink, you get just S2 times S2. For the hoplink, you now get a non-connected space. There's two components, they're both S2. And then for the trefoil, you get And then for the trefoil, you get S2 and SO3. And then there's a very nice observation from a while ago. It appears in a paper of Kronimer and Rofka, and also in a paper of Jacobson and Trudenstein from around the same time. If you just look at the two end torus Knotzer links, then the Covano homology of that link happens to coincide with this space. And you can say something about And you can say something about gratings, but for the most part, I'll just ignore gratings and just tell you that at the very least, covanophomology, where you ignore gratings, is isomorphic to the cohomology of this case. And this works for any coefficient ring in particular, what we see. And so here are the Cobano homologies of these dots and links. And just for fun, here's two more examples. More examples. Okay. So now I'm going to tell you how to think about, or one way to think about, this space, and we'll see some extra structure that arises in this space, which will allow us to enhance this observation a little bit more. So let's say you have a link diagram. And what we want to do is for every arc of the diagram, we want to pick a point. We want to pick a point on a two-sphere, and I'll call that lambda A. I'm thinking of this two-sphere as the unit two-sphere inside of bar 3. And then for every crossing, there'll be three strands that are relevant, three arcs that are relevant. And what we want is that the axis inside of R3 that goes through the point corresponding to A, the over strand, that if you look at 190. That if you look at 180-degree rotation about that axis, it should swap the points that correspond to the two lower strains. So, here's a picture. So, given a diagram, we look for configurations of points in the two-sphere which satisfy this condition, one for every crossing. And the set of all such configurations of points on S2 that satisfy these constraints. These constraints. It's just this space R2. Okay, so very concretely, if you take this diagram of the Hopflink, there's just two arcs. This crossing up here tells you that rotation about lambda A has to send lambda B to itself, which is to say it has to fix lambda B. So the only possible choices for lambda B are that it's equal to lambda. B, or is that it's equal to lambda A or it's antipodal to lambda A? So you see that there's exactly just two components of this representation space. And you can check that the other crossing doesn't add a further constraint. Okay, and then for this diagram of the trefoil, there's three arcs. So we're looking for configurations of three points on the sphere. And each of the crossings, what they tell you is that rotation about one of the Is that rotation about one of the points has to swap the other two? So, one possibility is that all three points are at the same location. Another possibility is that the three points lie on a great circle and are equidistant on that circle. Yeah? Is it that this is the same definition for the arc to like that these two arc over? So use the word tinger presentation, so for every arc you have a generator. So, for every arc, you have a generator, a marginal generator, and you know you have to send it to a traceless matrix, which you can identify with the two-sphere. So, then every crossing gives you a relation in the working-group presentation. So, it amounts to just checking that that relation given by matrix multiplication SU2 corresponds to this 180-degree rotation. Okay, and so for the trefoil, there's two components. For the trifoil, there's two components. One is where all the points are at the same location, and another is where the points are equidistant on the great circle. You can convince yourself that's SO3. Okay. So there's some more structure here than just like a space. And so one thing you can do is, given a particular arc in the diagram, which you can think of as maybe being specified by a base point on the diagram, you can define a map which goes from the representation. Find a map which goes from the representation space down to S2, which is given by just take a configuration of points in the sphere and then send it to the location of the point corresponding to your given arc. And it's a fiber bundle, and so it has a fiber, and we'll call that fiber a sort of reduced space, R2 bar. And from this picture, we also get this map from the representation space test2. Representation space test S2, which induces a map on cohomology. So you get a ring map from the cohomology of S2 to the cohomology of the representation space, and that gives the cohomology of the representation space the structure of a module over z adjoin x mod x squared. So, you know, covanohomology, then this sort of rings some bells. The covanophomology of the link, given a base point, has a base point operator which makes it into a zeo joint x mod x squared module. A zeo joint x mod x squared module. And given the base point, there's also a reduced covanum homology group. And for these 2n torus knots and links, correspondence matches up. So covanov homology of the link matches the cohomology of this representation space as modules over 0 joint x mod x squared, and the cohomology of this fiber is isomorphic to the reduced covano homology of the link. Your observation? I guess, but it's not hard to see it if you know it to look for. It's not hard to see it if you know to look for it. And in fact, this observation, not only as an isomorphism of abelian groups, but further two additional structures, it holds for rational links, for two-bridge links. So Sam LoWallen claimed this, but had an error in his argument, and so he retracted it. Argument and so he retracted it, but then Shimakovich proved the thing that he erroneously claimed. Is it possible that uh two rich ones are characterized by this phenomenon? That uh of this isomorphism? That isomorphism or that isomorphism together with the module isomorphism. Maybe. I guess I don't know. I guess, yeah, I'm not sure. Yeah, I mean, if you, so if you look at, so, so there are, yeah, so there are counterexamples, and yeah, that's a good question. I don't know. So there are alternating three-bridge counterexamples. Zenter gives many of them. He gives pretzel examples. Many of them. He gave us a pretzel example. Okay. So this fits into the story of instanton homology. And this instanton story sort of, I guess it explains it, but I think it only partially explains it. So Kronheimer and Rufka, apparently inspired by this coincidence, they defined an instanton homology using gauge group SU2 for links called I sharp, and they also defined a spectrum. Called I-sharp, and they also defined a spectral sequence from covanophthomology to I-sharp. And they used the spectral sequence to prove that covanophthomology detects the unknown. And this I sharp, this instanton invariant, it's defined by a version of Morse homology for a function that's called the Chern-Simons functional. And this representation space that I've been talking about, it arises as the set of critical points of this Chern-Simons functional. points of this transient functional. So that in particular tells you that the trans-Simons functional is not actually a Morse function. Its critical set is not discrete. So you have to actually perturb the function to do Morse homology. However, sometimes the turn-Simons functional might be Morse bot, which is to say that the critical set is a manifold and it's somehow non-degenerate in the normal direction to the critical set. In the normal direction to the critical segment. In which case, what you get is a spectral sequence from the cohomology of the representation space to the instant ontology. And so we sometimes get a relationship between the cohomology of the representation space and the instant ontology. So you don't always have the spectral sequence, but you do when the transients functional is more spot. So you can interpret the You can interpret the isomorphism between Covano homology and the cohomology of this representation space for rational links as the statement that, in fact, both of these spectral sequences exist and immediately degenerate. So for rational links, all three of these are isomorphic. Okay, so I want to talk about a generalization of this initial coincidence to Coincidence to Kavanaugh-Brzansky homology, to SLN homology, motivated by a picture like this for Kavanaugh-Brzansky homology in place of Kavanaugh homology and an SUN instanton homology in place of SU2 instanton homology. Okay, so let me tell you a little bit about SLN-link homology, also known as Kovan-Przansky homology. So there's a polynomial called the SLN-link polynomial. Called the SLN-Link polynomial, and it's a specialization of the Hong Fu polynomial, and it's determined by the Stain relation and the normalization on the unknot. And in the case that n is 2, if you look at the SL2 link polynomial, you get the Jones polynomial. And Kovano-Brzensky homology is supposed to be a categorification of this polynomial, just as Kovanov homology categorizes the Jones polynomial. So, and it's been constructed, and you can recover Kovanov homology as just SL2 Kovanov Rzansky homology. So, Kovanov and Rosansky themselves, they first gave a construction. So, given a diagram, they construct a chain complex over Q, whose homology is bigrated and categorifies the polynomial. And then it was later defined over Z. Over Z. So these authors do more, but one thing that they do is they give you a definition of SLN link homology over Z. So implicitly, I'm actually always going to be using the construction of Robert and Wagner when I describe SLN link homology. Okay, so to explain how this invariant is constructed, Kovana-Brzansky homology, the first step is to note that step is to note that, well, the first step is that this polynomial can be extended to certain trivalent graphs in the plane called MOY graphs. And MOY are Murakami, Otsuki, and Yamada. And they also define this extension of PN. And then they showed that PN then satisfies these different looking skein-like relations. So given a crossing, there's sort of now two possible orient resolutions. Orient resolutions. One is the oriented resolution, and the other is no longer an unoriented resolution, but instead it's like the unoriented resolution with an extra edge added so that you end up leaving the world of circles in the plane, and you end up in the world of trialent graphs in the plane. Okay, but then this extra edge that you had here, you label it to, you distinguish it from the other edges, and so you think of the other edges that aren't labeled to as being labeled. Other edges that aren't labeled two as being labeled by one. So that's what MOI graphs are. They're just trivalent graphs in the plane. The edges are oriented and they're labeled by one or two. Okay. So this is like the Kauffman bracket for the Jones model. Okay. So then to categorify the polynomial, what is done is that to every MOY graph, you associate some state space. Some state space. And what the state space is, is actually just a Z-graded free abelian group whose graded rank is the polynomial. So it's, as a group, as an abstract group, it has the same information as the polynomial. But what's interesting about it is that it's going to be functorial for a notion of a cobordism between these MOY graphs called phones. So this is what Robert. So, this is what Robert and Wagner, they define explicitly, they construct the state space explicitly for every MOY graph. Okay, and then the SLN chain complex of a link diagram is defined by cube of resolutions in the same way that Kibana homology is defined. So for every crossing, you have two potential resolutions. A complete resolution corresponds to a vertex of the cube, and you associate the And you associate the state space of that complete resolution to the vertex, and then for every edge of the cube, there's some foam, some cobordism that goes between the two that's constructed very locally. Take the induced map on state spaces, and that's the differential with the same science as a cobon object. And in this model, is there a similar role-playing by potential that you can kind of vary at your leisure? Yeah, there's a way to do it. Yeah, there's a way to do it where you, yeah, where you, yeah, deformed versions where you change the thing that you quotient by, or you change the potential. But I'm not going to be considering those today. Okay, so these particular foams here, they look like a merge or a split. They're basically a saddle, but you have this little extra disc that's somehow labeled two. somehow labeled two they're called the zip and unzip false okay so that's the this is the an outline of how it's constructed SLN homology now let me tell you about the relevant space of SUN representations so given a link an oriented link we're now going to look at all homomorphisms from the link group into SUN which satisfy a condition that every meridian needs to be sent to some Every meridian needs to be sent to some particular conjugacy class inside of SUN. I'm going to call that conjugacy class C1. And that conjugacy class is the class of this particular element in SUN. So you should think of it as the diagonal matrix where you have a single negative one and the rest are all ones. And then you have a little root of unity at the front, which makes this thing actually live inside of SUN. You just take the conjugacy class of this thing. You just take the conjugacy class of this thing. And in the case where n is 2, you can check that this matrix is traceless and its conjugacy class is the set of all traceless matrices. So this recovers the R2 space we were looking at before. And just like in the R2 case, when N is 2, we were able to identify, or I asserted that the space of traceless matrices was just a copy of S2. Of S2. We can actually also explicitly understand this conjugacy class. So if you take a matrix A in the conjugacy class, it's diagonalizable, and it's going to have only just two eigenspaces. It's going to have a line, which is the eigenspace corresponding to this negative one. And then the orthogonal complement of the line will be the eigenspace corresponding to all of the ones. So we have a line and an n minus one plane. And an n minus one claim that are worth talking about. And in fact, so each A determines a line, L A, inside of Cn. And conversely, if you give me a line, then I can construct a matrix A inside of here just by using this formula. So we can identify C1 with Cpn minus 1. So in the n equals 2 case, we have an identification between C1 and S2, Cp1. Okay, and so we can interpret the representation space given a link diagram as a choice of a point in Cpn minus one for each arc, and then for every crossing, you have a constraint. All right. Now let me give you a few examples. So for the unknot, you just get a copy of CPN minus one. For a two-component unlink, you get a product of two CPN minus ones. For the high, Once. For the hop link, you get something different, something interesting. So you have one component, which is a CPN minus one, and I claim that this component is sort of where the two lines, so you look at the diagram that has two arcs, so you're looking for two lines inside of Cn. This CPN minus one is where those two lines are the same line. And then this thing is where the two lines are orthogonal. So this thing is what's called a partial flag manifold. We think of it as a pair of lines inside of Cn that are orthogonal. But the data of two orthogonal lines, like ordered, two ordered orthogonal lines, is the same thing as a single line and a plane. And then the space of lines in a plane inside of Cn is what's called a partial flag manifold, denoted F12. One, two, three. Then for the trough oil, you also get two components. One is a copy of CPM minus one, and the other component happens to be the unit tangent bundle of CPM minus one. Check that the unit tangent bundle of CP1 is SO3. And then also for fun, here are two more examples. Thank you. Okay. So R2, the space of meridian traceless SU2 representations, was, to my knowledge, first studied by Shao Sung Lin in the early 90s. And then this Rn of L, this space of SUN representations I just told you about, is introduced by Kronimer and Rofka. And I'll note that Lob and Zentner and Grant studied the analogy. And Grant, they studied the analog of this representation space for MLY graphs, where you need an extra condition on what you do for meridians around edges labeled 2. And they were studying the relationship between the cohomology of this representation space and the polynomial that's associated to the MLY graph. And they show that many times they're the same, but there are also many times where they're not the same. And the story, the picture that you might expect is that there should be an SUN instant ontology for links defined by a version of Morse theory whose fun Morse theory for a function whose critical point set is just this representation space. And you'd expect spectral sequences just as before in the SU2 case. Then you might hope that, or you might get might hope that, or you might guess that for rational links, the spectral sequences exist and both degenerate, in which case the SLN homology would match the cohomology of this representation space. Okay, and I'll note that Kronov and Rufka did define an SUN instant on homology for links, but unfortunately, when n is bigger than two, they later showed that the dimension of this invariant doesn't change under cross-section sites. Doesn't change under crossing change. So it's not going to be the thing that is down here in this conjectural picture. But, I mean, it might be, it might fit into a similar picture where you look at a deformed version of Kovana-Rzenski homology, maybe like a Lie-type deformation with a spectral sequence to the currently existing SUN instantalization. All right. However, before this is However, before this is Josh, can I ask a question about this variance under crossing change? That's just a rank. Do the generators move around or they're not sure. Yeah, I think. That's across what the whole theory is in here. No, I mean, my guess is that it looks like a V homology. Like the gradings do change. But I don't actually know. So, constructing this invariant, which has these relationships to these currently existing objects, is I think an interesting project. But before doing that, a first step might be to just compare these two. I mean, if they agree, then that kind of tells you that you've got the right representation space. Okay. And so, indeed. And so, indeed, they do group. So, for 2N Taurus, not some links, at the very least, for 2N Taurus, Knots and Links. And in fact, not just the standard unreduced version, but both the reduced versions and also the analogous module structures. So, if you have a base point on a diagram, just like there's reduced Kavanaugh homology, there's a reduced SLN homology group, and you get a module structure on the unreduced homology group. On the unreduced homology group over the ring, which is just the SLN homology of the unknot, which happens to be z adjoin x mod x to the n. And a base point on the diagram determines an arc on the diagram, and we get an analogous fiber bundle. The space of SUN representations is a fiber bundle over CPN minus 1. Just call its fiber, this reduced space, and we get an indication. And we get an induced module structure on the cohomology of the representation space over the cohomology of Cpn minus 1, which is again z adjoin x mod x to the n. And this isomorphism is an isomorphism of modules and the reduced combined homology. The reduced eclipse homology coincides with the cohomology of this fiber. Is the reduced cohomology there the kernel of X or the co-kernel of X to be minus one? No, it actually not at the level of No, it actually, not at the level of homology. It's the homology of the subcomplex, which is the image of x to the n minus 1. Okay, thanks. Yeah, just like Covano homology, like reduced Covano homology is the image of the subcomplex given by the image of the base point map. Right, okay, so you could show this. Right, okay, so you could show this just by computing both sides. And the two in Taurus, knots, and links, their Kovana-Rosansky homology was computed, both reduced and unreduced was computed by Rasmussen. He did so before the version over Z was defined. So he computes it over Q, but you can use just by now standard techniques to just fully compute it. And you can also just compute the cohomology in these spaces. But I want to describe a slightly better. But I want to describe a slightly better proof where you don't just compute both sides. And it's because I want to go to colored SLN homology where it's sort of intractable to actually compute both sides. So if you've got two twists, or two crossings, and then arranged in this sort of full twist, then every crossing has two resolutions, and so you can. Two resolutions, and so you can arrange them in this square. And I'm doing, and so if you're familiar with Bar-Natan's Povanov invariant for tangles, then this is the analogous story for SL enthomology. What you can do is, it turns out that you can simplify the thing that's associated to this little local picture, and it's And it's analogous to Barnatton's de-looping. But in any case, you can simplify it. And all of these maps are explicit, so you actually know what all these maps are. And these maps here are somehow base point maps, just like in Kibana opmology, there are base point maps. Okay, but in any case, you can, there's an identity here, and you can apply Gaussian elimination to simplify the complex. So what you end up with is that. So, what you end up with is that, although a priori, the original definition of the complex associated to two crossings has four terms, you can simplify it so that it's actually just a chain. This type of simplification is pretty well known, and I think the first instance of it was due to Krasner. But what we can do now is we can close up the two left-handed points and close up the two right-handed endpoints to get a Right-handed endpoints to get a diagram of the hoplink, and we can use this simplified complex to compute the SLN homology of the hoplink. Though, if we just close up both ends, then what we get is that the complex associated to the hoplink is isomorphic to this, it's homotopy equivalent to this complex. So, over here, if we close them up, we get an unlink. Over here, we close it up, we get a theta graph, and over here, we close it up, we get a theta graph. But one thing to note is that these two maps, once you close it up, Maps, once you close it up, they're equal, so this map becomes zero. Okay, but then one thing that you can observe is that this initial complex right here, it's actually literally the complex associated to a one crossing a knot. And this object is randomized or invariant up to some grading shifts. Variant up to some grading shifts. And so, in fact, the Kovana-Brasansky homology of the trefoil, of the Hopflink, is just the state space associated to the unknot direct summed with the state space associated to this theta graph. Okay, and then the state space associated to the unknot is just the cohomology of Cpn minus 1. And it turns out that the state space associated to this theta graph is the cohomology of this flag manifold. So I mentioned before the state space, just as Before the state space, just as an abelian group, has no more information than just the polynomial. So you can just check that the polynomial matches the point-grade polynomial is panel. Okay, and right, this was the cohomology of this hot flunk, of the representation space of the hop flunk. Okay, so I want to point out that in fact these two things, the cohomology of this flag manifold and the states Flag manifold and the state space of this theta graph, although you know abstractly that they are isomorphic, you can in fact define an explicit isomorphism, explicit identification. So like this thing is an actual group which has maps in and out of it. And I want to tell you one thing about how you can choose this isomorphism. So if you look at this flag manifold and you think of it as just a pair of orthogonal lines inside of Cm. Pair of orthogonal lines inside of Cn. Then there are two special line bundles over this manifold. And the first one, over the pair of lines lambda A and lambda B, the fiber is just lambda A. And over the other, and the other line bundle, the fiber over the pair lambda A, lambda B is just lambda B itself. So these are like tautological line bundles. And you can check that the first turn classes of these two line bundles, they form a basis for the second cohomology. Second cohomology. And you can actually construct this isomorphism so that cut product with the first trend class of one of these bundles matches the dot map on one of the two edges labeled one, and cup product with the other trend class matches the dot map on the other edge labeled one. Okay, and we're going to use this when I describe how you, when we look at the trefoil. So if you took three crossings instead of just two, there's an Three crossings instead of just two, there's an analogous simplification of the complex. Here, we see the same map as before, but over here the map is slightly different because the location of the dot is in a different place. Okay, but then you can close it up and on both sides, just as we did for the hoplink to get the complex of a trefoil. This map right here vanishes once you've closed it up. This complex over here is just the complex. Complex over here is just the complex associated to a unknot with a crossing. So you can homotope it to be just the complex of an unknot with no crossings. But then what remains is going to be a complex, you have the state space of the statograph mapping to the state space of the theta graph given by this difference of dot maps. Okay, but we've now explicitly, we can identify all of these pieces with cohomologies. So the state With cohomologies. So the state space of an unknot is the cohomology of the CPN minus one. And then over here, we have the cohomology of the flag manifold mapping to itself by this wedge product with this difference of turn classes. And the representation space of the trefoil is a copy of Cpn minus 1 and the unit tangent bundle of Cpn minus 1. So what we'd like to do is we'd like to identify the homology of this complex with the cohomology of the unit tangent bundle. With the cohomology of the unit tangent bundle of CPN minus 1. And one way to do that, without actually just trying to explicitly calculate everything, is that this unit tangent bundle of Cpn minus 1, that I'm calling x, it's actually a circle bundle over this flag manifold. So this manifold is actually, it's a bundle in a bunch of different interesting ways, but one of the ways is it's a circle bundle over this flag manifold. And a circle bundle has an Euler class. A circle bundle has an Euler class. And you can calculate the Euler classes. You just do a characteristic class computation. And what you get is the difference of these turn classes. And then, associated to a sphere bundle or circle bundle, there's a Giesen exact sequence. And it takes the following form. You go from the cohomology of the base mapping to itself by wedge product with the Euler class. And the third term is the cohomology of the total space. So we've now somehow related the cohomology of this. Somehow, related the cohomology of this unit tangent bundle to the homology of this complex. And strictly speaking, what you've shown is that it's an extension of the kernel of this map by the co-kernel of this map, but you can prove that there are no extension issues. And in fact, the cohomology of X is just isomorphic to the homology of this complex. The extension issue thing goes away because these guys are supported, their cohomologies are supported in only EBITDA. Their cohomologies are supported in only even degrees. Okay, great. So that was what I was going to say about SLN homology. I explained the hoplink and the trefoil, but the rest of them are pretty similar. So colored SLN homology, it's a further generalization of SLN. It's a generalization of SLN homology. And it takes as input, it's an invariant not only of an oriented link, but this oriented link needs. But this oriented link needs extra data. And it's the data of an integer for every component. And that integer is called the label of the component. And it's a number between, it's an integer between 0 and 10. And ordinary SLN homology is just the case when all the labels are one. And this was first defined over Q using matrix factorizations by Wu, and then it was defined over Z by the same two. Over Z by the same two papers I was mentioning before. And just very briefly, the construction is pretty analogous to ordinary SLN homology, except the complexes get massive. And it's because instead of just associating to a crossing a complex which has just two terms and a single map between them, you now associate an entire row of terms and maps between adjacent ones. So for a crossing between So, for a crossing between strands label 2, you associate such a picture. And these are now more general MOY graphs, and they all have state spaces, and they have induced maps on state spaces. Okay, and if you have a crossing between strands labeled i and j, then the length of the complex is just the smaller of i and j plus one. That's sort of how many resolutions there are. But these complexes get huge. So, these complexes get huge. But you, again, you just apply a cube of resolutions. Okay, so this is sort of what it would look like if you're doing the computation for a hop flank where both are labeled two. Okay, and then there's a corresponding space of SUN representations that you can consider. And what you do now is just every meridian of a component labeled k, you send it to a different, a particular conjugacy class. A particular conjugacy class that depends on the row. That's how I'm using the labels of the link. I'm using that to prescribe where row the representation sends in. And this conjugacy class, depending on the label k, it's just, again, a diagonal matrix where instead of a single negative one, you have k negative ones, and then the rest are all positive ones. And then you have a root of unity, the same one from before, but now raised to the power of k. And just that. And just as before, you can explicitly understand this conjugacy class. You can identify it with the Grassvannion of K-planes inside of Cn just by sending a matrix to a particular eigenstate. Okay, so very quickly I'll just tell you some examples. For the Hopflink label two, if you look at R four, this is sort of the first case where it's not a projective space, the first Grassmannian, the first genuine Grassmannian. Rosmanian, which is genuine Rosmanian. Its space of representations has three components that looks like that. For the Hoplink label 2,2, but its SUN representations, it generalizes to this. And then you can actually just explicitly calculate what it is for a Hoplink with any labels using the fact that commuting matrices, commuting unitary matrices, are simultaneously diagonalizable. Okay, and then just for fun, a more complicated example is the trepfoyle label 2. It says U4 representations. There's three components, and they're all homogeneous spaces for the unitary group U4. Okay, so again, you can ask, is the cohomology of this space isomorphic to the colored SLN homology? But the first trouble you run into is that actually, there are almost no computations of colored SLN homology. Of color decimal antology. So you can compute it for the unknown. It's sort of baked into the theory what it is for the unknot. And for the unknown labeled K, you get the cohomology of the Grassmannian GKN. And so you can use this to get it for the unlink with any labels. For the hoplink labeled one and some other label, this was computed over Q by Yonezawa. And for the hoplink with any labels, there were computations. This was, there were computations from physics over Q that were given before there were even constructions of the Colorado animal. And I think that's it. I think these are all the computations. And if you look for links where all the labels are bigger than one, I think only the unlink appears in the literature. But I'll point out that one of the reasons is just that the complex is huge. So if you have the hoplink labeled i and j, then there's i plus 1 squared. And j, then there's i plus 1 squared terms. And the size of the terms increases as n increases. Okay, but a work in progress is that, in fact, the color decision homology of the hoplink coincides with the cohomology of this space. And so this, in particular, gives you a computation of the color decision homology of the hoplink. And just as before, module structures and the reduced theories occur. Also, occur. And this isomorphism holds over Z. And the way that I show that these two are the same actually lets you say something about the bigratings. And I'll just mention that the colored SL etymology of top link is supported only in even homological degrees, and there turns out to be no torsion at all. Okay, and I'm currently right now thinking about. I'm currently right now thinking about the trefoil, and I expect that it actually will work out. But the trefoil, it's going to have torsion. It's always going to have torsion. So it's going to be, it's kind of a more trivial fact that they might agree. Okay, so I just wanted to briefly explain how you show that these two are the same. And if we just look at this particular example of the Hoflink labeled 2 and 2, Of the Hoflink labeled 2 and 2, one thing I want to do is I want to actually open up only one of the crossings. I don't want to open up both of the crossings and get this huge thing. I just want to look at what happens if I open up one of the crossings. So each one of these three terms is a chain complex, and there are maps between them, so that the whole thing is a chain complex. And there's an observation, I guess you could call it a topological observation, which is that each Observation, which is that each one of these sort of MOY graphs, but knotted in space, if you just think of this as a trivalent graph, it's actually isotopic to a planar one. So this is isotopic to just the planar unknot. This one happens to also be isotopic to a planar thing, and this one's also isotopic to a planar thing. And you can do so in such a way that you can isotope it using just standard moves, like Reidemeister moves for these graphs. Reitermeister moves for these graphs, so that the complex, all that happens is that it just shifts gradings. But in fact, you can show that this complex is homotopy equivalent to the complex of the planar version, this complex is homotopy equivalent to this planar version, and similarly over here. But you do so, as you do that, you pick up some grading shifts, and these are the gradings that you end up getting. And if you just replace. And if you just replace some sort of these complexes with homotopy equivalent ones, you expect that there's going to be maps that still remain here and also like longer maps. So in general, you're going to have these short maps here and a longer map here. But these objects no longer have a differential, and they're concentrated in even homological degrees, so there's actually no differential at all. So you just find that the color destel line homology of the hoplink. Color desteline homology. The hop link is just the direct sum of these three things. And then you can show that, in fact, they just match the colomology of the different components of the representation space. The same thing works with any two colors. Okay, so that's all I wanted to say. Thanks very much. Anything else you forgot about? Forgot about? Well, that's the obvious question. If you go back a couple slides, is there potentially an identification between the color SLN link homology for two bridge knots with the homology of the representation, so to speak? I mean, I guess so, but there are just so few computations known that I have no evidence other than just. That I have no evidence other than just naive belief. Optimism. Yeah. Supports that conjecture. So, can you see Bargen Lyd? Oh. Maybe. But I don't I don't think I have anything intelligence here right now. I don't think I have anything intelligent to say right now. But I mean like if you fix the labels but then let n go to infinity, like it I think maybe I forget exactly who, but somebody showed that it converges to a thing called colored Humphrey and Bulge. Well, okay, yeah, if you might want to put in an affinity Okay, yeah, if you might, you might want to put in an affinity here. I thought briefly about that, but it gets a little wonky. Because, like, at one point you have a unit tangent, you have a unit tangent sphere. And if you have instead of a finite sphere an infinite dimensional sphere, it's contractible, so it somehow actually doesn't match. Yeah, thanks for the great talk. There is another arrangement of eigenvalues which would be interesting. Eigenvalues, which would be interesting to consider, at least from the perspective of incentive etymology, the higher end case. So, like, you can consider the case that let's say you're working with odd n and on the diagonal entries you have, you know, let's take n squared of unity and you have one omega omega square up to omega to the n minus one where omega is the n squared of unity. Right, right. Right, right. So this is supposed to be the version which is unlike this, you know, at least you know, the instanton theory and the eigen eigenvalues that you considered are you would get a trivial invariant, whereas in this case you would get an interesting, potentially interesting invariant. Do you know if there is a combinatorial analog for that? But you said you would get a trivial invariant? Okay, alright, so if I'm understanding you correctly, you're talking about the representation varieties that show up for the sutured, like sutured SUM instant ontology. That's right. And can you repeat your question about that then? What is the combinator? Is there any combinatorial how about that? I don't know. I mean, I would be interested to know if... I mean, I would be interested to know if the reduced representation spaces that I've been talking about, if that's somehow related to those representation spaces. Because for the SU2 case, I natural matches the sutured instant on homology. But I don't know any direct I I haven't thought about it, but I don't I don't know. So you are you saying we want to use the same eigenvalues as the ones that you considered here? As the one that you can see right here? Well, I'm just saying that I'm aware that for the suture theory for SUN, you have a different representation space. And I think, and I would like to know how these are related, and I don't know how they're related. And I also don't know a combinatorial counterpart for those representation spaces. But I haven't thought about it. There's a question from you, also maybe from Michael Willis. Take the limit of N in the other direction. So let's just take SU2 representations, and you just add more and more twists, right? In the hybrid homology side, there's sort of this limiting object. Do you have any sense of what the representation space, like what space? Space, like what spaces would that object be the representation space of, theoretically? Like the limiting object? Yeah. Obviously, it's not like pi one of something I can actually think. Here, oh sorry, I don't believe that. When you only have these two strands, right, all of the groups and also the representation series are all just sums, right? Like like somehow the complex looks periodic and so you're just keeping copies of the same thing perhaps. Keeping copies of the same thing over and over. I would assume the representation space is also just sort of this gives you that simplification that you show homology just sort of in the Kvon Krzanski Michaelski I mean the microscope is a micro structure as well. So I have a question, which is also about some kind of um but there's this notion of representation stability. Notion of representation stability months ago in mathematics. And as far as I know, there hasn't been really much about representation stability in these link homology theories. So one thing you could do is you could take a knot and look at n cables of the knot as n grows. And these admit, I think, SN representation. Local bottom homology groups, for example, admit SN representations. And you can ask, is there stability in this associated? Is there stability in those associated Young diagrams? But you could also ask the analogous question of the cohomologies of the representation spaces. Maybe somehow that's a more tractable question. Maybe. If you leave rational links and you go to just general links, then the spaces become, they might be singular. And so the cohomologies become. Yeah, and so the chromologies become a little harder to work with. But yeah, that's interesting. Maybe we should take a break and say further discussion. First, I think Joshua put on Joshua.
