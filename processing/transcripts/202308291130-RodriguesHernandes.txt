And thanks the organizers for this very important opportunity. Thank you very much. I would like to talk about a recent work with Maria PÃ©ricida Suades Vuas in this work with the plan. The class of a class of maps from CN2CP. And our focus of a very special ingredient or tool in this study is the variant called the out invariant that for a class of maps that's fine determined when p is greater than 2n, this Greater than 2n, this invariant characterizes find the term map jars. So, in particular, with this invariant, it was important to classify. We obtain the classifications of some fine-determined monomial map germs for some pairs N and P. And in general, what we have is a general form of form of any map of find the term the monomial map germ of any correct but this is we we talk about today okay we start with some notations uh for me on the note the some classical notators in similarity theory o n is the local ring of nutrient germs in cn at the orange NCN at the origin. This local range, we denote the Machambau ideal by Mn. Our class of maps that we are interested to study is map germs from CNGCP, as moot map germs that are denoted by this model, OM model, and NONP. And we study maps with respect to the A equivalents. Respect to the A equivalence. That's the classical mother group of diffeomorphism R times L, where R are the group of diffeomorphism to the origin from Cn0 to CN0, and L is the diffeomorphism to the target from Cp to Cp. So, and we say that two map germs are equivalent. Are equivalent if there exists a pair of elements in the group A satisfying that G is K composed with F composed with H minus 1. So these are the objects that we use in this talk. And with respect to the delta invariant, this is a very well known invariant in the study of curves. In the study of curves. For example, for parametrized curves in Cp, delta is defined as this co-dimension, the dimension of the local ring O1 over the pullback of OP. This notation phi star OP is we take an element in this local ring, OP, and we compose. Here we have a mistake. Here we have a mistake. Here is the composition with phi, not with F, is A composed with phi. And this dimension is the same that O1 is isomorphic to the power service wing in the variable T, and Phi star OP is isomorphic to the power series in the components of the curve. Of the curve. Well, and what the hypothesis over our map said that this invariant is finite. So in this case, it's easy to identify if the map is finite, is delta is finite or not, because when we look at the components of the curve, if this parametrization is primitive. Is primitive, and we call it primitive means that the greatest common divisor of the exponents of all components of phi is equal to one. With this property, delta is finite. And it's classical that for irreducible plane curves, we have the classical relation that the Mueller number is 2 delta. So it's a well-known invariant. So it is a well-known invariant in the theory of curves. And another way to compute this invariance, we can compute algebraically in terms of another object associated to the curve that is the same group associated to the curve. If you take, you consider all power series ring. Power series ring composed with the parameterization. We have a series in the variable t. If you take the orders, the set of orders are a semigroup of the natural numbers, and this semi-group is finitely generated. If the parameterization is primitive, the number of elements that not belong to the semi-group is finite and the And these elements that not belong to the semi-group are called the gaps of the semi-group. And delta is precisely the number of gaps of the semi group. For example, we have here a curved C3. The semicroup generated by phi associated to the map phi is generated by 4, 6, and 11. The natural numbers that not belong to the semi group are these: one, two, three, five, seven, nine, and thirteen. We have seven elements. So delta is precisely the number of gaps, seven. Okay, this the definition of delta as this co-dimension, we cannot return in general maps from. In general, maps from CNCP. If you consider a map from CNCP with n less than p, such the components of f is f1, fp. So delta we can actually to extend definition. Delta of f is the dimension of the local ring o n portion by f star op that's precisely this. That's precisely the dimension of the over G power series ring in X1, XN over this C vector space, the dimension of this vector space. Okay, but what properties of F guarantee that delta is finite? Well, if f is alpha determiner, delta is finite. We see these two eatings, two and three. We give more details in the next part, but it's possible to see the F delta with this definition, delta is exactly the L equal dimension. The L equal dimension 1p1 over p times L equal dimension. So if f is alpha determinant, we know that the L equal dimension is finite, so delta is finite. But we're not studying maps with respect to the equivalence L, but we want to study with respect to the group A. And here, if we restrict to P greater than 2n, delta. Than 2n, delta is invariant with respect to the group A, and delta characterizes a finite term map journal. So now we study maps where P is greater than to N. But what a definition of fine-determined map terms? Where we say that a map is fine-determined if is A. If is a equivalent to its kz to power C L polynomial Taylor polynomial of degree K so this is a very interesting class in similarity theory studied by many authors because has a very good properties and there are some classical results to to characterize finite determinism. Characterize finite determinacy. That's the matter graph, the geometric criteria, and the infinitesimal criterion. And we show the books theorems that we apply, we use, we consider here the Maragaff name for the special case when p is greater than 2n. And with this hypothesis, if a map is from Cn to Cp for P greater than 2n, F is a finite if and only if zero is an isolate singularity. There exists a neighborhood that the origins of zero is an isolate singularity, but it's not sufficient. F is necessary that F restrict to. That f restrict to this neighborhood outside the zero f is one-to-one. With these two hypotheses, we know we characterize finite determinant map germs from where p is greater than 2n. For example, these map germs for surface C4 is not a finite because by geometric criterion, Criterion, we have zero is an isolate similarity, it is easy to see analyzing the Jacobian matrix of F, but the second hypothesis is not satisfied because f is not one to one outside zero. F minus x0 is equal to f x0 for all x difference is zero. Okay. Okay. The another important theorem for finite deterrence is the infinitesimal criterion. There's a criterion, algebraic criterion, where the characterization of finite maps is given in terms of some invariance. And here we say that f is a finite if and only if the equal dimension. The equidimension is finite. The equidimension of the extended tangent space that here we define using a notation, matrix notation, is the set of the Jacobian matrix times any element, any vector field where epsilon i is an element in O n, plus another matrix where in each component we have In each component, we have an element of OP composed with the map F. It's not easy to compute the eco-dimension. It's so complicated. Imagine that we need to consider any vector field, any function epsilon i, any at the j, and we want to decide if this quotient is finite or not. It's not easy to compute, but But the delta invariant for class when we study maps where p is greater than 2n, the delta invariant, it's easier to be compute and characterize these maps that are maps that have the property to be a finite because delta is given in terms of the L equal dimension. Terms of the L eco dimension. And this result is known as the result of Gafflin that says that if F satisfied that P is greater than 2m, finite determines with respect to the group A is equivalent to finite determines with respect to the group L. So if A If F is a finite, by infinitesimal criterion, A equidimension is finite, by this result of Gaffney, L equidimension is finite. So delta that peak off is L equal dimension is peak office of delta. So delta is finite. And delta is much simpler to compute than. Simply to compute then the equal dimension. So it's a good invariant when we study maps where p is greater than 2n. Okay. But we have a so general question. If we fix the pair of dimensions n and p, the question is, is it possible to characterize all map germs that are afinite? That are a finite? Of course, it's a very general question, but for curves, yes, they say yes. If n is equal to one, find the term checks, map germs if the parameterization is primitive. In particular, we have the delta is finite, but it's not necessary in this case to compute the delta. We know that this map is a finite if F is a finite if each component, the great component of the exponent of all components of f is equal to one. It's okay, we look at the prioritization, we know that this map is a finite. But in general, it's not so simple. And we to study this problem, we restrict to the case of monomial maps. Of monomial maps. It's a very good class. Perhaps it's the one first class when we study maps to investigate because it's more simple. In this case, monomial maps are pasomogeneous. For example, it's interesting to say monomial maps, for example, because when we consider a variety parametrized by this map, we have a toric variety. We have a torque varite because a torque varite defined by an idea that is generated by binomials and in which the ideal is prime. This parametrization, if you have a binomial ideal, the parametrization is a monomial map. So it's a very good, a very interesting class to study. For example, Sigenia. Sijin, Thais Daubelle, and myself, we studied properties of historic varieties parametrized by monomial maps. So I think that's a good class to study. Okay, so now we study, in these two works, we have some properties of class of monomial maps. Monomial maps. And in order to characterize, finally determine monomial maps where in this case, from C2 to C4, a parameterized surface in C4 in a here in this last work, okay. Okay, so if you look to a surface, a monomial surface in Cp, we have F is parametrized by these monomers. And in this first work, we prove that if you have a surface, a monomial surface in C4. In C4, a map germ is afinite if and only if we have only two class two classes, inertia, or this parametrized curve is given to this way. X, we have a plane curve individual y, and the other monomer is x lambda y. x lambda y. And in order to prove this theorem, we use essentially the information that the invariant delta is finite. Okay, for surface in C4, okay, we classify completely. If we consider, for example, a surface in C5, A surface in C5, for instance. Well, so now we don't have, we have in this case more classes. A parametrized monomial surface in C5 is a finite, a finite determined if and only if is equivalent to we divide in terms of the current. If F has correct one, we have an immersion. We have an immersion or current one means that we have one, it's possible to consider change of coordinates that one component is x. Okay, the one component is x because f has con. We can have a curve in the variable y in c3, and we don't have any other possibility in this case that the possibility in this case that the last monomial is x lambda y or we can have a plane curve in the variable y so if you have a plane curve the next two components can be x lambda zero x lambda y zero or x lambda y and here any any other monomial and if f has cohunct two we don't have and we have only one possibility that Possibility that a plane curves in the variable X and in the variable Y and the less components X Y. So, and of course, if you have, if we embed this surface in a higher dimension, we have the possibilities to parametrizations can be more, but it's possible to describe. Describe another class that perhaps generalizes the surface in C4 is the class Cn to C2N. The behavior of Cn to C2N is similar to C2 to C4. We don't have a lot of classes of a finite maps, monomial a finite maps. If F is If F is from Cn to C to N, monomial, F is a finite if and only if is equivalent to these two classes, or again, is an inertia, or we here we denote the variables in Cn, X1, Xn minus 1, in the last variable we denote by Y. Not by y. So we have a current one map. This map is current one. So the first two components is x1, xn minus 1. And we have a plane curve in the variable y. And the other components, we need to have these pairs of monomers. xi, x1, lambda 1, y, xn minus 1, lambda n minus 1, y. This is all classes, all monumental classes. All the number classes of maps in this pair of dimensions end to n, that is a finite. And for any pair, any fixed pair, any p, we can classify. According to the hypothesis that we have, the answer is yes. We can have a lot of classes, but perhaps we can classify, for example. We can classify. For example, what the hypothesis we can put in order to obtain all classes of that is monomial and a finite. For example, we fix the n in dimension equals to where k is Where k is the number of components. My hypothesis is that f has S component when parametrized curve in CK is this. K means my hypothesis F is a singular monomial map satisfying that F zero y is this, we have a curve as components, a curve in C k. A curve in CK has components. So, with this hypothesis, with this dimension, the hypothesis that F is monomial and has a curve in CK as component, we don't have a lot of possibilities. F is a finite if and only if we have a corrangular map as a generalization of the first, the previous result. We have an identity here. A identity here, a plane curve, and these monomials. Here we have the same identity in Cn minus one, a curve in CK, and the other monomials are given to this way. So according to the hypothesis that we include, we can describe completely monomial finite maps. This is the idea. And more And more than to study monomial maps. When we start studying monomial maps, as consequence, we retain any deformation of this map, we can obtain other classes of non-monomial classes that is a finite. For example, it's not necessary in this result we have a monomial curve. Curve. Any curve that we consider here, if this curve is Z finite, this map is fine determined. So as consequence, this map that's here we have, any parametrized curve in CK, this map is find it. So when we start studying monomial maps, we obtain a lot of classes that Of classes that's non-monomic, for example, in this map from C3 to C7. This curve is not trivial map. We have a curve in C3. This map is infinite because the delta invariant of this map is finite. Well, well and all this construction motivates one cd and i to try to put these classes in a general structure in the same question if we have two maps x f and g and suppose that f depends of some Depends of some variables x1, xn, and g depends of variable g1 gy. It's possible to retain a new map such that if f is component of this map, g is a component of this map, there exists eight such that the mixture of these two variables, x and y. f and g, the variables are independent. G, the variables are independent. There exists a map, H, that mixture these two variables with the property that this new map is afinite. Because was this what we done before? More precisely, we define an operation that we call the joint operation. We have a map from CN to CP1, another Another map G from CM to CP2. And the operation is: we can put F and G together by we join F and G by the map H. The variables of F are independent of the variables of G, but H mixes these two variables. Our purpose is to decide for which map H this map is a fine. map H, this map is a finite. And of course, this definition, the joint definition, the joint operation can be extended to a finite number of maps. Join F1 FR means to consider a map that F1FR are components with eight. This is a new map. This operation is well defined and we respond. It's well defined with respect to the equivalence. If F is a equivalent to F tilde and G is equivalent to G tilde, the joint operation F and G are A equivalent to F tilde G tilde. And notes that all classes that we construct before has the same. The same property. For example, this map that we present, we have a joint. This map is a finite, is a join the identity in the verbs x1, xn minus 1 with a curve. Join, we put the identity and a curve and And the map that we construct when we join these two maps, we construct a new map that is a finite with eight. If we choose eight to this way, this map is a finite. And all this map that we present are has this configuration. But okay, but in the next example, we join. The next example, we join identity in one curve. Here we have a map, surface is six. And here we have two curves, a curve in the variable X, a curve in the variable Y, a plane curve. And we join these two curves with this map H that is from C2 to C2. From C2 to C2 given by X2, Y, Y, X3. This map in C6, this surface in C6 is fine-determined, has current one, and it's not necessarily one condition about, it's not a particular property of these curves. More generally, if you consider a plane curve, A plane curve in the variable X, a plane curve in the variable Y. And these two monomules, I know that this map is a finite. We prove that this map is a finite. It's important to put one mix the variables X and Y, but with a power of one variable with the other of degree one, one of degree and one. One of the three and one move the other with any power. So we not only join identity with one curve, we can consider join operation with two curves, not necessarily plane curves. If you have, we prove that if you have one curve in the other curve in Curve in independent variables with map we put here in order to have an a finite map. Look that we are process, we construct a finite maps. We give a process that we construct a lot of classes of monomial map, not necessarily monomial maps, but a finite maps. So I So, let me give an answer to this question. This question is: we have two curves, and we want to know what is the map eight such that this new map is a finite. So, the map eight is a generalization of the constructor that we done in this example. We put mixed two. Mixed two products of two variables, mixed the variables y1 and y2. Or more general, if you have n curves and we want to construct a joint map where we have a new map that in each component we have each curve. Each curve for each map H, this map is a finite. Well, I have one choice. Of course, there are a lot of possibilities, but one possibility is consider products of mix the variable of one curve with all variable of the other curves. value of the other curves to this way. If you fix y1, we consider a power of y1 product with all other variables of degree one, and so on. The next last variable, yn, we consider a power of yn with the other variables of the realm is in a class. A class where we prove that this map is a finite, is a correct and a finite map. We don't need that these maps are these curves. Sorry, we don't put the hypothesis that these curves are monomials. Any curves when we join if this map 8, this map is a finite. Here we have two examples. It's a very, this map is very big. So it's from C3 to C13. These two maps are currently. The first one is a finite, the second not. We put the almost the same components. Same components we have a curve in the variable x x 5 x 6 another curve is the variable y we choose a curve in c4 in z we we put again a plane curve and here we put mixed variables x power of x with y power of x with z power of y with z etc but here the difference But here the difference is that this one only. Here we consider xz, here we consider xyz. And this is the problem that g is not a finite because we cannot obtain x, any power of x with z of the real one in g star o 13. That is, we cannot have. That is, we cannot obtain this element using the components of the map G. Look, that the only possibility to obtain Z of degree one is in this monomial or in this monomial, but product with X we cannot obtain because here is X Y Z has the variable Y and in this company we have Y 2Z so So with this characterization, we can look the map, monomial map, and we know that if this map is a finite or not. So I think that's an interesting. So, well, with all these examples that we present, what is the general form of a monomial? Of a monomial, a monomial map germ from Cn to Cp of any corrupt with the property that the map is A finite and monogamous. So in this theorem, we have a general form with all these properties, A finite. The map is A finite, is monomial and has current key. Has current key. What the general form of this map? Well, f is a finite if and only if is a equivalent to. If the map, if the quarant is key, we have an identity in n minus q variables. It's classical. It's well known. Of course, more. Moreover, for the first components is an identity. In the other variables, y1, y key, because we have n variables. N minus q variables is identity. In the other k variables, we have a parametrized curve in each variables. Parametrized curve in y1, parametrized curve in yq. The math H The map H that becomes this map, a fin determined, one choice is a general form is to mixture the variables X with the variables Y. Consider a power of X with all variables of Y and a product of powers of Y with the other variables Y. And here we are free. in here we are free we are free to choose what do you want with this the first components and this first comp and these components we guarantee that this map is a finite after that if the dimension p is sufficient great we can consider any other map any other monomulous i'd like to say so this is a general So, this is a general form of a monomial map. Find the term. And the natural question is, if we characterize a finite monomial maps for P greater than 2n, is natural to ask if we can obtain. We can obtain a similar result when p is greater than n, but less than 2n. If p is n plus 1 until 2n minus 1, we can describe nominal maps in this class of in this with this choice of p I don't know because in this case. Because, in this case, for us, it was very important the delta invariant because we use a lot of objects. We use the semi-group of our curves, the description of the semi-group. We use the delta invariant is finite. And in this case, delta is not a maps finite determinant. maps finite determinant with respect to the group a not implies that delta is finite the equidimension s was delta no we don't we don't have the similar analysis but we believe that the all the the only monomial classes from Cn to C P less than 2n is these stable maps. These stable maps that an immersion, or these maps that's a kind of generalization of a cross-cut. Sorry. I don't know to prove this result, but we believe that we don't have any other class of maps. Plus of maps in these dimensions that is monomial in finite determin and to finish, we say quickly about how to compute since delta is an invariant that was interesting or was important in our study. In our study, how we can compute this invariant? Well, only we say that before that for parametrized curves, delta can be computed as these dimensions or with respect computing the gaps of the cell group. So, delta is in fact the number of The number of elements that do not belong to the same group. It's a classical formula for plane curves, monomial plane curves, is this delta is n minus 1, n minus 1 over 2. Is the Mueller number over 2? But for surfaces in C4, we have a formula. We have a formula. If n is n k plus 1, so delta is precisely given to this way, is lambda n squared minus 1 over 6k. And if n is n k plus n minus 1, we have the same here plus the other part. In general, for any In general, for any lambda n and m, what we have is a formula that is similar to the parametrized curve. For parametrized curve, delta is the cardinality of the gaps of the curve. Sorry, the gaps of the same group associated to the curve. For monomial surfaces, we prove Cg and I. CG and I prove that we can compute delta invariant in terms of the gaps of the same group to this curve. Or precisely, if we have a map that we classified before, monomial map given by x, x lambda y, y n. Ym, the semi-group of the curve is generated by NNM. Generated by N and M, the delta invariant can be computed in terms of the delta of the curve and the cardinalities of gaps, but not all gaps. The gaps satisfy the following problem. We illustrate with the example that it's easier than to explain details of this formula. Explain details of this formula. The idea is we have this surface in C4, for example. The parameterized curve is generated, the same group associated to the curve is generated by 5 and 12. The delta of the curve, the number of elements, delta is the number of gaps of the same group. These are the gaps of the same group. The elements that we cannot obtain by the semi group 5 and 12. By the semi-group 5 and 12. Delta of this curve is 22. To compute the delta of F, we look to the gaps of the curve, Y5, Y12, which gaps we can write as an element of the semi-group plus one. We eliminate We eliminate these gaps and LS the elements of gamma minus one, we collect this set. For instance, one is an element in gamma plus one. Six is five plus one. So all these elements we eliminate. We consider only the gaps that we cannot write at an element of gamma plus one. Of gamma plus one. So on. We look again to the set of gaps, and with gaps, we cannot write as an element of gamma plus one and two, and so on. And we compute the cardinality of these sets. Delta is lambda copies of delta of the curve plus the sum of all these cardinalities. All these coordinates we proved this in the first work that we present, and it's a formula that is similar to the we compute here. Delta, of course, more simple. Delta of the curve is the cardinality of L. Delta of this surface can be obtained in terms of the gaps of the curve, this particular curve, but with specific properties. Specific heap products. And we have a student called Wellington. And Wellta and I are describing an algorithm to compute for monomial surfaces in C4, an algorithm to compute delta that and we not necessarily don't Not necessarily, we don't need to compute all gaps of the same group. With this algorithm, we can describe the delta using the information that lambda and nm. Well, I think it's so what we can say more is that we can compute another invariant that we not present here, that, for example. The variants like the number of double points. We have a formula we relate delta with the number of double points, but we're not present here, not in this talk. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much, Maria Elenis. Thank you for a nice talk. Questions? Have you looked at some of the deformations? Well, thank you for your questions. If you have a fixed part, a monomial part, and you consider a deformation of sufficient degree with convenient filtration. The delta invariant is an upper semi-continuum invariant. So we will be doing new classes of a finite maps. And because delta is an upper semi-continuum invariant. Continuous invariant. I don't know what more information about the deformation. We know that if you consider families of these maps, delta is not a topological invariant with respect to topological triviality. Did some of what we know about the deformation and about the About the deformation, about the families. It's in high dimensions, but there might be some nice pictures. Nice pictures. Related to the deformations and singularities and all that. Yeah, we noticed that very much of the The behavior of these elements when we consider deformation only with respect to if this invariant of not these classes in general, but we obtain as a deformation other classes that we know that preserve the property that we are interested in here, that it's finite determined, but not explore very much the notion of deformations. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Another question? Are there more questions? Just a remark. Yes, just a remark. Thank you, Elenisi, for the nice talk. Thank you. So just a comment for Santiago. When P is equal to 2n, the deformation have double points, right? And if P is good. And if P is greater than 2N, then the formations are smooth. But as Elenisi said in the beginning of the talk, I would like also to remark that it's very much possible that this classification is the classification of all Tauric varieties with isolated singularity and smooth normalization. Smooth normalization, right? So, and we are working on this, okay. Thank you. Any other question? Are there any? Okay, we thank you very much. Thank you.
