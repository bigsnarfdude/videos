Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Okay, perfect. Okay, good afternoon, everybody. I would like to thank the organizers for the invitation to participate in this workshop. I hope everybody is safe and healthy. Today we had a power outage in Halifax. So, if I disappear, so it won't be for long. So, don't be alarmed. Okay. Okay. Today I will talk about some results. So I will review some results that some of them already old, some of them are not so old. So these are contributions to the Hamilton giant. So these are contributions to the Hamilton-Jacobit theory of separation of variables that extensively utilize the moving frame method, which also manifests itself in this context quite prominently. So most of the results I will be reporting today are obtained on pseudo-Remanian manifolds of constant curvature. So this is outline and let's proceed. And let's proceed. First, I would like to say a few words about the Hamilton-Jacobi theory. So, let we have a Sudo-Riemannian space of constant curvature, consider a natural Hamiltonian given by the formula one with respect to the canonical plus one by vector. Then, such a Hamiltonian system can be integrated by quadratures, as well known, by finding a complete. As well, known by finding a complete integral of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Normally, solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation given by two is based on finding a canonical transformation to separable coordinates. So, we wish to find a transformation from the physical position momenta coordinates to new coordinates with respect to which the equation can be solved under the additive separation and ZATS and the non-degeneracy condition. And the non-degeneracy condition was integral w. Then, orthogonal separation of variables occurs when first such a transformation is canonical, it preserves a Poisson structure and it's a point transformation. And in such orthogonal coordinates, of course, the metric is diagonal. So, the main problem can be formulated as follows. So, to determine all of the So to determine all of the inequivalent, first we wish to determine all of the inequivalent in some sense coordinate systems that afford orthogonal separation of the in the associate Hamilton-Jacobi equation, if such transformation to separable coordinates exist. Then we wish to characterize intrinsically the coordinate system found above. And finally, we wish to determine explicitly the corresponding coordinate transformation from the physical coordinates. Physical coordinates, physical position momentum coordinates to the coordinates of separation. So it is very convenient to set the problem using the language of the so-called Killing tensors. So let's define a Killing tensor of valence P on a pseudo-Remaining manifold as symmetric tensor of valence P0 satisfying the Killing tensor equation. So the Killing tensor equation So the killing tensor equation we give in terms of the scout and bracket because we wish to keep everything contravariant. So when p is equal to one, then we just get the usual killing vectors. So the Scoutin bracket is a bilinear real operator. So the set of all killing tensor values beyond n then follow, sorry, defines a vector space and its maximum dimension. And its maximum dimension is given by this Delong-Takuchi-Thompson Eastwood formula. And this is an upper bound for the dimension of the vector space of killing tensors. If we are in space of constant curvature, then this is the actual dimension. So then the dimension of the vector space of killing tensors available in sp is maximum. So for example, when p is equal to 2, n is equal to 2, the dimension is Two the dimension is six if p equal to two and m equal to three, then the dimension of the Killing tensor valence two is equal to twenty. So there is a natural connection with the Hamiltonian mechanics. So indeed we can consider functions on the cotangent bundle which are quadratic in the momentum, right, given by four. Then such a function is a first integral, right, for the corresponding geodesic Hamiltonian system. Hamiltonian system if the function chi Aj above are the components of a killing tensor. Okay, so the first result that I would like to mention is due to Eisenhardt, who proved that a Hamiltonian system given by one, in the case when there is no potential, is orthogonally separable if and only if it admits n minus one functionally independent first interplay. Minus one functionally independent first interpolation motion such that all of the corresponding Killing tensor values to have real and pointwise simple almost everywhere eigenvalues and the eigenvectors or eigenforms of these Killing two tensors are normal or surface forming and see the Killing II tensors defined defined by the n minus first n minus one first integrals have the same eigenvectors so in this case we get a pencil of killing tensors Pencil of killing tensors, and together with the metrics, they generate n-dimensional vector subspace of the total vector space of killing tensors on M. So then we have the following, that the generic killing tensor, which is equal to the sum of these killing tensors, have distinct eigenvalues and the same eigenvectors. So it shares eigenvectors with any of the eigenvectors with any of the killing vectors in the pencil and the normality of the eigenvectors of each of the n minus one killing tensor means that the eigenvectors generate n fliations that consist of n minus one dimensional hypersurfaces orthogonal to the eigenvectors of the Killing tensor. Such a geometric construction is called an orthogonal separable web, which defines the coordinates of separation for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Specifically, it's possible to show that in such It's possible to show that in such coordinates as the Hamiltonian satisfies the Levitic-Chivita criterion. So it is separable. So another theorem concern, another theorem concerning killing tensors, and now is formulated for the natural Hamiltonians. So assume that the original Hamiltonian system is defined by a natural Hamiltonian. Defined by a natural Hamiltonian, then we have the following theorem. So, the natural system defined by one, the natural Hamiltonian system defined by one is orthogonally separable if and only if there exists a valence to killing tensor k with point-wise simple and real eigenvalues, normal eigenvectors or eigenforms, and such that the following compatibility condition holds true. So, dk dv in this context is just the exterior differential of the one form. Of the one form k hat contracted with dv. So k hat is a one, one tensor. Then a killing tensor satisfying the condition one and two of the previous theorem and the killing tensor of this theorem is called a characteristic killing tensor. So its geometric and algebraic property exactly defines orthogonal separation variables in the corresponding. Orthogonal separation variables in the corresponding Hamilton-Chekovic equation. So, in order to solve our problem, so we need to classify such Killing tensors up to the action of the corresponding isometry group. So, the isometry group acting on the base manifold also generates the associated action, induced action in the space of corresponding killing tensor. Killing pancer. So we can thus find a representation of the isometry group in the space of killing tensors simply by finding the group action on the parameters A1, etc. ADZ defines the vector space of killing tensors. Then, of course, in order to solve our classification. Solve our classification problem, we need invariance or covariance. So, invariance are algebraic functions that are preserved under the action under the induced action of the isometry group. Of course, we can given a space, say a space of killing tensor values two, and a group action, we A group action, we have the theorem that states that there are n minus s fundamental invariants where n is a dimension of the base manifold and the group acts with s dimensional orbits. Unfortunately, this is not the case in our situation because the action is not semi-regular in this case and the corresponding orbits. orbits have different dimensions. So in order to find the dimension of the corresponding orbits that don't coincide with the dimension of the group, right? So we have to use standard Lie group theory and be able to find the corresponding Find the corresponding isotropy subgroups and use infinitesimal generators to find the dimension of orbits that don't coincide with the dimension of the group in question. So now the original problem formulated for the Hamiltonian system can be reformulated in terms of the vector space of Killing tensors as follows. So we have a vector space. So we have a vector space of killing tensor valence 2 defined on M. So we would like to describe the orbit space, modulus action of the isometry group. Of course, we are not looking for all orbits. We are looking only for the orbit that corresponds to the characteristic Hillen tensors. And accordingly, we wish to solve the corresponding canonical and the equivalence problems. So the canonical problems can be formulated as follows. So let As follows. So let we have the action of the isometry group in the space of Killing Penn surveillance 2. We wish to determine the number of inequivalent orbits, modulus isometry group action corresponding to any characteristic tensors defined on our Suderiemannian manifold. And we also wish to find the corresponding canonical forms representing each of the orbits. Then we wish to solve the equivalence. Then we wish to solve the equivalence problem, which in this case can be formulated as follows. So again, consider the action of the isometry group in the space of Killing tensor valence 2. Let K be an element of this vector space. So first we wish to determine whether or not such a Killing tensor is a characteristic Killing tensor. If the answer is yes, then we want to determine the corresponding orbit in the quotient space that K belongs to and. That K belongs to, and finally, we want to find the moving frame map that maps K to its canonical form. So, the first use of the moving frame method in this context perhaps could be attributed to Eisenhard, who in his 1934 seminal paper on orthogonal separation of variables solve the problem, the canonical forms problem using The canonical forms problem using effectively the moving frame method. So he started with the Killing tensor equation and then he wanted to find all canonical Keeling tensors that generate orthogonal coordinate orthogonal coordinate systems. So he adapted, he fixed the frame of eigenvectors of such Keeling tensor. And in these And in this frame, he solved the Kieling-Pensor equation, deriving the corresponding integrability conditions, and eventually finding 11 canonical forms representing 11 orbits for the killing two tensors in Euclidean three-space and six orbits of the killing tensors defined on the three-dimensional sphere. Okay, so specifically, so this problem can be formulated as follows. Since eigenforms are integrable, so we can introduce adapted coordinates. And in these coordinates, we write down the metric and the Killing tensor, and then solve the Killing tensor equation and derive. Equation and derives the corresponding integrability condition. So, this integrability condition, coupled with the equations that define the components of the corresponding Riemann curvature tensor, are all the equations that we need in order to extract those canonical forms. Geometrically, it simply means choosing a frame, it simply means fixing a cross-section that intersects transversally the orbits and the output of. Orbits and the output of this arrangement, of course, are the corresponding canonical forms. Okay, so how to given a killing tensor? How can we verify that it's a killing tensor with normal eigenvectors or a characteristic killing tensor? So we cannot employ the new house tensor because it would be too strong a condition. It would be too strong a condition. If you do employ the killing tensor or the vanishing of the killing tensor, if you impose this condition, that the resulting characteristic killing tensor will be trivial, will be a trivial killing tensor with constant components. So we need a weaker condition, and such a condition was found. So we employed the tunnel scout and new house condition given by the equation 8. Alternatively, Alternatively, one can employ the Hansch's condition. So we can employ the Hansch's tensor instead, which is defined by the formula 10. So in the formula for the Neuenhaus tensor, we replace the Lie brackets with Neuenhaus tensor. And this condition can also be employed in this case. So in fact, if K has real and distinct I K has real and distinct eigenvalues, the conditions, the two conditions are equivalent. However, if the multiplicity of some of the eigenvalues of k is greater than one, then we can no longer employ the Tonalo-Schooten and Haus condition. So instead, we can use a more general Hansch's condition. So which, if satisfies, tell us the distribution defined by the eigenvectors of k in the pseudo-Riemannian space are orthogonally integral. Remaining space are orthogonally integrable. So this condition, the second condition, the Hanschez condition, comes in handy when we work on, for example, on n-dimensional sphere or n dimensional hyperbolic space embedded in the corresponding ambient spaces. And we work in the coordinates of the ambient space. Then this is a possibility that K has eigenvalues of multiplicity. Eigen values of multiplicity greater than one, and then it is convenient to use the Francius condition. So, finding the invariance. So, at this step, we also employ the moving frame method, specifically the algebraic version of the moving frame method introduced by Felson Olver in the late 90s. And it can be applied. Can be it can be applied in the following way. So, first, we derive the explicit as a group action with respect. So, we find the generic killing tensor representing our space of killing tensors and then find the group action either on the space of killing tensors or extended space of killing tensors. tensors. Then we derive the corresponding invariance or covariance employing the method of moving frames. So we, instead of using infinitesimal generators and solving the corresponding systems of partial differential equation, we can employ this purely algebraic method. And in many situations, it works really, really well. Really well. So, let us consider such an example. So, the first, so let us consider the Euclidean metric given in Cartesian coordinates and the corresponding infinitesimal generators of the isometry group. So we have two translations and one rotation. Then the generic Killing tensor in this Killing tensor valence 2 is given by the formula 13. So it consists of terms representing all Consist of terms representing all possible symmetrize tensor products of rotational and translational Keeling vectors. Okay, so we have six parameters, right, as expected. Then we can introduce the corresponding isometry group action in the base manifold and find the induced group action on the space of Killing tensor. It's given by the formula 15. So we So we can then use an appropriate cross-section and define the respective normalization equations, thus eliminating the group parameters A, B and theta. So once the group parameters have been eliminated, what is left are exactly the invariants or coordinates on the corresponding orbits. So by the way, the last equation gave us already one invariant. And in order to solve the problem of The problem of characterization of orthogonal webs in Euclidean space. So we need just two fundamental invariants. So I would like to mention that this group action was first generated by Winternitz and Fries, who found these invariants by brute force, as the late Pavel Winternitz said. Then it was reproduced in a different context by McLenach and et al. in 2002. In 2002. And finally, Dealy, Horwood, McLenaghan, and myself in 2004 actually use the moving frame method to use to find these invariants. Then the classification of the Russogen coordinate waves is as follows. So it's very simple. Given a Keeling tensor, so we don't need to worry about integrability condition in dimension two. All we need is distinct eigenvalues. Need these distinct eigenvalues. So we take a Killing tensor, read off the corresponding parameter A, B, C, alpha, beta, and gamma, compute the invariants, and they tell us exactly what is the corresponding coordinate web generated by eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Keeling tensor in question. However, in spaces of higher dimensions, the problem is much more complex. So, for example, let us consider a new Let us consider a Minkowski metric, a three-dimensional Minkowski space, defined with respect to the canonical pseudo-Cartesian coordinates. Then we have six generators of the corresponding Lie algebra of the isometry group, right? And the generic Keeling tensor was the form that represents the vector space. Represents the vector space of killing tensor values to is again given by all possible symmetrized tensor products of rotational and translational killing tensors. So, in fact, we have 21 parameters, but on the count of this additional syzygies, we eliminate one parameter. And so, this confirms that the dimension of the space is exactly 20 as expected. So, we then again consider the induced. Again, consider the group action on the base manifold and the induced action on the Killing tensor parameters. So as we see, the parameters given the matrix C change under this transformation as a tensor. So it is, so we already have some invariance. As for the uh as for the other invariants or covariance we form the following additional uh additional objects so we obtain them from uh from the first two equations by replacing uh lambdas and deltas with respectively Kronecker delta and x so then it's possible to show that these these These objects are exactly translational covariance of the group action. Then we can contract them appropriately, right? And thus find a requisite number of invariants. So in fact, in this case, we have 17 because we consider a prolonged space, namely killing tensors. Namely, Killing tensor space together with Bayes manifold. So, in theory, we should have obtained 17 fundamental invariants, but 12 invariants is enough to solve our classification problem. And of course, we will have to find the corresponding moving frame map that defines a transformation from a given From a given characteristic Killing tensor to its corresponding canonical form. So, this transformation may be obtained by comparing the coefficients of the general Killing tensor representing the vector space of the Killing 2 tensor on M and the most general Killing tensor representing a specific orbit. Such most general Killing tensor, K tilde subnaut, is obtained by the group action. So we can take Action. So we can take a canonical element representing an orbit, apply the full group, and thus we can find the corresponding general Keelan tensor representing this group. Then we can compare these tensors. So in principle, this problem can be solved, but in higher dimension, it can be extremely complicated, extremely complex. So since the action is not semi-regular, we split. Is not semi-regular, we split the orbits representing a characteristic Killing tensor into subclasses according to the symmetries of the characteristic Killing tensors that they correspond to. For example, in the case of Killing tensors values to define an Euclidean space, we split the characteristic Killing tensor into the following three subclasses, asymmetric, rotationally, symmetric, and translationally symmetric, and then use the invariants for each subgroup to classify them. them so before i consider i still have some time before i consider an example uh illustrating this procedure let me review the corresponding results that have been obtained by solving the equivalence the economical and equivalence problem for the killing tensors in spaces in three-dimensional spaces of constant curvature so first uh killing two tensors in euclidean three Killing to tensors in Euclidean 3D space. So, in this case, we have 11 orthogonal coordinate webs or orbits of karatistic Killing tensors. So, the canonical forms problem was solved originally by Eisenhard, and then it was solved by a different method by Boyer, Collins, and Miller. The corresponding equivalence problem was solved by Horwood et al., and then by a different method by Horwood in 2007. The corresponding problem for killington tensor in Minkowski space. So, in this case, we have a huge number of cases, so 58 orthogonal coordinate webs or orbits. So, the canonical forms problems were solved by Cullinson, Miller in 1976, Hinter-Leindner in 1994, and Horwood and McLennan in 2007. The corresponding fibers problem was solved by Horwood et al. in 2009. 2009. Okay, the sphere, kilo-to-tensor on three-dimensional sphere. So, in this case, there are six orthogonal coordinate websites or orbits. So, the corresponding canonical forms problem was solved by Eisenhard, by Alevsky, Kalnins, Miller, and Winternitz in 76, and Schovel more recently. The corresponding equivalence problem was solved by Cochran, McLean, and myself in 2011. And finally, And finally, the corresponding problem for killing two tensors on hyperbolic 3-space. In this case, we have 34 soval coordinate webs or orbits. So the canonical form problem was solved by Levsky and independently by Smolodinsky and Tugov in 1966. And then the fibulus problem was solved by Cochrane, McLean, and myself in 2017. So as an illustration, I would like to consider the following. Like to consider the following Hamiltonian system. So it was obtained by Morosi and Tondo in 1997 as a stationary reduction of a seventh-order modified KDV equation. So I tried at the time I tried to use all available tools and techniques to verify whether or not the system was orthogonally severable. The system was orthogonally separable, and actually, I failed. I couldn't find any methods that would allow me to first answer the question whether or not this Hamiltonian system is orthogonally separable, and then find the corresponding orthogonally separable coordinate systems. So it took us a short 10 years to develop the corresponding algorithm that can be used to deal with such systems. Be used to deal with such systems defined on Minkowski 3-space. So, first of all, we can go from null coordinates to pseudo-Cartesian coordinates. So, rewrite the system in terms of a diagonal metric. Find the corresponding Hamiltonian in pseudo-Cartesian coordinates. Then we impose a compatibility. Impose a compatibility conditions that appeared in Bernente's theorem, right? And find all Keeling tensors that are compatible with a given potential. Okay, so we found the following pencil of Keeling tensors. Okay, so then we employed the Tonolos-Hutton Newhouse conditions and they were identically set. They were identically satisfied. So, conclusions: this is indeed a characteristic killing tensors. And it's also possible to show that the correct traces polynomial generates almost everywhere distinct eigenvalues. distinct eigenvalues. Therefore, we conclude that this Killing tensor compatible with the tonal sorry Morositon potential is has normal eigenvectors. So it's a characteristic Killing tensor indeed and it has distinct eigenvalues. So next problem. So we first we find whether which we find whether or not we find out whether or not the characteristic healing tensor admits any web symmetries. So it turns out it doesn't, right? So we identify this characteristic healing tensor as a killing tensor that belongs to a group of orbits. There are 10 orbits in total that corresponds to asymmetric characteristic killing tensors. To asymmetric characteristic killing tensors, and therefore, we need a classification of these asymmetric killing tensor. So, it's a very lengthy procedure. First, we generate invariants coming from those invariants that I listed above and the corresponding algorithms that can be used to discriminate between used to discriminate between all 10 of them. Okay, so this is this flow chart shows us how this process can be employed given a killing tensor. Okay, so for example, we start with the killing tensor A1. So it is a linear combination of the first invariants. Sorry, we start with the invariant A1. So it's some linear combination of Some linear combination of invariant C1, C2, and C3 that I listed above, and then given a Killing tensor, verify whether it's positive, negative, or equal to zero, and then proceed accordingly. So if it is equal to zero, then we can have one of those eight remaining cases. And in our case, we obtain the following result. Result. So, for the asymmetric tensor that is compatible with the Morossi Tondo potential, we found that A1 is equal to 0, C2 equal to 0, and A2 is equal to the following quantity. So, there are two cases to consider, namely A3 equal to 0, and A3 is not equal to 0. So, we just follow, sorry, we just follow the chart. The chart. So here's A2. Okay, so first of all, we consider the case when A3 is equal to 0, then we employ the covariant A4, then A11, and this procedure lead us eventually to the web class denoted by Roman 2. Okay? Roman 2. Okay, alternatively, we can arrive at this subclass using this path. Okay, thus, in this case, Killing tensor, the characteristic Killing tensor characterizes asymmetric web2. Next, we compute the moving frame map and then ultimately find the transformation to the separable. to the separable coordinates. So this transformation to separable coordinates is also defined by the moving, sorry, is also defined by the moving frame map. Okay, so the problem is solved. So the Morosi-Tondo integrable system is also orthogonally separable, right? And it can be solved by By solving the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation in orthogonal coordinates. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Are there any questions for Roman? Roman, I have one little picky question. If you go back to your flowchart. Chart. One of those branches, it says four or six. Does that mean you need another invariant to distinguish four and six? Okay, just a moment. At the very bottom, one of the boxes, four or six. Yeah. No, you were there, Ed. Yeah. Keep going. No, no, over closer to the right. Over closer to the right. Okay. Close. Yeah. Yeah, that one. Yeah. Hey, Roman. Yeah. Hey. Were you able to make any progress with this on the decomposability of killing tensors? Decomposability. Yeah, when they're tensor products of killing vectors. Products of killing vectors. Well, so in other words, when we are not in a space of constant curvature, right? Well, yeah, I mean, of course, there they all are, but some other, you know, like I always thought symmetric spaces would be a good example where you could maybe get your hands on the theory of decomposable and decomposable. Decomposable and decomposable in terms of the invariance. But no, we haven't gone beyond the spaces of constant curvature. Yeah, okay. All right, all right. Thanks, Mel. In principle, you can apply to your natural mechanical system, right? And convert this entire story into just one metric. To just one metric. Of course, there will be like one parametric family of isoenergetic surfaces, right? But the probability will be just the same there. Then, of course, your metric is no longer constant curvature. It's conformally, of course, flat, but no longer constant curvature. Do you think that your chart flow changes if you just consider Just matrix loser or this image, right? So reference your projected metrics, for instance. Yes, if we start, there was an echo. So if understand you correctly, if we start our problem in different coordinates, right? No, I. No, I suggest like that's in a not an actual mechanical system, but V equal to zero, but instead G not restricted by constant curvature, right? It should be still conflict because Mokoski's principle relates those two systems. But then you can do the same stuff. It will be a different, of course, it will be a different problem, right? And with a different flow chart. You'll be different for the charge, yeah? Of course. Because whenever I have a magistrate surface, they are actually, you know, at least like normal parametric equals. I refer to the Packet V principle and, for example, how Bolsonville made a counterpart for the ND approach. So you can do similar storage just for geodesic flow without potential. Okay, so you propose to solve the corresponding geodesic problem in a different space, right? Right, yes, a formal is that separable, automatically separable, yes. Okay, yeah, well, it's it's going to be a different uh problem, of course. Um, and and if we if we have a geodesic Hamiltonian, right? So indeed, we we don't need the flow chart at all, right? Because a geodesic Hamiltonian separates in all possible orthogonal coordinates. All possible orthogonal coordinate systems, right? Modular isometry group, right? So we can take any characteristic killing tensor, we can apply the group, right, and we'll have separation. But this problem becomes complicated specifically because we choose to incorporate the potential. Then it becomes a problem. Okay, so if we introduce a potential, then we introduce a potential then the killing tensor in question the killing tensor compatible with with the with the potential right may not be in canonical form so it becomes very restrictive so we need to completely solve the equivalence and canonical forms problem and so we need of course we need of course To characterize all possible orbits, right? And that represents the canonical Killing tensor. And then, of course, we need to find the corresponding moving frame maps. So if you have a geodesic Hamiltonian without a potential, so there is no problem. So all we need are all possible canonical killing pencils. Canonical killing cancer. Well, thank you very much, Roman. Thank you. Now we have a 25-minute break before the next talk at 2.30 mountain time.
