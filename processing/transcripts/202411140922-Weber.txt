For incomplete markets. So in the literature, there is not a lot known explicitly in terms of equilibrium asset pricing with marketing completeness. So the literature that is available often assumes a partial equilibrium. So certain assets are given. So certain assets are given exogenously, but how unhedgeable risk factors can affect asset pricing in equilibrium is not a well-studied problem. So the only papers that have some closed form solutions for models of this kind have idiosyncratic risk. So for example, there is this paper on JET by Chris Tensen, Larsen and Bunke, which gives an explicit Which gives an explicit expression for asset prices when agents receive some income which is unhedgeable. But there is really nothing available in which the aggregate consumption is driven by unhedgeable risk factors, which is what we're trying to study in this paper. So let me go through the model quickly. Uh, quickly. So, we're considering an aggregate consumption process, which is very simple. So, it's just essentially an arithmetic run in motion, except that we add this perturbation, which is an Orson-Uhlenbeck process. So, the aggregate consumption is driven by two varying motions, the one that directly affects the dividend and then Directly affects the dividend, and then there can also be shocks on the growth rate of aggregate consumption. And in this model, there is only going to be one risky asset that the agents can trade to hedge a risk, but there are two sources of risk. The idea to get to close-form solutions is by doing some asymptotic analysis because if Because if epsilon is equal to zero, so we don't have this perturbation, then the model is going to be complete. We're only going to have a very simple dividend process, which is driven by only one source of randomness, and we have one risky asset to hedge it. And so it's a very simple model to solve. It's just a very simple exercise. The problems arise when instead we have this additional noise, so this fluctuation. Uh, noise, so these fluctuations in the growth rate of the dividend. We have a bunch of agents who have exponential utility, so they can be heterogeneous in risk aversion and time preference. They are endowed with a certain amount of initial wealth, and then they can borrow and lend at an endogenously determined risk-free rate, and they can trade a risky asset. They can trade a risky asset that earns them dividends. The stock price and the interest rate are to be determined endogenously. And we have the usual, almost the usual definition of market equilibrium. So the positions in the stock, they need to sum up to one. So the stock is in a fixed unit net supply. The risk-free asset is in zero net supply. Asset is in zero-net supply. So every time there is a borrower, there is a lender. And then the sum of consumptions needs to be equal to the dividend. So that's typical in Lucas Tree type of equilibrium models. The consumption needs to be financed by this trading in the two assets. And the only thing that we do different compared to standard general equilibrium models is that we. Equilibrium models is that we don't force agents to behave fully optimally, but just optimally up to a small error. So we're looking at consumption processes and investment strategies that could be sub-optimal as long as the deviation from the optimum is at most of it's small. Of its small O of epsilon squared. So, this is what we call the second-order equilibrium. So, in principle, one could go also to higher orders, but I mean, expressions are already fairly complicated as it is. In the case when there is no perturbation to our benchmarks, or whenever there are no fluctuations in the growth rate of the dividend, then the model is complete. Then the model is complete, and it's a very simple exercise. And this theorem details how the equilibrium looks like. So a couple of things to notice is that being a complete model, there exists a representative agent. So we can just replace all of the agents with some agent that has risk aversion, a certain risk aversion alpha bar and a certain time preference between. Alpha bar and a certain time reference beta bar, and the economy is equivalent to an economy with such a representative agent. All quantities only depend on the exogenous dividend process. And also something which is unfortunately very common in this type of models is that there is no trading involved. So agents they have a fixed amount of shares and they just hold the Shares and they just hold those for the rest of their days. Once we add the source of incompleteness, so once we add this unhedgeable growth rate risk, the equilibrium becomes much more complicated, but it can be written explicitly. So I'm not going to go obviously through all the details here, but we get the Details here, but we get the explicit expressions for all the quantities in equilibrium: the asset prices and the investment and consumption decision. I just want to give at least a brief explanation of what is going on and how incompleteness affects equilibrium quantities. If the market If the market was complete, so we can make the market complete by adding an additional risky asset, which in this case, the most convenient risky asset would be a long-term bond. So the agency can only trade the stock and short-term bonds, but because the dividend growth rate is stochastic, this means that interest rate is also going to be stochastic, and therefore the long. The long-term bonds, it cannot just be simply replicated with short-term bonds. So, once we add long-term bonds, then the market will be complete. In this complete model, this would be the optimal consumption rate. So, this is what the agents want to obtain. And this is a consumption stream that can be achieved by simply having a constant amount of stocks and a constant amount of long term bonds. Of long-term bonds. Now, long-term bonds are not available, so agents are going to try to replicate long-term bonds with short-term bonds. But because the replication is not perfect, there is going to be some noise, some noise that needs to be absorbed by the agents through the consumption. So essentially, the consumption is going to become more volatile. Become more volatile in this incomplete model. And because the volatility in the consumption depends on this tracking error is something that depends on the whole history of shocks. Because one needs to check how much tracking error has been accumulated to Related to assess how much needs to be consumed. So, consumption is in this case no longer Markovian in the exogenous state variables. We also get that it's going to depend on the wealth distribution, because if all agents were if there was perfect equality in the economy, then there would be no borrowing or lending anyhow. Borrowing or lending anyhow. And so there would be no need to replicate long-term bonds because there is no demand for bonds in the first place. But the more inequality there is, the more demand, the more borrowing and lending there will be. So the more demand for long-term bonds, which affects the equilibrium. So differently than the benchmark, the complete benchmark, the wealth distribution does affect equilibrium quantities. Quantities in this case, and heterogeneity matters. So, we cannot just replace all the agents with a single representative agent because how the wealth is distributed among them does matter for the equilibrium. We also get dynamic trading, which exclusively comes from marketing completeness in this case. Again, this is. In this case, again, this seems something that should come out in equilibrium models, but many equilibrium models don't achieve dynamic trading. And often, in order to obtain dynamic trading, it's basically forced on the model, for example, by including noise traders, which are just agents who randomly trade without any reason. So, forcing also. Reason so forcing also rational traders to trade with them. But in this case, trading just appears because of marketing completeness, because we can still use the stock to somehow partially hedge this interest rate risk. Even though dividend growth rate risk and dividend risk are not correlated, the stock is still going to be endogenously correlated with interest rate risk. And the interest rate in equilibrium is going to depend at second order also on the distribution of wealth. As I said earlier, the more heterogeneity there is in the wealth distribution, the more volatility there is in consumption because there is. Volatility, there is in consumption because there is more borrowing and lending activity that is happening. And this creates additional precautionary savings effect, which reduces the interest rate in equilibrium. So a very inequal economy would lead to a lower interest rate compared to a more equal economy. Okay, let me skip this. So let me just. This. So let me just conclude here. So, what we did is set up this model with unhedgeable risk factors that affect the growth rate of aggregate consumption and heterogeneous agents. And in such a model, we managed to get closed-form solutions for the general equilibrium. So, for the interest rate, for the stock prices, for investment and consumption decisions. And the way we did this is by. Way we did this is by perturbing a complete benchmark model, which has a very simple solution. So we can just perturb that and then get some asymptotic expressions for the incomplete model. And we uncover all the effects that this unhedgable shock has on the equilibrium, given that we have explicit solutions, explicit expressions we can. Explicit expressions, we can analyze precisely the mechanism through which marketing completeness actually affects the equilibrium. And we see that heterogeneity in preferences and in wealth does affect all of the equilibrium quantities. Yeah. That's it. Thank you. Thank you.
