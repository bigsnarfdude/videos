Um so you already see what I'm going to talk about in this talk, but uh probably to some of you um it is more straightforward to say that what I'm going to talk about what I'm going to do is the CR analog of power co-fine and half rate on mode 6. So I want to find special curves or distinguished curves. Curves or distinguished curves in CR manifolds, or more precisely, I should say, strictly complex CR manifolds, but we don't have to worry about that condition because the manifold I'm going to discuss in this talk is just one single example, which is the unit sphere in Cm plus one. That's a standard example of the straight relation complex here manifold. And well, there are classically known classes of special curves in straight relationship CR manifolds, which are defined through the normal percent connection, whose construction is due to manager and independently to channel and also. And those four classes, well, the best known ones are for chains. And well, less well-known ones of larger class is probably this to call them CR geodesics or the CR version of parabolic geodesics. But the approach I want to take in this work is a holographic one. So that means I want to regard the C or sphere, the unit sphere in the Cr plus one, as the boundary of inf. As the boundary at the infinity of some complete reminer manifold. So, this approach is totally different from the normal Google approach. And well, although I'm going to discuss the case of the standard CO sphere in this talk, well, I do that in such a way that the approach easily generalizes, I believe. Generalizes, I believe, easily generalizes the arbitraries of my vote. I am about 90% sure, or a little bit more. And in that general situation, the curves that I'm going to obtain might be possibly the same as the change over CO2 basics defined through the normal contamination. That's probably different. But But, hmm. Well, uh in the in the setting of the atmosphere they are actually the same. And if they are the same even in the general setting, I want to know the ultimate reason why it is so. Okay, let me begin with reviewing the conformal guess briefly. And this is due to, well, I said it is due to Fine and Perferer in 2022, but the preprint was available since. But the preprint was available since 2019, I think. And they used minimal surfaces, but I also want to explain a little bit about my pre-formulation in terms of harmonic ones. So in any case, the curves which are characterized in the conformal setting are, well, in the case of the standard sphere, the standard round sphere, they are circles. Circles, the intersections of the sphere with some real affine real two point affine two point. There's no distinction between the great circle and the smaller circle between because I'm we are doing conformal geometry. And in general, there is a notion of conformal geodesics, which is actually defined through the normal carton connection called. Well, not for technology. And well, the star, so we take the holographic approach. So I view the standard round sphere as the boundary at the infinity of the hyperbolic space of dimension m plus 1. And in general, I see a given conformer manifold as the boundary at the infinity of some Korean manifold. So, well, you may think that there's You may think that there's a problem about the existence of conquering filling for any given conformal manifold, but that's not the problem in this discussion because actually it suffices to have some formal asymptotic expansion of network, which always exists for any given component. So, okay, then the starting point. And the starting point of the work of Klein Paraphrase is the observation that any given circle in the whole homosphere is the boundary of, well, totally geodesically embedded real hyperbolic land in hyperbole space. So one may expect that in the general In a general setting, any conformal geodesics, any conformal geodesic can be characterized as the boundary curve of a totally geodesically embedded real hyperbolic plane. And that's not precisely true, but in a certain sense, asymptotically, it is true. Is true in the following sense. So, well, I'm going to explain what financial curve I did. So, suppose that some curve in the home form is given in a conformer matbo, unparameterized curve. And they try to, or they consider extension of that curve into the one Grange time manifold so that. The one Grange time manifold, so that other minimal surface. Then they asked whether that extension, the minimal surface, is totally geodesic in one parameter model or not. And well, basically the extended minimal surface is totally geodesic. Totally geodesic, if and only if the boundary curve is conf uh, conformal geodesic. That's the argument. So, I I mean, that integration, what does conformal geometry mean? Conformal geodesic. Conformal geodesic meaning. So, the definition of conformal geodesics. So, that's well, so it it was originally defined through well um normal correct transaction, so I haven't explained normal correct transactions. So, it um but More cost transformation, so it um but it doesn't make sense. But um the ultimately is um given by uh this equation. So that any curve times one in this equation is a conformation basic. Three third order. Okay, but I can derive this equation through the whole graphical part. Back so I was talking about the umpire. So, I was talking about the unparameterized curve here. And there's a preferred parameterization for homo geodesics, and that can be obtained as follows. So, the observation which I should make is the following. So, in the standard performance sphere case, well, any circle is a boundary, is the boundary of totalitaria basically embedded real hyperbolic plane, and the real hyperbolic plane. Real hyperbole plane, and the real hyperbolic plane can be identified with the upper half plane. And through that identification, the circle minus one point is identified with the real line. So that's one preferred parameterization. So when I speak about a preferred parameterization of a circle in the homosphere, In the homosphere. It is the portion of the curve which is actually parameterized is the circle minus one point. But that's a preferred parameterization of the circle. And the transformation goal between any two preferred parameterization is given by a projective transformation, which is Transformation, which is the linear fractional transformation. And well, so in general case, the final perfect consider to approximate the extended minimal surface by a small portion near the boundary of the real hyperbolic plane at at any given point. At any given point. Then that's well asymptotically possible to some order, and the preferred parameterization of a conformal geodesic is given by this one. So this some portion of a conformal geodesic is identified with some portion of a circle, the circle, and this disk is identified with the upper half, upper half. upper half plane and well and in this way I can identify some portion of a conformative geodel basic with an open line and that's uh preferred parameterization of a conform material basic. So that's well a very good um the very good work. The very good work. But I but well, conceptually, this is a very good approach, but computationally, this is quite involved. Partially because the computation is splitted into three parts, maybe. So the first, they need to construct minimal extension. Minimal extension over a given curve, and then they need to see if they are probability of the z or not. And finally, they have to approximate the extended surface with some portion of the hyperwithe disk. And I found that using harmonic maps, those computations spread. Well computations splitted in three can be made into two steps or possibly one step, one single step, depending on how you debate. So I want to use that approach, how many map approach in the work for CR manifold, so I want to explain that. There are some more advantages of considering Of considering equations, partial differential equations for mass rather than surfaces. But I'll mention other advantages later. Okay, so as a general fact, any minimal isometric embedding is a harmonic map between Riemannian manifolds. So this embedding of a hyperbolic plane into the hyperbolic space gives a harmonic market. Hyperbolic space gives a harmonic map from H2 to Hm plus 1. So in general, I consider as follows. So I start from a parameterized curve in the conformal mic. And I will identify that parameterization with some identification of a curve with some portion of the real line. Yeah, the real axis in the upper house plane, and I want to extend that curve to harmonic map between some region of upper half plane into the one corona space space, one corona span mine. And that's always possible to some extent, to some order. And then I, well, I see. I see whether that extended harmonic map is totally geodesic or not. Probably the second fundamental form for maps might be not so well known, but Eve and Samsung defined it in their paper on maps. And it's defined as this: Nabula Du. So U is a long map I'm considering from H to D for a graph. To be more graphic time manifold, and du, the differential, can be seen as a section of the tensor product of the cotangent bundle of H2 and the pullback of the tangent bundle of the target space. So, well, there is a naturally induced connection in this bundle, induced from the level to the connections between the domain of the target. And NAMLA DU is the second bundle. Is the second fundamental form of the map, and the map is called the geodesic. It vanishes. And well, the harmonic map condition is given by the trace of that second fundamental form. So the map is harmonic when the trace of the second fundamental vanishes. So yeah, so simply speaking, what are the equation, the differential equation, which Equation, which I want to consider, is this number du equals 0 because this is satisfied and it automatically means that the map is someone you can. So I do this asymptotically. So I introduce coordinates to the hyperbolic plane, uh which is the upper hubs, which is given by the upper hub space model. And for the target space, I uh introduce coordinates using Introduce points using the ground V normal form. So, according to the ground V normal form, the neighborhood of the boundary is identified with the boundary times some small interval. And I introduce some local coordinate to the boundary manifold. So, locally, this space can be regarded as R. Regarded as a r 1. And using these coordinates, I will write any given smooth map u, which is both u, in the set of n plus 1 functions. So u infinity is the export. And ui, where i runs through one to n. So these are To n. So these are y1, y2, dot or yn for units. So any map can be thought of as a set of n plus 1 functions, and it can be, well, I consider the following expansion, the power series expansion in s. And the boundary condition is reflected as this, so that well, zero for the coefficient must be given by zero. must be given by 0 and gamma i for well 0 for the u infinity component and gamma i for the u by component where gamma i is the coordinate of the curve. Then, well I can solve this order by order and the conclusion is that Conclusion is that there exists a such formal power series solution to the totally geodesic Harmonic map equation to order to second order if and only if the given parameterized curve in the former boundary satisfies this third order equation called pronounced basic equation. Geodesic equation. So the fact that the conformal geodesic equation should be a third-order equation can be understood as like this. So in the standard example, so when I think about two-dimensional round sphere, if I remove one point, then it can be identified with a plane. It can be identified with a plane, and in that plane, the core form of geodesics are just circles, circles, or infinite radial circles. So, for any given initial point and a given initial direction, there is a family of circles like this, or conformative physics like this. So the initial point and initial direction doesn't fix the curve. We need one more parameter to fix the curve. So that's given by the initial acceleration. So in that sense, the conformal geodesic equation should be a point of equation. Well, that's what happened. What happens conformal geometry? Okay, because of the whole determination of the coefficients, but I just skip this slide. Okay, let's go on to the CR case. And I only consider the CR sphere, the unit sphere in Cn plus 1, which is S2N plus 1. And well, the special colours that I want to characterize. curves that I want to characterize it, characterize in this setting are chains and horizontal circles. And chains are what is well known. They are intersections of the sphere and the complex line, any complex line in Cn plus 1. And on the other hand, the horizontal circles are well, relatively not so well known. Well, relatively, what's well known. So, I take some special example of a horizontal circle, and I want to define general horizontal circles as the images of that standard one under the action of the automobile group of the zerosphere, which is projective unitary group of the inlet, immediate Matrivian plus one ma. And the standard one is given by And the standard one is given by this. So the standard one is the intersection of the sphere and the real two plane spanned by the real axis of the first coordinate and the real axis of the last coordinate. So this is a totally real plane and intersection is the standard horizontal circle and Horizontal circle and any image under the V node can possibly circle. And this is, well, the reason for the name is that these curves are everywhere tangent to the horizontal distribution. Where I haven't explained what the horizontal distribution is, but yeah, there's a special hyperplane distribution over the unit sphere. The unit sphere, which is given at every point at any given point, has the maximum subspace of the tangent space, which is closed under the action of almost complex structure in Cn plus 1. So there's some special distribution, hyperpoint distribution over S2n plus 1, and this is called the horizontal distribution or the standard compact distribution. I called them horizontal circles, but well, I named them without much thought and I afterwards realized that, well, maybe the R circles is the more commonly used name for these curves, while chains are also called C circles. But different people call them differently. And, well, for example, Ellie Kartang. Ellie Kaftan called these our circles Ellie Khaftan called them just circles or circles I haven't read the original Captain's articles but I learned it from Jakobovitz on three-dimensional CL geometry and Jakobovitz himself called them Owitz himself called them called these horizontal circles pseudo circles. So, well, many people call them differently. So, I think I'll stick to the name horizontal circles in this talk. One thing we should be aware about horizontal circles is that in general, a horizontal circle is not necessarily in the intersection of the sphere and the real two point. Real top it can be uh not like that. Uh so that's um yeah, I had a some misunderstanding about that until last meeting and I said something wrong in the seminar at the university told you what all right so I want to characterize those circles and I there's one thing. And there's one thing I would mention. So these two circles, these two circles, are both the boundary curve of a totally geodesically embedded real hyperbolic plane in the unit pole, where the unit pole is equipped with the complex hyperbolic metric. But there's a difference between these two. So the embedding is given by some The embedding is given by some mapping from the unit disk to the hole. But in the case of horizontal circles or R circles, that mapping can be smoothly extended to the closed disk. While in the case of chains, that's not possible. It can be extended continuously up to the boundary, but it's not smooth. That extension is not smooth. That's the difference. So if I want to continue. So if I want to characterize these chains using local harmonic map consideration, then I need to introduce in the asymptotic series half integer powers of boundary-defined function for the disk. Well, I concentrate on the case of horizontal circles. Right. Yeah, before going into the consideration, I want to look into how what kind of curves, horizontal circles, are in the viewpoint of the Heisenberg group. So, if I remove that point from the unit sphere, that can be identified with the Heisenberg group. So, that's similar to So that's similar to the identifying the conformals here minus one point here, and the Heisenberg group is as a smooth manifold identical to Cm minus R Cn cross R and the C n coordinate is denoted by theta from this top and the real coordinate is denoted as tau. And then And then, yeah, just like this case, I want to explain what horizontal circles are if the initial point is set to one, some point the original size of the group. And the initial velocity vector is fixed as the directional real axis of the first coordinate in the CM coordinates. So yeah, zeta is written as C plus I eta and yeah, I said the initial velocity vector to be D B C Y. D C1 and R with pre R. And I completely written down the formula for preferably parameterized horizontal curves. So preferred parameterization of horizontal circles are given by Giga as before. So horizontal circles are the boundary curves embedded totally geographically embedded hypothetically. totally geographically and the hyper plane into the uniform and uh I identified the well the real hypothetical plane with the alpha Hawk's plane and the real axis gives the preferred parameterization of the horizontal circle and preferably parameterized horizontal circles with these initial conditions are given by this formula so there are still Still 2m plus 1 real parameters for the family of such curves. So the p and q are parameters. And in terms of these, gamma t is given better. The complex coordinates is given by this formula, and the real coordinate is given by this formula. And one thing By this formula. And one thing I want to observe from this formula is the following. Unlike the conformal case, even I fix the initial acceleration vector, the curve is not yet fixed. So if I expand this complex part, complex um components of the uh horizontal circle, Horizontal circle into the powers of integer powers of t. Then the second order coefficient gives you the parameter p. So by fixing the initial acceleration, I can read p from that coefficient. But in order to fix q, you need the third-order coefficient. So that means That means the ordinary differential equation defining the horizontal circles cannot be a system of third-order equations. It should contain some fourth-order equation. And that's why I found it out using common market approach. Okay, so I set up the student. Situation for doing asymptotic analysis for common gaps between the hyperbolic plane to complex hypoblex space. Okay, so the complex hypoblex space, so the unipole can be seen as manifold equipped with a complex hypoblex metric. And there are many other ways to see that. One well-known thing is the Z-GL upper house space. Space. And if I decide to break the complex structure, then it can also be seen as a product of the high-number group and the interval zero infinity. So this is like the upper half space model for that real hyper space. And in these coordinates, so in the Hassember group, I use zeta and tau. And in this coordinate, And in these coordinates, the complex hypothometric can be written like this. So the vertical, there's a Heisenberg group here, and there's a vertical axis x. And the vertical direction is 4 times dx squared over x squared, and the tangential. And um the conjunctional direction should be written in uh two parts. Um so there's a difference in uh the order of divergence of the components of the metric. Um so there's a fourth order divergent term. Um so the second term is theta squared over x to the fourth and this theta is the standard contact one, what is called the standard contact one, which is. One half of d tau minus i times some well yeah you can see the formula here. And well another term, another tangential term is this one. One minus x squared times the standard condition in a product point Cl. Okay. Okay, so this is the formula I need to use to analyze some of the maps. And then the problem is the same as before. I suppose that I am given a parametrized curve in the present blue group. And I want to extend this curve to a well, first I extend this curve to a harmonic map. This curve to a harmonic map from the hyperbolic plane, the hyperbolic plane to the complex hyperbolic space. Then I will see whether this extension, omega, is totally equal to C4. But there's a difficulty when analyzing this how many marks in this setting, which is non-existent in the conformal case. Conformal case. The difficulty is the following. Using coordinates, using these coordinates zeta and tau in the Heisenberg group is not good in some situations like this. Which is because there is a standard horizontal distribution or the contact distribution on the horizontal group, and that distribution can be is not spun by. Is not spun by directions given by coordinates. That's what contact distribution means. And I need to restrict that horizontal distribution. And for that purpose, instead of using coordinates, I want to use some local frames of the tangent bundle. Or these are frames of the complex by tangent bundle, but then The complex Pythagorean bundle, but anyway, I want to use this one. Alpha runs between 1 and n, and Z alpha is the partial derivative input between C. Alpha plus 1 I times the complex conjugate concentration alpha times tau differentiation, and the bar, Z alpha bar is the complex conjugate. G alpha bar is the complex quantity of Z alpha, and well, T denotes twice the taunting in the tau direction. These are dual to D, zeta alpha and B, zeta alpha R and Z tau. But then the problem arises. Um I won't analyze max U, but that it doesn't make sense to say the comp speaker. The speaker, the components of you with respect to these friends. So, if so, in the previous setting, in the conforma setting, I was using coordinates, so it makes sense to speak the components of u for each coordinates. But I want to use these frames in the second. So, instead of considering maps directly, I need to introduce some. I need to introduce some idea which is drawn by our work of Donelli, Harold Doneri in 1994. Donelli analyzed how many marks fit in rank one compact symmetric spaces and in that work Donelli considered interpreted the Harmonic Map equation as an equation for different Equation for differentials of the matter. So, well, it is better to say that I'm introducing some unknown functions to the system. So, to make this second-order system for you, to make this second-order system for you, to the first-order system, to you and phi. So, well, phi denotes du and well. du and well then the number of the this equation number of du which is totally geld as a common equation um domain to number of the feet equation so this is the first idea uh then uh the advantage of doing this is that uh by considering so um it makes sense to speak about the components of phi with respect Of phi with respect to the given frame, but not necessarily given by coordinates. And one more additional idea to this is, yeah, it is even better to use instead of frames dx t z alpha z alpha bar, it is better to use this weighted frame, x, d, x, x squared times t and x z alpha and x. And Xt alpha and Xt alpha bar. This is because the complex hyperbolic metric diverges at different orders of the boundary depending on the direction. So yeah, if I take this frame instead of this usual dx tz alpha z alpha bar frame, well in particular the metric, the components of the metric will be The components of the metric will be constant, actually. It will help in the actual analysis. Yeah, so according to these ideas, the components of phi, which is to be determined, are the following. There are eight kinds of components. So if I insert S D S I insert SDS to APO. For consistency, for the domain, real hard public claim, I use SDS and STT instead of TSF. So I plug in STS into V and get four kinds of components, which is X T X component and X square T component, X T up T upper component. XT of the upper component, XT upper bar component. And well, there are four components, four types of components for VSTT. And I seek to construct a solution, a sympletic solution for the equation naval phi equals zero as an asymptotic series. Single text series. Yeah. Okay. For which corresponds to a given horizontal curve in the Heisenberg group. So the given curve in the Heisenberg group, I assume that the given curve is horizontal, which means it's everywhere tangential to the horizontal distribution. And because of that assumption, Because of that assumption, uh the velocity vector for gamma is uh can be written as a combination of z alpha and z alpha bar and the components are written as gamma dot alpha and gamma dot alpha bar. And in terms of these coefficients, the boundary condition which I need to put for phi, which will be. which should be good as the following. So the zeroth order term, for the zeroth order term, the zeroth order term of phi s infinity component should be set one. And the information from gamma is reflected to the zeroth order coefficient of phi mu alpha and the first order coefficient of mu alpha. So mu alpha is square root of two times of the length normalized velocity vector. And mu t, this is basically represents the speed of the given curve in the heart squared group. So this is the d derivative of log of the absolute value of gamma dot t. Value of gamma dot t. This is the boundary condition which should be imposed for our phi, and we solve the equation named phi equals zero starting from that. So determine these coefficients one by one. What is happening actually is that the harmonic macroequation basically determines all the coefficients. Basically, it determines all the coefficients. But there are other equalities which be satisfied if I impose that total interplaceness. And then some compatibility conditions come up, and they are equations that I want to find. Okay, so the new theorem is the following. Okay. For um First of all, for any given horizontal curve in the high sample group, there is a sympathetic solution to nabla phi equals small or all of s squared. But in order to get a solution, a sympathetic solution satisfying nabula phi equals all s cubed, the initial The initial curve should satisfy some ordinary differential equation. So if that is, and well, that ordinal differential equation characterizes the real horizontal circles in the horizontal group. So finally I can say that there is a synthetic series solution of this form to modula phi equals always. Nebula V equals OS cubed if and only if that initially given curve is a part of horizontal circle, which is parametrized preferable preferably. Okay, so the actual ordinary differential equation comes in the next slide, which is C, like this. So there are, so the system is decomposed into two. The system is decomposed into two parts. And the first one comes from, well, this is. Ah, I said something wrong. In order to have a solution to the second order, there is already a compatibility condition in SERF. And that's exactly wrong. Yeah, so in order to for the existence of such a solution, Existence of such a solution, the curve should satisfy this third order equation, comma triple dot dot dot plus something equals zero. But you don't have to look at it very carefully. You need to look at the first two terms only. The first two terms tells you, so there's a triple dot, so the product derivative of gamma, and there's And there's something, some correction term to the third-order term, involving the third order. I'll give again. And this second term basically subtracts the information of the triple derivative of gamma in the direction of j gamma dot zero. So the velocity vector turned ninety degrees. 90 degrees. Yeah, so this second term subtracts that information. So this first set of equations gives some constraint to some part of the derivative of gamma. But there's one real component which is not fixed, but this Fixed by this fixed by this equation, and actually, the fourth-order derivative of that direction is fixed by this second equation. So, in order to get a third-order solution to the number of equals zero, the initial curve gamma should satisfy this equation, the first term being imaginary part of inner product of gamma dot and gamma four dots. So, gamma dot and gamma four dots. So, this set of equations means that if I give the initial point, an initial velocity, an initial acceleration, and one component of the initial, I don't know the underscore for the For the third order derivative, but initial third-order derivative of gamma at time t equals zero, then the curve is fixed. And then that curve has the horizontal circle, and it is referably parameterized. That's the conclusion. Okay, so that's basically what I want to tell you on this talk. But But let me mention a little bit about characterization of chains in CO sphere. So as I said before, in the case of the chains, so the chains are the intersection of the sphere and the complex line in Cn plus 1, and that intersection, the circle. That intersection, the circle, is always a boundary curve of somebody embedded in the real hyperbolic length, but the embedding length from the real hyperbolic plane from the Wongard disk to the complex hyperbolic disk, the unique volume CN plus one, is not smoothly extended up to the boundary. So I need to introduce um the half integer powers of S, as this is the vertical coordinate of the real half of the plane. And in this case, the zeroth order term is fixed as one half for the S infinity component and one for the T0 component and other zero-folder coefficients must be zero. And the information of the curve is reflected. Of the curve is reflected to the, well, s to the one-half coefficients of V s alpha component and V T alpha component, which is alpha T and there's nu D, which also reflects the initially given curve in the Heisenberg group. The first order coefficient of the T infinity component is fixed by the curve, and then you can well. And then you can solve the equation, the total EGSI common equation, order by order, and get some Boeing differential equation, which is which characterizes this must must characterize the horizontal chain in that CR round sphere. But I haven't calculated that, well, this is all the necessary computation for that case. At this, like I said, I don't see that. At least, like I said, I would say that this should characterize chains. Okay. Well, I have a lot of time remaining, but this is the final slide. Okay, let me summarize things to do. So, first of all, there is no doubt that I have to think about general CRM false. So, I should replace the sphere or the high-temperate group with an AB. With an arbitrary straightforward convex CR manifold. And it is known that any of the convex CR manifold can be, well, at least formally understood as the boundary at the infinity of something called a synthetic of the complex cycle of the Keinstein manifold. So I replaced the complex cyclical space with a synthetically complex hype-like Einstein filling of that straight digital complex here manifold and I CR manifold, and I do the same thing to find a serial invariant of differentials at a system of ODEs for horizontal circles, horizontal curves, and the curves transfers to the horizontal distribution, which should correspond to change. But there is no special reason to expect that those curves are identical. Those curls are identical to the curls defined through the normal quarton connection. So I need to check. But well, my expectation is that for probably for integrable strict digital convex CR manifolds, they end up to the same class, same set of curves, but probably there is a class of non-integrable. And in that case, I'm I'm well about 50% sure if they agree. But if they agree in some cases, then well, I need to know, or I want to know the ultimate solution, but if they agree. Because the normal when when you say the normal for example, When you consider normal curl-town connection, there is a normality condition for general curl-town connections, and that normality condition is given by some operator which is related to the algebraic homology. And there is no reason to expect that normality condition is related somehow to Einstein collision and harboring math equation. So if that happens, if the If these set of curves, sets of curves, happen to be the same, then I need to find out the reason, the ultimate reason. And also there's a room for similar work for something like combat maps between H3 to n Poincaré-Einstein manifolds or a synthetically complex cycle manifolds. I have no idea what happens for those. idea what happens for those cases but undoubtedly true undoubtedly true that did you have some conclusion about formal considerations of lapse between those okay I still have looks a little but I stop here thank you very much For now, it's a question.
