Organized workshop. I've enjoyed myself very much, both at workshop and outside workshop. So I haven't really done that much research using biobank data. My focus is in cancer research. And so as we know, the biobank data is very large. And in the big biobank case, you have like half million individuals. However, cancer is still relatively However, cancer is still relatively infrequent. So despite the large number, we only have several thousand of cases in the Gibbatobank. And for genetic discovery, we really need a large number of cases. So I'm going to share a couple projects that we actually still touch upon, the biobank data, and just to share our experiences and how we use biobank data or integrate them into our research, our kinds of research. So a little bit of background here. So a little background here. I've been involved in a consortium called the Genetics and Epidemiology of Korean Cancer Consortium, shorthanded by Gecko. And this consortium is led by Wikipeders. So I've been using this consortium for more than 15 years plus. This is a growing consortium, includes more than 80 studies. Each of those and 150,000 participants. Participants, and each of those individuals has GWAS data. And we also spent a lot of effort to harmonize the lifestyle environmental risk factors that are identified to be associated with colorectal cancer risk. And certainly lots of work in the harmonization part of it. So, this is the cancer consortium. So, in addition to those data, we actually also have follow-up data. We also have follow-up data on the cancer patients, including their treatment and survival data. Treatment is a little spotty, but we do have survival data. We also have tumor characteristic data for more than 15,000 patients. This slide is slightly old. We are also in the process collecting spatial omics data and also tumor immune filtration. The new filtration data. So, in the last year, we partnered with the UK and Asian consortia. So, we conducted perhaps the largest GWAS for carotid cancer to date. That includes 100,000 cases, 150,000 controls. Through this effort, we identified 50 new GWAS loci. GWAS loci and validated or confirmed 150 that have been previously identified. So, in total, we feel comfortable to say that there are about 205 GWAS lips that are associated with carotid cancer risk. So, we also have performed TWAS and LOS analysis. So, I'll probably go into the results a little bit later for my second hot talk. So, a little background about current. So, a little background about carotid cancer. So, this essentially can look at the heritable and environmental contributions in carotid cancer based on twin data. So, about one-third of choreotic cancer risk can be attributed to heritable factors, and two-thirds to the environmental factors. So, based on this analysis, we set out to develop a risk approach. To develop a risk, a prediction model based on lifestyle environmental risk factors as well as genetic variants. So we call it e-score and g-score. E-score consists of major risk factors that have been shown to be associated with chorotic cancer risk. So G-score here only includes 63 SNPs, and those were the SNPs that were identified to be the known loss at the time when we developed the model. The model. So I guess the take-home message here is that we find that both E variables or E-score and G-scores contribute independently to the core defensive case. So we explore the utility of the risk prediction model. So we sort of take the strategy, so-called eco-risk, eco-management. Meaning that based on the risk prediction model, Based on the risk prediction model, we know that people have different, or actually just in general, people have different risks for developing coronavirus cancer. So, based on the risk prediction model, we can calculate the expected risk or estimate risk for each individual based on their risk genetic and environmental risk profile. So, what we did is that we, so it's essentially survival model, so essentially we determine at which age. At which age the person 10 years of developing carotid cancer reached the threshold. So you can imagine if someone has a high risk, it may have the same risk for developing carotid cancer at an earlier age compared to someone with a low risk profile. So we use that to determine to say that if somebody has a certain age reached that particular threshold, we say that the person should start screening. So this is actually the plot to show. So this essentially is the plot to show the recommended age-desert screening groups based on individuals' risk profile. So on the left-hand side is for individuals with family history. On the right hand side is for the individuals without family history. And the red line corresponds to women and the blue line corresponds to men. So women actually have a lower risk for developing coronavirus cancer. Risk for developing carotid cancer compared to men. So that's why men tend to, based on this eco-risk eco-management policy or strategy, that men should have screening at an earlier age than women. And then individuals with positive family history also should have earlier screening age compared to those without feminine history. I think importantly, based on the polygenic risk score, we see there is a wide range. There is a wide range, based on the polynomial, based on the rescore, there's a wide range in terms of the recommended page for starting the screen. So during this, as you can see, this paper was published in 2018. So there were really a lot of movements in this GWAS analysis, and a lot of progress has been made in the GWAS studies for charotic cancer. So we decided to. So, we decided to continue to improve the polygenic risk for the parameters. So, all the known loss are, even based on our most recent GWAS analysis, all the 205 known loans explain about 20% of the familiar risk. So, currently, there are many more yet to be discovered. So, there is a value to use the genome-wide genotype data to build the project. So, our training data is based on this 250. The training data is based on these 250, 400 million individuals that I showed you in the earlier slide. So we have an independent validation data set, and all the studies actually are not included in the GWAS analysis. So Neil is not here, but if he's here, he'll be probably happy to see that JIRA co-board was used as one of the validation data set. So JIRA actually was not easy to The JIRA actually was not easy to access. It's not like you can find back everybody a very easy procedure to access the data. Partially because of the kind of difficulty to get the GIR data, I was not including any of the GWAS analysis. So it really ensured that all of this validation data set were not used in any of those previous findings, including the non-boxed findings. So we sort of look at two sorts of So we sort of look at two strategies. I just want to also mention that among this quarter million, we also have about 60,000 Asian GUS data. So we look at the Eurocentric PRS essentially just based on the European PRS data, GUS data, and then Asian Euro PRS. So we actually tried many strategies, including PRS-CSX, basically sort of like an acceptory. Basically, sort of like your ancestry-specific PRS, but you integrate information from other ancestry and mainly whatever the methods that have been out there, including some of the methods that we have developed in the audience. What we find to work the best for creative cancer is that actually we just simply do a meta-analysis of Asian and Euro GWAS data and use that as a summary synthesis. As a summary surfaces. But we did do a little bit different in the sense we construct the LD matrix based on the composition of the original, based on the original GWAS data. So essentially proportional to this quarter million data. And that turned out to give the best results, perhaps with the smallest confidence interval. So to some degree, I guess it's kind of echo, but Adisha said the But Addisha said probably a lot of variants have common effects across racial ethnic groups. So I think the one message that I want to show here is that, of course, when we increase the sample size, it will improve the AUC estimate, but the most significant improvement is in the Asian and Hispanic group. And I think that including the Asian group or the diverse group helps improve the performance. Improve the performance in the target population. However, we're still very much lagged behind in the black or African American output. So this is just the odds racial estimates. Again, we see this odds racial estimates for Asian, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white are similar. And for black, African American is more attenuated. But nevertheless, it's still predictive. Left dress is still predictive in this group. So, again, this is JIRA cohort. So, we actually built the R1 with the Kaiser Pomanetic Vescular. So, that's how we got to their data to validate our model. So, this is the probability of developing coronavirus cancer by age. by age. So on the and it's a little bit busy on the top left is for African American and top right is for Asian and top left is for Hispanic and top, I mean both bottom left is for Hispanic and bottom right is for non-Hispanic white as one would have expected. So this is essentially 5% Pola and the middle 4 and the middle between 25 to 75 percent, and bottom against lower 5 percent, lower quarter percent. So, you can see there is a substantial difference between individuals in the higher risk group and persons in the lower risk group. And that difference is very prominent in the non-Hispanic white group. And for the African, it sort of tends to be awkward. So, we also did a decision curve analysis, again, based on the It's again based on the JRA code. So, this is standardized net net benefit. Essentially, you calculate it based on your model, you calculate the true positive, you minus the false positive, but each false positive comes with a cost. So you look at the essentially difference of the true positive minus false positive, but the number by itself probably is not very meaningful. So, we also sort of take the ratio compared to so-called the maximum possible attainable net benefit. Attainable net benefit. What that means is that we calculate the value, assuming the test has the perfect sensitivity and perfect specificity, and divide by the number. So what I show here is kind of like a percentage. So like what is the percentage of maximum metabolism that achieved? So the blue dotted line is for the polygenic waste score model, and the green line is the family history. And the red vertical line is a threshold. red vertical line is a threshold for the average risk of developing curiosity at age 45 because the current guideline is to recommend everyone to have carotid cancer at age 45. So if we use the risk threshold as some sort of balance between cause and benefit, we can see that actually incorporating the polygon risk score can actually improve this benefit considerably based on just time and history alone. Just time and history alone. I just wanted to add in a little information about creative cancer risk. So it's only two years ago that it lowered the age from 50 to 45. What that means to the healthcare organization is that it added another 20 million individuals that are newly eligible for COVID-19 screening. It created as a lot of burden to the healthcare organization. So, some type of risk-stratifying strategy might be helpful here because the Be healthy because the risk for younger age is still very low. Yeah, so just a little concluding remark here. So what we found here is that if we include the Asian Chiwa Sala, it has improved the performance for the Asian and Hispanic population, but it really hasn't improved for African-American population. So the next step, of course, we want to integrate the data for the African American population. America population, but the sample size remains to be very limited. We have scraped the bottom of the barrels and have been contacting a lot of people. All we have up to now is only about 3,600 cases and 28,000 controls. So we're thinking other alternative strategies. One of the strategies Ian Bizon and Visha says is that maybe many of these functional variants, their association are more likely reproducible across. More likely reproducible across racial ethnic groups. So we're thinking to integrate those functional information to help identify those variants that are more generalizable across ethnic groups. We start to see a little bit of improvement and hopefully sometime I can share the new results. The last thing I just want to mention here is that I've been focusing a lot on the polygenic resource, but we own all, you know. Risk work, but we all know most of the variation or the risk is attributed to lifestyle environmental risk factors. And we actually spend a lot of time to build the model based on those factors, but when we apply the risk model to the tutorial, the performance falls kind of flat. So I think the measurement error and variety of estimate bias and so on, it remains a huge issue for life size. Remains a huge issue for a lifestyle programme to perspective. I think there's a long way to go to improve on the end. Sounds like I'm running out of time. I don't have time for my second project, but I'll just stop here. Quick question for the presentation. Nice work. It's really awesome to see this coming along. It seems like one of the best applications possibly for colleges. We're still all on the new parts, though. With the E-score and G-score, as we call them, the environmental score may be higher for some populations on average, and the polygenic score may have less predicted value for some populations on average. Bringing those two things together, like if you were to change age screening recommendations, how does that fit together at a population-level basis? Like, you broke this down by sex. Does this also change by population? If you were to stratify based on how those average E-scores and G-scores are playing out and related questions. Related question is: You said 20 million people are eligible for screening. Like, out of curiosity, how many people are newly taking advantage of that screening? I'm guessing there's like kind of a bias to not get screened. That's right. So, how is that all? How are those dynamics working? Yeah, so that's a very good question. And we also have separate work on the cost-effective analysis. So, the obvious thing is just But obviously, they just changed the screening policy two years ago, and I think there are a lot of campaign work that will remind those young people that you're now eligible for cancer screening. So the way that we think about it, we have a project with the Kazar Permanente Colorado site. We're putting a brand application, but it hasn't been very successful to get funded. So the idea that we have in that video brand application is that we Is that we invite, of course, the eligible members to join the study. Actually, before we target, it's actually target those, to your point, target those who have not taken a screening within a year of 2045. So those are probably the top steps. And so invite them to join the study and then provide the complete testing results back to them based on Back to them based on their risk profile, both P-score and G-score. And the thought is that if they're more aware they're in a high-risk stratum, perhaps they're more motivated to take the script. So that's sort of the idea of that project. It hasn't quite flagged well from the universe yet. And any comments on the key score and How the p-score and the g-score differences in utility across populations and how it might play together. Like, your polygenic score doesn't work as well in operating switch populations, but maybe your U-score might be elevated. How are those dynamics playing into your model? Yeah, so very, very good question. So, we haven't looked too much on that for the key score across the population, but we tend to, we didn't look at it, but we tend to. To, we didn't look at it, but we tend to think that those, so there are two aspects. One is the effect size. We tend to think the effect size for e-score tend to be similar across racial ethnic groups, but the prevalence of the risk factors can be different, kind of like genetic variables as well. That's even though the effect size may be similar across mutual ethnic groups, but some variants may be more common in one. Some variant may be more common in one group than the other. So that's sort of the hypothesis we are operating under. For polygenic resource, I mean, there's another thing which I didn't touch upon, is that we know that the distribution of polygenic re-square, let's just assume the effect size is the same across all ratio F numbers. But we know the polygenic rescue distribution is going to be different because it's sum of beta times g, and because the mean and the variance for the gene is different, so of course the whole distribution. Different, so of course, for distribution of this, it's going to be different across racial ethnic groups. And when it comes to the ethnics population, like you was talking about, that becomes even more challenging. I know what eMERGE has done is that the use, I don't know what you want in eMERGE, is to sort of try to recalibrate the polygenic rescue using the genome and trying to put them on the same footing so you can sort of determine the pontiac. That looks nice in a picture of this, because under the right hand. That looks nice in a picture of it, sweeps under the right the fact that they are fundamentally still a different value across populations. That's it.
