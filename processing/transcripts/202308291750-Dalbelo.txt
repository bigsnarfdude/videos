Thank you. Thank you very much. Good afternoon for you that are in Mexico and good evening for the one which are here in Brazil. First, I would like to say that it is a pleasure for me to present my work in this conference, and I also would like to thank the organized conference. I also would like to thank the organized committee for the opportunity. And I also would like to say that I am really sorry for not being participating in person. Unfortunately, in this time, it was not possible for me to come in Mexico. So I'm sorry for that. Well, I will talk about invariance and the Whitney eximilarity of images of finite morphisms. And this is a joint work with Marcel Saya and Miriam Pereira. And in fact, this is a work in progress. Marcelo, Miriam, and I. Marcelo, Miriam, and I, we have been working in this project for some time and we have found some difficult obstacles. So today I would like to share some ideas with you and to present the result, a simple result. A simple result that we have so far. So, if you have any ideas or suggestions, they are very welcome. Let me start presenting some motivation. Oops. Well, the search for The search for invariants to describe X singularity conditions is a very important problem in singularity theory, in especially the Whitney X singularity. Among those invariants, we can quote, for instance, the Euler obstruction. The local Euler obstruction was defined by Was defined by MacPherson as a tool to prove the line engraming the conjecture about the existence of the churn classes for similar varieties. The local wire obstruction and the Whitney exingularity and the concept of Whitney exingularity are Singularity are strongly related with polar multiplicities. The polar multiplicities and the polar varieties and the polar multiplicities were introduced by Tessier in these two key papers in singularity theories with the purpose of controlling the Whitney. Of controlling the Wittniak single arrow of hypersurfaces with isolated singularity. In what follow, I will briefly describe the polar variety and the polar multiplicities. Well, let it Z in In Cn be a D-dimensional germ at zero of a complex analytical set. And let P from Cn to C D minus K plus one be a generic linear projection such that the kernel That the kernel of this projection is a linear subspace of Cn of this dimension of codimension D minus K plus one for K from zero to D minus one. The noting Denoting by this way the restriction of this projection to Z0, where Z0 is the smooth part of Z. Then we can define the polar variety. Let P K Z B be the subset of Z defined by the Z. set of Z defined as the closer as the closure of the points in the smooth part of Z such that these points are in the critical locus of this restriction of the restriction of the projection P to Z we call this set Set BKZP the polar variety associated to Z with respect to P. Well, the K invariant of the polar variety is its multiplicity, which we denote here in this way, but sometimes. But sometimes also of this way. Okay. Let us remember that for generic choices of the projection P, where is P here, for generic choices of the projection P, this multiplist is constant, okay? Is constant, okay? Which means that for generic choices of this projection, the multiplicity does not depend on P. Okay, as I said before, the local ideal structure is strongly related with the polar varieties and with the And with the polar multiplicities. And in fact, we have this very important result proved by Le and Thessier, which says that if Z is an analytic space of dimension D at zero, then the local Euler obstruction of Z is given in this way. Is given in this way, by this way, is given as an alternating sum of the polar multiplicities of Z. The polar multiplicities are also a key to in the studying of the Wichinetic similarity of. Of families of germs, as we can see in this result of Gaffney. Gaffney proved that supposing that X is a family of isolated complete intersection singularity, then X is within a singular along of the parameter space if and If and only if all polar multiplicits and also the top polar multiplicits are constant along t. Okay, well, in fact, we have others, many others important papers dedicating. Papers dedicated to studying the Whitney singularities of families using polar multiplicities and other invariants and concepts associated to them. And just to quote some of them, I will mention these three works. The first one, The first one is a paper of Nui Valesteros and João Tomazer dedicated to study the Wittney singularity of families of map germs between curves. The second one is a work of Nuim Balesteros, Orefio Camoto, and João Tomazella, where here they where here they studied uh they they present um among other results they present conditions um for the whitney singularity of families of isolated determinantal singularities and those results is also using the polar multiplicities and they are in And they are, in fact, as inspiration, they have this, they use this result from Gaffney. The last one, the third one, is our work of Gaffney and Sigina dedicated to study the Wittenic similarities of essential isolated determinantal singularities. Determinant of singularities, which is a very important class of determinant of right, and that in general has not isolated singularity. In this work, they use tools which are kind of generalizations of the polar multiplicities. Okay. And now in this, oops, sorry, in this sequence of papers, the authors studied properties of analytical varieties, which can be described as an image of some other analytical variety. Analytical varieties. To do this, they use the properties of the variety in the source and also of the map between the varieties. For instance, in this work of Roberto Bedrigao, Marcelo Saya and João Tomazella, the authors computed The authors composed the polar multiplicits of analytical variety which are made by a finite map of ICE, of completely of isolated complete intersection. And in fact, when we In fact, when we started this project, we were in fact inspirated by this work. And our goal is to remove these hypotheses. I mean, our goal is to study varieties given by the image of The image of other analytic override by finite map, but without Z being necessarily an issue. So let me fix it some the following setup: let Z. Let Z and Y be germs at zero, both of the same dimension D. And let F bar denote a map from Cn to C P such that Y, the variety Y is the image. Is the image of the variety Z by the map F bar. And the restriction of F bar to Z, which we denote in this way, just by F without bar, is a finite map. We also define this set that we That we call sigma kf, which is the closure of the points in the smooth part of z such that the derivative of f bar in this point has hang less than d minus k. And remember that d is the D is the dimension of the variety Z and Y. Well, to compute the polar multiplicit of Y, we need to consider this set as we saw in the definition. But this set have the disadvantage that they are in the target. The target, and we do not know anything about their geometry which could help us to compute this invariant. So, our strategy is to compute the polar multiplicits in the target in terms of the invariants associated. Associated to this subset of Z and this subset and also of this subset. And both this and this one, they have the advantage that they are in the source. So What we proved so far is this result. In fact, it is a simple result. And in the above conditions, just to remember, we have Z and Y analytical, reduces the analytical override, both with override both with the same with the same dimension and we consider f bar an analytical a map germ satisfying this equality which means that y is the image of z by f bar such that the restriction of f to z is a finite map. Z is a finite map. Then, if you if we denoting by S K F the dimension of this set that we had defined before, then we have these three situations. For if the dimension of sigma kf Of sigma kh is equal to d minus k, then we can compute the polar multiplicity in the target in terms of this degree, of the degree of f and also of the multiplicity of the image of the set sigma kf. Sigma kf, where here I forgot to to put, but p d minus k is a sufficiently generic projection from Cp to D minus K. If the dimension of dimension of the set sigma kf is smaller than d minus k, then the multiplicity of the target is computed in terms of these two degrees. And the third and the last situation is if this dimension is bigger. Is bigger than d minus k, then in this case, the multiplicity is computed in terms of this degree, of the degree of f, and also of this degree. Okay, well, just to finish, this is a simple result, but A simple result, but as a direct consequence, for instance, in this situation, we can compute the Euler obstruction of I, of the variety I, Y, using the Lay-Nesse formula and this result by alternating some of Alternating sum of degrees. Okay. Well, as I said before, this is a work in progress. And in fact, it was the first time that I talked about this subject. So for me, it has been a little difficult. But talk about some work. talk about some work it's a nice way to to try to to continue and to try to finish the work so uh thank you very much muchas gracias thank you is there any question or comment now in the chat no No, yeah, we have one question. Hi, Thais. Hi. It's just a remark is that you are also considering the question of the Whitney equisingularity, right? And there was a question by Terry Gaffney if Whitney equisingularity in the top. Witness equisingularity in the target would imply a witnessing in the source, right? And for some time we believed it was true, but more or less recently, Otonio has some examples showing that this is not always true. Yeah, that's just a remark. Okay, thank you. I will search the Atonio's paper. Thank you. Paper. Thank you. Is there any other question? If not, well, we thank Dais for this talk. Thank you. Thank you. And now we have the next and last talk of today.
