Thank you to the organizers for having me and for all of you for coming. So I guess I'm going to be maybe the portion of today that's going to be more about fractons than the beyond part of the conference. And so today I'm going to be talking about some new work in collaboration with. Work in collaboration with a graduate student at Harvard, Nat, who is in the audience over there. I couldn't find a good picture of him, but most of you have probably met him before already. So if not, I would encourage you to use kind of the driving force behind this work that I'm going to be talking about today that's on the archive. And it's basically about trying to come up with some ways of systematically searching for fracton orders in a way that. Orders in a way that, with the eventual goal of maybe teasing out some classification schemes and also maybe some universal data that might be contained in these facton orders. But this is a maybe starting point for that kind of grand goal. And it's a little bit complementary to some of the approaches that we already heard about yesterday, where that also involved kind of looking for new kinds of fracton orders. So, just to give a little bit of background, so we understand symmetry-protected topological phases, like conventional symmetry-protected topological phases, fairly well in two spatial dimensions. For example, there's classification of certain symmetry-protected topological phases based on group cohomology. And here, of course, the phases are inequivalent if one respects some symmetry and are made equivalent. Symmetry and are made equivalent if you violate the symmetry. And a simple example is provided by the 2D Ising SPT. So in this case, I have Ising spins in two spatial dimensions, and there are two different SPTs that are protected by the global Ising symmetry, and one of them is just a trivial paramagnet. And it's always easiest to kind of think of many of these SPTs that have an on-site unitary global symmetry in terms of a condensative domain walls of the symmetry group. So for the trivial power magnet. Group. So for the trivial paramagnet, it's just an equal amplitude superposition of all of the domain wall configurations. And then the non-trivial SBT state is this state proposed by Lemon and Gu, or discussed extensively by them at least, where the domain walls come with a relative minus sign, and so the amplitudes in the wave function can differ by a minus sign that has to do with essentially the total number of connected components in the system that are pointing up or down. So the inequivalent. So, the inequivalence of these two SPTs, and also the fact that this is really a complete classification of the Ising SPTs in SPT in two spatial dimensions, can be seen in a variety of different ways. But one way that was discussed in their paper, which is going to be a starting point for my own investigation of fractons, is basically to gauge the symmetry. And gauging the symmetry effectively tests whether or not the two SPZ orders are related. Whether or not the two SPC orders are related, and the reason is that essentially I want to see, even before I gauge the symmetry, how a pi flux of the symmetry in the SPT kind of behaves. And it behaves very differently in this trivial paramagnet versus the Levin-Goose state. Of course, this pi flux becomes a deconfined fractionalized excitation when I gauge the symmetry. It becomes an enion. And that anion has very different statistics than the two topological orders that I get when I gauge the Ising symmetry. Orders that I get when I gauge the Ising symmetry. So in the one case, I get just toric code topological orders, so just ordinary Z2 gauge theory. And in the other case, I get double semi-on topological order, where the pi flux has semi-on statistics instead of both statistics. Now, of course, we know that there's no finite-depth local unitary transformation that can change the statistical properties of these anions. And by extension, a corollary of that is that if you go back to the SVTs, there's no finite depth symmetric local unitary circuit that can take. Symmetric local unitary circuit that can take you between these two. And we've gauged the symmetry, there's really the fact that there's no finite depth circuit here at all is equivalent to the statement that there is no symmetric one here that can take you between the non-trivial and the trivial SPTs. Yes. I I don't quite understand this picture in detail. Can you explain a little bit which part of the picture should Which part of the picture should after gauging the green? Yeah. So in terms of the lattice original lattice model, what is one of those? In one case it's equivalent, in the other case you get a minus sign. Yeah, so yeah, so if you think about this in terms of the wave function, so the torque code wave function is you can think of as loops of the electric charge, let's say, and an equal amplitude superposition of all possible configurations of those loops. In the double Loops. In the double semion model, you get a relative minus sign when you have every time you nucleate one of these loops, essentially, relative to a configuration that has one fewer rooms. But are those loops equivalent to these domain walls that you talked about in the top? Yeah, they are. So really, when I say that I'm gauging ising symmetry, maybe an easier way to think about it is really a duality transformation. So in this case, I have spin degrees of freedom on sites. But if I describe this state in a dual language where I'm in the domain-wall Hilbert space, then really I'm describing a Z2H. Then really I'm describing a Z2 gauge theory. In this case, I'm describing the double semi-ontopological order. Right. Yeah, hopefully that's clear. And of course, so this at least establishes that these two SVT states are inequivalent, but then I can also ask: well, maybe there are more topological orders that can be described in terms of just one string that has no branching, which is like an Ising domain wall. No branching, which is like an Ising domain wall. And if there are, then there should be other Ising SPT states in two spatial dimensions. And more precisely, like on the gauge side, on this dual topologically ordered side, we can ask if there are other kinds of topological orders and other braiding statistics that are consistent with the same set of fixed fusion rules. Right? And which is equivalent to asking this sort of question in a more technical language for those of you who are kind of more familiar with. Kind of more familiar with two-dimensional topological orders, which is there's a local move between the sort of loops of the electric condensed loops of the electric charge in the topologically ordered phase, and that local move can pick up any phase, not just a minus sign, and why isn't this possible? And the reason is known, obviously, that the wave functions for topologically ordered phases are constrained by consistency conditions. And these consistency conditions are local moves that essentially tell you that any way of going from one condensed configuration. From one condensed configuration of closed loops of electric charges to another must accrue the same phase. And that restricts this phase factor to just be plus or minus one. Now, this is actually, in a more rigorous sense, very much equivalent to the SPT classification problem when I'm thinking about an on-site unitary symmetry group, G. So in two spatial dimensions, the SPT classification just comes from, more formally, from the third group coherent. More formally, from the third group cohomology of G. And you can show essentially that the same problem, which is if I now, on the topologically ordered side, I fix my fusion rules and branching rules based on some group G, and I ask for all of the braiding statistics that are consistent with that set of fixed fusion rules. That's exactly the same question. It's classified also by the third group cohomology of G. So there really is a more formal one-to-one correspondence between these two. Formal one-to-one correspondence between these two things. So these are quantum double models that I'm thinking about, where really the input information is a group and not just a category. So where fractons come in is really in some analogous way. So many gap fracton orders in three spatial dimensions are dual to subsystem symmetry protected topological orders. This has been well known for some time. And we heard a lot about, well, both fracton orders and subsystem symmetry orders yesterday. Acton orders and subsystem symmetry orders yesterday, so I'll give a very brief overview of them. So, subsystem symmetries are on-site, they're unitary symmetries, but they act on subextensively many sites in the system. So, they're not local, but they're not strictly global in that they don't affect every site in the system. So, a simple example is in two spatial dimensions, I can think about spins on the sites of a square lattice whose dynamics are sort of constrained essentially by some line-like subsystem symmetries. Line-like subsystem symmetries. And these line-like subsystem symmetries are, for example, if I flip all of the spins along a line in the vertical direction or in the horizontal direction, that that's a symmetry of the system. So it's sort of quasi-global. There are more complicated subsystem symmetries as well, which are sort of fractal-like in the sense that they're interacting. They're lattice models one can write down where the kind of Ising symmetries don't act on a simple line. Don't act on a simple line or a plane, but they act on some regions that have a self-similar structure and are therefore called fractal-like. The connection to fractons comes from, again, as before, looking at a dual description of these types of states in higher dimensions. When you have line-like subsystem symmetries and you look at an ordered phase with respect to those subsystem symmetries, the domain walls in that phase. Symmetries, the domain walls in that phase are constrained to move in exactly the same way that the charged excitations in a fracton phase are constrained to move. And that duality has been employed pretty successfully in higher dimensions and three dimensions, let's say, to kind of find fracton orders more easily. So to sort of restate that, so I can take an SSPT state. So now an SSPT state is going to be a state State different ground states, let's say, that are symmetric with respect to some subsystem symmetry, but are inequivalent if I actually preserve that symmetry in sort of strict analogy to conventional symmetry-protected topological orders. So in three spatial dimensions, for example, I can consider some subsystem symmetry group G and an SSPT state, where the ground state is a condensate of the domain walls of this subsystem symmetry group. And what I mean by the statement. And what I mean by the statement box above there is just that if I look at the same state in a domain wall description, I really get fracton order in three and higher spatial dimensions. In lower dimensions, you can show that the dual description can also be some sort of SSBT state, or it can have maybe conventional topological order, but it can't have fracton order in these gap systems. So, to make this more concrete, an example of An example of a very simple SSPT state, which is kind of the analog of a trivial paramagnet in the case where you have planar symmetries, is the one that I've shown on the left here. So I have a cubic lattice with spins sitting on the sites of the lattice, and I have Ising symmetries on every XYYZ XZ plane. So I can flip all the spins on any plane, and that's a symmetry of my system. That's a symmetry of my system, and I can write down a wave function which is symmetric with respect to those symmetries. And a dual description of that state in the sort of domain wall Hilbert space is actually a fracton order and is the X cube fracton order. And this was originally the way that this X cube order was kind of found. This is, of course, a trivial SSPT state. It's really just a paramagnet. But there are other possibilities when one But there are other possibilities when one has planar symmetries that correspond to different fracton orders in the same way that different 2D SSPT states correspond to different 2D topological orders. So this you would call a trivia. The Plaquette state is a trivial SPT. Yeah, so really I haven't written down a wave function here. I guess the right the Hamiltonian consists of these interaction terms which are just on sites and that respects this planar symmetry and yes, the ground state is just a trivial state, yeah. Just a trivial state, yeah. But there are other possibilities, which I am not showing yet. But those been explored? I think over the past few years, yes, there are quite a few people in the audience who've worked on these things. And I think the bulk of this talk is going to be about kind of going back and forth between these two pictures, but using a different approach to kind of classify, in some sense, S. Classify in some sense SSPT states and also their dual fracton orders. But so the overview of this talk, or kind of the punchline, is I'm essentially going to be deriving kind of constraints for the wave functions of fracton phases in three dimensions, which are going to be in some sense constructive because they allow me to find fracton orders in 3D. And by extension, they're dual subsystem symmetry protected topological orders. Topological orders in a way that's very analogous to what we saw with 2D SPT states. And really, I'll be going kind of back and forth between these two pictures, which is to say that sometimes it's easier to think about the SSPTs and then to go to the fracton orders, and sometimes it's easier to go the other way around. And what I mean precisely by deriving constraints will become clear through examples. But really, the analogy I want to draw is just to summarize again. Just to summarize again, that in 2D, if I have an on-site unitary symmetry G, global symmetry G, then to construct a GSPT, one way I could do it is I take as input this global symmetry, and I think about all of the consistent wave functions I can write down that are condensates of domain walls of this symmetry group. And there are consistency conditions, which are different ways of reaching a domain wall configuration using these local moves. And that has to be such a To be such, essentially, such that these consistency conditions one can write down and essentially are the same as the sort of string net equations that one would write down for the dual topological order. But the output is essentially the possible GSPTs and these topological orders. And this is essentially what I'm going to be doing, except for fracton phases and their dual subsystem symmetry protected phases. So the overview. So, the overview really is the, and to black box the whole thing, I want to take as input some subsystem symmetry group in some number of dimensions. But the subsystem symmetry group, of course, acts along some sub-manifolds. It acts along planes, it acts along lines. So in addition to the subsystem symmetry group, I have to specify some lattice translation group that tells me how the subsystem symmetry group changes as I translate from one site to the other. So the input is going to be a subsystem symmetry group and a lattice translation group in some number of spatial dimensions. Translation group in some number of spatial dimensions. And then I'll propose similar local moves between elementary kind of domain wall configurations of this symmetry group. The local moves are going to be constrained by the translation symmetry which I impose, which essentially means that I kind of fix a unit cell along with the lattice translation group. And there's no real way to think about this SSPT state and the local moves that I'll be talking about. PT state and the local moves that I'll be talking about in the continuum. But nevertheless, one can write down these local moves between elementary domain wall configurations. So, pictorially, what I mean by that is, so previously I had a system, a 2D square lattice with line-like subsystem symmetries. And you can ask if I have these line-like symmetries, which are essentially like a spin-flip along a vertical row of spins. Well, where do the domain walls of this symmetry live? Obviously, if it was a globalizing symmetry, the domain walls would live on links. But when I have this line-like subsystem symmetry, it turns out that the domain walls actually live on plaquette centers. And the way to see this is that the simplest operator that one can write down, which is sort of invariant under all of the symmetry transformations, is an operator that lives on a plaquette. And so the domain wall itself must live on the dual. Must live on the dual, essentially sites of the dual lattice. And the local moves are going to be some local moves that allow me to move domain wall configurations subject to some constraint. In lower dimensions, like in 2D, for example, a domain wall can't end. It has to close in on itself, which is a constraint. In 1D, you always have an even number of domain walls. And there are similar constraints in higher dimensions for subsystem. Higher dimensions for subsystem SPTs. And then I can write down these relative consistency conditions on relative amplitudes in the wave function for an SSPT state and solve them. And then the output is the possible translationally invariant GSSPTs and their dual fracton orders. It's important that these are translationally invariant GSSPTs, so it's not, so the So, the subsystem symmetry protected order is protected both by the symmetry group and by the translation symmetry that I've chosen. And heuristically, the wave function for the SPT state is going to look something like this, some condensate of these domain walls with some phase factors that I've solved for. And in higher dimensions, this will give me some fracton phases. So, some comments on maybe high-level comments on High-level comments on differences and maybe similarities between this and other approaches that have been taken to do this, so taken to do similar things in the past. So the consistency conditions that we write down and that we solve for give in higher dimensions fracton phases and SPT phases that are distinct up to the action of a finite depth translationally invariant quantum circuit. So this is a different equivalence relation than what people often consider for fractal. Than what people often consider for fracton phases, where you have a foliated equivalence relation where you're allowed to add layers of two-dimensional states. Or even in lower dimensions, there are other works where people have thought about linear depth quantum circuits and that as an equivalence relation on SSPT states. And this is really just classifying translationally invariant fracton orders. And for SSPTs, this leads to a natural definition. This leads to a natural definition of weak versus strong phases. So for us, weak and strong SSPT states have been defined previously in the literature, but in this classification, a weak SSPT state is one that doesn't actually need translation symmetry in order to be protected. So in many instances, the fact that we've input some translation symmetry group, it can sort of be removed at the end, and you can just show that it's just a crutch and you don't actually need it to protect either the fracton order or the SSPT order. Order or the SSPT order. An advantage of this approach, and maybe a disadvantage as well, when one solves these equations, the searches that we perform are sort of exhaustive given the symmetry group and the translation group, as well as some interaction range. So we can also say in some sense that there aren't any fracton orders that are dual to some SSPT orders with some range of interaction in some number of dimensions. And the And on the flip side, because the approach is so microscopic, it's often hard to tease out, unless we do quite a lot of work, what exactly these phases are and what the universal data is in these states. Okay, so this is all relatively vague and kind of at a high level. And for most of the rest of the talk, I think I'll be dealing with actually an example in 1D, which employs basically the same techniques that we use in higher dimensions, but is sort of a repackaging of what we already know about 1D SPT. Of what we already know about 1D SPTs, except in a language that kind of generalizes more easily to SSPTs and to Fracton orders. In 1D, I mean, what is the SSPT? So yeah, in 1D, there are no, I'm just going to be thinking about global symmetries. But the formalism that's employed is something that one can generalize if you just replace thinking about domain walls in the global symmetry with domain walls and the subsystem symmetries. The reason I want The reason I want to start with 1D is because we already know the answer very well, and just that the projective representations of a symmetry group classify all of my 1D SPTs. So I want to see exactly how that data shows up when I solve for these SPTs in a totally different way that involves sort of putting out consistency conditions for the relative amplitudes in a wave function. So let me explain what I mean. So I'm going to think about a 1D system with an Ising symmetry. So I have spins, there's a spin-flip. So I have spins, there's a spin-flip symmetry with respect to which I have a ground state that is symmetric. I'll also at some point consider time reversal symmetry, which is in this case will just be complex conjugation. So I want to, when building a wave function that's symmetric with respect to this symmetry, think about domain wall variables. I can, in this case, for this spin configuration, I've drawn these dual sites where I have a domain wall and where one is absent. And the local moves between the elementary domain wall configurations are going to be specified by picking a unit cell as well as a translation group and then writing down all of the possible things that domain walls can do within a certain region. That is to say, I can pick these two sites on the dual lattice where the domain walls can live. And the local moves could be that there are no domain walls on those two sites. Domain walls on those two sites, and then I pick up a phase factor if two of them pop up. Obviously, there are four such moves that I can write down if I restrict myself to just the two sites, because there are two possibilities for the domain wall configuration on each of these sites that I've shown here. You flipped a spin between the two. Sure, yeah. Right. But the reason I'm doing everything in terms of the domain walls is just so I have a manifestly symmetric. Walls is just so I have a manifestly symmetric wave function with respect to the Eisen symmetry. Right? Right. So I can package all of this information about the phase factors that one would pick up. So here obviously implicit in this is I've also included a translation group and a unit cell. And I can package all of this information about the phase factors that I would pick up in going between these various domain wall configurations into some matrix. Configurations into some matrix. And for which there are four different phases that I can pick up. But the consistency conditions on the local moves are essentially the constraints that I would have written down, let's say, for the 2D topological orders, which is to say I can start with a domain wall configuration and I can implement some series of local moves. And if I come back to that configuration, I And if I come back to that configuration, I accrue no phase. And that'll be my constraint. Now, all such moves are actually generated by just two sets of moves that I can write down very easily. And one is just squaring this matrix, and the other is acting with this matrix or these moves on adjacent pairs of sites that overlap. So the consistency conditions that I accrue no-phase when I come back to an original configuration. Back to an original configuration are actually just simple constraints on this matrix. They're a simple commutativity condition and also the condition that the matrix squares the identity. This may take some work to see, but is relatively simple once I guess you see that these moves generate all moves that would bring you back to a given domain wall configuration. So, of course, I can solve these conditions and And if I neglect time reversal symmetry, then for the phase factors, so obviously the let me again say that the translation symmetry comes in when I assume that this matrix takes the same form when it acts on pairs of domain walls that are adjacent on any pair that's adjacent in this 1D system. So that's where the translation symmetry is implicit. I can solve these consistency conditions first by neglecting time reversal symmetry, and then naively if I solve these. And then naively, if I solve these conditions, I find that the four phase factors take this following form. So there's a z2 degree of freedom, which is this integer n, and then there's a sort of u1 degree of freedom, which is this phase variable theta, which can be 0 anywhere from 0 to 2 pi. So naively, it looks like I found kind of a Z2 cross U1 classification for 1D SPTs with just a global Z2 symmetry and lattice translation. But of course, this makes But of course, this matrix M is only well defined up to a local symmetric circuit which is translationally invariant. So I can always. So, and what do I mean by symmetric? So in the original spin system, I had a global Ising symmetry. When I dualize it, and when I talk about the domain walls, there's essentially a dual Ising symmetry, which is that the total domain wall charge has to vanish. And this matrix M and any And this matrix M and any unitary that I conjugate it by must commute with that constraint. So if I, it turns out that if you actually study this for a while and study kind of the equivalence relations on M up to the action of a finite depth local symmetric circuit, you can get rid of this U1 degree of freedom and you end up with just a Z2 classification for 1D SPTs with, which we know to be true, with just an Ising symmetry and translation. So, um So in the presence of time reversal symmetry, the answer is more complicated. One gets a Z2 cross Z2 classification, which we also know to be true. There are two Z2 degrees of freedom that specify the local moves. And to understand what exactly these SPTs are, it's kind of easy to think about the ground state wave function in the following way. So the conditions that I've written So, the conditions that I've written down here equivalently allow me to define a commuting projector Hamiltonian using this operator m. And the ground state is just given by projecting onto m as eigenvalue 1 in the dual Hilbert space. So, I'm in this domain-wall Hilbert space. So this is the Hamiltonian that's dual to my SPT and the state that's dual to my SPT state. And if I ungauge this operator with respect to this Ising. This operator with respect to this Ising symmetry, then I get a commuting projector model for the SPT state. So, what does this mean? It means that in 1D without time reversal, this Z2 classification is actually fairly trivial to understand. Obviously, I have a trivial paramagnet in 1D, which is Ising symmetric. But if I flip the sine of the X operator in this paramagnet, then this is actually an SPT, which is distinct. An SVT which is distinct from the trivial paramagnet in the presence of translation symmetry. Thanks. With time reversal symmetry, you can also get a cluster state, which is like a Haldane in the same phase as the Haldane chain if I'm allowed to break the SO3 rotation down to a Z2 subgroup. So with time reversal symmetry, I have an extra generator, extra two generators, only one of which I'm showing on the screen. Generators, only one of which I'm showing on the screen. So let me go through this part fairly quickly. It turns out that you can show that this kind of prescription in 1D, you can generalize to any unitary global symmetry, and you can show that the phase factors that you pick up upon doing these local moves are just simply related to the group cohomology data through this relation that come from what we already know would be the classification of translation. Know would be the classification of translationally invariant GSPTs in one spatial dimension. So basically exactly this prescription is what we end up doing in higher dimensions. In the last five minutes, I'm going to be talking essentially about the results for the classifications that we obtained for both SSPTs and also their dual fracton orders in 3D. You can imagine that these consistency conditions. You can imagine that these consistency conditions get a lot more complicated to write down in higher dimensions, which is why, and I am not as good at drawing pictures on keynotes. So in high dimensions, one can write down similar conditions, but it quickly becomes a numerical exercise to solve these equations and not something that one could do by hand. The difficulty of solving those sorts of consistency conditions in higher dimension scales essentially exponentially with the range of the interaction. The range of the interactions that one wants to write down that describe the kind of fixed-point Hamiltonian. So, we, of course, do the thing that's simplest and hope for the best, but obviously that's not a complete classification unless one extends the range of interaction in the problem. So, I'll just go through some of the solutions of interest that have to do with the fracton models. Do with the fracton models in three dimensions. So, in three spatial dimensions on a cubic lattice, there's some interesting strong SSPTs that we find strong with respect to the definition that I talked about earlier, where you have, they're protected by line-like Ising symmetries along three different directions. And here's one. And here's one generator for one of these SVTs. So, by generator, I mean that there's a unitary circuit that's symmetric that prepares this SVT state. And the kind of fixed point Hamiltonian has terms that look like this. So it's a stabilizer Hamiltonian. And you can show that it's a strong SSPT state by showing that the dual description of this SSPT has a degeneracy that scales in a way that isn't consistent with. Scales in a way that isn't consistent with how the degeneracy should scale if this were actually weak, if this could be trivialized by just breaking translation symmetry. So there are other SSBTs like this that one can find using, you know, with other line-like symmetries, et cetera, in three dimensions. Of course, we know that there are actually some no-go theorems on stabilizer codes that if the subsystem symmetry is sufficiently low-dimensional. Is sufficiently low-dimensional, then no matter what SSPT you have, if you dualize it, you won't get a fracton order, you'll just get some sort of another SSPT or some other more conventional three-dimensional topological order. So we can look at other more complicated symmetries in order to look at kind of more interesting topological orders in order to find sort of interesting fracton topological. In order to find sort of interesting fracton topological orders in 3D. So, here are the most interesting answers in my opinion. So, this procedure allows us to find kind of non-stabilizer codes that actually have fracton order in the three dimensions. So, here's a simple example. On the FCC lattice, if I have planar symmetry, then there is a Z2 process Z2 classification for the strong SSPT phases according to the prescription that we have. And the SPT state is some hypercluster state on the FCC lattice, but the dual C lattice, but the dual fracton order is a symmetry-enriched order. That is to say, here I've this is a fracton order that's symmetry-enriched in that it's if I'm allowed to break any symmetry, then this is actually equivalent to what's known as the checkerboard model in three dimensions. But if I preserve time-reversal symmetry, then this is actually distinct from the checkerboard model as a translationally as a fracton phase. So I think that probably the most interesting. So, I think that probably the most interesting thing that we've gotten so far out of this prescription are kind of non-stabilizer models of this type that are actually symmetry enriched. And perhaps if we increase the kind of the parameters of the search, it would be interesting to see if one could actually find more complicated fraxon orders where you don't actually need this extra time reversal symmetry in order to protect it relative to a known fracton phase. Another interesting one is in 3D with fractal symmetry. And in 3D with fractal symmetry, if we are allowed to break translation and we only have this fractal symmetry, then there's only one SSPT, which is the trivial SSPT, whose dual is Haas code, which we find. But with time reversal symmetry, again, there are two more fractal SSPT generators, and one of which is very interesting. It's the one that's shown over here. So this is protected by a fractal symmetry and also time reversal. Time reversal. But the interesting thing is that this SSPT also has a planar symmetry. So if you gauge the fractal symmetry of this model, you actually find something that has the same fracton order as Haas code, but is distinct if you preserve time reversal. But if you gauge the planar symmetry, then you end up getting an X cube model, which is distinct from the ordinary X cube model again if you preserve time reversal. So this you can think of as a sort of parent SSPT state. A sort of parent SSPT state that, when you gauge it in two different ways, gives you a type 1 Practon order, and in another case, a type 2 order. Anyway, so with that, maybe I'll finish. So this is, at this point, kind of a numerical approach, a sort of brute force approach, by writing down what we think are sort of consistency conditions on fracton wave functions and SSPT wave functions in two and three spatial dimensions. Three spatial dimensions. And of course, the next steps that we're thinking about right now are essentially simplifying these consistency conditions by defining some essential data that can be used to parametrize the solutions to these equations. So maybe what we've done is kind of analogous to in two-dimensional topological order, if you wanted to write down all of the different operators that would sort of measure the magnetic flux. Of course, that's given in terms of some more essential topological data. More essential topological data, which is the F symbol. And of course, the string net equations are written in terms of the F symbol, not in terms of that operator. So we would ideally want to parametrize these equations in some convenient way to actually solve these efficiently without resorting to some numerical approach. Of course, we can also consider more general inputs instead of a subsystem symmetry group. And yeah, so that's basically it. Thanks for your attention. All right, we have a couple minutes. All right, we have a couple minutes for just a few quick questions. Yeah. So in the usual global symmetry domain wall thing, you can put these bases on the different domain wall hopping figures. Let me know that that's all the data you need and that the Pentagon equation is the only equation you need to look at because all higher order consistencies will solve that one. Do you think something like that could be could prove that for you? Yeah, that's what we're trying to think about, which is essentially like Which is essentially like, but yeah, it would be interesting to try to prove something like that, but I don't have anything concrete to say about that right now. Yeah, that would be one way to kind of proceed and try to derive some sort of conditions. The problem is it's hard to do something that generalizes to many subsystem symmetry groups. It seems like you can do things in a very particular way for one sort of group. But at least the neat thing is so far that we So far, that we can certainly simplify these conditions by implementing some point group symmetries. And I think if we do that and still run a sort of brute force search, there are kind of other fractal models that we might find, which would be pretty interesting. Maybe the coolest thing is that you can find non-stabilizer codes using this approach. Yeah. Can I look at the table? Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. So I flashed it up very quickly. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay, cool. So Okay, so is three dimension cubic lattice by cubic you really mean cubic. I mean what I say, yeah. We have some model which we claim SSPT, strong SSPT. Yeah. It's pretty much with plain SMH. Yeah, so so again, this has to do Yeah, so again, this has to do with our difference in the definition of what we call strong. So I think, and this is something that we're still trying to understand. So all of the SSPTs that we call weak are weak SSPTs under your definition, but some of our strong ones are also weak. So basically because we're classifying these up to the action of a finite depth local unitary circuit and not the action of you know you're not allowed to act with the linear depth circuit, which would maybe trivialize. Circuit, which would maybe trivialize. Some of our strong one you would call weak, not the your strong one we would call weak. So the one we call strong would be a weak one in your classification. Is that the case? No. So I think our classification is more generous. Let me just say that. We call certain things strong that you would call weak. So there's probably, there might be a subgroup of this, just a C2 subgroup, which is like what you guys find, but then the other ones are. But then the other ones are probably weak under your definition. But you're all out zero. Which one are you looking at? The blind symmetry? The one is with planar symmetry. Oh, I see. The planar symmetry one. What's a zero? Oh, sorry. I thought I was confused then. I thought you were looking at the line symmetries, that there was some subset of this. Yeah, so I think this must have to do with the fact that in this search, we're restricted. Do with the fact that we're in this search, we're restricting the range of the interaction in the search. So it might be that, for instance, when I nucleate some cluster of domain walls, I could get a phase factor that depends on domain wall configurations that are sort of arbitrarily far away, right? When I look at the dual description of the SPT wave function. But we sort of truncate that when we solve these consistency equations. So that truncation prescription is probably what gives us zero. Maybe I can explain that. Maybe I can explain that offline. Yeah, sorry. All right, it's an interesting time. I think we should start here again. So just hit the stop recording button up there. Button up there to move here so you can converge for this different thing.
