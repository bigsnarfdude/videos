Thank you, and thanks to the organizers for organizing this nice conference, and thanks to the audience for coming at this ungodly hour. I'm requested. I'll try to make it short so that Clover will have time to have some fun as well. So today I'm going to talk about material costal homology, and this is joint with Mike Hill, Carl Ornspie. Michael Carl Ornsby and Paul Arner Vistra, that's how it's pronounced. And can you say it again? Yes, I can. Will you help me to? Paul Arne Vestra. Wait, louder. So for all the ones who are watching this from afar, it's called Paul Arner Estreil. And so we're doing some calculations in Lativik Hochschulford. Some calculations in Mativic Hochschlomology. And why did we do that? Well, for one thing, the Mativic world is interesting in its own right. So there are lots of things there that we want to understand, in particular, community respect. However, I'm mostly interested in this because it is supposed to shed light on the space case. And we've seen that in very many instances. Very many instances where there have been calculations in glotival homology, we saw that yesterday, that gives profound insight to what's going on in the topological situation. And there's so much we don't understand about the commutative structure of topological Hochschlomology. So, Hoch-homology, well, that's the thing there. I'm going to come back to it several times. But today, the base ring is going to be the motivic sphere spectrum. And for simplicity, we choose an algebraically closed field of characteristic different from 2. Okay, so think of the complex numbers, that's a brilliant example. And for all purposes, that will be the interesting example. And C here is going to be the mod to motivate Einberg-McLane spectrum. Today, I'm very mid-Lane spectrum. And so I'm focusing on the prime, on the even primes. And of course, you can do this on the odd primes as well, but then you perhaps should ask Mike about that. He is an expert on those kind of things. So some of you have heard me talk about something quite similar earlier on. And what I'm going to tell you today is What I'm going to tell you today is that this actually isn't as complicated as I told you before. So we have this wonderful approach, which has its benefits. And I must admit that there are things about the simple approach that I probably wouldn't have guessed if we had made it complicated first. But today we're just going to muddle through, do the ordinary stuff, and it will actually work. And it will actually work. Well, because of this dual thing, that in the botypic world, things are quite a lot more complicated, but you have way more structure. And those two things turn out to even each other out. So it becomes not that bad. Okay, so I tried a didactic approach, new one today. And on this right-hand side, it's right-hand when I stand like that. Side is right hand when I stand like that. That right hand side, very little is going to happen, it's just going to repeat or remind you of stuff that happened on previous slides. So, apart from this slide and one more slide, nothing will happen on the right-hand side. It's just there for reference. And so, but of course I have to build the right-hand side first, and that's what I'm going to do now. Okay, so bear with me, and because I want to. And because I want to emphasize that what Hochschland homology is, is given by your context. So we could discuss what should we mean by motivating Hochschlomology. And I will take this approach here where there is not much choice. So if you start with a model category, an infinity category, of course, it has an initial object and it has a final object. And the zerosphere is just what you get when you take the two final points. Get when you take the two final points and glue them together along the initial points. That's it. And the circle is what you get when you take two points and glue them along, well of course the points are sort of intervals or something, but they're contractible, and you glue them along the zero sphere, and you go on. And in the case where my category is some, in some context, commutative S algebra square s is Algebra, where S is something, computative something, and I look about on the S algebras that are over one specified S algebra C, then the zero sphere is just, well, the disjoint unit is tensor over C over S, I'm sorry. So it's just C tensor C over S, the Big Oldstein or the algebra, if you like. And Hoxhale homology is just And poxial homology is just this circle, what you get when you glue two points together along the zero sphere. So there's not going to be any discussion as to what I mean by motivic Haushal homology. And just to remind you how this looks in different contexts, when we take S to be the integers, this is what's called, some people call it Schupler homology. It's just derived Haushallomology. When S is the sphere spectrum, this is called topological costumology. And when S is the motivic sphere spectrum, this is motivic Haushalhomology. This is what it is. And we can do some calculations. So for instance, if we start with the integers and I take my C to be the prime field, then I glue to prime fields along the integers. Fields along the integers, and of course, there's going to be a zero cell, Fp, and there's also going to be a derived cell in degree one. So I won't, I'm sure to mess up my fermions and variants and whatever on this, so I won't just call it tau naught, okay? Tau naught squared is zero. However, if we have a sphere spectrum, then the dual steeroid algebra, S0 in that context, Algebra, S0 in that context is more interesting. And it's given by a polynomial thing if P is 2, and it's going to have some exterior generators, some polynomial generators, if P is odd. So I chose this so that it conforms with, so I can use the same notation in all the various contexts. And so then in this situation here, the degree of tau. the degree of tau i is going to be 2 pi, 2 pi minus 1, and likewise for Ïˆi. I'm going to come back to the motelic dual steenroid algebra in a moment. But perhaps before I go further on, you can notice that there is one new character that is this tau that you saw yesterday that has weight. That has weight. So there's an extra, so it's a bi-degree now. So that's an extra degree minus one, zero minus one. And all the other buggers here, they also have some weights. And that's actually very, very helpful. Coming back to that in a moment, you notice that there is a difference here in what it looks like in even primes, but in odd primes it's very much the same thing. And here I use for it to have such a simple I use to have such a simple formulation, I use that my field is algebraic host. Okay, so what is Hochschull homology? So starting with the integers, I get, well, when I take, glued together two copies of Fp along the zero sphere, I get the one sphere, Schuptle homology, which is a divided power algebra on a class in degree two. On a class in degree two. And if I start with a sphere spectrum, Duxett tells me that something wonderful happens. I get a polynomial algebra, also on a class in degree two. And both of these calculations can be had in the same way. You could start with the Tor spectral sequence, and since S1 is gotten from S0 by gluing together two points along. By gluing together two points along S-naught, you have a Tor spectral sequence. The ring here on top is going to just be the dual Steenrud algebra, and here it's just going to be Fp twice. And for Schugler homology, that's actually very, very easy. Because you calculate torr, and torr you do by an explicit resolution or something like that. It's a resolution or something like that, and you get the divided power algebra. That just falls out by pure algebra. And this spectral sequence now is so sparse that there's not room for anything else. So that actually is the answer. So Schukler homology is the divided power algebra. There's no choice here. Whereas, if I start with a sphere spectrum, then I no longer have just a exterior. Exterior algebra here, I have polynomial stuff and I have exterior stuff. The polynomial stuff in torque, well, again, concrete calculation, it gives you exterior algebras, and exterior algebras, as we saw, give me divided powers. But now something else happens. Of course, you see here that there's lots of stuff here. Well, because the dual syneroid algebra has lots of stuff. And Duxted then discovers that there are loads of differential Is that there are loads of differentials and extensions? Well, in order for him to get a polynomial ring on one generator, of course, there has to be Carnage herein when p is odd. By the way, here's p is equal to 2, and here's p is odd. There has to be quite a number of things that die down here, and they do. And in the end, we're going to end up in a situation very similar to the even prime situation, but then all the Situation, but then all the generators mui hinge up so that mui squared is mui plus one, so that eventually I get a polynomial filler. Okay, so this story carries over nicely in with some interesting twists to the motivic case. So this is the second time I have something to say in the right-hand column. And because now I'm moving to somewhat unfamiliar territory, namely motivic homotopy. Territory, namely motivic homotopy theory. And so here, S is the motivic sphere spectrum, whatever that is. So motivic world is built out of, well, cells just as we're used to, but in addition, I allow myself to have varieties, and I can glue these things together. And I insist that the affine line is contractible. I just force that. And in order to have spectra, I take the projective. I take the projective line, which since A1 is contractible, is equivalent to a suspension of Gm. And I make that invertible. So that is, okay, so you have a topology, the near-wage topology, and whatnot. But in the end, you have quite a lot of concrete calculations. So of course you have the Motivic sphere spectrum and you have the Motivic Eye-Whermic Lane spectrum, mod P I-Wermic Lane spectrum. P on Mermic Lane spectrum. And so, okay, so in this situation here, we have bigrated homotopy groups coming from that we both have usho spheres and we have gm. So that gives a bigrating, called the gm part the weight. And I get an extra generator in with weight minus one. And then we get the Double Steenrudd algebra. And then we get the Doubledstein red algebra. And in characteristic zero, at least, this was done by Wyboltsky. And, well, here, again, precisely the k is now a radically closed field. So in the odd case here, I get exactly the same as we got in the stable homotopy theory situation, except that I have this extra fellow tau here. So this is, of course, then just the coefficients. Coefficients. In the even case, something somewhat more interesting happened in that the coefficients mess up with the taus and the xi's in the sense that tau i squared is tau times psi i plus 1. So in the usual case, there is just a polynomial fellow, and that is because, well, think of tau there as 1, and then that just identifies tau i squared. identifies tau i squared with psi i plus 1, so there's no need to say psi i plus 1, it's just the taus. And if k is not algebraically closed, then the rho that you heard about yesterday is going to make appearance here as well. So far so good? Okay, so there are two things that you ought to do when you see this picture. The first is See in this picture. The first is that you try to come back to the topological case by inverting tau, and what you get then is just the Laurent polynomials on the usual Steenroid algebras. So that's fine. It's exactly the same thing. So here then, as soon as tau is invertible, I don't need like size anymore. But what's fun is that if I What's fun is that if I work modTau, then the picture, both in the even and in the odd case, becomes that of the usual odd primary case. So what do I mean by that? Well, if tau now is zero, then it says tau i squared is equal to zero. And I get exactly the same sort of formula. Same sort of formula that I would have when p was odd, both for the even and the odd case. So, yeah. So that's sort of surprising. I don't know how surprising it is, but it's fun. And so now I'm going to fix S to be the motivic sphere spectrum, and C is going to be the motivic ion-Mermic lane spectrum. For this slide, I'm going to invert tau all over the place and see what happens. All over the place and see what happens. And I want to calculate motivic Hochschl homology. So since that is gotten by gluing together two motivic Einmermic length spectra along the zero sphere, I have the Torr spectral sequence. And since this Tor spectral sequence now is exactly the Laurent polynomials on the old On the old Tor spectral sequence and information about either you steal this from Bucksted or you do Bucksted's analysis afresh, you get that the motivic Haussl homology of tau inverted mod p I Mermic-Lane spectrum is simply the law of polynomials on Druckstett's results. However, in order to have the weights add up, you'll notice that you're forced not to have mu i squared to be mu i plus 1, but actually what's going on is that mu i squared is tau p minus 1 times mu i plus 1. So there is a, okay, so this is going to reappear later. So it's not so that mu i squared is actually equal to mu i plus 1. Plus one. Okay, so let's work mod tell. By the way, was this okay? So no surprises here. So is this eta prime two and is p equal to. So, I mean that the formula for the mu with the squares, in the classical case, that only is true at the prime two. It's mu to the p at i prime. At I primes. And so I'm trying to understand what this formula is supposed to be. I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Oh, shoot, I have P and 2. I'm sorry. Okay, so from now on, P is equal to 2. I'm sorry, I see the type problem. Okay, so there was a 2 that should have been a P on the previous slide. Thank you. Exactly. This one there. Okay, so. Okay, so let's go to the mod tau situation. And there we are in the situation where the mod tau dual steel rod algebra is of the same structure as the odd one. So of course the challenge then is to try and mix this. Though you have this tension between the mod tau looking The mod tau looking like it's odd, and you have the localized thing looking like it's two. So from now on, p is going to be two. Okay, so then I have the Torrespecto sequence, just as before. And now this is, well, since this looks like the odd primary dual Steenroid algebra, it looks like It looks like this thing here, except that p is equal to, or well, it looks like this, it looks like this when p is equal to 2. So the E2 page is just the same as the E2 page in the odd primary case. So we have some exterior fellows up here that give me divided powers down here, and we have some polynomial fellows that give me exteriors. But now something weird happens. But now something weird happens. And this is. So in the odd usual case, there was carnage at this stage. There were lots of differentials and things were killed off. And I essentially only were left with a new ice in the end. But here something else happens, because contrary to this topological situation, weight considerations, because these things have weights, there's actually no possibility. There's actually no possibility. So you can just analyze the situation. And there's no room for extensions. And there are no room for any differentials. We keep this enormous thing. It's just like it is. Sorry. Here it is. Modital motivic horse homology is this big thing, and you seem to recognize this. No, I but the point it all makes sense, it's fitting together, right? I mean, you're working mod tau, so you're really in So, like, you're really in BP star BP co-modules, right? And so, this like you're doing Hawks-Schill homology in that algebraic category, and where things are simpler to continue. But it, of course, becomes much bigger. And one thing I, so perhaps you can answer that. To me, this is sort of mysterious because one of the important insights we got from Dirks' calculation was that topological Hochschl homology is definitely not something outread. Not something out of rate. It gives me something glinovial, it has power operations, it is highly non-outridic. Whereas this thing here looks exceedingly outrage. Okay, but things will this will be amended. In the end, when we go, when we don't word mod tau, this will be destroyed or at least. So sorry, I have a quick question. We're going to be, you know, that one that the original the original Bachstead approach isn't The original Boxted approach is in the atom spectral sequence you. Okay, yeah, so okay. So I uh so okay, you may modify the Duxted's approach so that it's actually possible. I totally agree, but I'm saying I've never seen an approach to compute the THH where you use the Adams-Nobakov spectral sequence. Okay. No? And is this the E2 term? Yeah. But it's exactly the same analysis. And I should, by the way, say that there is a And I should, by the way, say that there is, and while thinking about yesterday's talk, it's good to have several spectral sequences talking together. And there is also, when we did this, we had great help of the Greenleaf spectral sequence, which actually picked out, made us guess the right things. But here, as soon as you think of the correct linear Linear combinations of filtration, weight, and total degree, this just falls out. But of course, you have to think of the correct. Do you expect the divided, like since it's co-fiber tau modules or like VP star VP co-modules, then do you expect this, like if you could model this thing by a simplistical computer to bring in VP star VP co-modules, then its homology would or its homotopy would automatically have divided power obviously. But I don't know if that's well, I don't know if that is correct or not. So, okay, so we're going to glue together all the tau portions, and keep in mind that we know what happens when tau is invertible, or when I invert tau. So, this is actually going splendid. Glover, you'll have time. So, I look at multiplication by tau that decreases weight by one, and I can take the projection from motivation. From motivic, okay, so M here is short for the motivic mod to Einberg with Leigh spectrum, just to pit up the screen. And I can take the quotient down to the mod tau, and of course it's sort of deep that in itself is an E-infinity ring spectrum by Georgie. But, well, at this stage everything is very outrageic. And we, of course, have the boundary map that decreases the degree and increases. The degree and increases the weight. And we have the Bogstian, which decreases the weight by one. And we can calculate. So since this came from the Tor spectral sequence, I know what all the generators are. I can sit down and I can calculate. And I find that the Bokstein of, well, these are the divides. Of, well, these are the divided power generators on the mu ice. Well, I lose one index on the gamma, or actually I lose two, at the price of getting one of these fellows in the exterior algebra. So by the way, the bars on top of here is just to remind me that I'm working mod to tau. It has nothing to do with conjugation or anything like that. And the bochkend on the exterior classes. On the exterior classes is zero. Okay, so you know that. And then you do a calculation in ordinary homological algebra. Takes some work, but not terribly much. And you do, well, then the Bokstein becomes a differential, and this becomes a chain complex. The multitude Haussler model becomes a chain complex. Chain complex, and you take the homology, of course, this is the next page in the Bokshdian spectral sequence. We won't need that because something dramatic happens at this stage. What does happen? The only thing that survives the Bokshlien are the mu eyes. The only thing that survives the Bokstein are the mu eye. All the other horrible noise that we have here is gone. And the mu eyes. Those were the ones that survived when I inverted tau. So I'm in the situation here that I know, okay, so I know the names of some generators here, come from the Tor spectral sequence. And I know some classes here that survived when I localized, and these mu i's did. And these mu eyes did. And they are projected down to the thing that survives Bakshki. Okay, so we tip these two things against each other. And what do we see? We see that all the stuff in here that comes from these fellows has to be, of course, it has to be tau torsion, but it cannot be divisible by tau. The tau torsion in motivic horseshoe homology is not divisible by tau. So there's no tau mod tau squared or anything like that, which is sort of magic in my mind. Of course, that has to do with a prime being 2, so p minus 1 is equal to 1. And in the odd case, as Mike will tell you, you have p minus 1 sitting in here. here. And from our analysis when I inverted tau, I can exactly say that the non-coortiant part consists of these mu's. And what do I have to have? I have to have that they hinge up on each other, so that tau i squared is equal to this generator tau times mu i. times mu i plus one. And that's this is the part that survives to topology, and we have a lot of torsion classes. Lots of torsion classes. The tau torsion then becomes the image of the boundary map from mod tau to motivic osho homology. And I know this fellow here and And since this homology vanished, I know that that will then be all of the tau torsion and it will map injectively by the projection down to the moditauf group. So I have full control. Life is nice and simple. So summing up how far we gotten, we have the material costal homology, the The non-tau torsion part is given just as in the space case, except that there is tau, of course, popping up in the formula. We can't help but that being true. And the tau torsion, and we know by the way how these fellows act on the tau torsion because we know how they act here. The tau torsion maps by an isomorphism to the image of the Bokstein, and the image of the Bokstein is some. And the image of the Bochdin is some particular submodule of this horrible thing here, which was the mod tau Bokshup homology. Okay, so we could leave it at that, but being a wee bit greedy and actually want to understand the tau torsion, I will spend some minutes discussing what's there. But is the picture clear? We have the non-torsion part being just as in topology, except that tau is not one, it is something. And we have the tau torsion, which is potentially quite big, but it's a submodule of this thing here. Of course, this is an ideal, and this is just a solvent submodule. Okay, so let's analyze what happens with the tau torsion. And by the way, so. With a tau torsion. And by the way, so I emphasize that if there is something you forget, you can look it up over there. And now we're going to become a wee bit technical. So I want to have generators for the tau function, and here's one way to go about it. So if f is a function from the natural numbers to the natural numbers that has finite support, I look at, well, I look at well I look at the mu n's and I decide what divided power power I'm going to take of that and the F is just going to pin down how far I'm going to go up there. So the F here is just one way of keeping track of where I am in the divided power structure. And together with the current And together with the kernel- in things in the kernel of the Bokstein, these fellows here generate all of mod tau, motivic horse homology. Okay, so they generate all of this, and torsion is the image of this. So the image of the boundary map on these fellows here, let's call them XF, they generate the Xf, they generate the entire ideal of tau torsion. And so, of course, together with the fellows of non-tau torsion, they generate all of motivic opposition energy. And for those of you who are keen on knowing the weight of things, this is the weight of things. It will be over there if you want to remember it. So what are the relations between these generators? What are the relations between these generators beyond, of course, mu i squared is equal to tau mu i plus 1? Okay, so since the entire tau torsion is mapped injectively by the projection to the mod tau metivic portion homology, knowing what the projection of my generators are is highly valuable. Well, it's just a bottom. Valuable. Well, it's just a box steam of the yf's, and you sit down and you calculate, you know all of this. So, what is it? Oh, there should be a bar over the lambda. It is, well, what happens is that I sum over the support of f and at the nth sumad, the f loses one. So remember that yfn keeps track of how much keeps track of how far I'm in the divided power structure. So I lose a single value at n. So delta n is the Kronecker symbol. It takes 1 at n and otherwise it's 0. At the price then of multiplying with a lambda bar n plus 1. So I know exactly what these fellows are. I know exactly what q of xf is and q is injective. So, in particular, if I take y of this Kronecker thing, so it just has to port on one place, and there it is 1. So, what is that? That is just the second divided power of mu n. And I take x, the corresponding x, then q of that will be just these exterior power. These exterior power generators. Well, the exterior power generators are square zero, so all the x with support just on one place are automatically zero. And if you sit down, you will see that that's actually true for all f's. That this is just an example. The square of all the generators are zero. There's nothing we can do about that. Which is good. On the other hand, there is potential. On the other hand, there is potential for interesting multiplication between them. It's not so that this is a tensor product or exteriors. They multiply interestingly together. And we can say something about that. Because, well, again, we map ejectively into the mod tau motivic Hochschule homology. So I can say whatever any product, what that is, by looking at it here. By looking at it here. And I do know, of course, a thing of 2n here. I know, of course, that, well, we just used that the exterior algebra class is square 0, R square 0. But if you sit down and you analyze and you use your divided power knowledge, you will find that the product of the Yf and the Yg, well, it's just a multiple of Yf plus G. And here I'm just adding two functions as you would add functions. Functions as you would add functions. But the coefficient is rather nasty. It's a product over the support of the intersection of f and g by all these funny binomial coefficients mod2. And I have to admit that I did an error in an earlier approach here, because these products of mod2 binomial coefficients tend to be zero much more. Coefficients tend to be zero much more often than you would think they would be. And so I have some zeros that ought not to be zeros. Do you mean that yf plus g gets multiplied by itself all those times? No, no, thank you. So this is, so this, so okay, this is a number times that. Okay, so you could write the y of g on the left of the process. I could, and I should, perhaps. So this is just an enormous coefficient that most lightning. Enormous coefficient that most likely is zero, but occasionally it's not. And for instance, if the support of f and g are disjoint, then the product of yf and yg is simply yf plus g. So this gives explicit relations that you can write down and work with among the generators. Because I know exactly what I know that, well, Q is injective, and I know that Q of F is Q of f is this sum over here with lambdas who square are zero and y's that multiply like this. And so you know essentially everything that you want to. So one thing that we already saw was that the square of anything is zero. And as an easy example, if the support of f and g both are in, well, the support is just on i and j. The support is just on i and j, just two points, no more. Then I can write the product of xf and xg in terms of, and what's this on the other side? Okay, so this is a huge number. Actually, it is, it's not that huge, it just looks huge. It's either 0 or 1, okay? So, this thing here is the function that is the value fi plus gi, only at i, and 0 otherwise. And this is the function that i. And zero otherwise. And this is the function that is fj plus gj, fj, otherwise zero. So these are support just one place, support just one place, and there is a coefficient in front of it. And yeah, so you can continue this way. If you have support of three things, you'll get things like that. So here the support is on 0 and 1. Support on 2, 1 and 2, 0, 2, 1, 0. 2, 1, 0, and the sum of those kinds of cyclic permuted, and it's 0. And if they're overlap, so this was the case where I have no overlap, so the support was disjoint. And here's the case where I do have common support, and then I get, well in this case here, I just get twice the function with support only at one. So this function here is. So this function here is 2. This function here is 2 at 1 and otherwise it's 0. This thing here is 1 at 0 and 1 at 2. Okay. So we have full control. We have the motivational homology. The non-torsion part is just as in topology, except that we have this annoying tell that is not necessarily. Annoying tau that is not necessarily one, has weight has weight minus one, and we have the tau-portion part, which is exactly the submodule of the mod tau motivic causal homology, which is this divided power in this exterior fellow. And it's given by, of course, all the mu's. I can't avoid having those exterior on them, not divided power. Multi-by power, and the part that is generated by these explicit, well, this is q of xf that we had before. So this is q of xf sitting inside here. And all the relations between these things here are given very, very exactly by these formulas here. By the way, this formula is somewhat simplified because we're in mod 2 land, otherwise it would. Mod to land, otherwise it would be slightly more complicated. And as a fun fact, at the end here, we can notice that, well, the mod2 motivic Einbermic length spectrum has no tau torsion. That tau torsion that we're seeing here is nu. So in particular, the motivic Hochschl homology is not a sum of all Mermaid-Lane spectrum. Is not a sum of Allen Mermic lane spectra. It has tau torsion. Of course, we can't see that in topology because tau torsion dies there. But still it's there. And okay, so perhaps I should come clear why am I interested in this. I said I was interested in knowing certain facts about ordinary Hochschl homology, and there are certain maps between Hochschule homology that, for instance, we know. Homology that, for instance, we know are null-homotopic, but we don't know that they're null-homotopic as E infinity ring maps. And the hope is that having more structure like this, so far that hasn't succeeded, but the hope is that having more structure of this sort can help us guide us to either find counterexamples or prove that these maps are as we think they are. Thank you. Thank you for your attention. Questions? So here you define T E t to be F two to the tensor the trivial sphere. Yes, exactly. What happens if I take the trivial x is your question? No, it's a sensor TL. TL. Yeah, okay, which of course would be more or less the same thing, with just a suspension. Yeah, I haven't the faintest idea. Of course, you can do that, and I have no... The problem is that I have no, of course we know abstractly that that exists, but we have no good tools of exact uh of uh attacking that. And that is why I chose this interpretation of topological functional logic, so that you wouldn't ask that question. I mean you need to have a material infinity algebra. So I guess the question is there is that you have a three algebraic is there is a space of actually remembers there are each other space. I think Pohu showed this for things like answering a little to the ring with a rocky. But there's a question of whether it's the right. Like you could always define something by declaring that on the free thing you get the free on gm smash. Like gm tensor free x should be free gm smash x. But you can do that always. But you can do that always. But like, how do you know that you picked the right notion of commutative algebra? Like, for example, if you tried to do there is an S1 tensor A when A is an associative algebra, but it's not actual algebra. So I think that's the fear. Yeah, so probably you should have some weight in the... Well, I don't know. I just don't know what the definition of a motivated commutative ring is, I think, the problem. So, um I was also wondering if you have any ideas about what might be detected in fixed points. What might be detected in fixed points? That's one? So no, at uh at present uh we haven't uh looked at that. At present we're at least I am uh I'm heavily on the community ring aspects. But of course that's an actual thing. Because I'm curious if you can see shifts in the WIs using this framework or if you really need this GM I didn't catch the shifts in like the WIs, these periodic families. Periodic families. I'm curious if you can do that with this framework or if you really need to tensor with GI. I don't know. So I don't know anything about Bochdett's kind of spectral sequence computation that you just mentioned earlier with lots of differentials and extensions. But can you interpret all of this tau torsion as somehow like remembering all the differentials, all the block stretch differentials? Yeah. So there is a. Yeah, so there is a close connection between what's going on here and what's going to know how's happened before. So this tau here, this relation here, is what generates the entire tau torsion. So the point is that you're going to, okay, so to be very explicit, what's going on here is that at a certain time, you'll have a short differential. You'll have a short differential that kills this bugger, but it won't kill that bugger. So there will be a later differential that kills that one. Okay, so now I'm in the green lace speckle sequence. There will be a later one killing that one out. And that has to be tau torsion, because tau times it is something we've already killed. Of course, in Buxton situation, Of course, in Buxted situation, this thing here is not there. These things just hinge up very, very nicely. So you don't see it exactly that way, but there's closely related and then closely related to what's happening in the odd case really. So it's a mixture between the odd and the even case. I don't know if that's a satisfactory answer, but that's what I know. So what I do here is that I just smash over the 03 or the dual zero algebra. So I've refrained from using that language at all. But it would be tense string. Let's see, is there a difference here between these two? There's not a difference. The forgetful functor will be off and it's in common to those. Yeah. So, yeah, so I think. So, yeah, so I think the answer is yes. In that ah primary description, there, is there any sense in which the p-fold massey product of a tau is the next C? I guess the answer is yes. But of course, that's the odd person is sitting down here. You should ask him. Yeah, so I don't know, but that is what seemed to happen. So may I answer? Yes, I think so. But I haven't analyzed that situation. Any further question before we give Clover the chance to prepare? Okay, next talk. Okay, next talk is the minutes.
