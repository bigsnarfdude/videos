Thanks to Agnieszka and Miroslav for the invitation to speak here. I must say that the weather in Banff is much better than I expected. So what I'm going to talk about is a relatively simple or well at least harmless looking system of PDE. System of PDEs with feasible applications to the biology of tumor growth or living tissues internal. And this is going to be describing some recent results with Benoit Partam, Markus Schmitchen, and Nicola Bouchelet. Okay, so let me dive straight into the equations. So we consider this. This advection reaction system of equations for two species, healthy cells and abnormal cells, if you will, who are affected by the gradient of this concentration W, which is related to the pressure via this equation, which we call Brinkman's. Equation which we call Brinkman's law. And on the right-hand side, you have growth rates for the cells, which importantly depend on the pressure. In a sense, the pressure is the most important factor here, which controls the proliferation of the cells through what is called. Through what is called contact inhibition, meaning that when the pressure gets too high, the cells are going to sense it and they will just stop dividing. And in this compressible model that I want to present here, the pressure is supposed to be related to the total cell density via a smooth increasing. A smooth increasing function, and we take for simplicity this power law, which we've seen this week several times already, I think. Okay, okay, so let me mention briefly what the goal is. So we want to, the incompressible limit that is in the title corresponds to passing to the to the limit k to infinity in this in this relation here. In this relation here. And therefore, we would obtain a limiting model which would give us a different description of the tissue, a more geometric, if you will, description of the motion of the tumor. Let me start with a few remarks. So if you consider So if you consider just one equation and absence of viscosity, meaning formally you take nu equals zero here, when the velocity is related to the pressure gradient via Darcy's law, then you just obtain the porous medium equation and the issue of this limit came. Of this limit, k to infinity, is a long story, which is a rather well-developed mathematical theory. The limiting equation here being the classical Helleshaw model for incompressible fluid with a free boundary. And there have been plenty of generalizations of this, including proliferation. This, including proliferation, including nutrients as well, and also extending to systems like we have for two species. However, an important thing to remark here is that for the system, the incompressible limit is only understood in one dimension. So it's not still a complete story in this regard. Of course, all those. Of course, all those generalizations that you can imagine that I mentioned, they still use heavily this connection to the proporous medium equation. In particular, for the system, the equation for the total cell density obtained by just adding the two equations gives you a porous medium type equation. And you can use, for instance, you can try to try to derive some adaptations of the classical Arencon Benilan regularizing effect, which helps in the analysis. In the viscoelastic case, on the other hand, that we are considering, there are some other mathematical analytical problems. In particular, even though viscosities are regular Viscosity is a regularizing effect, the estimates on the pressure are weaker, and this causes, this makes it much more strenuous in the end to obtain compactness. In particular, this is due to jump discontinuities of the pressure, both at the boundaries of the at the boundaries of the of the supports of the of the cells cell densities and and on the internal layers where the well the two density two populations meet okay uh yeah so this is a very brief incomplete uh incomplete discussion uh of course let me just mention uh that there is a result uh concerning a a Concerning an incompressible limit for the Navier-Stokes system with a growth term, with a linear growth term, by Evelina and Nicola Vaschle. And we are actually in part, we are using very similar techniques. Right, so here are the assumptions. We assume that the function g that That the function g, that both the functions g, the rates of growth for the cells are decreasing in the pressure. This is what I already said, that the cells can sense the pressure in the sense that when the pressure is absent, they want to divide the most that is possible. And as they do, the pressure increases, causing the cells to Cells to stop dividing, or at least divide at a smaller rate. So there's this sort of logistic effect here. In particular, there exists this pressure Pm, which is the maximal pressure at which the proliferation stops altogether. Hence the term homeostatic pressure. As for the data, we take non-negative data in terms of. We take non-negative data integrable and bounded and such that they converge in the L1 norm to some known functions and zero infinity. Okay, so before I can state the results, I need also to introduce some other variables and some other equations. So it is very useful in the analysis to consider an equation for the time evolution of the pressure. Of the pressure and also to introduce this variable Rk, which stands for the population concentration or population fraction, if you will. So this is using an equation for the total cell density obtained by just adding the two equations and, of course, using the relation between the pressure and the The relation between the pressure and this total population density, which gives us this equation, while those population fractions satisfy that equation. And these are very important in all our analysis. In particular, one of the goals is to pass to the limit in the pressure equation. Okay, so let me advertise the results first. Okay, so let me advertise the results first and then I'll discuss what how we go about proving them. So we have existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to our initial problem. This is not much of an issue. The most important thing that I want to discuss as in the title is this incompressible limit. So the main issue is to obtain compactness of the pressure and And we can do that, and we can pass the limit obtaining this system here, which corresponds biologically to a situation where the total population density is limited by some critical value one here. And in unsaturated regions, so when n is less than one. So when n is less than 1, there is no pressure and the cells are dividing, the populations are growing at different rates, but they are. And the fully saturated regimes where n is equal to this critical value, then the pressure is positive and it satisfies this relation, which comes from the right-hand side of the pressure. From the right-hand side of the pressure equation. So that's the system that we converge to as we pass with k to infinity. And okay, let me point out one more thing. I will not speak too much about this segregation, but let me just mention that in the analysis of these kinds of models, this is one of the typical questions. This is one of the typical questions that you want to address: namely, will the cells that make up the tissue mix like in a homogeneous mixture or will a front form? This is important from the biological point of view. I'm told that, for instance, immunotherapy can only work if the immune cells can actually mix with. Immune cells can actually mix within the tissue. And if they can't, then they are stopped by the front, and the therapy just won't work. Okay, so back to back to maps. Right, here are some estimates that we have. These are the first two are rather standard things. We get positivity, we get L1, L infinity bounds. Well, but nothing more essentially. So, in particular, no estimates on the pressure gradient. And one important thing here is this last line, which as you can see, once I'm able to pass strongly to the limit in those nonlinear terms, this will give me this complementarity relation that we had here on this slide. Slide. Okay, so that's an important observation. It comes actually from considering the time evolution for this quantity here in the absolute value. And if you think of it like, okay, forget the reaction terms for a minute. Then you had just w minus p, which is Laplacian of W. So we're considering the time evolution of the. The time evolution of the L plus and of Delta. So, this does have somehow this Aren√ßon Vanilan flavor in a sense. Okay, at this point I would like, yes, I think we managed it. I would like to split into two cases, one-dimension and multi-dimension, because well, that's how we did it for one reason, and also. Reason, and also somehow the methods that are used are orthogonal in a sense. So I think it's good to mention that. So I said, the main issue is to obtain strong compactness of the pressure. And in the one-dimensional case, this is possible from some additional regularity estimates on the Estimates on the sandal densities. In particular, we have this lemma, which follows from a careful Gronel estimate using heavily the structure of the problem, meaning that the fact that the functions g are decreasing and also the fact that the pressure gradient has the same sign as the Same sign as the derivative of the total population density. Okay, this gives us some appropriate cancellations and helps to close the estimate. So given this additional regularity, we can prove compactness for the pressure sequence. And the main idea here is that even though we Here is that even though we are not able to show directly that we control time and space shifts in the pressure itself, but we are able to control them for a non-linear function of the pressure, which, okay, this actually can be seen, this can be seen from the proof of the previous lemma. And again, this uses when you look at the function phi, this uses When you look at the function phi, this uses heavily this relation between the pressure and the total density. Okay, and then okay, this eventually this leads to compactness in the pressure, but I'll skip the details. Okay, so yeah, so this is all contained in this paper with Marcus. So how about the multi-D case? So how about the multi-D case? Of course the previous strategy fails miserably and we need to look for something else. There are no BV estimates for the system in multi-D and so we need to look for some other ideas. And one idea is given by a previous work of Benoit and Nicolas, who considered analogous processes. Who considered an analogous problem in the case of just one species, where they could strengthen the weak convergence of the pressure coming from the a priori estimates to strong compactness by observing that the only obstacle to strong compactness is oscillations in the pressure between around the values zero. Between around the value zero and some other positive value which can be identified, and it is related to the limiting velocity potential. And then, so what they do is they pass to the limit in the pressure equation using this knowledge and also using a representation of weak limits, of weak non-linear limits. Of weak nonlinear limits of the pressure which comes from a kinetic formulation. And then, yeah, and this is enough for them for compactness. And so if we tried to mimic this sort of approach, we run into problems very, very quickly because now we have Now we have more involved in nonlinearities in the sense that we don't only have the pressure, but we also have this nonlinear population fraction. So we somehow have to make sense of that to be able to apply this strategy. And to cut a long story short, we realized that the argument would be fine, it would work. Argument would be fine, it would work once we can guarantee that this sequence Rk converges strongly. Okay, and hopefully, I mean, fortunately, this is the case. It does make a huge, a huge, it does require a huge lot of effort to show this, and it actually shifts the interest back from pressure. the interest back from pressure to the to the individual densities and uh and for them for them we we we are able to to derive uh derive a compactness result and since i'm running out of time and uh this is a short presentation let me just mention that the main idea of the proof is is to use this uh uh this compactness methods as in uh as as in uh the paper of Greg and Jabern for The paper of Grecian Jabin for compressible fluids. Okay, so here's the final result. Having that, as I said, having compactness of the individual species, we can pass to the limit in the pressure equation and prove the main result. I think I'm out of time, so I'll just show you these. these sorry you still have one or two minutes okay so i can i can just uh showcase this this last slide with uh some uh some uh other problems that are still still uh open and i think very interesting in this this uh field uh as i mentioned before the the incompressible limits for the darcy case is only known in in one dimension because again in one dimension it was possible Because again, in one dimension, it was possible to have some BV estimates and pass to the limit in the multi-decays. It's not known what to do. And also, it would be interesting to see a rigorous derivation of a link between the two, between the Peruvian and Darcy. Okay, that's it. Thank you. Okay, so let's thank Tomek. So let's thank Tomek.
