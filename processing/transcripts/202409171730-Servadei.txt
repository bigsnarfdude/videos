Okay, what I want to speak about today is some new results about the jumping non-linearities and the local functional problems. First of all, just a moment because I have some okay. First of all, I would like to introduce local critical problems and the motivation for studying this kind of equation. These kinds of equations. And then I will present to you some recent results I got in collaboration with Giovanni Molikadishi, Katerina Sportelli, which is in Western Australia, and Katisha Pereira from Florida State University in the US. Okay, the problem I want to focus is on modification of this one. Modification of this one, which is a critical problem in a non-local framework. Non-local for me means that the leading operator in the equation is this operator minus delta s, the fractional Laplace operator. And the problem, as you can see, is critical because the right-hand side is a critical power of the function u. Here to stress is To SARS is the fractional critical sovereign exponent, that is the exponent that we have that appear in the bending of the embedding of fractional Sobolev spaces into the classical Lebesgue ones. And it is exactly the exponent from which we From which we don't have compact embedding of the sobless space into the Lebesgue ones. Here we set the problem in a bounded, open bounded domain over n with the smooth boundary, and lambda is a real parameter. As usual for fractional problems, we consider boundary condition in this sense. Condition in this sense. So we require that the function u, the solution we are looking for, the equation is zero, vanishes outside the set omega. And this is due to the fact that the problem is non-local. And so we need to know what is the behavior of the solution in all the space Rn, in all the Euclidean space. This condition plays the role of. Plays the role of the condition, for instance, u equals zero on the boundary of the set omega if we replace minus delta s with the Laplace operator minus delta. Okay, why? What is the fractional Laplacian? The fractional Laplacian is a non-local operator that can be defined in many different ways. Here, I considered I defined the minus Z as the inverse Fourier transform of Inverse Fourier transform of this function, modulus of x to the power to s Fourier transform of u s the term s is the parameter s is between zero and one. And why I started with this definition, because if we consider the limiting case, in particular the case s equals one, what we get is that this definition is consistent with the one of the Laplacian. Of course, if you consider Of course, if you consider the case f exactly s equals zero, here you get just that minus delta zero u is the identity. The fractional approach can be defined in an equivalent way in this form using these two integrals. The first one, the green one, is the integral of a suitable average of second order. average of second order incremental quotient and equivalently we can express minus delta s also in this way in the blue form with a principal with an integral in the principal values n. The three definitions I presented you in this slide are completely equivalent up to positive constant. Okay, and why studying the fractional applaution? Because in the general local No local equation or no local operators because this kind of operators arise in a quite natural way in different contexts, in particular in problems where the interaction with all the points in the domain are important. Here I just reported. Reported. I just wrote a short list of possible fields from where we can have models driven by non-local fractional applaution and in general non-local operators. Why critical equations? Because critical equations are very relevant, in particular, Relevant, in particular, in problems arising from differential geometry and physics, where there is a lack of compactness. One of the most important problems in this setting is the famous Yamabe problem, that is the problem of the prescribed scalar carvashorona manifold. That we can state in this way. I don't want to I don't want to spend more time more words on the Yamabe problem because I'm sure that the audience knows very well this kind of problems. And okay, now what we know about critical problem in the non-local setting. I start with some result Some results which are not recent, results by myself and my collaborators, but not so recent, about this equation. So the critical, the Nolofa critical equation I presented you at the beginning of my talk. And we can see that in the case s equals one, this problem reduces to the famous equation. The famous equation studied by Predice Niederberg in a paper appeared in Communication in Pure and Applied Mathematics in 1983. This famous problem here, just to start the exponent here, is to start S with S equal one, so the classical critical Sovolev exponent. And what Bredis and Nirenberg proved. This and Nirenberg proved with respect to this problem that the problem, the critical problem, has a positive solution, provided lambda is less than the festive value of the Laplacian, if the dimension of the space is greater or equal than four, while in dimension three, the same result holds provided that lambda is sufficiently far from zero. Later, this result by predison. Results by Predice Niernberg were extended by Capozzo Fortunato Palmier in 1985 and Gazola Ruf in 1997. This author proved that the critical problem with the Laplacian admits a non-trivial solution for any lambda positive in dimension greater than four, while in dimension four, the same result holds provided lambda is not an eigenvalue of the Lambda is not an eigenvalue of the Laplacian. Here, just I want to say that in the case of British Nirenberg, the British enherence proved that the solution is positive, while the other author proved just that the solution is non-trivial. But this is, in a sense, normal, in the sense that also the result by Capozi for tonight. Also, the results by Capozzi Fortunato-Palmier and Gazoralouf say that if lambda is less than the Pestigian value of the Laplacian, the solution they found are positive. Over the Pestigian value of the Laplacian, the solution always changes sign. So, this is why here I'm speaking about a non-trivial solution. What happens? This is the picture. This is the picture for the classical case. What happens if we replace the Laplacian with the fractional Laplacian? We proved that the same result holds in the case of the non-local equation and in particular we showed that the non-local presence-Nirenberg problem admits a non-trivial solution for L v lambda positive when the dimension of the space. When the dimension of the space is greater or equal than for s, sorry, is greater than for s. The same rules in the dimension for s, provided lambda is not an eigenvalue or the functional applaution. And in low dimension, that is for n between 2s and 4s, we have a non-trivial solution provided lambda is sufficiently lambda is positive and sufficiently large. And the restriction and greater The restriction n greater than to s is due to the fact that we consider the critical exponent. And also, if we are above, sorry, under the second value of minus z, we can prove that the solution is positive, exactly as in the classical case. What are the difficulties in this in treating In this, in treating the problem in the classical setting, the lack of compactness. As I said at the beginning of the talk, the problem of the difficulties related to the study of critical problem is the lack of compactness. The fact that in our case, H10 omega does not embed in L2 star omega compactly. Compactly. And this produces the fact that the Palisman condition, which is the compactness condition required in order to face the problem using critical point theory, holds true at any level C, provided C is less than this quantity, 1 over n S to the power n over 2, where S is the critical source. The critical sobola constant. So defined in this way. And in the non-local setting, the situation is the same. We have exactly the same difficulty, the same problem, due to the fact that the space HS over m, which is the natural space where to set the problem, does not embed in compactly into In compactly into El Tusare sovereign. And here again, the Palace Mail also provided the level C is less than this term, where S of S, this constant, is again the critical sober constant related to this embedding. And okay, I don't want to enter into the Enter into the details of the proof of this result. Just I want to say that the existence of non-trigger solution was proved using classical physical point theory, precisely the mountain pass and the linking theorems, with the mountain pass when the parameter lambda is less than the value of the Laplacian and the link. The leaky theorem when the parameter lambda is above the Festigan value of minus delta s. And what we have to do in order to apply this theorem, we have to show that the energy functional naturally associated with our problem satisfies the Palesman condition. And I said what happens in this in this framework. Also, the energy functional has to respect a suitable geometric structure, which is the one of the mountain paths or the linking theorem. And due to the fact that the polysme condition holds through until this threshold related to the critical turbulent constant, we also have to estimate the critical level of the energy functional in order to prove that this level In order to prove that this level lies below the threshold where the Palesman loads through. And as you can imagine, this estimate is the difficult part of our papers. And I have no time to enter into the details of this estimate. What I want just to say you is that we have to construct a suitable solution of a suitable non local problem. And we have to estimate the norm of these functions in different functional spaces, in the fractional Sobole space and in Lebesgue spaces, in order to get the estimate we need. Okay. Okay. Okay, in the critical setting, we also proved some multiplicity results for this problem, but what I want to, and also the multiplicity result we get, extended the one already known in the case of the Laplacian. But what I want to focus now is what happens if we change our problem. Problem, so the critical, this is the Nirebert problem in introducing jumping nonlinearities. That is, what happens if we replace the term lambda u here with the b u plus minus a u minus. So we replace the term lambda u with this one, with what is what is called. Is what is called the jump a jumping nonlinearity. So the problem I want to discuss with you now is one. So it is exactly the problem I considered before, but with this with the change here. A and b are positive parameters, u plus and u minus are the positive and negative part of u, and all the other stuff are exactly the same as before. Same as before. Why studying this? Sorry. Okay. What happens if the parameter A and B are exactly lambda, we get the British-Nirenberg problem. And what is important for considering this new problem with jumping nonlinearities is the dancer pushing spectrum of minus zeta S in omega. That is the That is the set of all points AB and R2 for which this problem, which is something like a eigenvalue problem for minus delta S, has a non-trivial solution. Of course, you can easily see that this problem here reduces to the Dirichlege value problem for minus delta S if A is exactly A is equal to B. exactly a is equal b and so if we consider the sequence of dirichlege values of minus delta s then we can say we can say that the dancer fussy spectrum of minus delta s contains the points lambda l lambda l of course an absolute result due to perera chector proved that in the square q In the square QL, this yellow square here, here lambda L minus one and lambda m plus one are the values of the of minus delta s. So in this square, the denser push spectrum of minus delta s contains two strictly decreasing curves, C under L and C over L, which are the one below the other, and these two curves. And these two curves touch just in the point just in correspondence of the eigenvalue of minus delta s. So in the square, the spectrum contains these two curves, and these curves have this problem that the points in QL that are either below the lower curve or above the upper curve are not in the Are not in the denser Fouchik spectrum, while the points between them may or may not belong to the spectrum when they do not coincide. Of course, when they coincide, they belong to the spectrum because of what we said before. Okay. I'm sorry. Okay. And so So coming back to the problem, why these curves are important for us? Because our main result about the existence of non-trivial solutions for the problem with jumping non-linearities is this one. We get the existence of non-trivial solution for the problem provided the parameter A and B are in the square QL and the dimension of the space N is. Of the space n is greater than this number, and we are above the upper curve, or n is greater or equal than for l s we are below the lower curve, where l is greater or equal than 2. Our proof, the proof of this result, is based on variational and topological methods and on the application of a new. And on the application of a new linking theorem due to Pereira Esportelli. This result is very recent, appeared in the Journal of Differential Equation one years ago. And okay, so this is our main result. I want to point out that the study of problems or critical problems with James. Of critical problems with jumping nonlinearities is challenging also in the local case, but in the difficulties we had in the local framework are different and we have a lot of problems in order to get the results I presented you. And also, another thing I want to stress. I want to stress is that it is explaining you why we need a new theorem, a new linking theorem in order to face the problem. Because in the classical linking arguments, the classical linking arguments use the fact that the decomposition of HS zero of omega into into a gauge space of minus delta S Of minus delta S involve linear subspaces. This is not true in the case of the red problem, because the problem is non-linear. And so the use of the classical linking theorem is not possible in this framework. This framework. And this is why we consider the result by Perenna Esportelli. Also, with respect to the proof of this result, it extends the one already known for the Laplacian. And the result in the classical case is due again by Pereva Esportelli. But I want to stress that the The extending this problem was not so easy because, in the non-local framework, there are additional difficulties due to the fact that the operator is non-local, in particular to the fact that the operator is non-local, but also because there are technical complications and we need a lot of regularity result related to the Related to the gain function of minus delta s. These regularity results, which are, of course, also of independent interest. So what we proved in our paper are some regularity results for the function of minus delta s. And also the argument, many arguments used in the local case can be used, but we have to refine and But we have to refine and enhance them in order to face the non-local problem. Okay, I think my time is quite over. Just another final comments. Many ideas and approaches used in this paper in collaboration with Molikabis, Spostellia, and Pereira can. Can be used for studying the same problem in different contexts, such as, for instance, the subrimanion scenario, in which in particular one of the authors, Giovanni Molikabishi, is very familiar and an expert. And okay, what we want to do, what is now our Now, our idea to prove the same result: so, the existence of non-trivial solution also in low dimension. So, for n between 2s and 4s, and in the case in the green pace, n greater or equal than this number, which is due to some technical reason. But the natural number here has to be forest. Okay, but what I'm But we are working now in extending our result also to this interval where n varies. Okay, the result I presented here is this appeared in this paper published this year in Journal de Mathématique theoretical applique. And I think, okay, I think, sorry, I can. I can stop here, and I thank you very much for your kind attention. Thank you.
