I'm here to bump and give this talk. And what I'm going to talk about is joint work with Fedia Lazaro, Dima Rabogin and Vladiaski. So as an introduction, first we have all the definitions. I just put them on in one slide and you're all familiar with them already. Support function, radial function and the polar body. And the polar body so let's move forward from this. All right. So if you notice the title, I said I'm going to talk about the eighth Bushman-Petti problem. The thing is, before I tell you about the eighth Bushman-Petit problem, I need to talk first about the fifth Bushman-Petti problem. Pussman-Perbi problem, because I will show how these two problems are related to each other. And the solution of the eighth problem will be related to the solution to the fifth one. So let's start with this one. So we have k, an origin symmetric convex body. We take a central section perpendicular to some unit vector zeta, and we consider And we consider the product of the volume of this section with the support function. So what we're basically computing is the volume of this cone for which the base is the central section and the height is the support function in that direction settlement. And the question that Guzman and Petty asked is: if the volume of this If the volume of this cone is independent of theta, does this mean that k is an epsilon? And it was already known to them that in dimension 2, the answer is no. There are a lot of curves that have this property in dimension 2. Radon characterized these curves. They are usually called by his name, Radon curves. And let me draw one of them. And let me draw one of them. So, first of all, you notice that in this case, the volume of the section is twice the radial function in the perpendicular direction. So, this equation from Busman-Petif problem becomes this. The radial function of the polar body is a pi over 2 rotation of the radial function of the original body. So, let me draw an example of a runoff work here, where you will see. Suppose here you take some P between 1 and 2. You write the boundary of the L P ball in these two quadrants. And then here you write, draw the boundary of the L Q ball, where one over P plus one over Q is equal to one. P plus 1 over q is equal to 1, then it is clear that the polar of this body is a 90-degree rotation of the original body. And in particular, by taking p as close to 2 as you want, you have bodies of radon bounded by radon curves that are as close as you want to the Euclidean world. For the measure. For dimension 3 and higher, this problem is open. Alright, so I state the problem again. Well, the first observation is obviously that equation holds for the Euclidean ball. Everything is constant. Yes? If you had C infinity condition, would it be? I mean, this example does not work. C infinity? Yeah, C infinity of the square. Oh, I see. No. Does it allow counterexamples? Counterexamples. I don't know about C-infinity rollout curves. Okay, so the equation obviously holds for the Euclidean ball. And it's also clear, because that equation really represents the volume of a cone, this cone, if you apply a linear transformation to the problem, the only thing that happens is that. The only thing that happens is that this constant Cn is multiplied by the determinant of the linear transformation. So this is invariant of the linear transformation, and therefore an ellipsoid also will verify this equation. Okay, so now we're going to reformulate the problem. And first, we introduce the intersection bodies. They have already showed up during this conference. I'll remind you of the definition. So we define the intersection body of K. The intersection body of k is the body ik defined by the radial function, which is equal to the area of the central section perpendicular to zeta. So if we write these in polar coordinates, this volume is the integral of the radial function of k to the power n minus 1, and we integrate on the sphere on the plate perpendicular. On the plane perpendicular to theta, this is the spherical Radon transform of rho k to the power minus 1. So then the equation we started with can be restated as the radial function of the intersection body is a multiple of the radial function of the polar of the original body. So this is a new restatement of problem business. Statement of problem was not the default. Okay? So there's an affirmative local result. First of all, the affirmative local result for Pusman Petif is worked with Nazarov, Dima, and Blood. And the ingredients of the proof of this are the following. First, it was proven in this paper of fish, Nazarov, Rebogin and Slat. Paper of Fish, Nazarov, Rebogin, and Svavich in 2010 that the intersection body operator is a contraction in L2 in the neighborhood of the Euclidean ball. In other words, if K is a convex body that is very close to the Euclidean ball in the binary massive distance, then the intersection body operator acts like a contraction. There's up to a linear transformation here in the proof, but I don't want to get into that right now. But that's basically what you have to keep in mind. What you have to keep in mind. So that's the first step. But here we don't have the intersection body operator. We first apply the intersection body operator and then we take the polar. So the question was, do we still have a contraction after taking the polar? So the polar intersection body operator is also a contraction. To prove this, we need to do a maximum We need to do a maximal function estimate for the polar body. And I will get into details in the next slide. Alright, so here's the definition of the spherical card-little good maximum function. If the radial function of k is equal to 1 plus chi, where chi has Chi, where chi has a small L2 norm, has average zero, and of course it's even, because we're talking about origin symmetric bodies. So we consider the decomposition of chi in spherical harmonics, where phi is the polynomial and psi is the tail. Then we prove the following proposition. If k is close enough to the Euclidean ball in the Banamax distance, Then you can estimate the support function in terms of the radial function in a way. You know, to be more precise, if the radial function is equal to 1 plus 5 plus psi, then the support function is approximately equal. This is up to a constant, that will won't bother us in the proof. 1 plus 5 plus the spherical maximum, hardly maximum function of the tape. All right, so now let's see how the proof would work for the local version of Busman-Peltifi. We start with k close to the Euclidean body in the L2 norm. So we know we do have a contraction for the intersection body operator in this case. And then And then, now we have to deal with the polar. So, the L2 norm of the polar, I write the radial function in terms of the support function. Now, we're very close to the Euclidean ball, so 1 over the support function is comparable to the support function itself. And then we apply the maximum function estimate. We want to bound this by the radial function of ik. This is by the radial function of ik and this term by the previous proposition is bounded by constant the L2 norm of the maximal function of the tail. The maximal function is bounded in L2 with a constant that is independent of the dimension. And then the tail we make, so this is lambda epsilon. We can make this less than epsilon to the power greater than one by taking the tail. Taking the tail far enough so that overall we still are less than mu epsilon for some mu that still is less than one. Okay? And then we iterate. So you start with the original body K, take the prior intersection body, call that K. intersection body called that k2 define recursively your sequence of bodies km and then we have just proven that we have this contraction with mu is less than one and iterating this process we have that we have convergence to the Euclidean body in the L2 norm but our hypothesis was that k is equal to the polar intersection body which means all the terms in the sequence are equal to k and this proves our results equal to k and this proves our result. Alright, so now we're ready to go into the eighth Busman-Petty program. I have to make another picture. Again, I draw this like central section with him. And then we have that point P, which is the point of support of the plane, which is parallel to the plane of this section. What Busman and Petty asked in question 8 is: if the ellipsoids are characterized by the fact that the Gauss curvature at this point T is proportional to the volume of this Proportional to the volume of this section raised to the power minus n plus 1. Okay, Petty have already proven when they ask this question that the answer is yes in dimension 2, but the problem is completely open in dimension 3 and half, as of now. All right. Alright, so first we are going to write the curvature function fk of theta. This is the reciprocal of the Gaussian curvature as viewed as a function of the unit normal vector. So we restate our problem like this. If the curvature function of k is proportional to this, the volume of this section to the power n plus 1, does it mean that? To the power n plus 1, does it mean that k is an ellipsoid? So the first observation is as before, for a Euclidean ball, this is obviously true. And then it also takes more work than from the previous problem, but this equation is also invariant under linear transformations. The factor that you get for the constant is the determinant of t to the power n minus 1. So this is also satisfied by early. This is also satisfied by ellipsoids. All right, so as we did before, we're going to do an analytic reformulation of the problem. Now, it is known that if the support function is of the class C2 and the curvature of the body is strictly positive, then we can write the curvature function as an operation. As an operator A applied to the support function, and I didn't want to get into writing the formula that defines A. I'll just tell you this is a sum of the terminants of n minus 1 times n minus 1 minus of the Hessian matrix of the support function. So we have written the equation like this, where the volume of the section is as before, the Radondra. The section is as before the Radon transform of the radial function to the power n minus 1. So now this is our equation looks in these terms. And I'm going to explain how would one go to prove that for bodies close enough to the Euclidean ball in the Manat Master distance, it is true that all It is true that only this condition in pleasure body is an ellipsoid. Okay, so formally solving here for the support function, we will have this. And the key idea is to realize that raising to the power n plus 1 and then applying the inverse operator of a basically Of A basically leaves us with the Radon transform of N minus 1. In terms of the L2 norm, we're really not getting anything larger than we had before. So we want to exploit the fact that we do have a contraction here and see that this raising to this power and applying this operator doesn't increase the L to normal. So we still have a contraction. And as before, we're very And as before, we're very close to the Euclidean ball. The support function is comparable to 1 over the support function. And if you replace here hk by 1 over hk, this is exactly the formulation of problem 5. So now you see the connection between problem 8 and problem 5, and why I started talking about problem 5 first. Okay. So to explain this, first we're going to linearize the problem. This operator A is nonlinear. So the first thing we do is study its differential and see what we can prove for it. And the differential of the operator A at 1, so at the Euclidean ball, is actually the spherical Laplacian. is actually the spherical Laplacian. Well, plus a term with the identity, but that's not going to be any problem. Yes. Yes, locally. We're always locally near the ball. But the general equivalent. Yes, look, I'm using also this thing. I'm locally close to the Euclidean ball, all of in all of this setting. No, in general, there's nothing known either for five or four eight. Okay, now I just want to make this observation. For the spherical Laplacian, we know the eigenvalues for the spherical harmonics, and we're going to split this in the proof. So we have this lemma. So we have this lemma. When you linearize, there was the moment that we have raised to the power m plus 1, the Radon transform. When you linearize and you write this using Taylor's formula, that m plus 1 is a factor that's in front of your linear term. So that's why we have that m plus 1 here. So we prove that m plus 1 times the L2 norm of the inverse of our differential. Of our differential doesn't increase the alt-normal. And actually, I'm going to show the proof of this. Okay, so we write the psi in spherical harmonics. We have a very zero as before. And it's just applying first of all's formula here. We do have the eigenvalues, and this n plus one is this one. And this m plus 1 is this one. And then we notice because our m is greater than or equal to 2, all of these quantities can be bounded by m plus 1, which is what we wanted. Okay. And then, of course, let's go back if instead If instead of A inverse we have the differential of A inverse, we would be done. But we don't. So what is left is to study the difference between the operator A and its differential. Well, how do you do that? Basically, we know the bound on the Laplacian, we need to have a bound on the other mixed partial, second partial derivatives. So this is. Derivatives. So this is classical singular integraphs. We need to apply Risk transformance and boundary singular integers. And there is no time to show that, but I just wrote that this is what it remains to estimate to finish the proof, that this is very small and isn't that we still have a contraction after that. So I think that's all I wanted to talk about. Thank you. Questions, remarks? So you mentioned this very interesting question about intersection body polar being a k. So what if you do projection body? Clearly you can do a cube as well as a hole, right? Instead of intersection body, projection body. If you say projection body, polar supposed for a polarity. Yes. Chase is working on that. But the idea is basically the same. The same as you have that the intersection body operator is a contraction, there was this paper by Artema and Christos about the projection body operator being also a contraction in the neighborhood of the Euclidean ball. So the idea is. Euclidean ball. So the idea is basically that's the dual version of the fifth Busman Petty problem. So it's more or less follow the same idea and see that the maximal function estimate allows you to deal with the polar and then the contraction for the projection body is already proven. Does the other notes of this? Uh does the uh Barnes Mass distance uh depend on dimension? Yes, the cost all the costness depend on dimension here. No, no, no, no, no. We are actually, yeah, there's dimension and at some points we are carefully tracking that, but in general we don't care, but there is always the dimension, the dependence on dimension. The next talk is in 10 minutes. And I don't know why I know at least two theorems are then for speaking. This is planned for speed. Uh machine idea. So identity was identical to steps.      So most of the time it's a charge. You're annoying. Before I seem to come very highly in the summer, in last October I I met Diping in Shanghai. I was in Shanghai and he was also here there maybe for the national taste. So we met one day at the university. Very nice. So this is the process. Very beautiful systems. I mean, that's actually good. And uh what we're working on is who's all the Shmu costing problems. Very much, very much. Until September last year, you have still a lot of people. I'm looking for points. So but like this teacher
