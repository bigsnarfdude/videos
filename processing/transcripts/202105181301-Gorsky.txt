All right, thank you so much for inviting me to speak here. So, I will talk about tautological classes and some interesting operators acting in Kavanaugh-Frasansky homology of any naught and the symmetry which is implied by the existence of these operators in some sense. And all this is a joint work with Matt Fogen-Kamp and Anton Mehled, and it's on archive, and this is the number on archive, and so the plan. And so the plan, I mean, it's not so good plan, but I'll overview results, like what we expect from these interesting operators and how the symmetry is actually phrased. Then I'll talk about the idea of the proof. So idea will be basically some homological algebra. And I mean, not so much algebra, but I'll try to outline the main ideas. And then for people who don't like homological algebra, especially for people who like physics, I'll try to outline some geometric motivation behind all this, which was really. Motivation behind all this, which was really motivating for us, in particular for positive braids and for some part of Kavanaugh-Prasansky homology, there is a very concise geometric model, which was kind of well known. But in this model, we can construct explicitly all the stopological classes and verify the symmetry. And Anton Mel had a separate paper about this, and that I'll mention in the end. Okay, so what are the results? So, first of all, for any Results. So, first of all, for any link with any number of components, you can define HomeFly polynomial. And there are two versions of it: reduced and unreduced. So, unreduced is in general a rational function in A and Q, and reduced is a polynomial. And Kavanov and Rozansky defined so-called triply graded homology, HHH, with three gradings I, J, and K, which categorify this unreduced polynomial. So, if we take alternative. If we take alternating sum with respect to k grading, so k is kind of homological grading here, and q to the power j and a to the power i, add all this up, you get big graded polycharacteristic of this triply graded homology. And this recovers the home-fly PT polynomial of the link. And because this left-hand side in general is a rational function, on the right-hand side, you expect an infinite-dimensional space. So HHH in general is infinite-dimensional. General is infinite dimensional. And there is a reduced version for people who don't like infinite dimensional spaces. So, this is usually called HHH bar, and it's mostly well-defined for nodes. There are some versions for links, but I'll mention this later. But for nodes, there is a really well-defined version, which is called HHH-bar. It's nice, finite-dimensional vector space, and it could signify so-called reduced Honflap polynomial where the value of unknown is one. And for this reduced version, And for this reduced version, we prove our main theorem. And it says that Kamano-Frasansky homology is symmetric in the following sense. So there is a symmetry which preserves A grading, reverses the Q grading. So Q grading goes from negative 2J to 2J, and does something interesting to the K grading. So it shifts this by 2J. And I have to say that in some appropriate normalization, Q grading is always even. So you can always. Is always even. So you can always normalize the formula polynomial. So it depends on even powers of Q. The same holds for homology, and that is the normalization that we use. And in particular, so we compare Q grading negative 2j and Q grading 2j. And with appropriate shift of homological grading, the spaces are isomorphic. So they have the same dimension. At least over a field. So we don't consider torsion here, I would say. Here, I would say. And this was actually conjectured by Gukov, Danfield, and Rasmussen in a very remarkable paper from 2005. So, this was a pretty old conjecture for 15 years. And in that paper, it was remarkable in many ways. So, in that paper, at the time, there was no definition of Kovan-Frashansky homology. So, they conjectured that such a theory exists and they predicted lots of properties. And the theory was constructed a couple of years after that. Years after that. And they computed still lots of examples like how this hypothetical theory would look like. And this is an example of Kavanaugh-Frasansky homology for 3-4-Taurus node. So you go around the torus three times in one direction and four times in the other direction. And Hohenzoi polynomial is well known. And they predicted that Kavanaugh homology looks like this. This was confirmed shortly afterwards. So it is 11-dimensional. And there is a lot going on in this picture. And there is a lot going on in this picture. So let me try to say something. So there are three rows here. They correspond to the A grading. So the bottom row has A grading zero, the next row has A grading one, and the following has A grading two in some conventions. And the numbers indicate the T grading, the homological grading, and kind of horizontal position is the Q grading here. And there are all these errors which I don't want to. And there are all these errors which I don't want to explain. But the most important feature of this paper and of this picture is that it's clearly symmetric with respect to the vertical axis of symmetry. And so this symmetry reverses the Q gradient. It does something interesting to the T gradient, but you can figure out what it does exactly. And they conjecture that for any knot, this picture is always symmetric and there is this vertical axis of symmetry. There is this vertical axis of symmetry. And this conjecture was open for almost 15 years. And very recently, in the end of last year, there were two other approaches that I need to mention. So one, Yoda, Blankov, and Rosansky. So they used the very, very complicated machinery of Matrix factorizations over Hubert schemes of points on the plane and over other spaces related to groups and the algebras. And it's a combination of about five. Of about 500-page papers, when they build basically a separate model for Kavanaugh-Frasansky homology, that model is manifestly symmetric in QNT for notes, which they prove in a separate paper. And then finally, they prove that their model is actually isomorphic to Kavan-Frasansky homology in, I think, December last year. And so, as a result, Kavan-Frasansky homology is symmetric. So, this is very technical. Symmetric. So, this is very technical but very powerful machinery, which says that basically we have a different model for covanitarian. And also, in December, Galashin and Lam gave a different model. I mean, they didn't give a model, but they give a proof for some special class of nodes related to Richardson varieties. And they used methods from geometric representation theory. Namely, they used so-called graded Kazoole duality for category OR and for mixed perverse shoes. And for mixed perverse sheaves and flag varieties, and lots of other machinery developed by Bzurkovnikov and Jung and geometric representation theory. And I have to say that both approaches are very technical, at least in my opinion. So they use very heavy machinery of geometric representation theory. And what I will try to explain is more pedestrian and more straightforward approach. And one advantage of our approach is that it generalizes to links and Generalizes to links, and we need this generalization to links in order to complete the proof. And also, we have list of total logical classes, which I'm not sure how they can define in their approaches. So, in any case, there are now three different proofs of the same result. Eugene, sorry for interrupting. If it's okay, if moderator allows me to ask a quick question. The other approaches, they don't generalize to links, just to clarify. So, Galashian and Lab should not generalize to links as far as I understand. Not generalize to links as far as I understand, and there are some kind of deep reasons why it can't because it uses Zorgil modules as opposed to Zorgil py modules. Ablonkov and Drazhansky probably should generalize to links, but it's not written. And I don't know if Lev can comment on that maybe in the end of the talk, but my expectation is that Oblonkov and Drzhansky should be able to generalize to links as well in some form. But I will explain on the next slide why there is an issue with generalization to links, like why it's not. With generalization to links, like why it's not straightforward. And again, like tautological classes, it's an interesting question if any of them can see this. But again, I will give them for free in some sense. So this will be part of the construction. All right, so what are the problems for games? Since Sergei asked, so the biggest problem is that there is no good reduced homology. And the main reason why there is no good reduced homology. No good reduced homology is that for any link with C components, there is an action of a big polynomial ring with C variables x1 through xc acting on this link homology. So for topologists, this action comes from the action of a node. So if you have any link with any number of components and you put a mark point somewhere on the node, you can have this kind of merge cabordism with unnod. And this gives an action of homology of unnaut on homology of nodes. Of homology of unknown on homology of the node, which will depend on the marked point. And in particular, if you choose a marked point on different components, you have C different actions of a polynomial ring, all of this commute. And so you have an action of C variable polynomial ring on this homology. And somehow to define reduced homology, you would need to kill this action. And you can't just do it on the level of homology. You need to do it on the level of chain complexes. So you need to do some kind of homological algebra of the. Do some kind of homological algebra over this polynomial ring, and that's pretty delicate, I would say. And the main issue why you need to do this is that the degrees of xi are not preserved by the symmetry. So you have a complicated module or polynomial ring. It's generally not free, but it's infinite dimensional and xi increased the q degree. And if you apply the symmetry naively, then the degrees of xi are not preserved. Not preserved, and so you cannot have a symmetry on unreduced homology. If there would be reduced homology, maybe there is a symmetry, but it's kind of subtle. And so the first idea is to use some other variables which would be dual to xi under this symmetry, which is still hypothetical. And so this was defined by myself and Matt Foggenkamp a couple of years ago. So we defined so-called Wi-Fi homology, HY. Called Wi-Fi homology HYWL. And it's slightly different version of this Kavanaugh-Frasansky homology, which I will define in a couple of slides. And Wi-Fi homology is naturally moduled over two sets of variables, x1 through xc and y1 through yc. So you have x and y for each component of the link. And then the symmetry would just exchange xi with yi, and all the degrees match up. The degrees match up, and then it's kind of natural to expect that this module is indeed symmetric with respect to this swapping X's and Y's. And one example which we computed in the paper was math was the example of N and K and Taurus link. So this is a link of N components. All of them are unknowns, but the linking is interesting. So each two components have linking number K. And And by what I've said before, so the homology of this link should be a module over n x's and n y's. So it's an interesting module. And we were able to compute this module like this in the theorem. So it is an intersection of over all i not equal to j, ideals generated by xi minus xj, yi minus yj, and theta i minus theta j raised to the power key. So x is To the power key, so x is and y's are even variables which I kind of defined above, and thetas are odd variables which are additional, which carry the A grading. And these polynomials in X's, Y's, and thetas, this is just homology of unlink or Wi-Fi homology of fun link. And so homology of the N, K, and Taurus link sits inside the homology of unlink, and it has this explicit description, which may be not so important. Which may be not so important for the talk, but it's really useful to know. And in particular, it's clearly symmetric in X's and Y's. So this ideal is clearly symmetric with respect to swapping X's and Y's. And that's kind of another good indication of this symmetry. And just in case, so if you want to recover Kavanaugh-Frasansky homology, you just take this answer and quotient by Wise. So quotient by maximal ideal generated by Wise. You get some module over x's, but it's really, really complicated. And it's definitely not symmetric in x's and y's. And there is no symmetry which kind of does it if you kill y's, but you don't kill x's. So that's kind of structure that we see. Okay. And so now the main result. So for any link L. For any link L, we can consider Wi-Fi homology H Y of L, and there is an infinite family of operators FK which satisfy the following relations. So all these operators commute within each other. They commute with the action of Xi. They don't commute with the action of Yi. And the commutator is given by this formula, Kxi to the K minus 1. So they kind of interestingly. interestingly intertwined x's and y's. And then you have a special operator F2, which satisfies so-called Hard-Lechitz properties. So F2 has degree 0, 4, and 2. And if I apply this to this group, H, Y, I negative to J, K, if I apply J times, then I get to this group. And then the theorem says that this is an isomorphism between this, and therefore this HY is isomorphism. Therefore, this HY is isomorphic to this HY, and this is the symmetry that we were looking for. So it's kind of similar to Leipzig's property in the usual homology of projective variety that you have a class in H upper two, you start capping with this, and this realizes pancreatuality. So that's kind of the story here. And so, in particular, this F2 extends to an action of Lie algebra CL2 on this Wi-Fi homology. And so, that is the main theorem. And so that is the main theorem that we can construct these operators, and furthermore, F2 is kind of F operator in this SL2 or like capping with this class in H2. And so this works for links. And if we want the result for nodes, we observe that Hy of a node, you just reduced HHH of the node, tensor with polynomials in one variable X and one variable Y. In this case, it's actually. In this case, it's actually a pre-module over x and y, and you can peel it off. And so, if this whole thing is symmetric, then HHH of k is also symmetric. And in particular, if you have these operators on hy, you can also have a trivial sum end here, but you define some interesting operators on reduced hhh of a node as well. So, that is, I think, the main result. So, maybe I'll pause here and ask if there are any questions. Okay, so if there are no questions, then I'll proceed and explain the ideas. First of all, I think I'll explain the definition of Kavanaugh-Frasansky homology and this HY, and I'll proceed and try to explain how these operators are constructed explicitly. Okay, so what is Kavanaugh-Frasansky homology? So we start from So we start from polynomial ring in n variables. And I didn't say this, but I'll say this later: that you want to present your node as a closure of a braid, and this braid will be on n strands, and n is the number of variables that you have here. And then for each i, you define a bimodal of the following form. So it will be r tensor r over the ring of invariant polynomials when I swap. Of invariant polynomials when I swap i and i plus ones variable. It's not so important what the definition is, especially if you see this for the first time. What is important, though, it is that you it is a bimodal over r. So there are two different actions of r on the left and on the right. And somehow antipologically, this corresponds to the fact that you have a braid and you have an action of unnaught dependent. Of unknown depending on marked point. And if you have a braid, you can naturally choose your marked point in n different positions on the bottom of the braid and n different positions on the top of the braid. And so this gives you two n different actions of a naught, which correspond to n variables, which we will call x1 through xn. And that's the left action of r, and x1 prime through xn prime, which will be the right action of r. And this is fairly standard in like all. Fairly standard in like all non-homology theorem that if you have a braid, then you have two n-different variables corresponding to that node. Now, if you have a simple crossing, if it's a positive crossing, you associate a two-term complex of these bimodals, BI to R. If you have a negative crossing, you associate a two-term complex R to Bi. And if you have any braid, you just tensor this together over R. And again, like if you haven't seen. R and again, like if you haven't seen this before, it sounds like really abstract, but it is what it is. And a result of Rukia says that this Ti and Ti inverse, they satisfy braid relations, and in particular, this is well-defined up to homotopy. And the braid closure corresponds to so-called causal homology of this complex of bimodals. And I'll swipe all the details under the rock. I just want to say that there is a theorem of Kavanaugh and Rosansky. Kavana Franzansky, which says that this complicated algebraic construction outputs a topological invariance of the closure of the braid beta. So we presented our link as the closure of beta. And in particular, the number of strands in the braid could be different. We can present the same link near the closure of different braids, but the result is still the same. So up to overall grading shift, this is a well-defined construction. This is a well-defined construction. And so we want to start from a braid and construct our tautological classes FK from the previous slide, basically, or some versions of them. And for this, we need to define a remarkable DJ algebra, which we call DJ algebra A. So first I get the usual algebra, B, and this is just polynomials in x's and x primes, which are exactly the same as left and right. Are exactly the same as left and right actions on bimodules before on the previous slide. And we require that any symmetric function in x's is the same as the same symmetric function in x primes. And that was definitely true for these bimodules, because semantic functions are in this ring Ri plus one. And so whatever you do with these Rouquier complexes, semantic functions in x's and semantic functions in x primes are the same. And x primes are the same. Then the key definition is that we have a DG algebra extending this B. So, in addition to x's and x primes, we have additional generators psi's of degree one and additional generators u's of degree two with the following differential. So, differential of psi i is xi minus xi prime. And so, I'll say it. And so I'll say it in a second, but roughly speaking, you should think about it as a homotopy. So xi is a homotopy between the action of x i's on the left and x i's on the right. So I said that depending on mark point, you can act by the homology of unnaut. And if you slide this mark point through the cruising, you have an interesting homotopy between this left and right action. And if you've seen this before, xi. And if you've seen this before, XI play the role of this homotopist. And this u's are new things. So, this is kind of the most important thing in this paper that we can track this u's. And the differential of u's is a complete symmetric function of xi and xi prime times psi i. So, so far, something abstract. And I want to comment that with this definition, this That with this definition, this square is equal to zero. And the reason is that you start from u k. So this square of psi is equal to zero. That's obvious. The square of uk is also equal to zero because you replace here psi i by xi minus xi prime. You have this complete symmetric function times xi minus xi prime and sum over all i. And this is the same as sum of x i to the k. same as sum of x i to the k minus sum of xi prime to the k and that is equal to zero because we assume that any symmetric function in x's is the same as any symmetric function in xi prime and therefore at least this square is equal to zero in this digital algebra so that's everything is well defined and then why this algebra is important so algebraically there are two things here one is that this is a free resolution One is that this is a free resolution of R as a B module. So we can abstractly say consider R as a module over this algebra B and get a free resolution. But it is really important to have this explicit model here, as we will see. And then the most important property of this algebra is that it has a co-product. So you have a map from A to A tensor A, and it's not A tensor A. A and it's not a tensor a on the nose, it's a tensor a over r. And you have explicit formulas described in this coproduct. And maybe I don't want to say much about it, but kind of x's go to x's, size goes to size. But the interesting formula is on the bottom. So coproduct of uk is uk tensor one, one tensor uk, and then you have some correction term involved in just sides. And so you have lots of discretion. And so you have lots of these correction terms if you iterate this coproduct. And that will be important for us, but maybe too technical. And we check that this coproduct is co-associative up to homotopy. And again, if you like homological algebra, you could just say that, well, it's resolution of R. R tensor R over R is still R. And so you know the existence of this co-product from general kind of homological algebra, but it's really useful to know that it can. Really useful to know that it can be given by this formula, and it's really co-associative up to homotopy. And maybe another comment is that this algebra actually appeared before in a different presentation in a work of Abel and Hogenkamp. So they constructed this as anti-symmetric projector, and it was useful for construction of colors homology for them. Okay. Any questions here about the definition of algebra? Here about the definition of algebra, about this co-product. Good, and then we can use this algebra for something interesting. So, first of all, this algebra does act on simple crossings. So, recall that for simple crossing, you had this two-term complex. You know how to act by x's on both of these terms. You know how to act by x primes on both of these terms. That's easy. That's easy. Psi gives you explicit map from backwards from R to B, which can be constructed. And then all the u's act by zero, and the same kind of here. So this is really easy. And as I try to explain, so for a simple crossing, the action of x is on the left and action on the right is homotopic up to this permutation of variables. And ψ realized this, what is known in the literature as Dodge-lighting homotopies. Dot slide in Hamla dot this and all UK is just equal to zero in this case for simple crossing because they have degree two and this is just two term complex so there is no room for degree two operator basically but now we can use the coproduct to extend the action to arbitrary tensor products of ti's because if you have an action on ti of the algebra and if you have an action on some other ti of the algebra you can use this method algebra you can use this map to say that you have an action of a tensor r over a on the tensor product and use co-product to give it the structure of a module and combining these ideas together we get the following theorem which is one of our main theorems that there is an action of this digitalgebra on the rookie complex for any braid positive or negative doesn't matter this action is well defined up to homotopia and its invariant Homotopia and it's invariant on the braid relations. So, in fact, if the action exists, it is unique and we construct it explicitly starting from these elementary pieces and using the coproduct. And that's already good, but it doesn't give us yet the action on homology. And the reason why it doesn't, because this size and use, they are not closed operators. So, if you want an interesting action on homology, you want a closed operator. Homology, you want a closed operator acting on chain complex. And so we need to tweak the definition of chain complex a little bit. And this is this definition of y fiction. So we had our all differential, whatever it is, and then we deformed the differential with size and formal variables yi. So xi is the same as before. And the new differential is d plus sum of xi i y i. So I so these y's are in some sense because all dual took size, but you don't need to say that. And these are even variables, and size are odd. Now, this deformed differential doesn't square to zero, but it does after closing the brake. And so you can still define the homology of it, at least first taking Holtz's homology, then the square is equal to zero, and then you take homology of this differential. Homology of this differential. And this is what we call Wi-Fi homology. And again, a couple of years ago, we proved with Matt that this Wi-Fi homology is the topological invariant of the closure of beta. So it doesn't depend how we present it as a braid. And I have to say, again, should have put it on the slide, that this Wi-Fi homology for Kavanaugh homology, it was considered before by Batson and Seed, and then for some versions of And then, for some versions of home-fly homology, it was considered by Caudis and Kamniser. So, it's not particularly new construction. We give a slightly different presentation, but for people who've seen this butts and seed spectral sequence and butts and seed homology, it's very related to that. And once we deform the differential, we can also deform the use. And the u's are deformed like this. So, we have now these y variables, everything is free. These y variables, everything is free over y's, at least on the level of complexes. So we can take this d over dyi, multiply by a complete semantic function, add uk. So uk is not closed, and this doesn't commute with y. And these two facts together actually cancel out, and you can check that this deformed differential and this deformed use commute. And so FK give you well-defined operators on Wi-Fi homology. And I mean, somehow we designed this extra term to make this work. And so we have an action of lots of interesting operators on Wi-Fi homology. And the main theorem is that this action is actually topological invariant of the closure of the link. And you have to be a bit careful here if you want to be precise. So far, the number of u's and the number of f's is the number of strands. Is the number of strands, but you can extend it and you can kind of increase the number of F's and the number of U's to make it infinite and make kind of stabilize it and so that it does not depend on the number of strands. So there is some technical point here, but let me avoid it. So the first part of the theorem is there, and we construct with this apparatus. And basically, by this construction, it's clear that all these commutation relations fold. So they commute with axes. So, they commute with x's, they commute with each other, and they commute with y's in an interesting way. And so, the second part is to prove hard lefts, but that's actually pretty standard once we have all this. And so, the idea is that we use Kane relations, basically. So, whenever you have a positive crossing and a negative crossing, you have so-called scan exact triangle between the positive crossing, the negative crossing, and this complex KR. And this complex ki plus one, where kij is this two-term complex from R. So this cone of multiplication by xi minus xj, in this case by xi minus xi plus one. And so what we prove is that this guy has an action of this algebra A. This guy has an action of the algebra A. This guy has an action of the algebra A, and this is exact triangle, roughly speaking at the category of A mode. Roughly speaking, in the category of A modules, there is some subtlety, but in appropriate category, this is an exact triangle. And so, whenever you have a braid built from these guys and from these guys and from these guys, you have exact triangle respecting the action of F's and on homology. And so, this allows us to use scale relations to change the braid. And so, we start from some complicated braid, we use scale relations to simplify it to. Use kin relations to simplify to basically a bunch of unlinks or unknots. And then we all this can use with the action of F2 and FK. And then we can on elementary complexes which are unlinked, maybe with a bunch of Kij's, we compute this action of these tetrological classes explicitly, verify hard lefts for them, and then use five lemmas. So five lemma in homological algebra just tells you that Chromological algebra that just tells you that if you checked it for if you check this hard lashes property for braid containing Ti and positive crossing and negative crossing, then we proved it for this one and so on. And so you can, if you prove the hard Lash property for two of the links in this exact sequence, you proved it for the third one. And that's the idea. And so that's basically how all this works. So we construct F2 and then use. So, we construct F2 and then use pretty little metric monological algebra to do this. So, I think the hard work is to make sure that these FKs are well defined and they don't depend on anything. They really can be defined explicitly for any braid. You can compute it, and that's important for this computation: that you can compute it from these pieces of a braid, and you can do skin exact sequences here. Exact sequences here. And maybe one comment, which I didn't put on the slide, is that you have this formula. So I should have said this earlier, but somehow if you have two pieces and you want to use coproduct to extend the action of A to the tensor product, what do you do actually? You have action of UK in the first factor, action of UK in the second factor, and the bicep stop. And so somehow, even though the action of UK is trivial on all the crosses, Uk is trivial on all the crossings, these extra correction terms give you interesting action of UK and products of elementary crossings. And you can control it, especially for U2 and F2. And that's why you get an interesting operator on the product of crossings, although for individual crossings, you don't get anything interesting at all. And I don't know if it was clear, but hopefully it was. Okay, and so in remaining time, I want to comment a little bit on the geometric motivation behind all this. So, we had some digital algebra, we had some co-products, we had some weird constructions, where this might come from. And for us, and especially, I think, for Anton, it came from some old and classical results in group homology. And so, let me review that and talk how. Let me review that and talk how this might be related to anything. And so we have a group which is just GLNC, and I want to construct interesting differential forms on the group and on powers of the group. And so the classical result is that if you have a symmetric function in n variables of degree D, then there is a way, which goes back to bot, I guess, to construct differential forms on G. So there is a form in So there is a form in 2d minus 1, there is a 2d minus form on g and so in particular homology of g is generated in degrees 3, 5, 7 and so on, or 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on, in all odd degrees. So this form is closed. It gives you interesting homology class of the group. But there are more. And so there is an interesting 2d minus 2 form on g cross g and there is an interest in 2d minus 3 form on g cross g g interesting 2d minus 3 form and g cross g cross g all the way up to the dth power of g where you have an interesting d form and they satisfy a bunch of kind of co-cycle relations and we'll need only two of them so the first form on the group is actually closed so this gives you a co-homology class on the group and the second form is not closed but the differential measures something related to co-product of the first Something related to the co-product of the first. So you have this multiplication map from g cross g to g you can pull back phi one along the multiplication map and compare it with phi one tensor one and one tensor phi one. And then the difference is actually zero in homology, so it's a boundary of something and this is your phi two. So this is sometimes called transgressions, sometimes called kind of simplicial model for group homology and things like that. For group of homology and things like this. So, this is pretty classical, but it should be known better, I would say. At least I didn't know this when we started. And so if we start, for example, from sum of xi squared, that's a symmetric function of degree two. So this construction is supposed to give me a three-form on the group and two-form on j cross g. And this three-form on the group is well known, and the two-form on j cross g is also actually. Two-form angro G is also actually well known and written in many textbooks. But again, this differential of two-form is non-zero three-form on John G, which can be written explicitly by this form. And Atiya, Bot, Jeffrey, and many other people use these forms to construct interesting cohomology classes on character varieties. And the idea is that if you have a bunch of geo-valid functions, you can construct forms. And let me try to explain. forms and let me try to explain how this is done so if you have some manifold x and you have a g valid function f and you have some manifold y with the g valid function g, then you can take the form which we had on g, pull back to x, and assume that this is a differential of some other form omega x. And you take the the And you take the form on g pull back on y, and you get again differential of some omega y. So, I mean, the most standard example is that we have a three-form on g, we pull back, and it's a boundary of some two-form. And you have pull back here, it's again a boundary of some two-form. And then the question is, is there any convolution of this construction? And so you have a map from x cross y to g, which is just multiplication of these functions. Of these functions, but you cannot just add the forms. And when you do something to the forms, you need to correct your map by this extra form on G cross G, which measures this failure of coproduct in some sense. And so you have F cross G of this extra form phi2. And this still satisfies that the differential of this new form is the pullback of three form on G. Is the pullback of three form on G under this convolution and so this is actually very similar to what we have here so we have kind of we had a formula when we had uk tensor one and one tensor k plus correction terms and these correction terms are very similar to this in some precise sense if we work equivariantly i would say and i don't want maybe to say too much about this but like one specific thing is that for example you have a matrix valid function That, for example, you have a matrix-valued function, and this is pullback of phi1 is just zero. And you have another matrix function, and pullback of phi one is also zero. But this construction could give a non-zero form on x cross y, because this is zero, this is zero, but this thing could be non-zero, it could be interesting phi too. And so, how this all comes together is this notion of braid variety introduced by many people. By many people, in this particular form, it was introduced by Anton Mellet in a previous paper, and the variety is defined as following. So, you have a positive braid. It only works for positive braids. You have a bunch of crossings. For each crossing, you define some matrix depending on one variable. And you multiply all these matrices, and you require that the product of these matrices is upper triangular. And you have some explicit matrices. have some explicit matrices some explicit formula for these matrices and then again the question is like can you say anything about this variety can you construct some interesting forms in this variety uh and the answer is yes and basically the construction is exactly the same as before so you regard these forms this bi as matrix valid function for each of them you can construct a two form and you have this kind of convolution procedure for these two forms which Convolution procedure for these two forms, which was described in previous slides. That you convol them, but you add this extra correction term, which kind of corresponds to our coproduct. And so combining these ideas, Mellet proved that there is an algebraic closed two-form on this variety. And then the cop product with this form satisfies so-called curious hard lashes property conjectured by other people and Hausil, Little Rodriguez Villages, with respect to. Villages with respect to weight filtration and cohomology. And the relation to lean homology is also known, and it goes back to at least Webster and Williamson, where they say that homology of this variety is essentially one piece of one particular A degree of Kavanaugh-Frasansky homology. So, this works for positive rates, but it's some very explicit construction. Explicit construction. But I think what's different between this and Webster Williamson, for example, is that first of all, you don't work with sheaves, you work with varieties, which is fine because the braid is positive. But you also have a fine model. And so this variety is affine. And therefore, you don't need to think too much about constructing interesting cohomology classes. You can just write differential forms, and that just works. And so you can write explicit. And so you can write explicit differential form on this thing. It represents your cohomology class, and you can check all these properties pretty explicitly. And you can do lots of other stuff. So we wrote a separate paper with Rojeka Sals, my brother, and Fosici Matar. So we studied these varieties from various points of view. And in particular, we proved that this variety is smooth. And this form that we get is holomorphic symplectic everywhere. So it has lots of nice properties. And you can study this variety. Properties, and you can study this variety from lots of different points of view. And maybe another point of view, which was taken by Galashan and Lam in this recent paper, which I think is very nice and beautiful, is that this variety is also known to people. And in particular, if we start from this variety photorus node, it's isomorphic to so-called open pesotroid stratum in the Grassmannian MM. In the Grassmannian Mm plus M up to a free action of the torus. And so, in particular, if you want to study its homology or symmetries in forms, you can study it using positroids or some other things. And for example, so I started this presentation from 3,4 torus naught. And what is the variety correspondent to 3,4 torus naught? Well, you can write it in terms of flags or matrices, but I think this work of Galaxy. This work of Galachian Alam gives you the most compact presentation as explicit open stratum in Grassmanian 3.7, which is also known as E6 cluster variety. And cluster people actually computed this homology completely separately by completely different methods. And they computed the weight filtration cohomology. And so in Vadiergo Laman Speyer gave this table of cohomology of this E6 cluster variety, which is Which is five-dimensional, and it looks like this. So, vertical columns correspond to homological grading, and horizontal rows correspond to the weight filtration. And so, our two-form that I was trying to explain corresponds to class in H upper two. This is the square of this two-form. This is the cube of this two-form. And then there is an interesting four-form, which also comes from this kind of tipological class construction. So, you start. Construction. So you start from symmetric function sum of x iq. It gives you a five form on the group and it gives you a four form on g cross g. And you can cook up some interesting homology class here. And it's not what they do, but you can do it anyway. And so maybe I'd like to just say that one can compare this with the bottom row of own flag homology from the beginning. So you have a five-dimensional. Homology from the beginning. So you have a five-dimensional space here with this 0, 2, 4, 4, 6. And this is precisely what you see here. So you see 0, 2, 4, 4, and 6. And this is, I think, remarkable that like two completely different worlds of like non-homology and differentials and whatnot. And this was done using some machinery of classifiers. They give exactly the same answer with correct by gradings. And somehow the methods. And somehow the methods are very, very similar. And I think that's all what I want to say. So. Great. Let's all thank you, Eugene. Let's see. Do we have questions? So you mentioned that you you have sort of an SL two action and you're coming from this F2. Is it possible to explicitly construct the sort of corresponding operator going backwards? No. That's a very interesting question. So we don't know how to construct it on the chain level. So we just know that it exists because So, we just know that it exists because of these hard layers, but we don't have any explicit construction. And one thing which we don't know, which we really want to know, is how it commutes with the rest of F case. So we know that F2 commutes with F case. We kind of know that this other guy from SL2 couldn't commute with them at all. Because like, but, and we have some conjecture what could be the commutation relation, but it's pretty complicated. And I don't see any way of like using this machinery to check this commutation. Like using this machinery to check this commutation relation because that would be too. I mean, again, we don't have it on chain level, and it's not clear how to compare. No questions. Marco? Nice talk, very nice details. I have one question which is not directly related with this last observation. Last observation, but you said that Fks in general are topological invariant, so action of FK on each, well, for each K, right? It should be for all of them. And it seems to be computable. Can you see, is there some example of like not with the same homology, but with different actions of Fks? No, that's a very good question. Like, I mean, it's a question: like, can we use them explicitly for the large family of notes? Like, that would be. The life fame, and if not, like that would be an awesome project. Of course, is there some target example of that? I mean, because they might carry also many information in them, because Es are very hard, of course, and all this, but at least F case or F2, these hard lapses. No, I mean, hard lapsets, you can guess from the symmetry, I guess, in all examples that at least like in this Danford Google Rasmussen. So that's not a big deal. That's not a big deal, but like computing FKs, even in all these examples, is very interesting. And so, you can ask, like, what is the homology as a module over FKs? So, for example, for torus nodes, we have a lot of interesting results about homology of torus nodes. Is this module generated like by one vector? It's like maybe dual is generated by one vector or something like this. What is the meaning? What is like, what are the relations between FKs and this homology, and so on? So, understanding. So, understanding the homolog as a model over Fk, I think, is like a wide open problem, which exists because of this result. But we didn't compute many examples except for F2. And in principle, that should be very interesting. So, I mean, so far, we just computed this F2 and FK for things which kind of unlink with a bunch of these Kazoo complexes, control strands. And there, it's already. And there it's already already quite interesting, but I think there is a lot to explore. And there are other, maybe I should have mentioned that there are other models for not homology which are kind of not in this vein, but related to like Hebrew scheme of plane curve singularities and other things. And there, there are some tautological classes which kind of should be related to F keys. We don't know if they're related to F keys, and there are lots of things to explore there as well. Okay, good. Well, thanks. Okay, because other questions may may make a comment. So physicists know that these homologies correspond to the following situation. You have a five-dimensional Q of T whose space is Taub naught. And in that Taub naught, you have a two-dimensional defective cigar. A cigar and the homology is counting particular ways of vibrations of this cigar. So apparently there is a way to melt this cigar, to remove it for a moment. So imagine that this defect is not present yet. So there is a, instead of the space of BPS states, you have a module. You have a module over some variables x and y. x and y are coordinates in the top nut. So if you have a link of k components, then you have one variable x and one variable y associated with each component, and you build a complex of modules over k variables x and k variables of y. And then when you decide When you decide how, so since the link has k components, for each component, you have a choice, for example, of a cigar that you want to pick, whether it's y equals to zero or x equals to zero. So at this point, you multiply this complex of modules by other, by a module which says that some x is equal to zero and other y's are equal to zero. And this gives you a homology. This gives you a homology corresponding to this distribution of link components. So, the funny fact, so, first of all, this pre-existing complex of modules is equivariant with respect to GL2 rotations of tau naught, of C2. So it doesn't know about your choice of placing the cigars. The cigars before you place the cigars, there is a full symmetry. And second funny fact is that apparently there is more than GL2 action. This complex of modules is equivariant with respect to Hamiltonian vector fields on C2, which is really funny. So part of the structure is in our paper with Misha Kovanov on with algebra. on with algebra action of on on link homology that's what remains of your hamiltonian here here i should uh i should uh quote anton millet who mentioned these hamiltonian vector fields on facebook asked a question about them so if you put all your cigars all your m2s on one particular cigar then the remaining symmetry is Then the remaining symmetry is the homorphic vector fields on that cigar, and that's what we studied with Michael. And what you see here in Eugene's talk is another piece of those vector fields, which differentiate along x variable and multiply by polynomials in variable y. So that's a particular subspace in all Hamiltonian vector. Space in all Hamiltonian Vyaker fields, but generally there should be the action of all Hamiltonian Vyaker fields on C2. And it's a funny symmetry of this five-dimensional cube. So there are two funny facts, I think, from the point of view of physics. Number one is this Hamiltonian vehicle field structure. And number two, that there is a mother complex of modules, which then tells you. Which then tells you what will be BPS states when you choose the placement of your defects. Sorry, if that was a long comment. I mean, I just want to say an answer to Jake's question as well, because like this Hamiltonian vector fields, if we believe this conjecture, that so the algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields on the plane, it has a SL2 in it, where the Hamiltonians are like x squared, xy, and y squared, and it also has. Squared and it also has another commutative subalgebra generated by just the powers of x. So all these are Poisson commuting functions, so they give you commuting operators. And so the claim is that SL2 and this thing, I mean, the relations between them are such that they generate this algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields on C2. I think that's like the honest answer, but we have We have, I mean, I personally have no idea how to check this, except like in some examples where we can compute it. So maybe one more comment is that we can compute it in this Torus Not example. In this example. So in this example, we can compute all these FKs because we know them for unlink and somehow the map preserve the action of FK. And so there it is indeed. And so there it is indeed related to Hamiltonian vector fields on C2. But in general, yeah, that's wide open conjecture. It's a beautiful story. I wouldn't say that it's unnatural physically, right? Because, you know, the brain that you sort of, at least, well, it doesn't match well with Tobias's talk. It doesn't mesh well with Tobias's talk, where the brain associated to the notch plays a key role. But from the perspective of gen duality, from another perspective, where your BPS states come from the bulk and they just break at the brain. The brain is just a defect. And I think your description somehow emphasizes that. Not that there's nothing to understand, of course, it's beautiful and but it's not puzzling. I have a question about picture. So you put the Jake's picture on the beginning, right? And you didn't explain what are this red and blue arrows, but everybody knows what they are. So, right? So how your algebra interacts with this blue and red arrows, which you did not comment on? So, okay, so there are two parts of the answer. So, first, you because everything is defined really on the level of braids, so you can define it in conflict homology, you can define it in Kavanaugh homology or in the Selena homology as well. So, all this should work through nicely. And you won't get symmetry, of course. So, symmetry will be broken, but like these operators are still well defined, and I think. Are still well defined, and I think, like, we didn't check it super carefully, but I think it just follows from what I just said, and Jake will correct me that this will correct this FTA commute with the differential, with the Selen differentials, more or less by definition, because they are defined on the level of chain complex for a braid. I think so, at least. So, I think they should come out with this blue differential, which corresponds to To SLN differentials. And then, I mean, these red differentials go another way and they're symmetric to this. So you can formally define red ones by kind of combining the symmetry and the blue ones. But you can ask, like, is there any intrinsic definition? Is there kind of like, what are other commutation relations? What is the commutation relation between this E, between this other SL2 guy with the differential? And that we still don't know. But that's, I think, part of this. Know. But that's, I think, part of this understanding commutation relation story. And where is the width algebra that Lev mentions in this picture? That's also interesting. All this stuff and lots of examples would be wonderful, which, yeah, I'd love to answer. Thanks. So, do you see that to define the SLN differentials, you have to break the symmetry between x's and y's? Yes. But maybe if you define like sl n dash n, then it's here, then it's still symmetric. I mean, it's symmetric if you swap m and n. Yes. So here, like in this picture, like this is not done in general, but in this picture, you have a differential which kind of takes this odd variable theta and sends to some monomial x to the m and y to the m. M and why do they m and that like conjecturally according to like our conjectures with Jake and Alexi from 10 years ago that should be related to J-Lehmann differentials but we still don't know and it's still wide open but in particular just the Selen differential sends theta i to xi to the power n, like capital N. And so that breaks down. So that is not symmetric on x's and y and that breaks down the symmetry. And so that's an indication. An indication, but on the other hand, like there should be some other maybe differential which sends the y to the n, and that should be this dual differential. But that we don't really understand yet. But hopefully, this extra structure and extra operators which will help understand what's going on. Right, do we have more questions? People can just speak up. All right, if there are no more questions, we are, I suppose, finished for the day. So let's thank you.
