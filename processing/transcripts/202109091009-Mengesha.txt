Of Tennessee, Knoxville. The title of his talk is Calderon-Sigmund type estimates for non-local PDEs with shalder-continuous kernels. You're welcome to start. Thank you, Igor, and thank you, everyone, for being here. And I would like to begin by thanking the organizers for inviting me to speak in this wonderful workshop. I haven't been to BANS. I haven't been to Banff and this was my first opportunity together, but it didn't happen. But it's okay. I still get to see many of you virtually. This work that I'll be presenting is actually joint work with Armin Shukora and Sasikarn Yipo. Armin is at the University of Pittsburgh, and Saskaran was his PhD student from Thailand. And I've been working on Calderon-Sigmund type or higher. Calderan-Sigmund type or higher sobolov regularity estimate for solutions of PDEs, who is a work I did with Fuk Nguyen, who spoke two days ago. But I have always been interested in doing the same thing for non-local problems. And so this gave me the opportunity to collaborate with Armin Shukora on this. And so the focus is really: this is a linear equation, linear local equation. Equation, nearly a local equation, and we are trying to understand interior higher sobolow regularity estimates for solutions, weak solutions of this type, LSU equal to the fractional appliances or SS fractional appliances of F, let's say, on the right-hand side. And this operator is a linear operator and it has a coefficient, as you can see, this is singular, it has a coefficient, and the prototype is actually the fractional, the fractional Laplace. The fractional Laplacian and the event k is one and omega is rn. The only difference is that this has now a coefficient k. And the coefficient, this will serve as a coefficient, as I said, is assumed to be bounded, measurable, and symmetric. And we would like it to be elliptic along only in the diagonal. This somewhat generalizes works on uniform ellipticity that's assumed. Ellipticity that that's assumed on here, but we want it to be just elliptic along the diagonal by the diagonal. I mean, just Kxx. We want this to be positive. Okay, the reason I will show you later is this is a kind of perturbation that we use. So this is the assumption I'm working on, the coefficients. And of course, the question that comes in our mind is for this side of the equation, if Side of the equation, if f is in L P, let's say in some p bigger than two or large, where does the weak solution u leave? And what I'm going to show you, this is just a simple application of what I'm going to show you, is that if k is in x and uniform in y, but in x if it's held or continuous, then for any p bigger than two and s between zero and one, f in L U P implies U is actually in HSP. In HSP. As you can see here, this is again, as I said, part is just a consequence of the result I'm going to show you. This shows only improved regular, improved integrability. The result I'm going to show you actually says there is also improved differentiability. This is just a kind of question asked and the kind of question that will be answered. Now, we need to understand how, because the solutions are defined in different ways. Are different defined in different ways. We need to understand how this operator is understood. We understand this operator in terms of divergence form. By that, I mean this takes WSCP into its dual, and the action of LSU, this operator, acting on V in WSU is this way. This is a bilinear form that we are familiar with in our, let's say, variational as variational methods, okay, the tools, when you apply variational tools. And with that understanding, we can actually study much more general equations of this type. L SU equal to Laplace F1 plus F2. This is, as I will discuss later, this is something related to something which is a non-local analog of divergence of A of X graduate divergence of F plus G, okay, type equation. But here, as you can see, Okay, but here, as you can see, here is a tau. This differentiability over here on the data is different from the differentiability over here. This is this tau is smaller than this. In any case, the way we understand as a solution is a solution in WS2 is a weak solution of this equation if when I test it with smooth. By the way, this is important: the fact that we want the solution to be satisfied in a subdomain omega one of omega here, because after all, our results. Omega here because after all, our result is a local result, and so the test function should come from should be supported in inside of omega one in C infinity. And then when you apply the usual weak derivation appears, and the derivative on F1 will be dumped on the test function, the same way that we do weak solutions for differential equations. And as you can see, the existence of solutions, you can work it out actually that, for example, if omega is Rn and example if omega is rn and you require u to vanish outside of omega one as a sort of drichlet problem you can find the existence of a solution for this kind of problem okay you know this one will serve as a sort of a low order perturbation in the in your in your when you try to estimate let's say trying to do corrosivity okay um and as i said earlier this is inform a non-local analog of this kind of as i said this is not really true because i'm going True, because I'm going to give you also another type of equation of this type, which is fundamentally different from the one that I'm discussing over here. Okay. Because these fractional gradients and fractional divergence can be defined in many crazy ways. So let's recap what has been done for the equation, for the local, the PDs, the linear PD of this type in terms of. Linear PD of this type in terms of higher sobo regularity result. Well, just for simplicity, I'm going to drop G and then assume just earlier, as Dominique discussed, that the integrability, so somehow the integral, if this G is zero, the integrability of F must match the integral, the integrability of what's inside the divergence, right? If you somehow, let's say, invert the divergence operator, though it's not invertible, if you invert the divergence operator, A of x. If you invert the divergence operator, A of X must be of the same integrability as F. And that's what you'd like to see in the theory that comes out. Well, in general, it's not true, as most of you know, all of you know, but it's true for smooth coefficients. In fact, even for rough coefficients, having a small mean oscillation, a small immunization changing not rapidly. Okay. And in fact, we'll see also talks. Talk after this talk by Larsi. Now, this is for W1P. This is what's called the W1P theory. And there's also a W2P theory, which says that, well, for W2P theory, you compare, let's say I'm going to take F0, you compare G with the second derivatives somehow. And then in that case, you have to differentiate. For that, let's just be generous and then say the gradient of U has also mean oscillation. Okay, these are some. These are somewhat classical works now. For example, the W. Pitori, among other people, recently was popularized by Caperly and Peril in their real analytic perturbation method, and also by Yun and Wang after that for other more general domains and so on. The W2P theory was done by, at least again, among many people, I know of the work by Charenza, Francine Long. Charenza, Frasca, and Longo, where they used sort of representation of solutions and they used calderism operators and estimates for those kinds of operators. So that has been done. The result I'm going to show you, so as I just let me say that coefficients having small minus zero, allow us to use perturbation meters and then to compare the solution U, our here in this case, with that of a regular solution corresponding to, let's say, constant coefficients or. Let's say constant coefficients or smooth coefficients, okay. So you can transfer the smoothness that you get from constant coefficient solutions or smooth coefficients equations to that of your PDE. So the results I'm going to show is somewhat a mix because there will be some sort of improved differentiability and also improved integrability in the holder in the sober box space. Okay. And this is a result that I wanted to show. This is a result that. That I wanted to show. This is a result that the analog of the W1P/slash W2P theories, where if you take any T between S and the minimum of 2s and 1, we would like this guy, 2s minus T to be less than 1 for our work. And omega 1 is inside omega. Then given F1 and F2, the data in L2. F1 and F2, the data in L2. Let's say that you have an energy solution, in this case, the WS2 weak solution. Then, if the data F1 and F2 are improved to be in LEQ for Q bigger than 2, then any WS2 extension of U tilde will be also highly integrable. Now, as you can see here, this is the T fractional Laplacian of U, the T or fractional Laplacian of U tilde, right? Fractional Laplacian of U tilde, right? So if you imagine that this was what this was the s fractional Laplacian of U. So you can write that one as the 2s minus T Laplacian of 2, the 2s minus T of the T Laplacian of U. So you can see that F1 and the T Laplacian must have the same sort of integrability. And this is exactly what's replaced here. What's replaced here, okay, and this is exactly what I would talk about that I say about the improved holder regularity result for this kind of problem. But this happens for our work at least, provided that K is holder continuous, as I said, of any exponent, alpha, as long as it's holder continuous. Moreover, this local result comes with an inequality that uses again the data. Remember, this omega one, this is. This omega omega one. This is well, this is supposed to be omega one. Yes, this is log of omega one. So this should be omega prime and it can be bounded by the other beta, say omega or omega one, okay, which is a bigger space. Okay, now I want to do some, I want to say that the side of the order exponent k is not important for our regulatory results, partly because, as you can see, I restricted the t all the way to the minimum of 2s. All the way to the minimum of 2s and 1. If I want to go beyond that, close to 2s, so it looks like we may need, you know, the influence of the holder exponent of K will enter into the picture. But in our case, it does not. And kind of expected that to happen, especially known what are called self-improvement properties of non-local equations, okay, as I will discuss shortly. But in any case, in the event 2s, there's a one, let's say you. Event two s is less than one, let's say you can think of this as an optimal local regularity result. Okay, um, just to highlight the distinction from other works that the ellipticity we require only is along the diagonal here. And this allows, let's say, sign-changing coefficients like this. You know, you can write this and it has large values, negative. It could be negative because sine in the xm, but if you plug in x equal twice, this part is gone. Plug in x equal to y, this part is gone. What you get is this expression which is symmetric and bounded, and along the diagonal, it's actually bigger than one. You can show, okay? So, our result is applicable for this type of kernels, for instance. I want to compare it with other known results for Sovolo regularity estimate for the non-local equations. So, in a work in 2007, Decari, Warmer, and Soazua obtained an optimal Obtained an optimal differential integral irregularity result for Dricle problems. They were actually solving Laplace U, S Laplace U equal to F with U only in a boundary set and U vanishing outside of the region. And they proved this optimal regularity for the fractional Laplacian. That is a true fractional location, no coefficient involved. And that's why. And the idea of the proof is just extend it to the whole of Rn and apply optimal regularity that have. and apply optimal regularity that have that's that's available for problems that are posed on the whole domain and and of course you have one has to do careful analysis of the elliptic equation what that appears because of the cutoff function that are involved in there is a lot of technical details but they were able to prove that again this is for just the fractional depression for this guy okay no coefficient the No coefficient. The result that's actually closest to our work is actually the work of Matthio Kozi, and he obtained almost optimal differentiability results, where he showed that weak solutions can go all the way. In that case, this is comparable to the W2P theory. This is, he did it only for p equal to 2, all the way, they can go all the way to 2s minus epsilon. Go all the way to 2s minus epsilon, a little bit of that. But he assumed that it's actually uniformly elliptical and bounded, and k has to be Cs holder, okay? And this S has to match with the S of the equation, right? The S of the fractional operator. And his method is slightly different from ours, and he used kind of the usual translation method or the difference quotient method properly adjusted for non-local equations. There is also an work of There is also the work of Honj Donnelly and Kim on strong solutions of equations of this type for translation invariant kernels where they obtained actually the full optimal regularities that will the data in LDP the solution has to be also in this Bessel space H2SP okay and that is using mean oscillation arguments that work for well for For well, for this kind of problems. Recently, Simon Novak, University of Bliefeld, proved a number of interesting problems. It's incredible the kind of work he's producing. The first one that I knew of until two weeks ago was this, which is comparable to the W1P2. Which is comparable to the W1P theory, where he proved for translation invariant kernels, where he proved, let's say, F1 in LP and F2 in some improved, this should be a little bit here, improved space, then U has to be in HSP locally. And the trouble that I also failed in the past not to apply, for example, the coverary parallel type metal was I didn't know what kind of, you see, for the coverly parallel. Kind of see for the caferi-perelium method, you need a gradient. And to show that the gradient is an improved, I mean, higher integrable, you need to do proper label set estimates of its maximal function and so on. And covering argument and so on. But the problem for Neil Calcution is what is the substitute for the gradient? Okay. Well, he came up with this S gradient and he used this S gradient to apply. To apply, to implement the coveralli parallel real analytic method. And he showed that the S gradient, this guy, is actually in LDP lock, in p large. And there is a characterization of Bessel spaces using this gradient, which dates back to the 50s, 70s, I don't know, 56, 70s of Stein and Tibbelson, Tibbleson, and so on. And you can show that once this S gradient is in LEP, then your U is actually in it. Then your U is actually in a SS local. There is a restriction on P, it has to be above some local, some solo of conjugates. Now, just two weeks ago, this hero, he posted a paper on archive, which talks about improved servolar regularity for linear equation with VMO coefficients. Remember, in my the result, I said, I said the holder regularity really. Said the holder regularity, really as long as the k the coefficient is holder regular, this the index is not real matter. So, we kind of suspected that maybe this is in proper in a proper way, if one does it properly, then maybe extend it to VMO. And then we mentioned something that we believe that is true for VMO. And he answered that question actually. Now, so you so earlier he used the S gradient, this time he used another gradient type, this time he. type this time he used these these objects this this object the dual pair that was mentioned that was first that first appeared in the work of men Johnny Kussi and Sear Yanni Sear where they showed self-improvement properties and he manipulated and he did the whole level set estimate for this in in in the new in LEP space where it is it can be used to obtain a higher integrability result for you. Higher integrability result for you. And it's a long paper, and I still haven't figured out, and I haven't carefully reviewed. But he indeed implemented the Caparelli-Parallelatic method using a sort of different gradient type object. And he used again the techniques of the Minjoni, Kusi, and Sear in finding a proper estimate for the level set estimates for this. For the level set estimates for this capital U. And he managed to do that. And you can go ahead and look at the paper and archive. I think August 26 or something was the latest version. Okay. As I said, you know, that dual pair, those objects appeared in first the work of Kusim and Jones here in demonstrating self-improvement properties of non-local equations. And for them, they wanted to prove a Mares-type estimate for non-local equations. For non-local equations, meaning that if k is just, if the coefficient k is just bounded measurable and uniformly elliptic, what has an improved quantity does any gradient has? And they shows, in fact, not only higher integrability, even there is an improved differentiability in the solution, even just for measurable coefficients, and that's a small, our result. Small. Our results say that if you put smoother coefficients, then you have actually improvement both differentiability and integrability all the way to the full range. And that has been also now extended to the VMO case by Simon Novak. And so how do we prove this? Well, ours is actually brute force. So we just use a bootstrap argument, iterating between extension via cutoff argument and comparison with a non-local equation that I'll show you with regular solutions, whose regularity theory we can get optimal. And the extension, how does the extension, the V A catal function work? What we do is the following. If you solve this LSU equal to F in omega one, we somehow Omega 1, we somehow extend it to Rn. And that way the right-hand side will also be affected. And so this extended one will solve also LSU tilde equal to G, the same form of equation, except now the norms of U tilde and norms of G can be controlled by the norms of the data F, the original F, the norms of U. So now we'll be working all just on Rn and then we'll transform that regularity that we get for. Transform that regularity that we get for u tilde to u. Okay, and um, once extended, we view this operator. Remember, this operator has k, the coefficient, right? So we will use this one as a perturbation of another operator. What is this operator? This operator again acts on test functions in this way. Here is where I, the first time, the diagonal entries of the coefficient kk into the picture. So, what you do is. The picture. So, what you do is the way the action of lstu on test functions is at the integral k, and then you have the t fractional appression of u times whatever will be on psi on the test function. Whatever is left is on side. Okay, so how does the comparison work? In fact, what we're going to show is that there will be a constant where if you Constant where if so LSU will be a constant times this diagonal operator that we defined, which is which we're going to show that it has actually optimal regularity solution, optimally regular solutions, plus Tu. And the hard part is showing that actually Tu is a low order fractional differential operator. Okay, once it's a low order, you can put it in the dual of in the dual dual dual dual dual the dual of in the dual of in the dual space and then and and then you you'll get you'll get the estimate that you want and then and how does one what makes this tu a lower order because that that is the result of it's reduced by essentially by the holder index of k okay this is you know we are going to take differences and then of course the most important part of the work is actually Most important part of the work is actually in obtaining optimal regularity results for this diagonal operator equation that I'm going to be showing. That's the first thing that I'm going to discuss. And so by a solution to this equation, we mean again, we test it by the smooth test function. And this is the way that I defined earlier. Now, this equation is actually a distributional formulation of this equation. And that's why I said earlier. And that's why I said earlier that equation is misleading in terms of a non-local analog. This can also serve as a non-local analog of the d a of x gradient u equal to df plus g type equation. Okay, but unlike the divergence, this guy is invertible. Okay, this guy is invertible. And in fact, the reason that we should expect sort of improved or optimized regularity is because the fractional, this operator is invertible. Fractional this operator is invertible, and how can I, and it's inverse, is obviously the risk potential. How can I write the solution? The solution, the inside guy here, the t fractional Laplacian of U can be written as one over k times the risk potential. Now we can use Sovolo embedding to estimate, to get the optimal estimate on here. And if you start with Q, the T fractional derivative, rather the fractional of U will be. The fractional of u will be in LDP, which is the q conjugate with respect to this sobolov exponent here. Okay, that's this is where we get we get the optimal regularity. Okay, and more precisely, you can actually write an optimal regularity result for this equation, and which says that if you start with for any t between 0 and 2s and s between 0 and 1, and if you have a tq solution, which is a distributional solution of this equation. Distributional solution of this equation, then if you improve, then for any other p, of course, the interesting cases when p is bigger than q over here, for any other p, f1 and f2 in lp implies that the t Laplacian of U will also be in LEP. Okay, this is the, and we're going to use this again and again to you know to carry the regularity improvement that we get from here to the original solution, okay? And how do how does And how does one prove this rigorously? Well, first you prove a priori estimates, which says that if P, as I said, the interesting case when P is bigger than Q, if P is bigger than Q, then what you show is that if F1 and N4 are in highly integrable space coming from this, then the solution will also be in LDP, but it will be controlled by the T fraction. The t fractional norm of the n r where r comes from a lower sovereign conjugate of p. Okay, once you have this, once you have this, you just iterate. You start from q from the lower end, you obtain yours between the q and q star, and then you do all the way you reach to p. Or in this case, you start from p and then you go down to all the way to you reach q, and then eventually you will get the l eq norm of. You will get the LEQ norm of. So, whenever you do that, of course, you have to shrink the domain. That's why you have also a sequence of a sequence of domains that are embedded, one embedded into the other. This one says that the LLP norm, the T the LP normal of the T fractional function of U on omega one can be estimated by the other norms on omega two, which is in a bigger space. Okay, here truncations and so on into enter into the picture. So, I don't want to bore with you, but the But this is of star is very important inequality. And how do you prove that? We actually use duality and the fact that we have an equation we are solving over there. And well, the LEP norm is the soup of this integration when you integrate against this, against the test function, which is in LEP prime using ellipticity. So now we have to relate this somehow to the equation. To the equation, that's the regular equation that we're trying to solve. And here, here is ellipticity enters into the picture. So, write it like this. But then you have to write this in a proper as a proper test function. Okay. And this is also another time that you have a lot of cutoff functions. So you start with psi, which is a infinity cutoff function, and then rather a simple test function, introduce a cutoff function which. Introduce a catal function which is one and then vanish outwards, increase its differentiability, although it's infinity, increase its differentiability, apply the catalog function, which is now a little big in a bigger, the support is in a little bigger place than omega one. And then this is phi one. If I apply the Laplacian, especially on the places where omega is one, if I apply the fractional Laplacian over here, because this is one, this is sort of the inverse of the Laplacian, you'll get The inverse of the plush, you'll get psi. So, really, phi and psi one have the same. In any case, you're able to. The point is that we are able to write psi as the fractional Laplacian of phi one plus phi two, and phi two is the leftover guy. The leftover guy is zero in a places in omega one because eta is actually zero. Well, I should be careful because this is a non-local operator, but it is again it's. But it is again, the LEP norm of this is comparable with the LEP norm of psi. In any case, if you plug in this form of psi into this form, into this integral, what you get is something which looks like testing the equation. This one is like testing the equation. And from the equation, you will get that this is the data F1 times the S, the 2s minus the Laplacian of phi 1. Laplacian of phi one and then plus this leftover object and now the trick is in estimating this leftover object over here you get the data phi phi one and phi two now one thing that i forgot is over here is that when you write psi in terms of phi one and phi two in this four you can actually control the lp prime norms of phi one and phi two in terms of the lp prime norm of the original test function psi prime okay and you can do the Do you know a sequence of estimates, and this is the technical part, and then you can show that for any R that comes between P lower star and P, you can, this can be bounded by this. And here, here you are, here you get the norm of psi prime, which appears in the duality, in the duality norm. And that allows you to obtain this star, which gives you the. the which gives you the the optimal regularity for the but the the the smoother or the regular equation okay okay once you have that rewrite so let's say remember we are we have extended the equation and we are working on the extended this one has k in it okay the coefficient k so let's say that u is solving this equation and now as i said you can write You can write so by taking the difference, you can introduce this for some constant gamma. You can write that this is actually ls diagonal u equal to ls u plus the order term that I said by that decomposition. And this one will solve as the load. The key is now, how do you show that this is actually with proper regularity, with proper estimates, how do you show that is actually a lower? And this is somewhat related to And this is somewhat related to commutator estimates. And it turns out that for sufficiently epsilon, you can show that this Qu this leftover operator over here can be expressed in terms of the risk potential over here acting on these expressions. And this allows us. This allows us to estimate to make this TU in the dual space of appropriate solar loops in the appropriate solo space. So as a consequence of that commutator estimate, which I don't bother to even discuss, you can show that actually Tu is in the dual space of the Soviet, the homogeneous Soviet space. And you can do the calculations using Sovolo embedding inequalities. Once you have that, this is in the dual space, then Tu can be written, can be represented. then tu can be written can be represented by an in by a g which comes from the dual of the whole the holder conjugate of this which is this guy okay that's an improved integrability result so so so the original solution u to your equation now is written as because now i'm i replace instead of tu phi i replace g times phi this because tu is exactly given by this Is exactly given by this expression, okay? By this representation, now I can write lsu diagonal here, or supposed to be t over here to represent the t here, is actually the 2s minus the Laplacian of this data. Now, this g becomes data, which is a function of u, remember, and that uses the t the LUT norm, and plus some perturbation that also you can estimate. Now you can apply the optimal regularity that we obtained for the diagonal operator. Obtained for the diagonal operator. Okay. And once you have this, that theorem, the star that proved that I proved says that for R1 in two plus a little bit between two and two star, actually two, in this case, two alpha for this, you have your T fractional Laplacian in this improved integrable space. And once you have this, you redo, you do the program one more time. You extend the equation. One more time, you extend the equation, you redo everything. Now you have already you in an improved sovelo space. You redo the entire program for R1. Instead of two, Q equal to two, you do it for R1. And then you will get also an RO2, which is between R1 and R1 star, which is again a bigger exponent. And then your T fractional applaution will be in R2. Will be inner, and then you iterate this all the way until you reach you any q that's bigger than two. Okay, that's how the um corollaries of this if you if you have lsg equal to f and f is in LEQ because you can make this f in any in all the space for any t and then turns out that this is actually uh the t fractional Laplacian will be this is the minus supposed to be minus is in LEQ for any t. Is in LEQ for any t in here. And of course, when t minus n over q is bigger than zero, we have holder because of the embedding in holder spaces. In general, if the right-hand side is in the dual of this space, then the t fractional Laplacian of U will be in LEQ for any t as long as this t is less than the minimum of one and two s. As I said, we cannot go because of the commutator estimates, needs the fact that 2s. needs the fact that 2s minus t is less than 1. As I said here, any trunk, you can write it in the dual space here. Okay, so just as a summary, I wanted to say that we have shown, so my alarm is alarming over here, so we have shown that for solutions of this type, we can have both integral and higher integrability and higher differentiability improvements. Improvements under somewhat weaker assumptions on the coefficient k being, let's say, elliptic only on the diagonal and holder arbitrary holder continuous and so on. And until the improvement of Simon Novak, I think there have been an improvement. The requirement t is less than one is important for our work, but we expect that this is true for any t less than 2s. And in that case, the holder regularity of the coefficients will interpret the same way the differentiability of the Differentiability of the coefficients entered into the picture when you try to obtain W2P estimates, right? And one unfortunate thing is because really ours is really brute force in some sense, because we are taking two operators, taking the difference, and we are estimating the kernel, our approach is not effective in the translation invariant. The translation invariant was supposed to be holder continuous of our so we're supposed to obtain all the way to 2s, right? But it's not effective in handling that case. Effective in handling that case. So that needs adjustment. With that, I thank you for your attention. Okay. Thank you very much, Tadele, for your beautiful talk. Are there any questions? I have one question for Tadele. Tadele, nice talk, a nice result. Thank you, opposite. Okay, one remark. One remark because I remember that you mentioned this technique that we introduced of the one of the dual pairs actually for proving higher integrability and different in the fractional case. So what we did there, and actually what Novak also used, was to, from a technical point of view, to Technical point of view to introduce these dual pairs in order to read to do in the same spirit of a bit of what you're doing, which is very remarkable, by the way, that you consider only along the diagonal. So what we did, we essentially wrote a Gehring's lemma along the diagonal, just looking at the diagonal. And we actually did two types of different types of Calderon-Sigmund decomposition, one along the diagonal and one farther to the diagonal. And then later on, another Diagonal. And then later on, another proof was found by commutators by Armin Shikov. That's a proof I like very much. Then there was another proof of our result by Pascalo-Sher, but it's purely linear. And I don't think that they really caught the point of the non-linearity. So if I understood correctly, this is how you overcome the fact of having ellipticity only around the diagonal. So you plug, you build another fractional operator, which is lower order, right? Outside. And then you put, and then you put. And then you put, and then you put on the right-hand side, and then you just stay along the diagonal. So you synthesize what we did by sweating on Heavy-Calder and Sigmund argument. So do you do this using commutators? Correct. Because you are so you do. So in a certain sense, what you do, you extend this approach by arming your commutators by separating the diagonal part, which is really the big. The diagonal part, which is really the beef, right? Because in all these problems, there's an interaction between the non-local part and the diagonal part. So, what you do, you are able to use commutators to synthesize this point of view that outside the diagonal, you can really put everything in a new low-order term, which has no sign. And that's what you so this is this way. And how is this non-linear too? So, so thank you for the remarks. So, thank you for the remark, Rosario. That's actually, I actually did not even put, I remember you did two calories in the composition along the diagonal and of the diagonal. Of the diagonals were sort of L2, whereas the diagonals were the ones that were, I did not actually make the connection with our work. But that's exactly what's happening. And this is... Because what we did is that we, in fact, separated the two, in some sense. In some sense, we separated the two operators not excitedly, but inside the proof. And then we have a Calderon sigma decomposition around the diagonal, where you really have only the diagonal behavior to be relevant. And therefore, in other words, it's purely localized. And then another Calderon type decomposition, and this was, of course, very, very sweating. And then it's, and so what you did, it reminded me that. reminded me that uh but then you can you can overcome this heavy counter and sigma decomposition with the with the with um uh with commutators aren't you correct correct so this is an argument okay and now the real question is how is this i mean can you do this in a non-linear setting because i mean shikara's proof was also non-linear correct so initially so so so the expectation is that it will work okay Is that it will work, okay? But even for the linear test, if you look at, you know, Armin is an expert on this, you know, putting two different things and just beat it two days to estimate, you know, that's exactly the computer estimate. He's a very refined, he's a very refined mathematician. Incredible, incredible. Okay, I learned it so much working with him. So that's exactly what happened. So he, he just, we just estimated today so that the difference of the two operators of the diagonal is actually a low. Of the diagonal is actually a low-order operator which we can handle by because this is what we exactly do with the double type of Calderon sigma. We realize that outside the diagonal, you have a completely lower term, but we do not make it make it explicit, of course. So the expectation of the computation. Yes, the expectation is that it would work, but it's a long computation. We didn't even try to attempt to do that. Okay. Especially in the nulling case. It's a really important point because there was this paper by some harmonic analysts that they claimed to have a shorter proof than ours, but it was purely linear proof. It was a perturbation proof. And the spirit of our papers is non-linear. Correct. Yeah. So we did what Simon Nowak was doing. Taking these dual pairs. So essentially what we did, we took these dual pairs and we split the energy in the code into parts. We split the energy in the quote in two parts by two different Calderon sigma, and this reminds me very much what you're doing in a more scientific way using these computators. It must be the same circle. I don't think ours is elegant, but it did the job, at least for the older regular coefficients. Yeah. I can tell you, this was our paper was a nightmare, right? Well, I told you last time, there is one person that I know who did your paper convincingly understood is my student. Convincingly understood is my student, who, by the way, we have done also, we have used your to prove sort of higher integrabilities for the double phase, the double phase non-local equation. Okay. And the next one that I know is you are one of the very few who read the proof and put it into action in other different settings. Thank you. I appreciate that. That's also credit to my student, James Scouts, who is at Columbia right now. Uh, Lars, Lars had caused his hand raised. I'm sure we're out of time. Thank you. Um, so I have just a simple question. I mean, you take this Laplace to the power of S and then you split it into two parts, but what is the reason not to split them symmetric? Is it, I mean, you have you split this delta to the S to delta to the S minus T half and delta to the T half. So why is it non-asymmetry? So, why is there non-asymmetry? Yeah, because we want the whole range. So, we see T moves between S and all the way to the minimum of S plus one. So, remember, the right-hand side to get some improvement in the differential, the right-hand side should be a derivative, some sort of derivative of some. So, the one that should be the highest. So, when T moves change from S to, so if you split it to be like S, that is the. Like S. That is the corresponding to the W1P theory. Okay, I see. If you want more improved differentiability, other values, you have to move the T, the T value. Then that's exactly what it does. The 2s minus T is precisely that. When T is S, that you'll get to S minus S is S. When you go all the way to S, that is the full sort of close to the W2P theory. Thanks a lot. Thanks for the wonderful talk. Thanks, thanks a lot. Thanks for the wonderful talk. Thank you. I appreciate that. Let us thank the speaker again if there are no further questions. So, thank you very much. And we have a break of about 25 minutes, so we resume at 11:20. Thank you. Thank you, Angela.
