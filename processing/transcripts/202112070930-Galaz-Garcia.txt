The si seven last slide perfect is much for limitation for hierarchy, this very content of virtually a space of representation. Presentation, is that context because the mathematical problems. And well, together here at the end, because Perfect. So, to empathize that is a representation. A representation is simple a homomorphism of groups between a group and a G that will be a group of matrices. So, this group is also pensive, like a subgroup of a G L and in particular, we will interest. We will interest representations or these groups where the group that we are mandating the matrix is the fundamental group of superficial groups that we can think about as connected, compact, oriented. All that. And Baber, to the end, two pedals that are supermassive representation. They are supervising representations that we can interest the first time that we have representation. So, what if the kernel of the representation is the identity? And what significance we have for us is that the representation is superficial, the mandate toddling. The mandate allows the group simply to 1 information. So, really, we are transferring all the groups to see what is that we have representation. So, this group is in a group and a topology, so we can see the image of the representation of significant things that are. Discrete significance that this image is a conjugate discrete dentures. So it is not a type of accumulations in the image of the representation. And how the principle subsides from all this will be between the representation as an algebraic object, of groups, and And the geometric grandeur of the superficial summit is. So, how we can cosas about the geometry of representation, and how we can judge with the geometric superficial geometry to obtain architectural copies of representations. So, to illustrate, I think with an example that you can result in a little more familiar result. So, here we have a superficial Aquínemos una superficial, genero uno que pues quizas enos tuosos de topología, thereamos visto que lo podemos obtainer and identifying this rolado of this. So, if I say this here, it is simple topological queue can be formed in a geometrical rigidity, what if you have a fundamental group that is. Here is presented as two generors, we are more. And well, the introduction is all topological representation, of their fundamental groups in the redos. And how to do that generated alpha, the translation for a unidad, so. And this other genada, the mando una translation for a unidad, so legendary. So, this representation and puppy can relax with the torrent when images, the image of representation that are met the plan or cridia. So, you are going to recurrently. We have recurrent and representation, actuando, or an adequate space. In this case, we are known that this linear vertical line identifies with this linear vertical line, and vertical sites, and this line horizontal, with this horizontal line, and horizontal situation. So, the action of the image of the representation has one. And what you do the redo on the action of the representation is that this cube where identifies the documents, but this is distinct from the topological with the chemistry, because this cuad established a part of a causal plan. So this mid one and this. Mid one, and this is also mid. The media that is going to also be. So, the representation is more of a fundamental group of Torrance, like the isometries, we are allowing a geometric structure from the torture. No, this is this caused implementing all topological implementations, it is a torro with a structure. Structural clinia. And we spent that cup of a por una relida from these cocimos, we explain a representation distinct, for example that mandate this one generated a translation by two in the G. So the option can be rectangular from the distinct and identifications, the toddler that we have a structure geometric structure. Structural geometric distinct of which we anteriorly. So, this is a little example based on how the representation does not geometric information. And what we want to do is understand this to superficial general queue. So, So, we are talking about these superficials, and what have we. The first context that is how a representation of the fundamental group of superficial groups, now in this group that document, we will add a structure and structure in this superficial structure. So, this is how the representation. How the representation means and a correspondence. Luego, we want to do not only one representations, but as we put the all juntas to study in the space where these juntas is in the space representations of fundamental groups to docer. And we are generalizing a little Generalizar, a little bit, simply generalizing in geographical para study representations of the group of superficial groups to energy with major queue, so that we have representations of rangual representation. And to this generalization, everything representations to this great queen is over. So, these things plan. And we started the principle, so the representation of a current genetic view structure that we have hyperbolic. And to understand this, I can repeat what these planets are. Of what the perbolic plan is primarily the model of the semi-plano superior plan. So, this planet per bolt is all the complex numbers with machinery more. You basically plan the tools with positive. So, everything else of the gender. And it's not. And so this is not space, you can define this formula, it is simple so that we clear that in this space, that we are seeing as a redos. The metric is not, it is a new metric that we are defining that. So, this metric, the geodesic. This metric, the gio descriptions, seven of this manera, there two types, one of them can be a rectangle that is orthogonal to the gender. And other types of types is these circulos that semi-circulates that also are orthogonal to the sequence. So, if I extend this geodesic asia, it is infinitely. It is infinitely large, not when this of the horizon. And to visualize a little like here this is very planned and pervolved, we can say, here these triangles and perbolicos, and well, important to see in this one that we are going to. So, this triangle that we have here is all of the same detail of the perbolic plan, what passes that we are persuading, as the management when we horizontally have two objects in the same place, and what is more horizontal. So, this is a little passing with. This is a little what this passing with these triangulos of here. Ok, so this is the perbolico, and we intend to also visit our group. The group of metrics of the parabolic plan is the PGE two power as all the matrices of two. Matrices of two poros with determinante estimo decero modulo sun notes disclose, but okay. And in particular, we are interested in the matrices, but in their group of metrics that can be the orientation of the planning period, one orientation that An orientation that arbitrary orientation. And this subgroup can be two series that are matrices of determinants for two percent corresponding, which is more identified. Ok, so this group can do a here, the pensamos como matrices have y si tengo un. And if you have a point, so the perbolic plan is here in all. So, for these transformations that we are. And here, what we are two as can see some of these isometric plano, but This isometric and perbolic planning here we have one that is a type and that what they are doing, if it is like the plan as infinitely. Just well, this geodesic. Here we have another isometric. Typical elliptic queen point of the planet per bolt and what is a type of rotation to this point. Ok, so we are planning perbolic plan to structure what is a structure in a superficial structure. In the parabolic structure, based on In the parabolic structure, you can see a cartas that will currently, with all the superficials, came a homomorphism of a nature, so that it completely is popular. So, we are with the line, if I have here two cartas, and we are going to. Y, who will say that it is a structural perbolic structure, if when intersection here in the image of this cart, and also here the image of this cartoon needs to be composition that will be this luminado, is one of these isometries of the planning per bolt plan. Of the planning per bolico. So, this is like the general idea of a geometric structure, and how we have this idea. So, what we are restricting is the type of geometry that we have superficial. Ok, so we are perbolic structure, and we are structured per bolic structure. It is structurally perbolic structure a representation of the fundamental group of superficial groups. So what you obtain is the side. If the superficial superior has a parabolic structure, so exist a sometometry of the universal superficial universe to the parabolic planet, which is the developing map. So, this is what we know, because we can identify two things. Well, the universal circuit with the parallel. And for the fundamental group of superficiency, active with cognitive, about the university. For other people, two, that we have this. So, what the representation is hyperbolic structure is a manera of tradition, the action of fundamental groups, so universal coverage to see this same action as the verbal planet. So, what we have is that. What we have, is this a point in the universal cube, verb as a point in the perbolic plan, and move with representation to be the action in the universal coverage, and that action clearly data in the pervolt plan. Okay, so So here there are important mentions. The first thing is that this representation is just representations that are gusta much. Osien yes discrete. The razón is gustamente because this representation is tradition esta action porcupent action. See the action for covetation that is a Porcoente, we know that it is an action and points of accumulation. So, if you want to do the proprietades, it creates the representation to discrete and disclose. So, we are not for here, it is and discreet. Ok, the other thing that is important to mention: this identification of the universal connection per bolico for. For a isometry, not unique. Basically, if we have this isometry, we can componate with other isometries of the perbolic plan, and we are an identification identification. With an identification new identity, there are other representation that identifies actions, but it is representation. Salvo conjugación conjugacion por PGL 2 er. So we're que la representation that we have the structure per bolica structure is a salvo conjugación. Oko un poco esto delonomía. This representation of perobic structures. Of the perbolic structure. And with the other direction, if I have this representation, also recover the perbolic structure structure original structure just at the same time that we are in the principle with the torso formando formando del plan i pervolic plan for the image of the representation as these actions function equal Voya recover the superficia. Okay, so this is like one of the angular pieces that is this bijection between the perbolic structure, structural hyperbolic structures, in a superficial general queue, and this space well with representations of the superficial group in this. Superficiency two that are. And if we all are thinking, it's confugación. So that with representations like the Tech Müller space, it's a very studied space, and that is also much more of a segment here there. Ok, so some questions. Ok, so we have the space text, and like we have a palomita, we are first objective, that. First objective that relations of the representation and geometry in the superficial geometry. And this pass is the representation solid since a more grand space where a space representations. So we can see the space of all homomorphisms of the group. Los homomorphismos of the group of superficial groups to PC docer estate representations modulo PEG doss, and this is what we are doing the representation. Well, here we go to an asterisk because this concept is a more delicate if we have to do things. So, we are a subject of representation. Un subject of representations, not all toddlers, if we have good copies, topological copies of this spacious representations. But for this, more general. Ok. So the spacious technique that we are seeing as with representations and components connects. It is a component connection of the space of representations. And well, we are also codified in the superficial structure, and it is studied much, a thing that we have is what I can goldman in the choice, and that is that the space technology is more tomorrow. That general de la superficiency, you know, what you have. You're basically what we do that topologically is unable. Ok, so we have this with representations very good, the discretion of the space representations map. And what we have wrangled, what is the rango of the group of. The rank of the group of groups that we are mandating in this group is superficial. So, two to investigate that is what passes with the representations of the group and the superficial group in major queues. And this representation, the same thing as morphismos, but with Con los puerlas dimensions correspondence. Ok. So entropy is spacious representations of interest in a component that we analyze from the text. The space of text. And the management in which we constituent is the constitution. Maybe with a representation of the fundamental group of superficial groups, the two, or if you have a representation in the texture, and here this omega is a representation, which can construct specifically that basically Specifically, basically, the irreducible representation, well, is the projectivization of the irreducible representation between two and that all is unique in the representations. This is a representation that we are component that the space is a component. The space is a component connection when I toddle with this representation omega obtained also in connection, which will be identical to a connection of the space of representations. So, that component connects the representations where Magenote Müller is what the component is. The component is hit. So, many of you are simply the component of Hitchin contain a copy of the technical space. And this is the component that studies as analog of the technical space. Here, I will put a strict porque depending on the group with the representations. So, in here, we are taking like PG Left, but also by PGN, and in that case, like all duplicated dimensions. So, there is also two components of hitching, dimension par, a component of hitching in dimension. Okay. So, this analog between the component of heat chain. And that is hit in the moment that can be the original article where the interesting thing in this object can component is a muscle to. And for all, this article and also is good because many other interpretations representations are very flexible that you can interpret much more. And And analysis, in Higgs, and their articles like this also understand the component of Hiki, not only one representations. If we also understand that information is standard representation in all these components. Una representation of all these components on the superficial. And also include this information a more basic information that is the representation of the component are and discretas. So there are various advances and not 20 that the unification. Unified as the representation of the components and components, we will do geometric information, and also their like the information algebraic basic overlays. What is the labor is that a representation of the component of Hitchin do not say a geometric structure about superficial structure. What is a critical parameter that is. But also, what vadar is this representation is a dynamic structure about the superficial material. So a static structure, we are dual about a dynamic construct of superficial construct. And this structural dynamic structure defined as depending on. So, how depending on a parameter that is parabolic from PC in all these representations that complete these dynamic proposed with respect to one parameters, the representations of us. So, the representations in us. And also these representations are not much information about the parameters that have a group. The parameters that have in this parabolic group. In particular, all the representations are in the component component of the representation of matrices and all distinct values. So, they are not repetitive, which is like a very important and good. Here are these que les queen. But it is a real convex structure. So, like, Projective convex project. So, like, for a good idea that if you could have information that masalto, but results that unified is a more dynamic. And what we are working are just with these representations in us, but of a perspective distinct perspective that. That bien of the geometric groups. So, this is a definition equivalent that was for Capoch, Levi Porti in 2012. And these representations are distortionadas regular. So, the voyage of how this both. Votamin is very powerful, like these representations are important and invalidated as a lot of definitions equivalent, which can usage. So, to see what are these representations, where also more dynamic information, we also see what symmetrical space and their. Symmetrical and subtract infinite. So, we are thinking representations of the group of superficial groups in PC inflation. So, the symmetrical space will be this caused by PC in this maximal compact, but that is. So, mativises autographs with determinante uno modulo sub center. And for the other things we do of this symmetrical space to the infinite. So, this infinite function are equivalent of geodesic in spacemetrical space where the equivalence is more. So, if I have a So, I have a genetic alpha, and I just gamma. So, we say that they are equivalent if all epsilon 0 exists a time the distance between alpha y gamma minus epsilon well. Epsilon, but Epsilon for all the majority. So this is what the créclos via, so there can be separate, but there is a moment to equal via the same, exist ajan to the same extancia, or circando. O sevancando, circando, circa. And so, what do we are saying? This is like this idea, for example, a view of the three, which is horizontal, and these via trends are parallels, but a reality when the perspective is like a point at the infinite point, because it is tandoid, if you can parallel, and define a direction. Okay, so. Okay, so what we are have using to see how these representations of the group is superficial, PCR denotes this new impact that is not distortional regular uniform. So, we are using other models. Other models, the plan per bolt that is the discourse. So, I'm here with the same in the semi-plano, and in the discovery ponchared, and the discovery is a little bit more in these applications because we conceptually understand a little bit what will be their infinite. For example, here, the designs will be new. Vancouver de Nuevo, these radios that have an angular nueve, no entangled or perpendicular, or these semicircles here, that also are perpendicular to the circumference. Okay, so revisiting the plan per bolican. The razón is that the plan per bolico is more than that we have space. The plane perolico will be the spatio-symmetric space of the group PC and scientifically with this PC and modulo PSO. And utter infinitely understandable very visual managers, and more, for example, two things that are. And if they are paradoxes, but this period much to the infinite and definite point here in the infinite point of the space-symmetrical space that will be the circumference to the circle. Ok, so we have the space-symmetric space and their infinite per bolico y sus. And their example we have, and we have these to understand the representations of a new manera dynamic. So, these representations that are not distortion of regular uniforms, which are equivalent to representations, definitely manage. Of managers. So, this representation of fundamental groups of superficial groups in PC. PC action on its spatiosymmetrical space. So, the image of the representation that is also actual spatiosymmetric space. So, one more So, one more understanding the representation works of the action that is immagen about space specific. And the other invariant we have selections about the infinite. That for us is what you will regularly parameter in. No express how important, but we will think that we have definitely. And the representation has these two poppies, we affect a point in the symmetrical space, and we analyze the orbital separate orbit vajo action of the representation. Action of the representation. And we know that it is action ten two properties. The pumer is that the orbit of this point is rational spacious engine. So what significant space is that orbit, well, a map. Well, we have a societal, social, that cada, point of group, the point correspondent in the orbit, and we have a quasi-sometime. So, well, that is what significant, but basically space. The thing is that we don't find it. That we have. And the second is that we intend to see the dynamic infinite dynamics of infinite: like the orbit will be spacious, the orbit seventeen expanded to the infinite font of the symmetrical space, and in this expansion, it will be accumulated in the infinite font. So, what we want is that one when we accumulate the Ok. So this if it is a more technical, we can understand in our ambiguous space and per bolt and also in our first And also in our first employees that we have that are these representations and represents why a representation of representation is not uniformly regular. We know: we are with the representation of the group superficial group to do it, and we have their corresponding space with Symmetric correspondent with the infinite queen that the circumference of the superficial image, the superficial group, is where the space symmetrical and select. The conjugate que vamos a selection in the infinite encase a caso much, also there is much that we cojer, and a unique manner that is cojo is that in this conjunction regular, this conjugate where authorizamos que cumul orbit baser todda la contend the infinite. If all this is okay, you are like the ingredients and the. Ingredients. And what we have to do is figure a point here in the symmetrical space, and we want to see the orbital separate orbit vaccine of the representation. So, well, here of each one, we have one two three, if it is today, all these structures regular about the space per bolt, the fundamental domain. Vamos know that pass with the orbit of this point, vajo la representation, can have a copy of this point during one of these fundamental domains. Son says I calculate much. But what we are pointing if complaint is two populations. So, the first one is that the orbit is rational space. Ok, y estimate space, the points of accumulation, but also this transformation. We are resulting with groups, is that the fundamental group of this superficial group is what is in the riddle, that is what we are obtaining. And the second proprietary is the dynamic infinite dynamics. So, if we all roses, and how is this accumulating in the infinite function, or we think that reality is orbital? So this one popped away, but we can see why the regular part where it could be cumulative orbit can be allowed to infinite. All is what happened a little when we. Pass a little when we rang from PC to PCR is what this dynamical infinite data is much more intelligent. The symmetrical space of PCR also has a infinite font that is a spherical dimension much, and now there is regular queue that we have in the infinite function, and we are. So, it is more than if we have more, and it is much more interesting to see if the orbit is accumulated to be part of the infinite one. So, in reality, very quickly we rang, and we are in this space that. And then these errors usando is simplicity structure. Structural simplicity structure is like the infinite font can cumulate the orbit of the representation one. So here images of how the infinite in these queues as apartments in here, we have this exaggeration and in here, we have this. Obtenemos is perfect. So the regular part will be all the interiors of these ladies. And that will select a part of the infinite face. So this also is very powerful of the films, and also as much more as well, all these representations is a little It's a little bit context. So what I'm, and where the questions are interesting, here also virtual asterisk with a moment, because this history can be superficial, but for all objects that are orbifolds, or if hyperbolic. In reality, many orbifolds have a fundamental group like. A fundamental group like Jarconel, and they are covering by these superficials of general majority. So that is us because the group of groups have their groups of superficial groups, and when you can go for the group of groups, like three groups that craft. So, a little bit of what my doctor was. My doctor was historia. The first is certain geometry of the fold in our algebraic fundamental groups between PC and soluenter certain groups between this first group of service that has a construction of one group that are self-modular. Luego also Tamien established in this new problem that suffered. And that is how we can use the geometric geometry to have fundamental groups through representation or PC in. And these algebraic populations are in. And well, and for all this queer representations a uniform regular uniform distortion, which has more than gemetric groups and representations in our representation, like a also explored that there is the component component. So, in the space of representations, there other components. There are other components and a construct representations to the components hit this construction more. That would be all much more likely. Much more than gracias, Carlo esto, monitor your practica. There is here varieties, and also in the chat or tomorrow microphone. We have to do here. Holy film is for the plateau. Or understand what the representations conduct. Representations when two embraced a metric parabolic metric. Or unica, dad for representation. But no meto clears that ganas alerts these groups of great groups that information geometric information possible in two. Sorry, the superficial. Sol superficial. How welcome as structural geometric structures, what all have a sense that is like the representation in the superficial superpower, when we have two three, here all can be an interpretation. An interpretation equality that we have planned pervolved, but these structures convex structures, real projectives. That is a part. But for the part, it is just that when Rangoon comes the vision of the hurry, is that when subscribed to Rango? When subsided, yes, they have a consciousness of the merchant, like what you have a consciousness of the image of the representation. But this is more recovering the superficial structural geometric above because it was much dimension, all as these dimensions. So, how these dimensions and empathy suggest and how information that is not animated if dynamic. So, the original definition is more part of this representation and a subgroup that cleanup can. And the representation valued as defined the action or dynamic action. So, no, that is a little stagnant. And the perspective. And the perspective with other work is more idea of what is grand when just action of the group of superficial groups on symmetrical space. And that action and that there is like a dynamic because it is like the orbit in all the space. That is like the information that is ganato. Muy interest, gracias, por la charla. My question is relaciation in the ultimate que position in the point two where the representations with the fold that risk. And the question. And the question is if there are riticulas in that case, if you can put the gemetria department, we can see that the representation of reticula images in riticula. Y well, what is that with them groups, no? Andal, yentonces, es una todo lo que es. That is a toddler what good groups, like the people, like that difficult construct of superficial groups that are like Spanish. Flacco, okay. So this result in particular is to construct this quid in that, but the year passed, also. Tambien se logo, as respondent, also technicians that are bending as the representation to construct these flags in that setting that is the more sensible reticence, but with impartial como que cuando. How when the enspare there is other difficulty, that focus all this is a difficult. So, when they para many things that are identified with PC, the same. So, we are sensible. If you are in the case of impact, many gracias come. Gracias launda.  Environmental difference. How que, losing segundo. I think historias are very distinct, like perspectives almost as very distinct as groups, and these things like dynamic dynamics, but these two definitions result equivalent. Resultant equivalents. Or Capovich Levi Porti, the proponents like another man of study the representations in our students, now as groups. So, how distinct, and that the definition, more technical definition, a lot of things that are equivalent, but also similar, but But they are definitions, multiple representations. And this is the definition that this user. The version of the version of the On our politics, in the version, this group can be the role that Juega is the space in space that are considered, that the PC. And in the version of us, well, as I said, I am excited to understand that the representation is the definition of the. Based on the definition of the idea with respect to a subgroup that is what is parabolic. So, with the group and with the subgroup, this problem: this representation is respect this subgroup. So, with the group and with the subgroup parabolic group, vases that are space of bandas, and this Vanderas, and this space of bandas, the us to construct the bandas, and sobreas there a flujo que vamiendo las things. So there is like this group with this group to construct if it bundles a bundle so that. So Flujano so. Well, many gracias are very good. Applaim.
