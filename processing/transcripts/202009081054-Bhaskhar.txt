Okay, should um I'll make the next announcement. Uh we're delighted to have uh Nivit Nivita Aska uh speaking about Speaking about the arithmetic aspects of algebraic proofs. All right, thank you very much for the introduction and also the opportunity to give a talk here. And I would like to wish Professor Andre a very happy birthday. So let me just try to figure out this Zoom sharing thing. Okay, I guess you should be able to see the slides now. And please feel free to unmute yourself and ask me any questions. Feel free to unmute yourself and ask me any questions. I sometimes don't see the chat notifications all that well. Yeah, so today I'll talk about SK1 triviality for L-Taursian algebra over piadic curves. And I'll try to kind of go through the proof. I mean, maybe not in full detail, but like kind of give an idea of the proof. And I think some of you might have heard this talk or variant of this talk before, so I apologize. All right, so let's begin. All right, so let's begin. So, who are the key players in today's story? So, we're going to have F a field, and then you're going to have D, a central division algebra of index n over f. So, for example, you've got real quaternions. These guys have index 2, right? And then you have this famous anti-commutative D diagram. So, ij is k and then jk is i, but you know, kj is minus i, and so on. Right, so we've got uh f a field and d a division algebra. And so, for every division algebra, of course, you've got the reduced norm map. And you can think about it as going to the algebraic closure. There it becomes a matrix algebra, and then there you have the determinant. But really, this becomes a map from D to F, right? And this is called the reduced norm map. And for example, the reduced norm of the Hamiltonian quaternions, so reduced norm of x plus yi plus zj plus wk is simply the sum of the squares. case simply the sum of the squares x squared plus y squared plus z squared plus w squared and the main thing to note about this reduced norm map is that it's multiplicative that's what is going to be important for us today so hence you can define sl1 d which is just the group of all reduced norm one elements let's say typo that should be d so sl1 d is just the group of reduced norm one elements and uh another interesting uh group in this context is d star d star right it's the commutator subgroup of d star Right, it's the commutator subgroup of d star now. Uh, because the reduced norm map is multiplicative, right? So, uh, clearly, every commutator or every product of commutators has reduced norm one. So, you have this very clear inclusion that d star d star is contained in SL1D. And now the obvious question to ask is: well, is the reverse inclusion true? So, can you say something about SL1D? Is it contained in D star D star? So, this is the problem, right? And this. Right, and this is actually the Tanaka-Arten problem. And we can just define this abstract group, and again, it should be D. So, SK1 of D is SL1 of D mod D star D star. Okay, so the question which was posed by Tanaka and Artin independently in 1943 is whether Sk1 of D is trivial. So, how does one begin to compute SK1D? One begins to compute Sk1D? How do you start? Well, you have some techniques from the theory of division algebras. So the first thing is that, well, factorize the index of D into prime factors, powers of prime factors. And then you can just segregate SK1D as a direct sum of sk1 of the various di's that you have. So for every, for each d, you have these bunch of di's with indices pi power ei, which are is pi power ei which are exactly the powers of the primes uh in the prime factorization and so sk1 d just splits up as a direct sum of these sk1 of these di's so what is it that to show triviality of sk1d you can just simply assume that your division algebra is a primary index uh has like index p power n for some n right you don't have to talk about a general index anymore okay so uh let's concentrate only on prime power Let's concentrate only on prime power indices for SK1D. And all right, what are some classic hits? That is, what are some known results about this? Well, the first result that is very crucial is Wang's, which was proved in 1950, which is that if you have any square-free index division algebra, right? So if you have an index algebra, if you have a division algebra whose index does not contain a square, then SK1D is trivial. And there have been And there have been results over special fields, like over local fields by Nakayama and Matsushima, and over global fields by Wang again. So, any division algebra, no matter whether its index has a square or not, these guys are also trivial. And there is Platinov and Yanchievsky who have shown that for division algebras over homological dimension less than or equal to two fields, SK1 is trivial again. Trivial again. But it's very interesting because you have a counter example by Platinov, which is a very famous counterexample. It's a biquaternion division algebra and it's constructed over fields like Qp double bracket X double bracket Y. And this was one of the first examples where SK1D was not trivial. So you've got a biquaternion division algebra with non-trivial SK1D. And of course, the thing to note here is that the field has homologous. Is that the field has homological dimension 4? The index of this algebra is, of course, it's a bipartisan, so it's 2 squared. All right, so for homological dimension less than or equal to 2, sk1 is trivial. For a homological dimension 4, we have a counterexample. And for division algebra, whose index is 2 squared. So the obvious question which you would like to ask is: well, what happens over dimension 3 fields? And I'm not going to And I'm not going to get into Susslin's invariant and so on, because that's a very deep theory there. But just a consequence of all that would be this following question of Suslin, which is take a central division algebra of index L squared, where L is a prime, right? And look at it over a homological dimension three-field. And now, can you say something about SK1D? Is it trivial, for example? So, for example, over Cd4, of course, this is not true. So, but over Cd3, can you say that SK1 is trivial? And we have evidence, in fact, for L equal to 2, this question is true. And this is a consequence of results of Frost and Mercury about the injectivity of the Sussilin invariant for bi-quaternion and for index 4 algebras in general. So, we have some evidence about the positive answer to Susslin's question when L. To Susilin's question when L is equal to 2. So we are just looking at L squared index algebras over a general C D3 field. All right, so but let's like try to look at this question, but even specialize it even more. So let's not look at a general C D three field. Let's look at something which has more geometric properties. So let's look at the following class of dimension three fields, which comes as follows. Which comes as follows. So you take a p-adic field, call it capital K, and take any smooth projective curve over K. So let's call it X. So f is the function field of X, right? So this is a C D 5 field. And now, of course, for L equal to 2, that is for index 4 algebras, we already have a positive answer thanks to Mercury and Ross' results. But can we answer Susslin's question for a prime which is bigger than for 3 squared or 5? Bigger than for three squared or five squared, whatever. So, can we answer Sussman's question over these specific dimension three fields for primes bigger than two? And this, in fact, so this is the theorem, which is under some assumptions, right? So, under this assumption, so let me read the statement. So, you have a p-adic field, and you have f is the function field in one variable, and you have a central division algebra of prime p. Algebra of prime period L, okay, where L is not equal to P. What is a period of a division algebra? It's the exponent in the Brava group, right? Every division algebra belongs to the Brava group. So it's a group element and it has some exponent. So it has some order. So that is this prime period L. So assume further that this F that we are talking about has a primitive L squared root of unity. L squared root of unity. So, under these assumptions, I can say that sk1 of d is actually trivial. So, earlier we were talking about Susan's question, which if you go back, it's talking about index L squared, but then in this theorem, I'm talking about period L, right? So, what is the connection between period and index? Well, this is thanks to Saltman's result. Saltman's result. So, index of division algebras over such fields divides the period squared. So, this is this famous result of Saltman. So, for us, if you take a prime period L, then of course it divides L squared, so it has to be L or L squared. But by Wanck's theorem, you know that any square free index is okay, right? So, really, the interesting case for this particular theorem is when the period is L and the index is L squared. So, that's the object that we're going to. That's that's the object that we're going to concentrate upon. So you've got D, which is index L squared and period L. And most importantly, L is not this P, where P is the p-iadic field characteristic. Sorry, any questions or anything I can clarify after this point? All right, so, okay, how does Platinov prove it for C D less than or equal to two fields? So it's a really beautiful. Fields. So it's a really beautiful argument. So let me try to do the algebra here. So just concentrate on the, forget the grayed out stuff on the slide. So just look at the non-gray stuff there. So you've got Z, which is an SL1D. So it's an element in D. It's got reduced norm 1. Now, of course, you can capture it inside some maximal subfield, right? And because the reduced norm is 1, you know that the norm from the maximal field to f is 1. So you've got. is one so you've got z whose norm from m to f is one okay now uh again please remember that d please remember that d over f has index l squared okay now uh here is the fun fact is that you can sk1 d injects if you do a co-prime to the degree uh base change right so to prove triviality of sk1d you can keep base changing uh to bigger and bigger fields as long as the extensions are Long as the extensions are have degree co-prime, they are co-prime to the index. Right, so doing some general Galva theory, you can just do this co-prime based change to make sure that your maximal subfield actually contains this nice cyclic subfield of degree L inside it. Okay, so all right, and so let's give this a name, the generator of the Galva group. So, Galva group of Y over F is sigma. Okay, so now what happens? Okay, so now what happens? So, because we are interested in m over f norm, so we have got this intermediate field, right? So, okay, so let's look at the intermediate stage. So, z goes the norm to y is a, and then a's further norm is one, right? And because y over f is cyclic degree L, we can apply Hilbert 90. So, we say that, well, A looks like some B inverse sigma B. Okay. And now, And now, because of Skolomnoether, right, sigma is the int of g for some g in d star, right? So I'm just replacing the sigma with this g, okay. But now here is where you utilize the fact that there is a C D Y in the picture, right? And C D Y is a central division algebra over Y and it is index L. So it is a much smaller object, and you already know the answer for C D Y over Y because it's a square free index. Square free index. So here is the beautiful algebra coming into the picture. So suppose by some miracle you know that you can find a C in the centralizer C D Y and an F in capital F such that C's reduced norm is this B F. Okay, for some suppose you could find the C and F such that C's reduced norm is B F. Then let's look at the objects of Then let's look at the objects of our interest, right? So this Z reduced norm to Y was B inverse GBG inverse. Now, because F is central, you can just rewrite it as BF inverse GBFG inverse. This F is just a dummy there. But we have got a commutator whose reduced norm is exactly this, right? This C becomes BF when you take reduced norm. So this commutator C inverse G C G inverse exactly becomes this. So Z's reduced norm is something. So, Z's reduced norm is something, a commutator's reduced norm is the same thing. So, you can just modify Z by this commutator to get a reduced norm one element in C D Y. So, we wanted to show that Z was a product of commutators. You have modified Z by a commutator and said, well, it is an S L one of a smaller algebra. By a Wang's result, you know that it is already a product of commutators. So, D Z itself will be a product of commutators. Product of commutators. So the entire proof is modulo this assumption that I can find these miracle elements C and F such that C becomes BF. And what is the miracle result that helps us? It's exactly Mercury of Susan's result, because if it's C D less than or equal to 2, you know that everything is a norm, a reduced norm. So in fact, you can just take F equal to 1, it doesn't matter. So C is reduced, there is a C whose reduced norm is B. Is a C whose reduced norm is B, in fact, so and so this whole proof works, okay. And uh, all right, so this is not a very well-defined notion, or maybe it is, I don't know. Let's just call, just for the sake of this talk, this Y to be nice for this element Z, right? So, forget about the C D 2 condition. So, just take any arbitrary field, and what is this Y, right? This Y was this. What is this y, right? This y was this intermediate uh cyclic uh L degree extension that you had gotten. I mean, you can always do this by this co-prime base chain, so that the fact that y exists is not a problem. But let's say this y is really nice for z if you can find these miracle elements c and f such which basically makes this thing work. So, essentially, Platinoff's proof for C D 2 fields is proving that given any S L 1 D element. Proving that given any SL1D element, you can find this nice y, right? And hence you're done. Now, further results of Platinov can be adapted to show the same result for this. So we are supposing you look at f, which is a complete discrete valued field. Okay, so you take a periodic field, you take a function field of a periodic curve, and then you take a look at. Field of a periodic curve, and then you take a discrete valuation, okay, and you complete it. So, you look at this more specialized f which is now complete. Now, the same kind of argument can work for these f's. Modulo an additional step. You cannot find this nice y for every z, but what you can do is you can take your z and modify it first by some commutators so that it becomes z nu. And for that z nu, you can show that there is a nice y. That there is a nice y, okay. So, if for these f's uh for these complete discrete-valued fields, uh, this the same proof can work modular this additional step. So, this was the starting point. Like, so basically, we wanted to use this kind of strategy to show it for our periodic curves function fields, right? But unfortunately, the problem is that this additional step that Platinov uses, the actual details don't work. The actual details don't work through, go through, right? So the same exact same kind of procedure doesn't, the modification that Platinov does for the complete discrete valued case doesn't really go through. So, but the abstract step still, I mean, it's a nice strategy. So that's what we are going to use for our function field case. Okay, so just to reiterate, what are we trying to do? So you've got this function field of a periodic curve. You've got this SL1D thing element. SL1D thing element, and you have put it inside the centralizer of a cyclic degree L extension, right? And we have seen that well, Y need not be nice for Z. So you want to modify Z by commutators so that you can find this nice Y. So that is where we are at this point. Right. So and so if you can dream and not make dreams your master, this is the line from Rudyard Kipling's. The line from Rudyard Kipling's famous if that is for us, this means if you can show that there exists this kind of nice diagram, right? So, what is it that I want to show that there exists? So, supposing you can find this another cyclic subfield E over F, which commutes with this Y, right? So, basically, Y is not nice, but can I find some E which is nicer and which commutes with Y? And it's not. Right, and it simply shouldn't commute. I also want an element z tilde in this eye whose norm is exactly a. So again, z was our actual element of interest. It had norm a and then further norm one. To transfer this problem, I want this new e over f and then which commutes with y. So I can talk about ey. And once I have ey, I want to find the z tilde in ey whose norm to y. Z tilde and Ey, whose norm to y is simply A. And of course, I want E to be nice for this Z tilde. So, supposing I can sort of make this setup work, right? So, then what happens? Yours is the world and everything that is in it. And which is more, Z will be a commutator, a product of commutators, right? Why does this work? Because, see, we have assumed that E over F, if you Assume that E over F, if you can show that E F you E over F exists, it's nice for the Z tilde, right? So Z tilde will be a product of commutators. But how do Z and Z tilde differ? Z has norm A, Z tilde has reduced norm A to Y. So these two guys differ by reduced norm one element, which is a commutator. So Z and Z tilde are the same modulo commutators. Z tilde is a commutator. So Z will be a product of commutators. Be product of commutators. So, this is the proof. So, really, the modification this whole moving Z by commutators works provided we can find these E and F. Okay, so how are we going to construct this E and F? So, the idea is this is where you use the special nature of F. F is not just any C D3 field, it is a function field of a periodic curve. So, there is a lot of geometry there. So, you're going to find what. So, you're going to find what are called local candidates, which I'll talk about shortly. So, let's call them EX and FX. And somehow you want to patch these local candidates to get our ENF. So, what are these local candidates? I mean, what is the setup? This brings us to patching techniques, which were developed by Harbeter, Hartman, and Crashet. So, these are very powerful techniques where you can solve algebraic problems over these function fields of periodic curves. Over these function fields of periodic curves by sort of finding these nice overfields of f, solving the problem there, sort of patching them to come back and solve it over this f. So just to try to be a little more precise, so let me say let K be the p-iadic field and x is a smooth curve. So f is k of x. So okay is the ring of integers of k, t is a parameter of k and k is this residue field. So, I'm not going to go into the details of the patching setup, but basically, you can find these overfields called FP and FUs, which all are contained inside these branch fields FPU, right? Such that all these fields form an inverse system. So, the idea is that you solve it over FPs and FU's, and then you sort of go patch them to go down to F. Now, just to give a little more explanation about what these FPs and FUs are. These FPs and FU's are. So just assume that you've got this nice model, this calligraphic X, okay, for your function field over the ring of integers. And assume that your special fiber is in simple normal crossing. So you can basically pick some finite set of points, closed points on your special fiber and look at the rest of it, right, and put separate it into irreducible. Right, and put separate it into irreducible components. So the u's are these irreducible components. You've got this finite set of closed points that is s. And basically, fp is the fraction field of the completion of the local ring at p, and f u is the fraction field of the t-adic completion of these local rings, OXU. And whenever this closed point P lies in the Zariski closure of this irreducible component U, then you have this. Then you have this overfield, which is which I denote FPU. Okay, so the actual details about FPU actually matter in the proof because they have some nice, I mean, the actual fields matter, but for the presentation, it doesn't really matter. So what the theorem is that, well, one of the results we'll use is that the patching holds in the category of f commutative algebras. That is, if you can find local commutative algebras EX, then I can patch them to find a global E. Then I can patch them to find a global E. So, this is one particular thing that we're going to use. So, how does the proof kind of proceed? So, the proof, I just want to give like a description. So, you've got the special fiber and you've got these bunch of closed points. And you can also look at all the co-dimension one points which is present inside the special fiber, right? So, these will be the generic points of these irreducible components. So, the idea is to classify these. Is to classify these points, both these co-dimension one points and the close points. Now, of course, there is the famous Saltman's meteorology, like you can talk about hot, cold, chilly, and a lot of other points. So, drawing inspiration from that, you kind of do a more extensive classification of the close points. And you also do some classification of these four-dimensional one points. So, and then to patch, right, you should not just be worried about yourself, but also your neighbors, right? So, you want to ensure. Neighbors, right? So, you want to ensure some compatible system, and so that involves just doing a lot of combinatorial analysis. Like, you have construct these dual graphs, and you kind of run into compatibility problems whenever you have a cycle and things like that. And when in doubt, you just blow up, right? And then make the graph look nicer, make the model look nicer. So, a modulo, all that, you can find a good model and you construct these local E's, right? And you construct it at, for example, the close points in the At, for example, the close points and the generic points, and then you spread it to a neighborhood of so you basically spread it from the generic point of an irreducible component to some open set around it, right? So all this works, but unfortunately, you will introduce some bad points. Okay, so after all that I've said, this technique really doesn't work. But what do you do? So you say, Do you do? So you say, Well, one E doesn't really suffice, I will take two. Okay, so it's literally the same proof, except that I don't want to find two E's. I mean, I don't want to find a single E. I will find two E's, which work for half of them, right? So I split my A into A1 and A2 and make the whole thing work for AI in both directions. Okay, so this is the general strategy, and it's Strategy, and it's just to tell you how the paper or proof looks like. It looks like you know, you see, you can see some blowing up thing here, you can see some of the classification here. There are lots of tables, right? And then there are like some of these kind of choices at codim one points. So, it's really an exhaustive enumeration of many of these things. All right, just maybe I'm almost out of time. Let me just conclude. This is not. Let me just conclude. This is not the end of the story, right? So, I promised you earlier I had to find E and then I had to find this F. So far, I kind of told you how to find E, but how do I find this F? Now we are assured that E is nice, but we still have to find F. And F is again by patching, right? So, again, because we have this exact hold of how E looks like locally, it's easy to kind of find F locally, right? And then you patch on. Locally, right, and then you patch all these guys. So you show that, well, this local F's patch, and the local F's satisfy the property that we want, namely that B local F is a reduced norm in the local setup. But why does this guarantee that the global F also has the property? Well, because you see that this B tilde F local thing is a reduced norm from C D E at every discrete valuation. Okay, so therefore, you can use. Valuation. Okay, so therefore, you can use Carto's result and say that, well, it is actually a reduced norm from CDE itself. And again, we are crucially using the fact that CDE has index L over E. Okay, so you're going to use Susslin's invariance injectivity in this case. So I think that is about all I wanted to say. So I will stop here. Thank you. Thank you. Are there any questions? Are there any questions? All right, thank you very much. Thanks again for very interesting exposition of this. Okay.
