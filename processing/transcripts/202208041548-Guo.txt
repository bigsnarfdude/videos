recent terms locked up a terrible type and u is the predator or so a is the commodity weight and w is the prey so b is the predecessor weight and and here here two predators are weak competitors and and just reverse the reverse roles there are two players here and two weak competing players and one single player here so these two systems also enjoy the the opponent function in the form I just mentioned in the film one so all these systems I put here classical diffusion but Any body below and above and transition of this system with this laboratory placed by fraction diffusion has the property of this property. So this theorem holds for Holds for all these five systems. Okay, of course, there are many, many, many other systems with which you can. So, this is still in sometimes very general. Okay, and in this talk, I just mentioned one application of the theorem, one, the obvious theorem. Put the theorem. So let's consider the foreign present system with fresh diffusion. And this is just a very classical, typical lockdown period type. So U is the play and we is the pretty. Okay. And assume B bigger than one. So the composite red, B is big in it. Combosion rate, B is bigger than one. So there's a chance for predator to survive. And we assume this also the product, the composition rate times this minimum is less than one. Okay, and because B is bigger than one, so this. This coexistence state u star, we star defined by these two quantities. And we get S star to be R2 times V minus one over N plus two R. N is the dimension of the spatial domain. And then U will be the solution of this system with this initial condition. And the initial function, U0 is U0 is bounded below by a positive constant, and this is not equal to one. And V0 is non-negative and bounded above by B minus one. And V0 is continuous with complex sport. Okay. So we and actually we are interested in the spreading speed of spreading, in particular spreading phenomena. In particular, specific phenomena of this prey-to-play system. Okay, then we have this T t infinity in this domain x less than equal to e to st or any s less than s sub the solution. The solution u v test u star v star and on the other hand, if s is bigger than s star and x the the f the absolute value of x or the distance of x to origin is bigger than equal to est then u v tends to one zero. I think I put somewhere anyway. Somewhere and anyway. Okay. Sorry. Okay, and I would like to emphasize here, this is very different from the classical classical diffusion for presence B. And actually, in 2013, a very nice paper by Capra and Nice paper by Capre and Filomichi. I think he is also in the audience. For scalar KBV equation, they prove the sprint speed is differential. Okay. So it's E to S T not the S T. Okay. Okay, now I how many times one left? How how how many time do I have for ten minutes? Okay. Uh six minutes how many minutes? Peace five. Okay, let me okay, please stop me. Okay, so in the meantime, let me give you some idea about the proof of film one. Theorem one, the obvious type theorem, and the application theorem three. So remember, F of U that the problem function attains a minima at the start only. Otherwise, it's positive. And okay, the key point is here is to construct PD. This, okay, remember F of U is the point. Okay, remember f of u is the problem function for ODE system, for ODE system. Okay, and uh here we need to find uh the function for the PTE system. So we take this integral, okay, of this the function of ODE multiplied by the cutoff function and integrate over whole the whole. Over the whole space. Okay, and the key point is to find a suitable weight function rho sub r, which is well defined for all t. I mean, I mean, for such that this integral is well defined for all t and even boundary for all t. And then we can based on the property of the function of O D, then we can derive whether this is a very useful. However, this is a very useful inequality for this functional FR. Okay, and then by an integration, then we can reduce f r must be zero, and then this implies you must be you stuck. That's the main idea. Okay, the way the function is we borrow a function introduced by Bond Ford. Born for restraint in 2014. This is the county. Okay. And here the power minus gamma over a gamma is chosen between n and n plus 2 hour. R is the order of the virtual diffusion. And this last property was proved by Was proved by escrows. And this implies the mass by plus 2 alpha rho 1 is bigger than equal to minus C1 rho 1. So this is very key point for the proof. And with the scale, take a scale of the row one and And then, by the scaling property of fraction diffusion, fractional approach, then we have this corresponding property inequality for row sub R. Then we can derive using the property d power of theta is equal to one minus one over theta. This okay, this immediately from the P D from the P D. The phone PDs you can have here, but there's terms here to be dealing. Okay, and this I so I is because of this property, this integral of one minus Ey star of Eye multiplied by the fraction of rho r and using the There's a kernel function for the fractional plot by this function, then we can plug in this kernel here and by certain manipulation of this inequality by pass, change of order of integration, and so on and so forth. Then we can prove II is bigger than. I I is bigger than this quantity. Okay. And so the so this inquiry can be derived and by integration then we can prove the u equal must be equal to u star. Okay and this is and for proof of For proof of theorem three, we okay. First, because of the assumption in data, we can prove the Kimberley principle of scale equation. Okay, the system does not have a comparison principle, but the scale equation we do have. So we can prove UE must be non-negative and U must be non-negative and u boundary above by one and then we bound it above by b minus one. And using this b above bound, then we can divide the u have this inequality. And then we can by comparison, we can have u bounded below by a positive constant beta defined by chi and one minus. Defined by chi and one minus a times b minus one. Okay, so here we assume this is positive. Okay, and uh and the key key point here is to derive this spreading property for present because you you already exposed everywhere, but we okay and and uh we we we We first make a transformation from U to one mass U and W becomes the solution of this inequality. And by comparison, we can write W function above by function phi. Phi is can be written as this. Uh, can be written as this integral in terms of the kernel kernel function corresponding to the fraction division of this operator. Okay, and then we need to derive some useful estimates by using the property of this paper and the similar argument by And my announcement and myself is named in Pen from China. We can derive the upper bound for W phi and satisfy this inequality. It is bounded by some positive constant data plus a constant m times b. And then plug in the Buoy equation, then we can have this the Bui etc. This. This KDB type equation and inequality. And so we know from the Capricorn Java papers, we know this in Buy is the spray property as this property. Okay. So okay, so from this From this property, and we know we can, so we know the this possible bound for u and v. And we know u, we are found. So by the audio proof, the audio type theorem, we can prove the convergence to the coexistent state in the in the region of okay. Okay, of course, the I mean for this process, we need a regularity, and this regularity for castle, I'm not for fraction diffusion. This nice paper by Casman, Schwab, and Fernandez to be rose altogether. This is similar to the Casco defeated. diffusion case we have a hurdle estimate and so on and so forth then uh uh oh so sorry after we have a pass drawbound and we uh we want to take a limit pass limit so we choose any any sequence d and x and by regularity then we can show the limiting function must be identical to Must be identical to use star with and disprove the commodities. Okay. And as I mentioned earlier, actually for the outer region, it will be tens one and year. Okay, thank you for your attention. Thank you very much for this for your nice talk. So maybe we have time for a short question. Can I ask a question, Francois? Sure, sure. So, hello, Yong Sheng. So, yeah, I know. Good to see you. So, I have a question. I don't remember if you talked about it, about the case of non-local diffusion with convolution kernels. What would happen in this case? The set theorem can be set. Can be said okay, I mentioned here. Okay, okay, okay. But but but the the the the uh French uh the probability function must be the form uh this form. This fault. This false. We did the manipulate integration by paths and so on. So and this, okay, let me see. This is a key point. This here, here. No. Here, here, here. This is important. Yeah. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Any more questions, comments? Oh, so by the way, of course, the weight function must be chosen different. Okay. Okay, it's different from the version decision, but okay. This is one weight function. One weight function for disposal case. Okay, thank you. The question: so, can you choose different value of alpha for the system? Oh, that's a good question. Okay, actually, we didn't think about this. Different R from then. I think, yes, because I think yes, because I think yes, because here we at this point, at some point here, we okay with the Clon function from this fractional diffusion. So if we choose different alpha, I think it's okay. I think it's okay, but I'm not sure. You have to check carefully. But I'm not sure, you have to check carefully. Yeah, I think it's a good question. Yeah, is it your question at all? Sorry, is that your question? Different alpha, right? Different fractional power. So thank you very much for your nice talk. So let's end the speaker again. Okay, thank you. Okay, so we
