Okay, so I will present the results for my previous product that ended like two weeks ago. The title is slightly long, but so the main idea is contained inside. The main idea, I mean in terms of lessons for public health, if I would be a little bold. But there is another main idea in my talk for specifically concerning methodology for modules. So I hope everyone. Module. So I hope everyone will get something interesting. And it's a shared joint work with Fran√ßois Castella and Federica. Okay, so first, some context and motivations. I will present a model with imitation dynamics related to social learning. So the previous talk was a very good primer for my talk. And we will, in particular, consider Consider NPI that reduces the change of contamination but does not reduce it to zero. So as a motivation, I show you this graph of mask adoption as a function of type in various countries. You can find them here. So you can see there is a different dynamics and we will try to find at least qualitatively the same. Find at least qualitatively the same kind of behavior of dynamics. Okay, so just to set a little context, in this field there I noticed two main textbooks here and in this domain there are every like three, four, five years a literature review. I put the two last I saw on the internet. So our Our base model, the epidemic part, will be based on the SIS model. And in this part, the Comte infection term is beta SI. The SI products stands for the probability for a susceptible individual meeting an infected one. And I decompose this beta as the M, the meeting rate, the encounter rate, and C, the probability of contamination when such encounter occurs. And counter occupies. Okay? So Chris mentioned his paper from 2005 where during the perfect vaccination, the C is reduced to zero. And there have been some papers in which the beta is just changed by the 1 minus E times beta, E being the efficacy of the NPI to reduce control. NPI to reduce contamination. And this reduction occurs in the SI meeting if at least one of them is, for example, wearing a mask or practicing social distancing or hand washing on a regular basis. But we consider that this modding might be a little too simple, and we wanted to include the possibility to have a double pedal. A double reduction if both of them is adopting the NPI, okay, like mask wearing. And for example, well, I will in this section give the main assumption of our model. Such complexification of the force of infection was already considered two years ago in two papers, and I presented here the different probability of contagion based on if it's the infectious one or susceptible one. Infectious one or susceptible one who is wearing a mask, or what is the MPI you want to consider. And as you notice, the reduction is different. I sum it up in this table, in which I note ES the protection for the susceptible one, S for susceptible, and ET the reduction in transmission. So that's the infectious one. That's the infectious one wearing a mask, for example, who protects the other. For example, for face mask, the regular face mask, you have ES who is rather small and ET closer to one. Okay, so now to couple the epidemic part and the behavior part, let's start with two populations. With two populations, the defectors and cooperators, this one always adopts the NPI, the protective behavior, and this one doesn't. Never. They don't. So the equations, well, there are four equations, but since the same, the sum is equal to one to one, that's fine. So three equations. And you can move from S to I based on the classical SIS model, except that the force of infection depends on the proportion. The proportion of each in each group, of these two groups, two subgroups. Now, based on the social learning that was presented previously, I had the possibility to change from one group to another based on the different utility. That's something not precisely defined, but something you want to optimize to maximize. Okay. So if your neighbors has a So if your neighbors has a better utility, you will tend to change your strategy to copy its strategy. So but as you can notice, we have this delta S and delta E, delta I, because we might have we might consider different way to make your opinion based on if you are susceptible or infectious. If you are suscept susceptible, you would like to protect yourself. You would like to protect yourself, but if you are infectious, you would like to protect others from infection. So that might lead to very complicated equations where we tried it at home and don't do it at home, it was done by professionals. But to keep it simple, we made the assumption that people are unaware of their health ages. Like, for example, imagine there is no test at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of course, you have symptoms. Of course, you have symptoms, but imagine you don't know. So the delta U is the same. It will be the difference between the payoff of carbon defecting, irrespective of your health wages. Okay, so the equations here are a little tedious. So we introduce a change of variables. Change of variables. This one, I don't go through the computations, but here is the system we want to study, complemented with this relation. And usually in these models, you would have the infection equation, the behavior equations, but it happened that in our construction of the model, a third one appears, which is non-differentiable. And that leads to a complex. And that leads to considerable complication and the mathematical. So at this point, I need to be more precise about what is this delta U. Since we have different payoffs based on if you are a cooperator or not cooperator, we have to fill these metrics. Basically, Basically, for the payoff for the encounter of two defectors, we included two costs. The S here, this S is for selfish. You have this selfish cost or you don't want to be infected. I recall that you don't know if you are infected or not. And then there is also this altruistic cost, in which that includes the fear to infect other people. Infect other people. And we have to modify this cost. For example, for a de facto meeting a cooperator, the defector's payoff will be reduced by a certain factor based on the characteristics of the NPI consumer. Of course, there is a symmetric one for cooperator meeting de facto plus the constant costs. And both reduction occurred when cooperator meets a contractor. If needed, in our model, we included the possibility to add a perception bias, like the reduction of your fear of infected or being infected can be unaligned with the actual efficacy of the MPI considerably. But I will not talk a lot about this perception bias. Okay, so a little more math. We put some change of variables. Put some change of variables, find, and here is the final system we want to study. I just make a comment on this A and H that appears in the equivalent of delta U. This A is a weighted mean between the ES and ET, the two characteristics of the MTI. And while this H appears to be the harmonic mean, well, I will not comment further. I will not comment further, but no, keep in mind that this A and H are means of the characteristics of the NPL. So the different equilibria possible are, well, the two from the disease free, which are not really interesting because R0 is smaller than one is not an interesting case. But in case R0 is larger than one, we can have either we can have no control. We can have no control if the basically if the this quantity row of eight that I will comment in the next slide is too large compared to the characteristic of the epidemics. On the opposite, if it's small enough, then we will have full control. And in between, there is a partial control, like a certain fraction of the population comply to the control. And this rho of A, so row of A. Rho over A, so rho is the financial slash psychological cost to adopt the control measure. And A, as I mentioned, was the average of the characteristics of the protection given by the NPO. So the interesting quantity is a rho over A, which is like a cost-benefits comparison. And we have to compare this value to these two bounds to see if we will be in the long run in no In the long run, in no control, full control, or in between. Here is, I depicted an example in the case of partial control in long time, and we can see that our kind of simple model can reproduce the different waves that can occur and also kind of plateau that can occur, that can be observed in mass cadosh. In the special case of ES equals zero, so the protection to the susceptible one, the model actually reduced to a two-equation system and we can plot easily the equilibria. And next we correlate the cost to the protection of the model to have this kind of cost as a function of the efficacy. And we observe that. Efficacy. And we observed that actually an intermediate level of protection and also intermediate cost leads to the lowest prevalence. The idea is that we have to find a balance between large adoption of the control and its costs, and its protection. I skip quickly on this one. It was to show that with bias, we can have two annotations. Too minimal for the prevalence. To conclude, we produced not too complicated model, but I think a little more complex to account for both kinds of production. And so, as I said, the main message is that disease prevalence is minimized for intermediate level of efficacy that ensure full adoption. Adoption and for the next tasks, we have to study the interplay between altruism and perception bias. And somehow, we would like to relax the assumption of people being unaware of their health detectors, which is not really realistic. But that would lead to very complicated equations. So, thank you for your attention.
