The university has changed name again. That's the former Paris 7, former Universit√© Paris, former whatever at the AMJ. And he will talk about fast reaction limits leading to cross-diffusion systems. Okay, so thanks a lot. Thanks for the organizers. It's really such a pleasure to be here in Granada. And okay, so as So, as Clement pointed out, there is no mistake in the name of the university this time. But as you can see, at least the date is not the right one. But anyway, so actually today I would like to present something which I choose really because I try to stick as much as possible to the title of the workshop. The title of the workshop, so I will have tried to put non-ear diffusion, multi-scale things, etc. So let's say the theme of what I will present is the passage from reaction diffusion models towards cross-diffusion models. So, the general framework is more or less the following. So, you have a reference. So, you have a reaction diffusion system. So, typically you have P species that you call U1, U2, up to UP. And both fields depend on T and X. And you can see them typically as concentrations of something. So it can be a concentration of chemicals. It can also be a concentration or number density of individuals in population dynamics model. And then you have a certain number of. And then you have a certain number of reactions, so usually they are called like Fi of U1UP. So those are typically algebraic functions of U1UP. And the setting I want to investigate today is the one in which you have for two of the species, say U1 and U2, you have some kind of fast reaction term. Fast here means that in front of the quantity J, Of the quantity j, you put one over epsilon for one of them and minus one over epsilon for the other one. So, in some sense, you can imagine that you have a situation in which you have a quick shift from species one to species two, and it can go in one way and in the other way. So, some kind of reversibility, let's say, in the passage from a species one to species two. As we will see in examples, this is typically what happens when you have. Typically, what happens when you have one species which can live in two states and can switch between those two states quite quickly with respect to the time scale that you are looking at for the evolution of the model. So that is the general situation. And now, when epsilon goes to zero, the formal limit is easy to guess. I mean, since you have one over epsilon here, you just multiply. Or epsilon here, you just multiply by epsilon the equation. When epsilon goes to zero, you say that everything which has epsilon in front is becomes zero, and you end up just with the fact that the J of U1 UP is equal to zero. Okay, and then so you have this constraint, and then you just add the two first equations. Okay, so when you add them, the fast reaction part disappears, it just cancels out. It just cancels out, and you end up with dt of u1 plus u2 minus Laplacian of this quantity is just the sum of f1 and f2, which has here, and the rest of the system is not modified. So, as you can see, the result is some coupling between an algebraic equation, a set of reaction diffusion equations, and an equation which is sometimes. Is sometimes called a cross-diffusion equation in the sense that now the variable is u1 plus u2. And as you can see, if d1 is not equal to d2, this quantity is not a multiple of u1 plus u2. And in order to write it in terms of u1 plus u2, you have to use a constraint. And so, in fact, this quantity will depend on all the rest, all the other variables. And this is what usually. Other variables, and this is what usually we call cross-diffusion, which means that somehow the diffusion rate depends on the other densities which are in the system. So, this is really a passage from fast reaction diffusion towards coarse diffusion. And I will focus on the case in which the algebraic equation can be solved with respect to the first variable. So, this happens quite often, but not. So, this happens quite often, but not always. And in that case, you just eliminate the algebraic constraint and you write directly that the equation satisfied by U1 plus U2 is in fact satisfied by a quantity which is U2 plus this H, which depends on all the rest. So you can sort of remove the constraint from the equation and write directly a system of cross-diffusion in which there is only P minus one equations in. One equations instead of p. So let me just say one word about the case in which you cannot invert this quantity. Actually, this is very interesting and it happens and you can see that in many papers, like for example, by the papers by Bote or Daniel Lorst or Michel Pierre or there is a whole group of people working on that. And it's especially interesting when you have things here which like When you have things here, which like u1 times u2, because then this means that somehow you expect to have one part of the domain in which you have u1 and the other one in which you have u2, and so you have some kind of segregation models which can really be obtained in situations in which you cannot invert this. But I will not say more about that. I will not speak at all about this situation. I will only speak about the situation which is here. So let's forget about this general. Let's forget about this general setting and let me try to present to you why, from my point of view, it is interesting to look at those fast diffusion limits leading to cross diffusion. So the first thing I would like to point out is that actually there are a certain number of modeling issues which can be understood by this procedure. And I would like to present two of them. And I would like to present two of them. The first one is one of the most well-known models of cross-diffusion for population dynamics. It's called the Shikesadaka Wazaki Te Raboto model, so SKT. And it was introduced in the late 70s in order to solve the following problem. That in nature, you see a lot of biological situations in which you can see that there is some kind of segregation, or at least places in which. Places in which one species is more present than another species, and places in which it is a reverse. And in order to explain that, if you use standard competition models in which you have a Lotka-Volterra-type reaction, so typically, let's say, degree two polynomials, and a standard diffusion, then you you can never produce such things as limits when t goes to infinity. Limits when t goes to infinity. You always produce things which are homogeneous. And so, in order to try to get something which produces patterns or segregation, I mean, those authors introduced this extra diffusion term, which is here alpha times u times v. So, v is the solution of the sequence equation. And let's say the The study of the Turing instability for this model, which is quite easy to do, this can be done really at the level of the third year of university, shows that actually you can produce patterns with this, provided that alpha is large enough. So if you have enough cross-diffusion, then it's possible to produce patterns. And so this model became quite popular because of Popular because of that feature. And actually, a modeling issue arose in the 80s. And you can see the trace of this all along the years. And actually, I received a referee report a few days ago in which there is still the same issue which is raised. And I would like to discuss it briefly with you. The public issue is the following: so, the question is: when you have question is when you have when you have a diffusion with a coefficient which is Tx dependent should you consider that the rate of the diffusion should be inside the Laplacian or between the divergence and the gradient? But the whole point. So of course when it is a constant it does not change but if something depends on x it's not so clear. So a typical explanation in A typical explanation in some papers that you can find for this model is that actually the Laplacian of UV, which is here, should be understood as the divergence of V grad U plus the divergence of U grad V. And those two things would somehow correspond to two different effects. In the first one, you see that the more You see that the more you have the more the concentration of the species V is large, the larger the diffusion for the species U. So somehow this model, the effect that if the individuals of the species U see individuals of the species V in large number, then they increase their diffusion, okay, which makes sense. And then the second term is interpreted as a Second term is interpreted as some kind of chemotaxis term, but with the reverse sign. So, here it more or less says that this is in the equation for you, okay? So, it more or less says that U tries to go in the direction which is opposite to the points in which V has the maximal concentration. So, it's a sort of anti-chemotaxis. Of anti-chemotaxis term. And so you can interpret, so you see in some papers that there is this interpretation of those two terms. And if you believe in this, then the first question is, why put one in front of those two terms? If they have nothing to do, why put the same coefficients in front of the two of them? Okay, why not put a beta in front of the sequence? Put a beta in front of the sequence one with a different beta if they are not related. And if you believe that you have individuals which cannot measure the gradients, but only the size of the concentration, which makes sense for many animals, that they somehow are able to see that a competitor is present in large numbers, but it's not so easy to see what is the gradient of. What is the gradient of this concentration? Then, if you believe in what I told you before, you would say, well, let's just keep this term. I mean, let's take beta equals zero here. Okay. So, how to solve this problem? How to understand this? Actually, there was this model which was proposed by Ida, Izwaha, Mimuha, and Nomiya. I think it was maybe in the early 2000s. The early 2000s. Anyway, they said, okay, let's not try to argue directly on the macroscopic model and let's try to find a sort of microscopic model in which we would really understand everything. And let's pass to the limit when epsilon goes to zero. Okay, so here the point is the following. You have the species V, which solves the usual Lord Carvaltera with diffusion. And then you say that for the species U. And then you say that for the species U, actually, the microscopic model is the following: U can be found in two states: one state, if you wish, which is quiet, and one state which is sort of stressed out. And somehow the individuals switch between those two states depending on the amount of competitors that they see. So, you have this term here, which, as you can see, can Which, as you can see, can go from basically UA to UB, depending whether V is large or not. And so there is this switch between the two states, and then there is a standard Lotka Volterra, which is here. So what you have to keep in mind is that in this picture, the Lottker-Volterra sort of represents the long-time evolution of the species. That is, you have Of the species, that is, you have birth, death, which are due to competition. And this term here corresponds to something which is much quicker, which is just the ways individuals will sort of be quiet or not, depending on the number of competitors that they see. And the whole point is that if they are stressed out, then you say that their diffusion coefficient is bigger. The picture you have in mind is that the animal. The picture you have in mind is that the animal sees a lot of its competitors, then it begins to move everywhere. I mean, it does not really choose his direction, but he sort of becomes stressed and he will go sort of anywhere. Okay, so this, in some sense, is a model in which there is no real issue of modeling. You can really believe in that. Maybe this is not what happens in reality, but at least. What happens in reality, but at least it's something which is completely understandable, and then you can try to let epsilon go to zero. So, if you do that and you apply exactly the procedure that I described in the general setting, what you end up with is the following, that what is inside the quick term is this quantity. And this you can rewrite like u bay is ub is ua plus u b times v and if you call u the times v and if you call u the quantity ua plus u b which is the total number of individuals of the species u you end up with u b is equal to u v and now you just add the two equations for ua and u b you end up with this thing here and you replace ua plus u b by u and what you end up with is exactly the sket model that was written at the beginning okay so actually what this tells you So actually, what this tells you is that if you put everything inside the Laplacian and not between the divergence and the gradient, this exactly corresponds to the situation in which there is only an increase of diffusion and no antichemotaxis effect. Or so if you prefer, this is a model for which you do not have to believe that the animals are able to measure the gradient of the concentration of the other species. Of the concentration of the other species. Okay, so from my point of view, this solves the modeling issue which was raised previously. I would just like to say that actually, together with Ariel Traskazet a few years ago, we sort of proved rigorously that what I presented holds for the solutions of the model. So basically, you can even put So basically you can even put the powers in the log cavali terms. So those powers have to satisfy some assumptions, but it includes the case of the SKT. And it's quite easy to show that the reaction diffusion system has a unique smooth solution. And it's possible to show that then epsilon goes to zero. To zero, both solutions converge in a weak sense towards the weak solutions of the SKT model. Actually, let me say that for this model with A, B, C and D equal to one, so the original SKT model, strong solutions are known to exist only in dimension two. So it belongs to this class of models which are exactly like the Netflix Tokes. Which are exactly like the Navier-Stokes, the incompressible Navier-Stokes. That is, you have a system of equations of order two with quadratic terms, and you know that you have strong solution for dimension two, and you don't know that you have it for dimension three. And if you look a little better, you can see that dimension three is probably also not a critical here, but it's more dimension two, which is critical. More dimension two, which is pretty cool. So, this class also includes the Lando equation that we saw yesterday in the Coulomb case and some other equations which were treated some reaction diffusion systems that I will not present today. Anyway, it's possible to give sort of a rigorous justification of all what I have presented for this model. I will not say more about the proof of that, and I would like rather to present a completely different modeling issue, which can also be understood from my point of view in this framework. So, this is actually a predata-free model, which is sometimes called polling type 2. So, the functional response here is a name that is. Here is a name that is given in biology to the kind of terms that you put in the reaction terms. Polling type 2 means the following, that the predetermined term is this quantity here, and in the basic model, you just have a constant times n times p, where n here is the density of preys and p is the density of predators, and n times p is. And n times p, in some sense, is the number of successful attacks from the predator to the prey. And it makes sense that it is proportional to both p and n. But Holling argued that if there are a large number of preys, then somehow predators will not be able to catch. Will not be able to catch all the phrase, and so actually there is a saturation in the model, and you should put something which is like n divided by 1 plus n instead of n. So, the holding type 2 means that you put a saturation in the number of prey in the predator prey model, and this is considered as a standard, let's say, a standard modification of the original predator pre-model. Moreover, nowadays, However, nowadays, usually people also have saturation here in the evolution of the preys without the predator. So you also have a minus n square here in the model. Okay, anyway, this is the set of differential equations which are considered as the predator prey holding type 2 model, which is also presented. Presented quite early in the courses for people doing math biology. And actually, Hans Metz and Odo Diekmann, maybe 30 years ago or something like that, proposed a sort of microscopic model which is closer to the original predator pre-model, which in a certain limit will converge towards Converge towards this falling type 2 system. So their argument is the following: that somehow the predators can be considered as being in two possible states. So the first one is called the handling state, and the second one is called the searching state. So somehow the picture that you have to keep in mind is that when the print Uh, when the predator has not found the prey, he's still searching, so he belongs to his PS class. But when the prey is found, then he needs some time to prepare, eat the prey, and digest it. And this is called the handling phase. And the rhythm at which it goes from handling to searching is very quick with respect to the time scale of the lab. To the time scale of the life of the predators and preys. Okay, so you put one ver epsilon in front of the term in which you reproduce the switching from hunting to searching. So typically, the idea is that you go from searching to handling when a prey is found, and this happens. Prey is found, and this happens with the rate n times ps, so the number of preys times the number of searching predators. And then you come back to the searching state with a rate which is proportional to the number of handling predators. So you have this term inside this one over epsilon. And then you have those terms which will produce more or less what is here. Which is here. Now, if you let epsilon go to zero, you do the formal asymptotics and you have this constraint which appears, which can be rewritten like Ps is like P divided by, let's say, one plus N, and PH is like NP divided by one plus N. And when you replace this in the equation for N and PH plus PS, you end up with exactly the Holing type II model, which was. Model, which was written much before this microscopic interpretation was produced. So, at the level of ODEs, it's very easy to show that this rigorously holds when epsilon goes to zero for solutions of the ODEs. But it is also quite interesting to understand what happens with the diffusion if the species live in a specific species. Species live in a spatial environment. So, in some papers, actually, people are taking the Holing type 2 functional response, which is written here, taking all the coefficients equal to 1, just to make it easier to read. And they just add standard diffusions for both predators and preys with different diffusion rates. Diffusion rates. So, this is a system that you can find in many papers. But the point is the following: that if now you come back to the microscopic system and you say, well, what should I put in terms of diffusion terms for the system at the microscopic level? Then you would put the standard diffusion for the preys, but for the hunting and searching prediction, But for the hunting and searching predators, typically what you would have in mind would be to put two different diffusion rates because somehow the hunting predators will not move, whereas the searching predator will move around. So you expect the D3, which is here, to be much smaller or even zero than the D2. So now if you do that and you do the formal asymptotics, when epsilon goes to zero. Asymptotics, when epsilon goes to zero, starting from here, you do not end up with the polling type 2 plus standard diffusion system, but with a system in which in the sequence equations, the one for the predators, you have these cross-diffusion terms which appears. So you see that the n now is inside the Laplace. So you see that this, in some sense, does not solve. Not solve a problem of modeling, but rather points out some kind of problem in modeling which was already done. Okay, which is that it's not, if you believe at least in the interpretation of Metz and Dickmann of the Holin type 2 functional response, the extension of the ODEs, when you take into account the diffusion, should not be. Diffusion should not be an equation with standard diffusion, but an equation with a cross-diffusion term. Okay. So maybe it's not such a big problem if this system and the system which is written here have the same large time behavior. Okay. And in fact, so let me go directly. Uh go directly there. So, in fact, it is possible to show that both those systems, so the naive one, if you wish, and the one in which you have put what is the right diffusion, if you believe in the microscopic interpretation, actually, they have no Turing instability region. So, the Larson behavior for those two things is trivial. Okay, it's just like. Okay, it's just like you go to homogeneous states, and so it's not such a big problem if you don't put the right diffusion inside. But in fact, there is a slightly more complicated model, which is called the Beddington De Angelis functional response. And this belongs to the folklore of people doing Lodca-Oltera systems. And it is a system in which, at the level of the ODEs, you do not take into account only the saturation. Take into account only the saturation between due to the large number of preys, but also saturation which is due to the large number of predators. So, when the number of predators is large, then there is competition between the predators, and you expect that the number of attacks is only like NP divided by 1 plus N plus P. This is called the Benton-De Angelis functional response. So, now if you start from this one and you do exactly the same process. One and you do exactly the same procedure as previously, you can see that if you put the standard diffusion like here, there is in fact a Turing instability region, but it is much bigger than the Turing instability region that you get if you put the cross-diffusion term here. So, at least for the Biddington-Leangelis case, you can really show that the The, let's say, qualitative behavior of the system is different if you put the plus diffusion or not. And once again, if you believe in the Metz and Diekman interpretation, you should put it. Okay, I don't know if I say one word. I will just say one word about the fact that here also it is possible to get a completely rigorous justification. A completely rigorous justification of the limits if you do it in the right functional setting and you get like weak solutions of the limit of the cross diffusion equations, which are at the limit. Okay, so this was, let's say, what I wanted to say about the interest for modeling of this fast diffusion approximation of cross-diffusion systems. I would like to say also, I would like to show one slide about another use. About another use of this approximation, and this is something which is really always a problem when you're trying to get to build solutions for the cross-diffusion systems. That actually, the approximating procedures are usually extremely painful. So, So, typically, you can do discretization in time or space, or use Aman theory. And Aman's theory is a way of getting from an abstract theorem local in time solutions. So, this is usually easy because the assumptions in a manner's theory are Are usually quite easy to check. But if you want to extend the time of existence in order to get global solutions in aman's theory, then you have to find a bound for your data, which is typically in L infinity in time, w1s in omega in the space variable, and the s has to be strictly bigger than 2. And that's usually quite complicated to get such a bound if you. Complicated to get such a bound if you're if you have weak solutions at the end. So, when you use Aman's theory, in fact, very often you need some extra approximation procedure. So, you have first to approximate your system, you use Aman's theory, you check that you have the criterion of extension, and once you have done that, you have a solution to your approximated system, and then you still have to pass through the limit in the approximation in order to get the original. In order to get the original system. So you have, in some sense, two steps of approximation. So it's not very pleasant. And if you do Galarkin, then this means that somehow you have to prove at the discrete level the aprio estimate that you want to show at the continuous level, and it's not that easy. For example, you have to do the discretization in time usually. discretization in time usually in an implicit way if you want to if you want to do that so uh all of this is already painful but there is even uh something which is uh which is not very pleasant it's that uh if you want to use some kind of fixed point theorem starting from linear parabolic theory so you freeze some of the coefficients and you try to use Some of the coefficients, and we try to use the linear harboric theory. Then you see that in classical books, usually you have the elliptic case, which is done seriously with Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions, and the parabolic case, which is done seriously with the Dirichlet boundary condition, but you lack exactly the one that you need, which is the parabolic case with Neumann boundary condition. So it's not so easy to find good references for that. For that. And so, for all of those reasons, it's usually a problem to approximate in a good way those cross-diffusion systems. So, when you have a fast reaction limit, then the situation is much better because somehow you start from a reaction diffusion system in which the diffusion part is a collection of heat equations, and for this, you have a And for this, you have a lot of good theory which is written down, and you can usually show quite quickly that for a given epsilon strictly positive, there is a good solution, a good smooth solution to your reaction diffusion system. And then you can try to pass directly when epsilon goes to zero to z to the system. So, this is a second feature which I think makes it interesting to look at those fast reaction limits. I would like to finish by what is maybe the most significant for people interested in the analysis of the equations. And unfortunately, as you will see, the situation is not so good for this. So the point is, is it possible to use those fast reaction limits in order to get new estimates for the macroscopic systems? And rather than presenting And rather than presenting a general theory, I would like to focus on one specific example in which one can try to understand when it is possible to get new estimates for the macroscopic system starting from the fast reaction system. So let's look at this system here. You see that it does not exactly belong to the class that I proposed at the very beginning because you have one over epsilon in the three equations. And this is a system of. And this is a system of, let's say, non-linear heat equations on the left-hand side, not necessarily with the same power in the Laplacian. And on the right-hand side, you put, for example, a very simple fast reaction term, which is here, Vw minus U. So you put one over epsilon in front of the first one and minus one var epsilon in front of Epsilon in front of the two last ones. So, actually, for people who are familiar with kinetic theory, it's no big surprise that the standard Boltzmann entropy added for all the components will be a Lyapunov functional for this system. Because, I mean, if you take the derivative of this with respect to time along the solution of this, you see that. Solution of this, you see that the diffusion part will give you terms which are not exactly the feature information because you have the powers here, but will be like, I mean, terms with different powers of the same style. And the terms coming out from the reaction, they will produce the same kind of entropy dissipation as the one that you have in the Boltzmann equation. So typically, things like Vw minus U times log of V minus W. times log of V minus W minus log of U. Okay, so you have a natural entropy when you start from both systems and here you can replace the powers here by any reasonable powers and it does not change anything and of course there are many many different possible choices for the reaction which give you the same structure. This is just an example. So for this system here you have this entropy okay and in some sense this is given to you by By standard thermodynamics. Now, if you pass to the formal limit in this system, you see that the u minus vw, which was in the right-hand side, it becomes u equal vw when epsilon tends to zero. And you just have to add now equation one and two on one side and equation one and three on the other side in order to eliminate all the reaction terms. All the reaction terms. Okay, so you do that, and you end up with this system here. So you have this algebraic constraint plus those two equations here, which in which U has been replaced by VW. So this system is rather ugly because, I mean, typically you prefer when you have the the the terms inside the DT. The terms inside the dt, which are just u1 and u2. And if you try to replace these by u1 and u2, then you have to solve a secant degree equations. And it means that here you will get a lot of square roots which will appear. But it's possible in principle. And now the entropy pass to the limit at the formal level and it becomes exactly this quantity here. So as you can see, you still have the You still have the part which is related to V and W, but you also have the part which is related to U, which is now VW. But now, if I give you this system, and you just forget about this, and I just give you this system, what is the probability that you can give me a Yapunov functional, which is given by this formula? Okay. Actually, I don't know for you, but for me, I mean, if I don't know the formula. I mean, if I don't know the fast reaction limit, the probability is clearly zero. So, in some sense, you see that you can build a priori estimates, and this one is actually quite efficient because in a good situation, you can really get existence out of it for this limiting system from the fast reaction. So, what is the limit of this? So, first, this has been done seriously at the request level by people like Gautu and Roland, and I mean, the specialists of reaction diffusion are aware of those things. But the limitation of this is that, in some sense, it goes in the wrong way. That is, I can give you a lot of those systems, I can pass to the limit, and I get a lot of cross-diffusion systems. Diffusion systems. But if I now give you a cross-diffusion system, it's really not obvious to see if there is a fast reaction diffusion system which is well behaved with an entropy and which goes to the original system. So you see that in some sense I'm cheating here. So I provide systems for which it is possible for me to show that they are well behaved, but it's not system that you would have looked naturally. So, this is my last slide. What I just wanted to emphasize is that at least it's possible to show that those good situations are not completely isolated. That is not just very specific cross-diffusion systems which can be obtained as a limit of well-behaved fast reaction. Reaction diffusion systems, because in some sense, at least in some sense, it's possible to show that the set of good cross-diffusion systems in this sense is open. And the reason for that is that if I take, for example, the system that I had previously, but now I initially have some amount of cross-diffusion inside. So you do not start from a reaction diffusion system at the microscopic level, but you already have. Level, but you already have some cross-diffusion inside. Then, if the coefficient in front of this cross-diffusion is small, and actually it can be measured, can be measured quantitatively, then it's still possible to show that the Boltzmann entropy is still an entropy for this one and can pass to the limit. So, somehow, the categories of cross-diffusion system that you obtain at the end, well, actually, I lie this because of my massive. I lie this because of my nice. So, this category, in some sense, is an open set. That is, you can start from the system that I showed previously, but you can add some perturbation, which is here, which is more or less whatever, provided that it is small and smooth. And you still have the good entropy structure. So, it does not solve the problem, I would say, in the sense that still, if I give you a That still, if I give you a cross-diffusion system, it's not so obvious to see what you should produce as a fast reaction diffusion system. But at least the set of systems which are well-behaved, you see that those are not really isolated points. And around them are the small ball of data, which are still, let's say, which can still be obtained. Which can still be obtained in the same way. So, this was done together with Esther Daros and Ansier J√ºrgen from the event. Okay, I think I will stop. I have a question concerning the reduction is fast limit. So, under the La Passions in the different The Laplacians in the different equations, we get now a non-linear mapping of the density to something. So, we did some work on some similar solutions, which roughly made the reactions fast compared to the diffusion. And one of the important conditions was monotonicity of this mapping is this like elastic uh conditions for me related, but you only experience how important this is to move the liquid. To move the limit somehow, yes, I think in general, it's in the example that I showed, you are typically in such a situation, and I definitely think that it helps a lot when you try to do the rigorous proofs. Are there examples where this is where you can handle the case without molliding? I don't have that in mind, but I've never really thought of it, so now I will check in the examples that I have if there is something interesting. If there is some interesting example in which you do not have automated DCD, but I think that in the example that I presented, I think that you have it. Other questions? GTPs are only useful for the existence part, or you can also prove some kind of approach to the mega limit or something like that. Or something like that. So, in some cases, yes, you can also use it for the large-time behavior. But in many practical situations, actually, those are not really a non-functional. They are only things in which you have a part which is monotone plus a part which is bounded. So, in that case, you cannot, of course, use it for the large time behavior. But, for example, in this specific situation here, you can really use it for the large time behavior. Large-time behavior. Maybe a small structural question. Okay, I don't know much about the modeling, but I imagine the noise, the diffusion corresponds to each species moving around. Are there models which are more a mixture of hyperbolic, carbolic? That some equations would not have the diffusion, there would be some sort of transmission. Some sort of transmission of noise, and then, yeah, I mean, uh, sure. I mean, uh, I think in the talk that we are this, uh, you had a sort of a good mechanics part, and then what also a diffusion part for some of the what does the cause diffusion in terms of not really looked by myself on those cases, but sure they appear in the literature. You know, I think there's the effect of two different Just the effect of two different diffusion coefficients, yeah, and yeah, sometimes it's not the same quantity, which is one is affected, the other one is diffused. Or I mean, you can have a mixture of both. I mean, you can have one advector in part and one diffusing part, as you say. Everything happens. So you could put your fast reaction between one advector and one diffused. But then an internet network structure will be quite difficult. But then an international structure will be quite different. Yes. You can certainly find examples like that. If there are no more questions, let's have a one or two minute break while we set up the next slide. Yeah, I have a piece of work.
