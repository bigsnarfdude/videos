Okay, let me first introduce our problem. On the real line, it is considered a generalized KDV equation labeled by number one with quasi-periodical initial date labeled by number two. Here the nonlinear term is UP minus one times partial Xu. Here P is a natural number and it is greater than or equal to Or equal to the number two. In the initial dates, u is a finite integer and it is greater than or equal to one. Cn is the initial Fourier date. Omega is a frequence vector and it is rationally independent. And it's rationally independent. That is to say n dot omega equals zero implies that n is zero. Here the dot operation is the standard equity in the product. What we are interested in is to study the existence and To study the existence and uniqueness of spatially quasi-peodic solutions with the same frequency as the initial date to the pressure problem. Such solutions are defined by the Fourier series as follows. Here the Fourier coefficient CTN is unknown for any given n belongs to the new unsuitable time interval. The new unsuitable time interval. It should be emphasized that such functions are non-periodic with respect to the space and they don't decay to zero with respect to the space. Regarding quasi-pursuit in space, Dave said with the discovery of quasi-crystal Of quasi-crestors, one can anticipate in particular that interest in PD problems and quasi backgrounds will surely grow. The following is a picture of quasi crystal. Some more details can be found in Dex's paper. It is about some open problems in random matrix theory and the theory of intercorboral systems. Regarding PD-inquaries, periodical setting, there are some significant works on such a cure and for current consider the following vector systems. Here, u is a vector-valided function as u1, it is um. And every ui is a function of y. Here, i is a member of RM. The triangle is the standard and abnormal with respect to the variable y. And y epsilon is a small parameter. f appearing in the nonlinear term is a function of x and y. Here x is a member of R and F is periodical with is periodical with respect to each of its n plus m variables. Quasi-periodical here, they considered means that there exists a matrix big omega of size n times m and a periodic function u, big u defined on the torrent such as the literal u equals to the right hand side. The right-hand side. The next work is from Ers. He studied the steady-sweet-Hornberg equation as follows. Here, mu is a bifurcation parameter, and u is a real function of x and y in the real plane. And it is the And it is quasi-periodic in all directions. That is to say, it's a four-way expansion with wave vectors belonging to a cross-y lattice big gamma. See the left picture below. This is a cross-inatus big gamma, and it is from Earth's paper. It is bounded by two constraint hexagonal with a rotation. String hex agonal with a rotation alpha in the real plane. This is the so-called quasi-patent, which was discovered in nonlinear pattern forming systems in the Fraday wave experiment. Mathematical existence of quasi-patents is one of the outstanding problems in patent formation theory. theory. To put it simply, the solution has the following Fourier expansion. Notice that the sum index, that is the y vectors, the pair with v1, v2 belongs to this quadratic. Then the next work is from the master. is from the master speaker one's work. She considers the following nonlinear sharing equation. I posh tu equals minus less than u minus the modulus of u 2p times u. Here p is an arbitrary natural number and is greater than or equal to 1. The big u is a complex value function of t The value function of t and x defined on r times r d here d is an arbitrary dimension. And she studied the space quasi-periodic standing wave solutions with the following form. Here E is a real parameter and the little U is even and is quasi-periodic in Periodic in each direction as k and so it is given by a currently periodical sine series that is ux equals the product of cosine jk dot named kxk with k from one to d with certain Fourier coefficients height u and then some over for j one etc J1 etc. The nonlinear Schaudin equation is used to study Burst Einstein condensation, and it is usually called the first Pitovsky equation when thinking non-decin solutions. Last year, Will Quinn and George studied the spatial inquiry water wave. Naturally, craving water wave of infinite deeps for the two-dimensional free surface overlaid equations. Okay, now returning to our model, that is the generalized KDV equation. The classical sense is p equals 2. That is, in this case, the generalized KDV equation is the classical KDV as follows. equal kdv as follows uh here here the non-linear term is u times partial x u and k d v is a mathematical model of water of waves on shiny water surface which can be traced back to the experiments by graceo regarding the coach problem especially for those with some p structure to the category C structure to the KDV equation. There are some significant works on the periodical, quasi-periodic, and almost periodic initial dates. These are associated with the so-called David conjecture. This conjecture states that the solution to the KDV equation with almost purely initial data. With a most periodic initial date, or has a unicorn global solution u divided by utx, and it is a most periodic in space for any time, and it is a most periodical in time t for any space. In the periodical setting, Nax, McKinney, and Tropo Witz prove that the Prove that the solution is almost periodic in time. This is also the motivation of David proposed this conjecture. In the quasi-periodic staging, Sagar obtained a local result under the polynomial decay condition by using Broguain's Fourier restriction method. Fourier restriction method. Several years later, Damali and Goldstein obtained a global result under the experimental decay condition with respect to the model of the defining condition on the frequency vector. They developed a combinatorial analysis method to get the local. Get the local result and then apply an isospectral argument to obtain the global result. This is based on the pair structure of the KDV equation. In the most general case, that is the most periodic setting. Bender, dynamic, woodstand, looking partial results, this conjecture. Partialness of this conjecture. However, there is a possible negative answer to this conjecture. Nasty year, Damanik and his collaborators, they presented a program which intends to show that this conjecture is not true in general. By constructing smallest or most periodic initial date, Initial date for which the solution is normal most purely in time. This is the delta conjecture. Another special case is P equals 3 of the generalized Caddy V equation. In this case, this is the modified Caddy V equation. Here, the nonlinear term is U squared. The nonlinear term is u squared times the partial xu. There are many studies on the modified KDV in the URL souvenir space and the periodic souvenir space. The sharp results are 1 over 4 and 1 over 2, respectively. This can be found in the work of Colinder and his collaborators. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no research on the current impurity in space for the modified KDV equation. Motivated by this, we consider the generalized KDV equation with quasi-periodic initial dates. And our main result is the following theory. If the initial forward date that is CN, it is experimental decay. That is, there exists two positive constants, A and copper. Here, copper is less than or equal to one. Such that the model of the initial Fourier date is less than or equal to 1. Is less than or equal to this experimental decay form. Here, compare is the decay rate. This is hold for all n beyond to the new. These quasi-purity problem has a unique special quasi-purity solution defined on this local time. Uh, defined on this local time interval and times the space real line. Here, t0 is a positive number, and it depends on the power p, amplitude a the decay rate coupler, the dimension u, and the modulus of the frequency vector. What's more, the Fourier coefficient CDN of solution. Efficient CDN of solution returns the expiry k with a slight remote constant. That is the following estimates. The modulo of CDN is less than or equal to equal to this experimental decay form. Here, the decay rate is the kappa over 2, and it is half of the original decay rates. This holds for this holds for this holds for all and belongs to zero and this is uniform in time down to this look interval this is our main result and here i'll give two remarks uh the first one is that the case p equals two coincides with the amount of coincidence local result Local result. The second one is that it follows from the experimental capability that this result can be viewed as a Khrushchev-Karneyv-Skaria theory for the generalized KDV page with quasi-periodical initial date. This is Mansterman's remarks. Next, I'll give a brief introduction to I'll give a brief introduction to the proof. The first step is to reduce the nonlinear PD problem with Fourier expansion to the following nonlinear system of infinite curved ordinary differential equations with this correct convolution of a high dimension and c as p with respect to n. P with respect to n, and it is defined by the following formula. And that is C as P T n equals to the production of C T n G with G from 1 to P and then some over and then some under the condition N1 plus N two plus and so on plus M P equals N Notice that this equation is a type of infinite dimensional ordinary differential equations with this correct convolution of high dimension. And it is impossible to solve it directly. Here we use its integral form and define the peaker circuits to approximate the solution. This is the volume picker iteration. Firstly, by choosing the solution to the linear equation as the initial gauge C0. And then define CK successively by netting the following formula. The left is CK and the right is similar to the integral form of the infinite. The infinite dimensional ordinary differential equations just by just by changing C appearing in the description convolution term into C sub k minus 1. And this definition is for all k greater than or equal to 1. Next, notice that CK minus C But Ck minus C 0 can be viewed as a multilinear form of C sub k minus 1. Okay. Hence, C sub k minus C 0 is indeed a multilinear form of the initial Fourier date. That is C sub K minus C 0 has a continuing product form C times D C. Uh, C times D, E to C C times C, and so on. And due to the difficulty of calculating the discrete convolution of a high dimension, we cannot control the iteration process effectively. By applying a combinatorial analysis method, we obtain the local result. This method makes the picker circuits into the following combinatorial tree form. Tree form labeled by number five. Here, these abstract symbols t n f i and c are defined inductive. With the help of the combinatorial form along with the external decay condition and by induction, we can prove that the picker sequence is experimental decay with the Experimental decay with the decay rates kappa over 2. This is uniform in time belonging to this Lucre interval. That is the following name. Regarding the proof of this neighbor, many complicated estimates should be made due to the complicated combinatorial indices generalized by the nonlinear R V and we meet them here. And we are meeting them here. If you are interested in them, you can find them in Axie. This is the Axial number. Next, by the exponential decay property of the P curves circuits, we can prove that it is a Cauchy circuit with the following estimates. If T belongs to this local interval and we have the modulo of And we have the modulus of C K plus the big star minus C sub k is less than or equal to the right. And this is uniformly for the big star. Furthermore, by some standard arguments, we can obtain the local existence results. In addition, the solution we construct is unique and is in the classical sense. Thanks to the Gaspar exponential decay property. Okay, let's make a summary for my talk. Firstly, we obtain the Mukoexistence and the uniqueness of spatial inquiry periodic solutions to the generalized KDV equation under the exponential decay condition with respect to the model of an or it can be viewed as. Or it can be viewed as a quasi-periodic quality of Chier theorem for generalized KDV equation. Next, the solution we consider are non-periodic with respect to space compared with the specially periodic solutions. And they don't decay to zero with respect to the space compared with the fast decay at infinity case. And certainly, the setting we are in is non-compact real line. This is from one paper. Generally speaking, due to the non-compact setting, there are very few known results on space quietly purely solutions to the nonlinear partial fraction equations. Firstly, the main difficulty we encounter is the operation of We encounter is the operation of a high-dimensional discrete convolution together with the communicative combinatorial indices. The remaining global problem is much more difficult and it might need the integrability of the generalized KDVP and some deep spectral analysis. Compare Dynamic and Goldstein's paper. The next one is that our method works for arbitrary natural number P. Okay, that's all my report. Thanks for your attention. Questions? And let's say let's thank Kei again and one more time. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And Fan, I have you. So, Fan? Fan, Fan Yang? She's on Zoom. Yes, that's what I'm asking. Where is she? She's on Zoom, but she's middle of the middle. Hello, I'm here. Yes, you can start your screen. We're doing this five-minute break, and in five minutes, we will start as you go. In the meantime, you can start your screen and check that everything is okay. Okay, thank you.
