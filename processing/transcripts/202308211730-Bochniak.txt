We started a few years ago with my ex-supervisor Andr√© Shitas and this about how to get certain modified gravity theories from the principles of spectral geometry. So let me motivate the thing with it. So we know that generality That generality can be encoded or derived from the action principle. And also, we know that certain particle physics like standard model also can be described or derived using the test based on non-computer geometry. But not only standard model, but also its certainization. So maybe we can also have Maybe we can also have some way of generalized version of generativity using this spectral method. So, not only going beyond plant and model particle flux, but also going beyond the relativity the action tensor. So, that's the idea. So, let me first summarize what it is about, what the spectral methods are. So, everything will be about observation. Everything will be about observation. I call this observation the theory: that if you have some anti-regular Riemannian manifold, then you can encode the geometry of this fault in certain algebraic data called the spectral triple. So immigrant manifold of a spin star with certain additional object adds to this object, you can get the Get the algebra of functions on this manifold. Then you have a Hilbert space of square integrable spinners. And on those spinels, you have a well-defined Dirac operator. And turns out, as it was shown, that under certain regularity conditions on commutative of this form, you can reconstruct the geometric manifold. Okay, so that's the idea. The idea, and you can talk about more generic when the others are commutative, and you can call corresponding spaces non-commutative spaces. But what we are really doing here, we are really only about the non-commutative spaces. So we have a system of algebra, a Hilbert space on which this is represented, and there is an operator which is acting in the Hilbert space, and there's a plenty of components. Space, and there's a plenty of compatibility conditions. I don't want to mention them here. Having those data, the idea we are talking about third-dimensional geometry, non-quintive geometry. Okay. But how to get out of this? So we know that, for example, the Eisenhower gravity is geometry. And where the geometry in this formulation. So this is a natural way. This is a natural way of associating certain functional spectral data to this spectral triple and out of functional you can get the effective action but this criteria you would like to have so roughly speak the idea having a spectral triple you are constructing object of this form so here So here lambda is some effective energy scale. f is a some function which plays the smooth version of a hydristic unit interval. So on the left hand side, I'm speaking count eigenvalues of the operator which are smaller than lambda. So the idea. This is some spectral information which you can get from the triple. And then you can And then you can this object. And for example, you can ask about the expansion when lambda goes to infinity. And you can look at the leading terms of this expansion. And if you apply the construction to the canonical spectrum, the one associated with the standard Liamian manifold, the leading terms will represent the Hilbert-Einstein action plus cosmological term. Okay, so in this sense, the effective action is an Effective action is encoded in the data. So now you can ask about other spectral triples and ask if you can derive certain actions out of those spectral triples. And this idea was extensively studied in particle physics, where models called almost quantitative geometries were considered. And in that case, people were able to derive the different versions of models going beyond the standard model. On the standard model, and all the families of Young Niels type TOS. So you can get those TOS encoded in a certain spectral typos. So what does the Army's commutative geometry? So this is motivated by Caroza Klein, but with some subtle modification, instead of taking the circle, you are taking the finite space. So you can take the space of endpoints, for example. And in this case, the algebra is just the tensor product of a Just the tensor product of smooth functions times n copy of complex numbers. So, this is something which, happily speaking, represents the space which is the n copies of the original manifold M. And you can, of course, take additional algebra of instead of Cn, you can take any finite dimensional sister algebra, which is just the direct sum of matrix algebra, and you can consider algebra of And you can consider algebra of this form. So the tensor product of smooth functions times some finite dimensional sitter algebra. Okay. And having the algebra, you can ask what is the natural Hilbert space in which you can represent this algebra. So the standard choice is just the tensor product of the Hilbert space you had for the canonical spectrum for the manifold. So just the square integer spinners times some finite-dimensional Hilbert space. And if And if the original spectral triple was even, meaning that there was some natural grading, then you can also try to mimic this grading on the product structure, the same for the data structure and things like that. So all the structures you had before taking the product, under the standard compatibility conditions, you can have those structures also on the product space. And in the same way, there's also a procedure how to get the Procedure: How to get the Dirac operator on the new space constructed out of the Dirac operator for the manifold, the canonical one, and some finite operator acting on the Hilbert space HF. And this is something we call the almost commutative geometry. So this is the canonical choice. And this choice actually was used in the particle physics to study the standard model and its possible extensions. In that case, the Dirac operator. Dirac operator, finite part of the Dirac operator, encode the cover couplings for the particles. So this is the standard almost commutative geometry. But can we go beyond this paradigm? So can we make something not almost commutative? So can we take something of non-product structure here? So let's first take the simplest possible case, n equal to. So just two copies of the same. n equal to so just two copies of the same manifold so the direct operator can be parametrized in in this nice form so this phi is some parameter here i don't need to specify what is at this moment so there is some parameter phi there is some gamma which is an operator and i would like to require that this operator has some properties like the gamma square is plus minus one but for a moment it's not so important but this is the most general structure i can have for the product geometry so there is a Have for the product geometry. So there is a diag operator for the manifold times identity. So this is the diagonal part, and there are those anti-diagonal parts which have this structure here. But why we need to assume that on the product, I'm taking the same matrix on the two copies. So let's now consider a situation where I have the two manifolds, M and M, but with different metrics. So let's say metric G here, metric H here. G here, metric H here. So the corresponding direct operator will, of course, depend on the choice of the metric. So now I will have some DG here and DH here. Okay? So this is like the very middle choice I can make, but it's still reasonable, geometry. So the resulting spectrum is still a spectrum, so it satisfies the axioms, but it's beyond almost commutativity. It's beyond almost commutativity. So, what we can get out of this construction. So, we had the two metrics, so maybe it is somehow related to biometric theory. So, that's the hope. So, let's try to check if we can get some interactions between the metrics, between those two metrics here, using the spectral method. So, let's try to compute the spectral action for this vertical tool and see what happens. So, the standard tool in four-dimension is To four dimensions is based on the Vojitsky Siddhu. And I will not discuss the technical details how to compute this, but I will give you like a practical basically how to do this for this case. So we start with the D-Rag operator D. We take the square, we compute the symbols of square. So this A0 is a part of the D square operator, which doesn't contain any derivative. A1 contains only first derivative. A1 contains only first derivatives, A2, only derivatives of order two. Now, using the pseudo-differential calculus, we compute the symbols of the inverse of this operator. They are quite complicated, but the computations are still doable. And it turns out that this formula containing the what is created here can be effaced using those symbols in this very simple way. So there is a concrete formula now we can use to compute. formula now we can use to compute the leading times of the action just knowing the symbols of the of the operator so that's the way we can compute and as i said if i take the the canonical spectator that gives me the uh hilbert einstein plus cosmological concept this is the the computation have to have to do so easy So easy to say, but the computations are not so easy actually, because that we have to compute a lot of integers of this form. And for generic choices of matrix, it is not doable. We have to simplification, see what is the structure. The simplest possible case to the simplest reasonable case is to take the FLW models, which is efficiently symmetric. Which is sufficiently symmetric. So, there is a hope, there will be other simplifications, but still, this model is physically reasonable. So, it's not oversimplified. So, let's try this. And the first case with trivial lapses was in total geometry was discussed in this paper by Andre. And then we generalized this to albitile choices of those metrics. We took the albity. The albutile w matrix with all possible choices for curvatures. The now is not assumed to be a constant like in the previous case. And we can run the machinery and compute the direction. So it took some time, but it can be done. So this is the answer. So we see that there are two terms, which looks like two copies of Hilbert Einstein class cosmological constant. But Einstein plus magical constant for the two metrics, and there is some well-known severe interaction term between two metrics. And here R is, of course, the H scar. And this parameter kappa is something that is determined by the choice you can make on this level, that gamma square is plus minus identity. And A1 and A1D1 are, of course, the parameters. So, index one means the first matrix, index two means the matrix H in this and this parameterization. So, we have the action. So, now the next step is to study this action, what this complication interaction means. So, first common is that this is purely Euclidean. The derivation of the expected action based on Yeah, the computational spectral action based on the asymptotic expansion is pretty Euclidean, so we have to make a figuration to have a Raylanc formulation. Then we can couple this to a, since this is an effective model, you can couple this to a state energy tensor to study the equation of motions. And in particular, we can study the stability of the classical solutions. So we did the test for like six or eight. I don't know, I know exactly the number of cases with all possible like matter-dominated. Like matter-dominated, energy-dominated cases. And in each of the scenarios, there's a range of parameters for which the classical solutions are stable. So it's not completely strange. I mean, this model has some potential to be reasonable. So, but as I said, this model has this feature that it involves two metrics. So the question is: how is this model related to the standard biometric theory? So, first, we observe that if we take those parameters x and y to be the ratios of b and a respectively, then the potential term simplifies. It's just a rational function in those x and y. And it has this nice property that if I exchange the role of x and y, we have this kind of symmetry, which was also present to biometrics. Which was also present in the biometric theory. And moreover, the potential depends only through the eigenvalues of this matrix, which is the square root of H inverse G. So this is something which we saw before in diametric theory. So this is a nice feature. But of course, we see that this is not the same potential because it's a rational function, not the polynomial. But the question is, maybe it is similar. Similar for some choices of metrics in some regions for some choice of parameters. So let's check how this model differs from biometric theory. So we started with the simplest possible case. So now we consider torus, where we have the metric, which is just a small collection of the mean cost, in this case, of course, Euclidean, because this is before the V rotation. Before the weak rotation. And we make the expansion in the parameter epsilon. So, this is the very beautiful computation. I will not go through the steps. I will just give you the answer. So, we expand everything here up to epsilon squared. The same thing for the standard magnetic theory, and we are comparing. But the answer is that already at this level, at the second level, the two models are completely. Second level, the two models are completely different, so we cannot make a matching at this level. So, there's a different model with a different potential, which is even not the same if I slightly modify the metric out of the Minkowski. So if I take small perturbation from Minkowski, the two models are different. So, that's the result. And even was, you know, even most. you know before even most terms if you take them metrics which are of those forms for example a a b b the so-called hobby metric then the potential 10 will contain the logarithmic 10 but still this potential will have this property that if i exchange the log of x and y i have this the same symmetry as i showed you before so the symmetry seems to be similar the properties of the potential are similar in a sense but this can produce This can produce more complicated potentials. Okay. But if this is not biometric theory, so how we can interpret this model? So you can look at this as a two interacting four-dimensional brains in this case, because we're working dimension full. But since this is a, I mean, in this picture, we have a dimensional photo. We have a dimension photo, so we have a base, but now you can ask the question: what happened in other dimensions? Right? So, if it was too complicated to compute the full action in dimension four, maybe it would be easy in dimension two. And then, by analogy of this interaction here, this should produce something like an effective interaction between two strings. That's the idea. But is the two-dimensional situation really simple? The answer is not necessary because in dimension two, we cannot use Vojitsky as you do. We have to use the spectra zeta function to perform the computations, and we have to connect the expansion of a spectral action in terms of spectra zeta function to the symbols of the z-squared operator. So it was much more involved, but fortunately, it is known how to do this. So we can use the known results from the literature, and then we can perform the computation. We can perform the computations. So, let me start with a now two-dimensional case. I have two metrics G and H. I use the Swibe formulation and slide because we have only two elements. Now, I can compute the Dirac operator for the two matrix. And on the double geometry, I have the form of the Dirac operator parametrized by those two matrices. So, this capital A is just a matrix consisting of the 5 by 5. Consistent of the swipe for the two metrics G and H. And this F is as was before. And let me make a comment that if I will use the same manifold with the same metric, then this F would correspond to something that is known as a Higgs field in particle physics. If you are doing the condot theory, so then actually this thing here. This thing here represents something or corresponds to something that produces the Higgs field after computing the spectral act in particle physics. So, here, effectively, we would have something that has a two matrix interacting to, in a sense, a Higgs field, Higgs-like field, you should call it. So, let's try to compute the interaction for this situation. And here again, I made the choice that, okay. made the choice that okay sigma square can be plus minus one and sigma is plus minus sigma three so i have additional parameters and i have some freedom to to manipulate okay but let's do the computation for this case so the symbols are now more complicated in particular the symbol of the inverse of d square now involved this addition at plus one here which as a result of Here, which is a result of using the spectral zeta function, not the Vojitsky residue. But fortunately, the computation can be made exactly for any choice of a metrics. I don't need to restrict myself to like a specific class of metrics like before. Here, I can do the computation in a full group. So, I can take any possible swipeines, not necessarily, okay, swi-bines, not metrics, and then I can perform the computations. So, I have the three times, which then Which then gives me the final answer for the actions. I have to just sum up all of them to get the final action. Okay, so these two terms are quite easy. This one looks more complicated, but the integral can be done in this case. And to do this integral, I have to slightly change my variables. My variables. So I had the matrices K and L, which were corresponding to the fibers I had. Now I can consider this matrix W, which I construct out of K and L, and the matrix S, which is a orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes this change expression here. And in this parameterization, the last time here, the whole integral can be computed easily. Can be computed easily and has it has this nice fold. Now, since biometric theories, we observe that what is important is the matrix constructed out of two metrics, G and H inverse. So let's do similar thing here. So let's introduce this X to be L K inverse. Now, as I said, L and K are formed out of fibers. So in terms of So in terms of this matrix x, the potential has this nice, nice form. And fortunately, this matrix here is positive and is 2 by 2. And it is fortunately known what is the square root of this matrix, what is the unique square root for this matrix. You can write explicitly the form of this square root in terms of the invariance of the matrix. And using that, you can simplify the expression for this term v1. So you get. V1. So you get this answer here. And first observation is that if the terminal of x was negative, then this term, of course, vanishes because of the sign here. But if it is positive, we have this nice compact form. And okay, just one comment that the positivity of this. Common that the positivity of this means that both of the matrix k and are either positive or negative. So, this is a nice constraint. So, now we had the expression in terms of swipe lines, but our goal, of course, is to have an expression in terms of metrics. That would be the nice way of representing things. So, let's try to see if you can write unique. See if you can write uniquely this potential in terms of the matrix. So let's parameterize the matrix K in this, the matrix K in this way. So some choice of parameters. Then the corresponding matrix G is of this form. And then you see that this determinant of X, which appeared on the previous slide, is nothing else than the determinant of G H inverse. Determinant of K is the determinant of G inverse. And the only G inverse. And the only abstraction to get like a compact formula for this intensive matrix comes from those two terms: tase of x and ts of x transpose x. So in general, we cannot write this in terms of matrix only. So there's an interaction between 5 binds. And you can interpret this like two strings, which interact through those 5 binds by. Bias by the Higgs-like field, which originates from this spectral construction. So it's not exactly interaction in terms of matrix, it's interaction in terms of zwi binds. And the use of sweibins is quite natural because we had a spin structure of the manifold. So the Direct operator is naturally expressed in terms of a Zwi bind, not in terms of a metric, actually. So the fact that we obtain something that is not Obtain something that is not usually described in terms of matrix, but in terms of swipe binds, it's not so surprising, actually. Okay, but of course, in certain cases, we can make some simplifications, like if I take the diagonal case, then of course everything is very simple. And the final expression for the interaction is this one. So again, you see that you have this factor. You have this factorization that you can write the potential as a determinant of one matrix, then some function depending on the square root of this combination. It has the symmetry that if I exchange the matrix, here will be determinant of G, here will be G H inverse, sorry, G inverse H. And in this case, this potential V has this nice form, which is just a simple rational function xy over x plus y. Okay. Export Y. Okay. So I think that's all I have about this construction. So we see that some modifications of spectral models based on non-commutative geometry, like the modifications of almost commutative structure that allowed for choosing two different metrics on the two copies of manifolds can produce some modification. Can produce some modified gravity models. Those models have some features which are similar to the ones known from biometric theory. And it suggests that maybe if we can modify something else in this construction, we can produce other models. So we would like to do this in the future, of course. But at this moment, this is what we have our model. So we know that modifying the almost commutative paradigm, we can. Commutative paradigm, we can do something beyond GL, and this is the hope that maybe we can also connect this with the standard model and we can have a standard model on top of the modified gravity model, which is the next step. But for the moment, this is what we have about this. So, thank you. Surprising volumination on the previous one questions from the On the previous one, questions from the Samia what's the ghost situation or so you left you have ghosts in the theory? Yes, we didn't check explicitly what are the conditions to do not have ghosts, yes, you might have problems. Yes, we. Yes, we can have questions. Okay. Can you protect them? Not in this construction. But okay. There are other. Um, there are other possible modifications you can do, but it's not like just this state for a while, non-product like extension. So, uh, the problem with the mass was in other places, it's not not this change of the expected title. So, probably I missed what I would see the top stream. Oh, because uh effectively we have a Effectively, we have a two-dimensional manifolds which interact in the Euclidean picture. So, if I take the fig rotation, it's like a thing one plus one. This is an analogy, it's an analogy because in dimension four, it looks like interaction between brains. So, if I now use this analogy in dimension two, this seems like having two one plus one things. For the case of two dimensions, yes, yes, yes. Okay, so it's effectively this one: S is this k times, oh, L times K inverse, and K is the matrix. And k is the matrix for the first Hillbind, and L for the second one, it's uh it's here. So, this is K, this is L. There are matrices whose entries are field binds. Fractional
