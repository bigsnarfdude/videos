Okay, so I will talk about complex analysis approach to nano-sized reinforcements in elastic materials and motivation as usually. So motivation comes from advancement in nanoscience, nanomaterials. So graphene, for instance, everybody heard that word. You can surprisingly buy this stuff right now. So it's not even that. Right now, so it's not even that expensive, so you can buy some under $100, and it has very interesting properties. Um, due to so it has very interesting properties in many ways, and adding this material to metrics of, for instance, epoxy produces materials, new materials, composites with also new interesting properties. At the same time, Properties. At the same time, it is known that if our reinforcements become smaller, then our materials exhibit size dependency. So non-decomposites, composites with smaller characteristic size have different properties than you would expect from the composites which have macro reinforcements. Another possible motivation with this. The possible motivation for this research comes from biomembranes, so layers of cells which also exhibit their own different properties, such as bending rigidity, resistance to stress, restraint, things like that. But in general, again, this research can be applied to any surface-reinforced solids. So if you want to have a kind of artificially surface-reinforced solid Artificially surface-reinforced soil, it's when you can do this type of work. Okay, now the atomistic structure of material changes near surfaces and interfaces. In particular, you can have kind of this type of irregularities in the material where your atoms rearrange from the way the atoms are arranged in the bulk. And these surface and interfaces are conjectured to. Are conjectured to be the reason why nanocomposites exhibit different properties, amplified properties. So, typical features of nanocomposites is small characteristic size. So, we are talking about characteristic length between 1 and 1000 nanometers. And again, I'm pushing it on both ends. So, one nanometer, it's close to interatomic distance at that point. And you continue hypothesis, might not be true. Hypothesis might not be true, and 1000 nanometers is almost macro scale, so you might not see those properties I'm going to talk about at those scales. So somewhere in between this level. Now, nanocomposites also have high surface to volume ratios. So we have high amount of those interfaces inside of a composite. And as a result, many atoms reside on the surface and surface. Deside on the surface and surfaces rearrange, and they can no longer be ignored in modeling of your material like we do at macroscope. Now, here, what I will be talking about here is continuum-based approach to modeling surfaces. Even fairly small materials still have large number of atoms, so atomistic modeling is computationally expensive. So, what would be nice to do? So, what would be nice to do is again use the continuum-based approach, which is computationally a lot cheaper and maybe cleaner in some way. Okay, so there are some established theories in this area. In particular, one of the very celebrated models is Gurton-Murdock model. It goes back to 1975-1977. There is a lot of research in this area. It was very difficult to track. It was very difficult to track one amount of research, which is over there. So, in this area, the surface is regarded as a thin elastic membrane, perfectly bonded to a bulk solid, membrane of negligible neural thickness. But this membrane resists to stretching. It may have pre-strain, but it doesn't have bending resistance. So, in 1997-1999, In 1997, 1999, 12 famous scientists, Stagman and Dogdon, noticed that Gurton-Nordic theory actually cannot support compressive stress state. And that was one of the actually reasons for development of the theory. So we decided to improve on the Gurdjan-Nordek theory by adding bending rigidity in the model. So in the model, again, we have a thin, negligibly thin layer. A negligible lithium layer on the surface which resists to stretching, bending, and also has pre-stress. So, however, we theory is a more complex theory, and I will show you boundary conditions in a second, and you will agree with me, but it is just those are more complex. So, for a while, even though again it was proposed in 1997-1999, this theory was mostly ignored and there was not much. And there was not much work going in that area. That changed, and for a while, I tried to track research literature dedicated to stagmanogden model. And I think I gave up officially at this point of trying to track it. So I will mention just first two papers which started here. And the first paper is probably Remyev and Drebedev. That's the first paper I'm aware about. That's the first paper I'm aware about. That was a very interesting paper. That this is the paper which spurred my personal interest in this area. So, what we did is we worked with Flagman-Ogden theory and we derived boundary conditions. And we wrote those conditions in easy to use form for practitioners. And we also proved existence and uniqueness, some existence and uniqueness theorems for weak solutions in certain. Weak solutions in certain energy spaces. So, those are not standard Sobolev spaces because you need higher regularity on the boundary to have kind of this stretching and bending over there. And again, shameless plug-in. I think my paper was the second which kind of started. And that was a paper from about straight mixed mode fracture, plain mixed mode fracture. So I came to this area from fracture theory, and I was interested in a very And I was interested in a very kind of specific part, fracture theory. I was interested in fracture fields, stress and strain fields, which are bounded at the crack tips. And it turns out that if you take into account this stretching and bending resistance, you might obtain fractured fields which are bounded at the crack tips, which is not a classical result at all. So mathematically, Gurden Martika. Mathematically, Gurton-Martek and Stagmonogen surface energy models generate kind of higher-order boundary conditions, unusual boundary conditions for the problems. And that is very different from the standard kind of boundary value PDE type problems. Okay, so the main idea is relatively simple. So we have an object, omega, solid, and on a part of this boundary, so it can be whole boundary, it can be just part. So, it can be whole boundary, it can be just part of a boundary. This object has surface energy. So, total elastic energy functional is written in this way. So, this would be kind of classical part, bulk part. But on top of that, we also have this surface energy. And this is the surface energy is what changes your boundary value problems. Now, Now, so surface energy, so this is a very general theorem in general. It doesn't say that you have to have a linear elastic object here. It doesn't say what type of surface energy you have to apply. Of course, it has to apply to some general properties. If you want uniqueness of solutions, for instance, or for instance, frame independence. Or, for instance, frame independence. So, there are some considerations which you can violate over there, but in general, it's fairly general. So, in this case, I will be looking at linearly elastic isotropic solids. So, my W is fairly simple. And I will take my surface energy in this form. So, actually, go back. So, epsilon S here is the surface. Epsilon S here is the surface strain, projection of a strain tensor on the surface, and cut by S is so-called curvature tensor. So, epsilon S is mostly responsible for the dependence on stretch and for pre-strain parts of this theory, while kappa S is the one which gives you bending resistance. Now, if we start with this functional, we apply external forces. We apply external forces. We do kind of standard integration by parts, applying divergence theorem, surface divergence theorem. You have to do it several times here. What you will end up with is you will end up with kind of standard governing equations in the bulk. And again, I have isotropic linear elastic material. So this is my constitutive equation here. And on the boundary, it will obtain equations of this type. Now, Type. Now, if we forget about this contribution, Ts, which is a contribution of surface energy to your material, then what you get is just essential traction condition, auto standard traction condition from surface elasticity. But if you take into account surface energy, then you get this component here, which produces different type of equation. Now, another thing which you obtain also from variation. Which you obtain also from variational formulation actual tip conditions, which is something which is not often mentioned, actually, in the research area, in this research area. So, if your material surface has a tip, then on that tip you will have conditions. So, again, this is kind of not classical results. We don't really look at the tip of the surface in classical inelasticity. But in general, these tip conditions also need to be satisfied if you want to have a stationary point of your functional. Stationary point of your function. Okay, so if we continue on and we look at this condition, so what is Ts here? So Ts for Steigman-Ogden model, for full steigman-Ogden model, looks like this. So there are lots of terms here. So NASA S here is a surface gradient, so projection of your gradient on the surface. T here is a cold surface stress answer. So it's given in this form. So it's given in this form. It depends on three constants. So sigma zero is your prestrain, mu zero and lambda zero are lambda constants view surface. This is a non-symmetric tensor in general because of this component here. So you have sigma zero nabla s u, which gives you non-symmetric tensor actually. M is so-called couple stress tensor. And again, it depends on that kappa s. On that, kappa s and kappa s is this thing, which depends on this thing. So there are lots of these gradients of surface gradients over there. So this produces very kind of high-order boundary conditions. Again, these are just jump subtractions on the surface, but they are related through this condition to the gradients of your displacements factor. So there is going to Spector. So there is kind of this complicated condition there, and surface energy is in general written in this way. So again, if you look here, there is pre-stress. When there is lambda 0, mu 0, which are lambda parameters, and then so these two are responsible for the stretch resistance. And when there is zeta and eta, which Zeta and eta, which characterize bending resistance of your surface. So there are, in general, five of these parameters in this energy. Now, tip conditions. So tip conditions also emerge from your variational formulation. They look like this. So nu here is the unit normal to the tip of your surface, such that it is perpendicular to the normal on the surface. So, you also need to satisfy these conditions. Alternatively, again, since it's a variational formulation, instead of these conditions, you can also look at these conditions where U is a displacement, so U is zero on the surface, or this must be zero on the surface. So, kind of this type of interplay. And depending on what kind of problem you study, one of those conditions might be more reasonable to take one of the other ones. might be more reasonable to take on the other one. So for instance, if there is no restrictions of how your surface moves, then this is probably what you want. At the same time, in fracture problems where you want your crack to actually close, you might want... Okay, I switched. I'm sorry. You might actually want to take these conditions instead. And the interesting part about fracture problems is taking into account these conditions. Problems is taken into account these conditions actually produces move stress and strain fields. So, okay, so now let me talk about actually the problem, which I'm a kind of toy problem which I'm studying here today. And that problem is for a semi-plane. So it's a plane problem, plane stress, plane strain. So we have this semi-plane, and on the boundary. My plane, and on the boundary, we have this little membrane material surface fitting. So that's the only part of the boundary which actually resists to stretch or bending. So the rest of the boundary is just, I assume, free stresses. So on the rest of the boundary, so there is no reinforcements of any type of weather. And this membrane is subjected to external force, P of X, which is given to me. And I want to solve. And I want to solve this problem. So, this is a static elasticity problem. Again, plane stress or plane strain. It depends on what kind of constant you want to take. And the displacement vector in this case was can be taken in this simplified form. I assume that uz perpendicular displacement is zero. My stresses are my displacements do not depend on z. So, this is kind of a simplification to two-dimensional problem. To two-dimensional problem. And now, if I again take this stress, a straight boundary correspondingly, my normal is constant on this boundary. And I take all this data which I have, and I go back and I plug it all the way over here. And that allows me to simplify my problem, my boundary condition. My boundary condition for this particular case, for straight case. And again, this is probably the simplest condition in steady monogen model you can possibly get. For axisymmetric problems, it looks more gnarly. For again, circular problems, it looks also correspondingly more difficult. So, this is the boundary condition which I obtain. And again, if you look at this boundary condition, you can see. If you look at this boundary condition, you can see what your tractions on this little membrane here are related to derivatives of your displacements. And again, they are related through these Lame constants here. For straight boundary plane strain problems, actually only this coefficient matches. So mu zero and lambda zero, they come in this form. And your high And your high, I think it should was it on the previous slide, and I'm sorry about that. We come in this form. Now, if I am looking at Guten-Nordec model, then this term here disappears. There is no band in ridiculity. So your problem is a little bit simpler. Your stresses depend only on the second derivatives of the strains. Otherwise, if you want to look at the full stagman-ogden model, then you get fourth derivative of your displacement here. Of your displacement here. So, and this is my boundary condition. Now, again, the rest of the boundary assume it's a free boundary, so I just put zero tractions on that boundary. And this is the type of problem which I want to solve. Now, since my surface actually has a tip, so I have actually two tips, negative A and A, then I need to take into account tip conditions. Again, there is no reason for me. Again, there is no reason for me in this particular case to fix, for instance, zero displacement, because why would it be zero on the boundary? So I'm taking kind of three tip conditions. So for plain case, those tip conditions, which I have shown you earlier, actually end up being three conditions at each tip. So I have total six for full Steinman-Ogden model. And when you look like this, now, if you look at this first condition, you can see that there is a kind of irregular. You can see that there is a kind of irregularity here. So, if we put stretch resistance to zero, but pre-stress is not zero, then this is not enforceable. So, there is some kind of inconsistency here for models where stretch resistance is zero but pre-strain is not zero, because this condition cannot be satisfied. In that case, you kind of have to counterbalance with pre-stress at the tip to actually have solution. At the tip, to actually have solutions. And this is what I call kind of compensated surface pre-stress. So essentially, I apply additional external force along those tips, kind of artificially balance that to have solutions. So there is this thing which again appears in some situations. So this is something which I need to kind of keep in mind for later. I will need those conditions. Now, Now, again, otherwise, this is a two-dimensional linear elasticity problem. I'm sure there are a bunch of people here who know exactly what to do with it. So I use A refunctions representation, which gives me a bi-harmonic equation, which I can then solve using Fourier transform since I have semi-plane. So I have this kind of representation. A and B are two unknown functions on my real axis, which depend on my boundary condition. Which depend on my boundary condition. So I need to fix one using my boundary condition. And of course, I can write a representation of stresses for these A and B. So these are my stresses. And I can do that for displacements as well. So these are my displacements. Again, I'm looking for solution bounded in the upper plane. So I have upper half plane. So I have this negative y absolute value of zeta. So now again, if you would be solving classical. If you would be solving a classical problem with not mixed conditions, what you would do is you just look at the boundary, substitute these representations on the boundary inverted Fourier transform, and obtain A and B. Now, my problem here is as so-called mixed conditions. So I have one type of condition on the segment negative A and another type of condition outside of that segment. So I cannot do it right away. And there are some different ways. There are some different ways of dealing with this in the literature. So, in particular, there is a method of dual equations, which is how people usually deal with this. I'm not going to be using that because I think I kind of find something which I like more than that. So, what I will do is I will kind of first study the classical problem. So, I assume that these kind of right-hand sides of my boundary. Hand sides of my boundary conditions are functions which I presume I know initially because I will need to go back and kind of fix them, make sure my conditions match. But I introduce these two functions g and h, which are exactly right-hand sides of my kind of stagman algorithm condition on negative a and a. And notice that I have three constants here: gamma one, gamma two, gamma three. Again, gamma one depends. Again, gamma 1 depends, characterizes stretch resistance, gamma 2 characterizes pre-stress, and gamma 3 characterizes bending. And those constants are important again for later. We will kind of show how your solution behaves. So if I kind of look at, introduce these unknowns, when my boundary condition becomes this. Now, this is a classical problem, right? So this is just a problem for semi-plane with some stresses. Plane with some stresses applied on the boundary, which you can solve using those integral representations. So you can go ahead and just substitute integral representations invert your Fourier transform, obtain A and B. And this is exactly what is done here. So those are my A and B functions. Now, again, I do not know exactly those functions because I have H and G over here. So I did not solve the problem yet. I did not solve the problem yet, but I simplified the problem. Why? Because this A and B allow me to satisfy without the conditions, those zero stress conditions outside exactly. So I don't have to worry about outside stress anymore. So I just have to deal with the segment itself, negative AA. And of course, on the segment negative AA, I have this kind of Have this kind of I need to balance my G and H with my stresses or displacements. Sorry, I think my vows rub on this microphone. And satisfy with conditions. I integrated those conditions because that is kind of results in nicer mathematical problem. And if I integrate with conditions, notice that I get two constants, C1 and C2. Constants, C1 and C2. And again, those constants will be important. I will keep careful track of them because, again, remember, I have tip conditions, which I still need to take care of. So I need something to satisfy those tip conditions. Now, if you look at these equations, what I can do is I can go back, substitute my integral representations for u, x, and uy in here, substitute my a and b from From here, through h and g again over here, and this will give me some kind of equation in terms of h and g and this equation I still need to work a little bit with that because I have this third derivative, which is in general kind of uncomfortable to work with. So, what I will do is I will treat this equation as an ordinary differential equation with respect. differential equation with respect to uy comma x so first derivative of x now if you look at this this you can look at this as a second order differential equation linear differential equation with respect to u y of x and of course you can solve that equation right that is an undergraduate ode class which we teach to our students solution of this equation will of course depend on Course, depends on what your constants are here. And depending on those constants, you will get kind of different classes of solutions. Now, again, it was a good idea to rescale. It was probably a good idea to rescale since the beginning, but for me, it's convenient to rescale at this point. So I rescale my unknowns g and little g and little h as capital G and capital H. And my X now is non-dimensional, so it's negative. dimensional so it's negative one lives on negative one one and they got rid of this a segment a and again a is usual nanometers we don't want to deal with nanometers so p is again known force so i will treat this as an ordinary differential equation and i will solve this equation and that allows me to kind of obtain a hierarchy of models which i have over here so again i can have complete stagmonogram model Complete stegmonogen model where all the coefficients are non-zero. There are actually two types of stagmonogdon here, depending on what kind of gamma two and gamma three you have. We have same sign or opposite sign, you get different solution to your ordinary differential equation. And then I have a variety of, again, models all the way to classic case where all the coefficients are zero. Now, two of these models, again, where you Where your stretch is zero, but pre-stress is not zero, are in general incompatible with your viva tip conditions. So again, I don't know what it means physically. I guess it's not reasonable to have pre-stress and not have stretch resistance. I don't know how it translates to me, but I don't know if it's correct. So now, mathematically, what happens is once we do... Is once we do that, we will obtain a system of two singular integral equations or a single singular integral equation. So it depends again if some of the coefficients are zero, then one of these functions might end up being zero, while for the other one you get single integral equation. In other cases, you actually get two intermingled system of two singular integral equations. And this is what the system looks like. And this is what the system looks like. So, this is the dominant part. So, you can see there are two equations, and these on the left are the dominant parts. And then there is a kind of a stuff on the right-hand side. So, the terms on the right-hand side are regular. So, you can have kind of regular kernels over here, and there is a kernel over here, which actually will this kernel include in general three integration constants, because again, remember. Constants, because again, remember, we are solving ordinary differential equations. When we are solving differential equations, we get integration constants. So, there is one over here, and there is actually three hidden over here, somewhere. Actually, over here, I think. So, again, if you look at this, there is a kernel here. So, what I will do now is I will do something which is called regularization by solving dominant equation. So, I will introduce. Equation. So I will introduce this new unknown, which is complex unknown, and I will multiply one of the equations by i, some of those equations together. And because you can see the coefficients are actually the same and we interplay nicely with each other, I actually end up with one single integral equation. So, very simple for the members of this audience, I'm sure. And this is kind of my own. Sure, and this is kind of my only claim to Riemann Hilbert in this talk. Because here, to solve this equation, you solve a little tiny, very tiny, not unlike many of you did, small Riemann-Hilbert problem. But solving this equation allows us to regularize this system, I reduce it to a system of two Fred Holm equations of second kind. And I get asked from time to time. I get asked from time to time why I am doing all this and why am I interested in actually obtaining this regularized system. And a lot of that has to do with counting the number of degrees of freedom in the system. Because again, remember, I have these tip conditions which I need to satisfy. And I need to actually ensure that I can satisfy those conditions. And also the uniqueness of the solution. Now, if I solve this equation in the most general class with singularities at the ends, then that gives me true. Ven's when that gives me two real constants. So, what I will get in general is if I'm doing the general dealing with general stagmology model, then I will get six real constants. And again, remember, I have six tip conditions. That is very nice. And if I'm working with Gurtzen-Murdek model, when I get four conditions, and for Gurtz-Murdek, I actually will have 40 conditions, not six. So, this kind of perfectly balances itself in my understanding. Itself in my understanding and allows me to kind of make sure that I can satisfy those conditions. Now, other interesting thing which happens here is this regularization allows me to characterize actual singularities of my solution. And of course, in this case, I will have classical singularity of order one-half, which many of you are familiar with. And also, I will have oscillating singularity with pure imaginary exponent IB, where beta depends actually on only. Where beta depends actually only on this coefficient in this, only on in this case. So, beta does not depend actually on surface parameters at all. Moreover, this is exactly the oscillating singularity which you get for rigid reinforcement. So, we recover the same oscillating singularity for rigid reinforcement here. So now this is kind of concludes my theoretical part. Kind of concludes my theoretical part of my solution. So at that point, once I know the number of constants and once I know the character of the solution, I just solve this equation, this system numerically at that point using Chebyshev polynomials. And I will talk about that. Now, a little kind of generalization of this. So this is my more new research. It's a New research. It's actually, I just got had the paper accepted in SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics just last week. So now I can mention this as well. So generalization of this is again for interface inclusion. So in this case, we have two semi-planes again, and we have this membrane on the boundary. And we can solve this problem as well. It is somewhat more technical, of course, because you have more parameters, you have more unknowns. Unknowns to solve, but you can do it mostly kind of in a similar way. And again, there are some interesting things which happen here. In particular, so when I started this problem, I hope that maybe I can get metrics Riemann-Hilbert problem out of it, just for beauty's sake. But unfortunately, no, I still end up with scalaring Riemann-Hilbert problem over there, so it's simpler one. Hilbert problem of awaits, it's simpler than that. Again, I get a selecting singularities, which in this case depend on both mu's and mu's and kind of interplay of parameters. And again, those are exact oscillating singularities which obtain, were obtained by for rigid inclusion by, I think, Ballerini. So it matches exactly kind of the rigid singularity isolated. Rigid singularity isolating results. There are some classic kind of particular cases for these problems. In particular, if this plane is absent, and I'm supposed to get my problem for semi-plane, single semi-plane, and I do recover that. If both of the planes are the same, then I'm supposed to get these results obtained by Simonomogievsky-Schillinger for membrane in web. For membrane in the plane, and I do get those results as well. Moreover, this case, when both planes are the same, is the only case when my system of single integral equations actually splits up into two separate single integral equations. So, in all other cases, I get actual system with intertwined unknowns. Okay, now numerical scheme. So, numerical scheme is fairly straightforward. So, I'm Straightforward. So I'm using Chebushov polynomial approximations. So I take these Chebushov polynomials. I build in my square root singularity in my approximations, so I don't have to deal with that. I use kind of orthogonality of polynomials and also this relationship for single integral, plug it all in into my system of single integral equations, use orthogonality, obtain value. User functionality, obtain a very nicely behaved system of linear algebraic equations, which of course I can solve. That system is pretty good. It has moderate condition numbers. Condition numbers don't grow too much. Approximations converge fairly fast. In many cases, you don't need more than 50 polynomials to obtain to see no difference essentially in your results. And that allows me to compute. And that allows me to compute all the stresses and strains in the system, whatever I want. Now, some of the interesting results. So some of those results are specific to this problem. Some of the results are general for the problems with segment optimum energy. Have been obtained in other problems as well. So, this is a comparison of stresses. So, sigma by y. Stresses so sigma yy normalized stress on the membrane for several cases. So, again, you have classic case. Then we can have, we also have results obtained by Lee and all in 2020. So, that is a result for a semi-plane covered by the membrane completely. And so, those are my comparisons, and when there are my results for Gutenberg, And when there are my results for Gutenberg and Stagman Ogden, and you can see that they are fairly close together. Those are different problems, so you shouldn't expect them to be to match exactly. The most kind of different result is this result by Li, which is Tegmanogdon model, but again, that is for the whole plane. So whole planes covered by the membrane. But otherwise, they match pretty well. Pretty well. Now, some of the typical things which are studied in this area are, of course, the influence of parameters on your model. And surface pre-stress is a very interesting thing. It's always kind of not always clear. So, depending on what kind of problem you study, it seems to produce different effects. So, in this case, surface pre-stress does have. Surface pre-stress does have quite significant role in the results, but it mostly influences the results through the tip conditions. So once you compensate that surface pre-stress on a boundary, on the tips, suddenly it actually does not play that much of a role. So it comes through the tips here. And if you do have it on the tips, If you do have it on the chips, then your results vary quite a bit, depending on what your sigma zero is. Another interesting thing is bending resistance. And again, bending resistance is a characteristic of Stagman-Ogden model. So, and it is kind of high-order effect in many ways. So, it shows up mostly when your characteristic scale is very small. So, if you A. So if your A is below 10 nanometers, then you will see stagman octane model. If your A is above, say, 50, you will not see stagmanocton anymore. So Gorton order is sufficient in those scales. And this is kind of my general conclusion based on studying many problems with this theory that it comes into effect at very small scales. And this is true here as well. And this is true here as well. So, again, if your A is relatively small, then you can see this banding effect. Now, other interesting thing in this type of research in general is size dependency. So, again, in classical inelasticity, and I think I told this many times to this audience, you do not see size dependency. It does not exist there, but introduction of But introducing of surface energy, introduction of surface energy results in size dependency of your solutions, which comes pro again through certain three constants, which I will show a little bit later on my conclusions. And again, so as your A changes, your solution changes, you again, it does not change necessary that much, unless you get to the very, very small scales when the surface energy jumps. The surface energy jumps. So if your size is kind of moderate, then there is some size dependency, but it's not super pronounced. Okay, so and I am running ahead of time. So some conclusions. So again, size effect, which I just mentioned. In this area, we have size effect. The size effect comes from three constants. So this is kind of a general situation. So, this is kind of a general situation for many, many problems I studied in this area. So, you kind of arrive at these three constants in your equations, which give you size effect. And again, you can see what there is an interplay between your surface parameters, your bulk parameters, and your size scale in here. And these surface parameters have been measured. So, again, there is some range where people. Range where people believe these parameters lie. And again, if we kind of put all these together, we can see that these coefficients, they are noticeable when your A is measured in nanometers. So that's when these coefficients are significant enough to be kind of taken into account. Now, Gorton-Murdock, so gamma 1 and gamma 2 again, Gorton-Murdock parameters, and gamma 3 is the one which is for stagman ogden. Is the one which is for stagmonogen, and you can see that there is a cubed here, so this is a lot more dependent on your size scale, but at the same time, this is a lot smaller here. So, this parameter it comes into play at the very small scales, but when it does, the effect is quite pronounced. So, now another interesting thing in this problem is what we Problem is that we do get different single behavior at the tips, and again, that depends on the difference between solving system of single integral equation and solving single integral equation. So, single integral equation is essentially just Cauchy kernel type of equation. So, if you invert Cauchy kernel, you don't get oscillating singularities. So, your solutions for these simplified models actually do not get. Models actually do not get these oscillator singularities and just have square root singularities. So, there is a difference in how your solution behaves at the end. Now, presence of extra degrees of freedom, so these integration constants, may actually produce smoother fields. So, it does not happen in this particular problem, which I present today, but it does happen for cracks. So, if you look at the fracture problems, then you can have this. Then you can have these other conditions which are cusp conditions. You can have smooth closure of a crack, and that results in smooth stress and strain fields without square root singularity in many cases. And again, this, which I don't know quite how to explain from a physical viewpoint, but some simplified models are incompatible with free-tip conditions. So you need to do something to balance. So, you need to do something to balance that pre-stress on the boundary. Okay, and some future studies. So, there are some studies here which are even forthcoming already out, just out there. So, there are some thin reinforcements of non-straight shape. There are very few results, despite abundance of results in this area. There are few results actually for regular shapes. So, again, if it's not circular, if it's not spherical, if it's not straight, those conditions are a lot harder to. Those conditions are a lot harder to handle, and there are not many results at all. I would say there are none outside of these kind of classical shapes. So, behavior of a material on the boundary of two contrasting materials, so interface behavior, again, that one slide I showed to you, it was accepted a week ago, so it will be out very soon. Multiple finger enforcements again, there are some results, so again, there are some. Results. So, again, there are some results which available, which Sonia and her student Patil did, and for multiple fin reinforcements. And there are also our results for circular reinforcements with Dr. Miguelskaya and Dr. Han, who has been here earlier this week. But again, there are not too many, actually. And there are many, many, many other problems in this area. Again, there are many. In this area, again, there are many results which you would kind of expect to have, but they are not available yet. So, there is no results in the literature. So, again, if any of you wants to collaborate on the problems, I will be very happy to. Okay, thank you very much and thank you.
