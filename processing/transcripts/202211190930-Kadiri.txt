All right. Okay. Good morning, everyone. What are you doing? Or you did the CRG. Okay, so last in November 2021, the CRG was approved by PIMS. And as Alia mentioned, there's three themes in this CRG. And we're going to just tell you a little bit about what we plan to do with this CRG. Okay, so the print. Okay, so the principal investigators of the CRG are myself, Habiba, Alia, and Greg. Currently, there's three postdocs working on the projects from the CRG who are all here. So Kubra Benli, Fatma, Dieczak, Erton Elma. Fatma is a PIMS CRG postdoc. So she was hired with the money from this grant. And Kubra is a PIMS postdoc. Kubra is a PIMS postdoc at Lethbridge, and Ayrton is also a postdoc at the University of Lethbridge. Okay, so we have a website for our collaborative research group. So if you want to get information about this CRG, you can go to this site right here. Every now and then we send out messages about the group, and there's a form button there. You can click on the form button and you can subscribe. Form button, and you can subscribe to our email list. And on the side of the website, there's a bunch of tabs about various events we have. So the weekly seminar, and then some other workshops like this workshop, moments of L functions workshop. All right, so here's the three themes of this clever research group. So we wanted to focus on L functions and automorphic forms. L-functions on automorphic forms. And then, very broadly, the topics we want to study are moments and zeros of L-functions, mean values of long Dirichlet polynomials, multiple Dirichlet series, spectral theory of automotive forms around a matrix theory. So that's one topic. Another topic is about explicit results about L-functions and primes. So that involves bounds for primes and primes in number fields, like Chevatarov's density theorem. Of Chevataro's density theorem, zero-free regions, during Halburn phenomena, which is zero repulsion, zero density results, balance for the least prime in various sets. Another thing we want to explore is the online calculator that Aviva and Andrew Fiore have built, which does calculations of like prime counting functions. Another thing we want to look at is the TME. Another thing we want to look at is the TMEEMT project of Olivia Ramaray. Maybe perhaps expand that. We like to look at applications from exposed number theory to diaphantine approximation and cryptography. And the last major theme in the DRG is comparative prime number theory. So there's this thing called Chevyshev's bias. So we like to look at this. So this is the notion that there's more Notion that there's more. You can when you look at pi of x and li of x, very often pi of x is less than li of x. So that's that's sort of an idea behind Chebyshev's bias. So we want to look at this. Look at prime number races where you compare primes like between two congruence classes, sign changes of prime counting functions. A major question in the field is Montgomery's conjecture, which is what's the size of the error from the prime. The size of the error from the prime number theorem. And this has been open for a very long time. So that's something we'd like to explore with something called the quantitative LI conjecture. But LI conjecture states that the zero demand data function, the positive ordinates, are linearly independent over the rationals. Those are the major themes. When we applied to PMs for this research grant, This research grant, this was a list of events we sent to the, we told them we were going to do. And we're going to talk about some of these things right now. So major scientific events are in the first three rows. So we already had a workshop at UMBC last July. There's going to be a summer school next July in UBC Okanagan with Burrs. With BERS. And then in two years, there's going to be a comparative crime number three workshop at UBC. So, those are the major sort of events that we're going to have the funding. And you can see in the calendar when things will take place. We'd also like to have some two-day workshops at Burr. So the launch event is this one. We'd like to do a few others, but we're not certain exactly what we're going to do. So one thing we're thinking about is maybe explore the connection between multiple Deer Shape series. Connection between multiple Diosches series and approximate functional equations. That's the fifth item there. Another one is applications of explicit prime number theory to cryptography. So like these papers of Bach and Sorensen, which use stuff from explicit prime number theory. Another thing that hasn't really been explored a lot is effective diaphantine approximation. So Mike Bennett has some papers where he uses balance for climbs and erosatic. Uses balance for climbs and erosatic regressions to get diaphane results. We'd also like to do some focused research groups. So maybe take people from our collaborative research group and other people that want to be involved to tackle certain problems. And at the time, we listed a bunch of problems, and this could still be up for discussion if other people have ideas. One of them, what we wanted to do, and I don't know if we'll still do this, like study. And I don't know if we'll still do this, like study the linear independence conjecture. There was an unpublished paper of myself, Greg Martin, Michael Milonovich, and Bill Banks, which looks at how often say one half plus I2 gamma is a zero of the zeta function, and it should never be a zero. So there's lots of related topics to this that could be explored. And that hasn't, nobody's really studied that problem. So that was one possibility. Another thing we're interested in. That was one possibility. Another thing we're interested in looking at is maybe attacking the primes between cubes problems, that there's always a prime between two cubes. So, Dudek, a student of Tim Trechant, published a paper a few years ago where he showed if n is big enough, there's always a prime between two cubes. So maybe this could be at the top. Sorry? Yeah, consecutive cubes. Yeah. So I don't know what I said. The first one is. Yeah, when did I say? Two cubes. Two cubes, okay. All right. Anyways, Dudek proved something, and then Kelly Haggle improved that a few years ago. Maybe this could be attacked by a bunch of people. Another question, the one that says large values, like about proving Montgomery's conjecture on a quantitative LI, nobody's really done that. And that could be studied for just more general error terms. Just more general error terms than the prime number error term. Okay, and then going down, we wanted to have a few like special sessions that maybe some CMS meetings or CNTA conference on L functions or any of the other topics in the theme. And originally we thought it might be at UVC, but it looks like the next CNTA has been moved to maybe Toronto is what we're hearing. So that we'll do maybe some special sessions at some point. Do maybe some special sessions at some places. We're going to have distinguished visitors in this program. So, Naomi will be the first one. She's going to be visiting UNBC. That's Naomi Tanabi. Let's see. So. Yeah. Thank you, Naomi. Thank you for coming. Okay. And postdocs, Atma's here. We're going to hire another postdoc. We'll say a few words about it in a moment. Another thing in the CRG is we have three online courses. Three online courses. So, Abiva is teaching one right now. And then in the spring, Greg is going to do a follow-up course to that. And this is sort of if students want to take the course, Greg's course will say something about that. These two courses put together will give you a solid foundation on like number theory. And students that take it could maybe attend the summer school in UBC Okanagan next summer. And then we also have an online seminar that takes place weekly. Online seminar that takes place weekly and it will go on for three years, and that's being organized by Erton, Cubra, and Fatma. Do you want to continue? Sure. So, Biva is going to continue. I want to ask Even a question in private. Okay, so the first item here about what Postoff. Here about the postdoc hiring. So, the deadline is December 5. So, if you are yourself interested or you know some people who would be interested by the themes we're proposing, please encourage them to apply. It will be the position is mainly based in UBC, but as we are a collaborative research group, that also means that. Research group that also means that gives opportunities for that postdoc to take part with all the projects and activities we're proposing, or to also collaborate with everyone that is in this group. So the Viet is on best jobs, and that's where you would upload your application. So in the events that took place, so this is a bit odd, we're launching, but we already had things happening. Launching, but we already had things happening. It's just how complicated scheduling is. Well, post-COVID, like everything has been postponed, and beers is expanding and more and more competitive. So we're actually pretty grateful that we can have our launch event for year, but we are launching the CRG event. But we can actually say a few things. So we have already had this conference. Already had this conference at UNBC in late July. All our events, we are making the effort to put them in hybrid format, which allows a wider audience. So that was something that we realized. I mean, we knew about it, but really we felt it with this event. We had a lot of people that maybe were under the radar and that we did not necessarily interact with to actually be part of a conference. So that was actually really exciting. So the event was actually really exciting. We were 23 people in person, 73 online. The conference was a week long. There were nine 15-minute talks, 19 shorter talks. We did open calls for the shorter talks and we will continue that to continue maybe discovering new results this way or new people. You can see that most of the lectures have been, people Lectures have been, people have generously agreed to be put on the master videos. So you can check things there. And the other thing that we did in that week is that people were invited to propose open problems in the field. And so this is still, I think, a document in progress. But during the event, lots of problems were shared. And this is something you can still contact mainly Alia or Nathan, and they would add. Or on Nathan, and they would add to this, and the goal is to spread that widely. The themes more specifically were approximate functional equation techniques, multiple Dirac series, shifted convolution sums, random matrix theory, and spectral theory of automotive forms. We also had to, as I said, it was hybrid. We had ways to communicate or see who was behind the screen and interact with us. So there were icebreaker sessions, two EDI sessions, one networking one. Sessions: one networking one and a daily gather meeting. The networking one was called Ask Me Anything. So, some of the quote-unquote senior people agreed to answer any questions that students or postdocs would like to ask, whether it's a math question or something about career development. So, that was without a successful event in how much people interact. And so, we hope we can. And so we hope we can continue to repeat things, I mean, this kind of vibe for the coming events. So, what is running throughout the three years of ECRG is our seminar. So, it's a weekly series. This fall, it was on Thursdays at 11 a.m. Banten time. It is the same. We are putting when people agree the lectures on math tube. Not everyone agrees, so maybe some, there was one this week that was actually really. One discriminatory was actually really awesome. If you missed it, it's too bad because it's not going to be on mass tube. So if you can log in, log in. You can, again, it's on our webpage. You can find the links there. You can ask to be included to the mailing list or see the announcement for the talks. The next two ones are Sano Rikan and Anorag Sahe. And the next four, we still are finalizing the schedule because we are but Because we are spring. Fall, yeah. Spring. Actually, spring in Lesbury because it's winter in Vancouver, which is hilarious because it truly feels like winter for us. It's spring for them. But yes, January-May session, we're finalizing your sketchboard. That should come very soon. So, as Nathan said, we are offering three graduate courses. Three graduate courses, so which are in hybrid, mostly online formats. So, the first one right now that I'm offering via the PIMS digital network course is an introduction to analytic number theory. So, the goal at the end of an introduction on the star function, proving the prime number theorem. We had a few guest lectures already with Olivier Aramé and Grace Martin, and I think also Alia will give a Alia will give a and yeah, for instance, so the audience is like we have five grad students in Lethbridge, and there are nine students registered via the Western Group agreement. So that are from, so we have students from Regina, University of Alberta, Bulgaria, UBC, UNBC. Yeah, and so back. Yeah, and so that we're repeating in spring. So, we'll follow up course with Greg on directly characters, functions, zeros and memorial terms and arithmetic progressions. And also, no, don't do that to me. Thank you. Limiting distribution of error term and comparative prime number theory. Okay, prime number verses. And as Nathan said, these courses for students who are interested to Interested to continue in analytic number theory. We're proposing this summer school, and these two first courses would definitely give a very solid base for them to continue on. And in the fall of next year, Alia will also propose a gradual course of moments of L-functions. We can't announce it, we have to go through the process of proposing it to the team's digital network first. So, as soon as we have news, we of course Have news, we of course will spread the word. And sometimes you have to be careful about the deadlines, they can be very early. So VERS Summer School is scheduled to be July 2nd to 15 in Kelowna, BC. So VERSE has an antenna now at UPCO, I think for a year now. It's going to be a hybrid model. We're hoping to have 30 students in person. Hoping to have 30 students in person. On the first week, we will focus on, it will be more of a classic lecture style week. So with courses of zero density, subconvexity, zero free regions and repulsions, character sums and Spokler density theorems. So there are actually the themes in there, the instructors being Alia, Hiari, myself, Alisa, Lomni, Robert, Yori. Isaiah, Rambert, Yolivira Marais, Tanikas, Reike Trevinho, and Asip Zavan, who is also in the group. The second week, what we're proposing is, so there would be some work in advance preparing to that, but is to split the students and younger researchers in working groups and to focus on projects which would be prepared in advance, I mean, proposed in advance, so that people can split between some groups and to. Between some groups and to have students actively participating doing research here, so that would be a booster to work on problems where we can invite students to work on. So we say it's in progress in the sense that we have fears. We're actually expecting, hoping that the community here can also give us feedback on what they would be interested to focus on. Interested to focus on. But these are some preliminary topics and events that we would like to host. So, some focused research groups, as Nathan describes, are three main ones. So, the topics being linear independent conjecture, primes between cubes is a theme that goes from zeros of zeta function, zero density, and in zero density, you have a whole field in itself. So, these are pretty. So these are pretty wide, just to give an idea of the different flavors you could have there. And Nathan described more of the Montgomery conjecture on the Artemino Prime Minister theorem. The two-day workshops as well, they are not scheduled yet. We are going, but it is the same idea to have around these themes people join us and find a nice place like here in the Place like here in the mountain or at the beach somewhere where we can do some math. And finally, one important component for the PMCRG workshops are the EDI network and community impact of the CRGs. And in our case, that meant strengthening current research networks, so people spread a little bit around the world and making sure that there is an effort to bring people together and do more collaborative research. And do more collaborative research. Increasing accessibility at low cost. So that's why, for instance, all the hybrid events. And the point of the money of the CRG is to support a lot of the younger, like the students, younger people to be able to participate to all these activities. And finally, in all of what we're doing, into showcasing and accelerating the diversity mathematics, so increasing representation and participation from equity deserving groups. From equity-deserving groups, and also proposing some EDI sessions, including some activities around care building and advancement. So I think that's it, right? To present what the CRG is about. And I hope someone remembers what the stage moves, but moments, right? Yes, sorry. Oh, I thought I was five minutes. Oh, I thought I was five minutes late. Okay. You're 25 minutes early. I'm 25 minutes early. Okay. Sorry about that. Anyone have any question about this overview of the CRT? I have a math question. Okay. Let's do overview questions for this. Going to the math questions. Yeah. I'm looking at the Zoom chat as well and asking questions. Without the description of the various events we're doing, there's better complexity. Did I go too fast? In any case, you will find things online. It was just to let you know what we're trying to do for these three years. I'll try a mathematical question. Yeah, so for the sum of two consecutive, or the primes of two consecutive cube, we already know that there's always a prime interval length x to 7 over 12 plus epsilon, right? So I guess the Yeah. So I guess the question is, so that already covers transfer between consecutive cubes for large. Yeah, there's a large that we're trying to create that. Yeah, yeah. So what's the barrier? Like, what is the other theorem, like the 7 over 12 theorem, not effective? Is that an issue? Well, it is effective. Nobody's worked out the constants and it'll be really huge. And if you probably did it, so do that, I don't know, when you get EXP, DXP something, or... Exponential, exponential, 33. Exponential, it's potential 33. I don't know. It's like to go back and conjecture, the oldest new is figuring something, but to do the finite range, you have to do the rest. So that's trying to do some sort of what help got that they said, yeah. Nobody's gonna do it. Overview, like if you were imagining your ideal world, like at the end of the CRG, like End of the CRG, like younger researchers. I think it would be that first that they would have access to, for instance, when I take very specific topics like zero density. It's not something I think we teach in a classic analytic number three course. So it is like maybe to, and at the same time, it is something, it's a hot topic, it's something that you know, it's it should be part of the arsenal of a. It should be part of the arsenal of an analytic number series. So it's to give in the themes that we know something about, or try at least can bring people that know something about, make sure that this knowledge is shared to accelerate that education. And the idea also of bringing people to solve problems quickly, there's also this idea that, I mean, I'm from a generation. I'm from a generation where I could do my master, and that wasn't necessarily an expectation that I have a publication. And now it's not the case, it's far more competitive, and we expect students to actually produce some research at a very earlier stage in their career. And so, it was also allowing that, proposing things for that. And so, I'm answering your question, I think. If he curious to hear from everybody, actually, so oh, oh, it wasn't to us. Like, in explosive number theory, there are a lot of people working on the topics right now, and it's moving very, very fast. And it's hard to know who's doing what. So, one thing would be to get everyone together and start talking about seeing what's getting proven. And maybe we can figure out what we want to prove too, and also maybe make groups of people working together too. So, same thing with like in one. Same thing with like in moments develop functions. There's many, many projects, and not everybody, like, it'd be good to just put them all out there and say these are the things that need to be done because it's hard, they're hard projects. And maybe it's better if we get two or three or four people working on some projects in advance faster. Same in explicit number theory. If one person does it, it takes a long time and there's also a very high risk of making a mistake. So we'd like to encourage more people working together and checking the work. The work. So that's another thing we're respecting too. Even just, you know, instead of 50 people in the world working in comparative ground number theory in ones and twos, and then you happen to hear about, you know, half a year later that someone's thinking about something that you're thinking about, what if all 50 of those people were in communication as a network of scientists around the world and knew who was working on what and had a chance for collaboration? So I think, I don't think that the culture I don't think that the culture in math right now is hyper-competitive, but there's some vestiges of kind of a competitive culture where people kind of want to claim things and keep them their best. I think a lot of what we want to do is to say, let's have everybody in the world who works on this stuff be a team. And it doesn't mean we're not going to get publications. It doesn't mean we're going to steal stuff from students, right? But at least let's all let's know what people are working on and what's hard and easy and what techniques are going to help and have that constant communication that, of course, That constant communication that, of course, is that of younger people getting projects and people finding teams to work on things more efficiently. I think that that's what we're really focused on. I mean, is like what can be done and who can do it. And instead of individual efforts taking forever to actually achieve something, like get a little bit more of concentrated efforts and actual improvements. And actual improvements, more significant improvements. That would be the ideal world. I think that's really what would ideally happen. So yeah, we can dream of it. We can see. We've been given a chunk of money, so that's what we're gonna try to do. The ideal outcome is that we spend all the money on science, aesthetics, and all the people. Science that extra such. We don't want to have anybody else. Would this be a bit kind of a segue to the icebreaker? If it, yeah, well, you guys are in charge for that, right? Yeah, but I mean, I have to do your stage to do it. Well, it's totally fine. Okay. Yeah, so. So, yeah, so in a little adjustment to the schedule, because we didn't quite have this technological capability we thought, so we've done this. Probably we thought. So, we've done this overview now, and we will make the slides available somehow. And we'll send out an email and so on. There's a also on the launch event website, there's an announcements page that all of the kind of this last information will be stored there. But we'll also email it to that. You should have gotten an email already if you've checked it about the change of schedule, even though you're. So, one of our goals for this event and for all events is to literally get people to talk to each other and meet each other, especially. Talk to each other and meet each other, especially the younger folks, because sometimes it's a little bit daunting to, you know, you've heard someone's name from papers or conferences, and maybe you don't feel like there's an excuse to talk. So it really is an explicit priority for our events for people to just introduce themselves to one another and to talk. And one of the platforms that BERS has set up for us to use for that purpose is a gathering. And so, what we're going to do now for an icebreaker, it was going to be maybe something structured with a little bit of a little game or whatever. Of a little game, whatever. It's just going to be completely unstructured. But right now, I'm just going to ask everybody to go to gather for the next 20 or 25 minutes and just talk to each other. And your goal is to talk to, if you're an online participant, talk to at least one person who's also an online participant and at least one person who's an in-person participant. And if you're in person, the same thing. So that is your goal. Introduce yourself literally just for the chance of talking and getting to know people a little bit better. Technologically, if you're in person, the best. If you're in person, the best thing for you to do is to quit out of Zoom entirely and go on to gather and then come back on Zoom at 1029 for the first of the talks. If you're here in person, the best thing for us to do is to take your laptop and earphones or whatever, find some space anywhere in this building. I guess it doesn't even have to be in this building, just to minimize like crossover noise or whatever. Just we'll spread out a little bit and we'll be on gather for sure for at least for the next 20 minutes. If you're in person, we'll have some coffee or whatever, and I know that will draw us. Coffee, whatever, and I know that will draw us inward. But Gather will be open 24/7 in particular. We encourage everybody who feels like just to stay on Gather till 10:29. So, unstructured icebreaker on Gather. Talk to people, introduce yourselves. You're all wonderful people. And we'll reconvene on Zoom and in this room at 10:29 for a 10:30 talk.
