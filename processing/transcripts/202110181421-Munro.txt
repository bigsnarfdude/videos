I really want to thank the organizers for putting together a really great meeting. I've already heard a lot of great science, and I wish I could be there with the rest of you. So my lab has been interested for a long time in trying to understand how early embryonic cells organize, actomize, and contractility in space and time through dynamic interplay of biochemical signaling, incytoskeletal assembly, disassembly, dynamics, and force generation. Disassembly of dynamics and force generation, and how they put it to use to do a variety of different jobs, like polarize or divide, or as groups of cells to collectively execute different modes of tube morphogenesis. And we work on a couple of different model organisms, the early C. elegans embryo, which you see examples of to the left here, and Assidian embryos, in which we study multicellular tissue morphogenesis. And we work across our variety of scales from single molecules up to multicellular tissues. Up to multicellular tissues. And most of what we do is an attempt to try to combine experimental approaches with quantitative microscopy and mathematical modeling or computer simulations to try to get at underlying design principles that govern how these different processes work. So I'm going to focus today mainly on our work in the early C. elegans embryo. So C. elegans embryos, the early C. elegans embryos are really remarkable and how much it gets done, how quickly. Done how quickly. So, the actomyosin cytoskeleton in C. elegans, in early C. elegans embryos, like in many other cells, is a network of actin filaments and cross-linking proteins and myosin motors that sits just below the plasma membrane. And in C. elegans, this same machine, machinery, basically rapidly reorganizes itself in quick succession to do a sequence of different jobs. So, for example, to generate long-range cortical flows, as you see at the top, in response to. You see at the top, in response to local polarizing cues that segregate various polarity proteins. Shortly thereafter, a couple of minutes later, it reorganizes itself to make a contractile ring, which pinches the cell in two. A couple of minutes after that, it reorganizes itself yet again in two daughter cells to generate pulse contractility and cortical flows and on and on and on. So we've been really interested in trying to understand how it is that embryonic cells can. That embryonic cells can take the same set of components, actin filaments and motors and cross-linkers, and very rapidly remodel themselves to generate different architectures that are specialized to do different variants of the same basic job, which is to contract and deform and generate flows. And also how during individual periods of time in which the networks have to have a characteristic architecture that they use to do a particular job, how to maintain, in essence, an architectural steady. An architectural steady state, even though the individual components of the system are rapidly turning over. So, what I want to do today is tell you about one story recently published in which we've tried to address that kind of question in the specific context of contractile ring assembly. And this is work that was primarily done by a very talented graduate student, Yunan Lee, who's since gone on, and Rachel Kadzik, who's a postdoc working jointly between my lab and David Kovar. My lab and David Kovar's lab. Okay, so as many of you know, the contractile ring assembles during cytokinesis in response to localized signals that come from the mitotic apparatus, which talk to the cell surface to position a local equatorial zone of Rho activity. Rho in turn promotes the assembly of actin filaments, the assembly and activation of bipolar mice. Activation of bipolar myosin to minifilaments in this equatorial region. And then motors and filaments and other factors have to rapidly reorganize themselves into this circumferentially aligned band of filaments that contract a ring, which then contracts itself to pinch the cell in two. And in C. elegans, this process happens extremely fast. So it happens in about 80 seconds from the time when you first start to assemble stuff until you have a contractile ring. You have a contractile ring, and then it just takes another minute or two for that contractile ring to constrict and complete cytokinesis. So, this is a beautiful system in which one can ask this basic question, how do you build from an initially isotropic array of filaments and motors, a highly aligned array of filaments, and then how do you maintain that alignment as the ring constricts? And we can look at all this happening at the surface of single large cells. Single large cells essentially in real time with microscopy. And so one can characterize the emergence of filament alignment by just using simple image filters, Sobell filters, which allow you to map out quantitatively local gradients and fluorescence intensity to get the local orientation of filaments or filament bundles within little patches of cortex and plot histograms, which just map out the local dominant. Map out the local dominant orientation within individual pixels throughout a region of the embryo, and then map how the distribution of local orientations evolves over time. And in that way, over a period of 80 seconds, we can follow this distribution of alignments as it goes from essentially isotropic to a highly anisotropic distribution. And we can quantify the alignment further by just measuring the ratio of the filaments that are aligned. The filaments that are aligned at 90 degrees to those that are aligned at zero degrees, just to get a simple scalar measure of that distribution. And so, that is what I'll call the asymmetry value goes from about one at the beginning to something like three when the furrow starts to invest. So, how does that work? How do you build a contractile, a highly aligned contractile ring? Well, one model for how this works has come from studies in fish and yeast from Tom Pollard. In fish and yeast from Tom Pollard and Dimitrios Vavalonis, who I think is here, and various other colleagues of theirs. The basic idea in fish and yeast is that you have a set of so-called cytokinetic nodes that are organized by an anilin-like protein that binds both forems and myosin motors. The formins extrude actin filaments. The myosin motors on adjacent nodes capture the actin filaments and walk towards them. The filaments are continuously turning over, and that allows. Continuously turning over. And that allows what's called a search capture pull and release mechanism that allows nodes to pull themselves together and align into an equatorial ring. And variants of that mechanism also pull actin filaments themselves into alignment with this equatorial band of nodes to generate circumferential alignment. So that's one way in which this could work. But it's unclear that something exactly like that is working in animal cells where the organization Animal cells, where the organization is much, there's no obvious discrete cortical nodes that one can see at the equator of animal cells. And so another idea that was proposed a long time ago by Gary Borisi and John White was this idea that just a larger gradient of contractility, high at the equator and low at the poles, could generate long-range compressive flows, compressive at the equator. Compressive flows, compressive at the equator, and that actin filaments within those flows would just get aligned by this compressive flow. And so the idea is that compressive flow could build up filament alignment. And this idea more recently was updated by Antecile Raymond and Chefan Grill and colleagues for the C. Elegant Embryo. But if you ponder this idea for a minute, you realize that in order for this mechanism to work, it has to be the case that the actin It has to be the case that the actin filaments within this network have to stick around long enough for them to become fully aligned. And if filaments are turning over very quickly and disassembling filaments are replaced by new ones that are assembling with random orientation, it's not clear how you could in fact build up this kind of alignment. So it becomes a quantitative question. Could this mechanism work? Well, it depends on how fast the contraction is and how long-lived the filaments are. And how long-lived the filaments are. So we decided to just ask that question quantitatively using an approach that we've developed over the last five or 10 years using single molecule imaging to look directly at single molecule levels at cortical dynamics. And the basic idea is quite simple. We can take any GFP tagged protein that expresses a transgene and use RNA interference to just tune the levels of expression of that. Tune the levels of expression of that transgene to the point where we can see single molecules with TERF microscopy. And so, this is an example of an actin binding protein that shows defilaments at full expression levels, but can be tuned to single molecule levels. On the right here is an example of actin monomers themselves tagged to GFP, which are incorporating into filaments at the cortex. And you can see them coming and going as they assemble into filaments and as the filaments that they're part of disassemble. And the idea. And the idea is that we can then use particle tracking approaches to follow these individual molecules and extract information both about their lifetime, which allows us to read out filament lifetimes, and their movements, which allow us to measure flow. And that gives us a way to simultaneously and quantitatively measure the things that we think determine whether or not compressive flow could align filaments. So just before I show you more of the data, I just want to sort of I show you more of the data, I just want to sort of orient you. In order for us to be able to do these measurements, we needed to be able to get straight where we were in the progression of cytokinesis. And because we're looking at dynamics that happen at the surface, we don't have access to events happening deeper in the cell. For example, the chromosomes, which would tell us exactly when cytokinesis begins and so on. So we developed a slightly indirect method where we look at the surface at Look at the surface at myosin and actin filament at the same time over time as the contractile cells go through anaphase and the contractile ring assembles itself and ingression begins. And we can measure just in an equatorial region of interest the local intensity either of actin filaments or of myosin. And we can exploit the fact that actin and myosin begin to assemble at the equator rapidly just after anaphase onset. So the onset of assembly is tightly phased. Of assembly is tightly phased with anaphase onset. And so we can, in individual embryos, we can capture this sharp increase in myosin intensity and use the point where myosin first begins to increase as a proxy for anaphase onset. And then we can align all other measurements with respect to that. And when we do that, we see there's this very sharp, initially exponential increase in actin and myosin to a plateau that's then relatively stable. And if we measure And if we measure the width of the region of the cortex that's in focus at the cortex as a proxy for furrow ingression, we see that that width is stable as stuff first assembles, then it begins to decrease. That is, there's shallow ingression for a while as a contractor ring is assembling, and then there's a phase of rapid ingression. So we can basically break the process of cytokinesis down into this initial assembly step, the ring formation step where the ring becomes aligned. Step where the ring becomes aligned, and then the rapid ring constriction. And we can use these various different milestones, either the changes in the rates of constriction or the increase in stuff at the beginning as temporal markers that locate where we are in time for measurements that we want to make. And we can also map onto that this local increase in asymmetry and see that during the initial cortical assembly phase, there's very little. You know, cortical assembly phase: there's very little change in asymmetry, it changes very little during the initial stages of ring formation and then it accelerates towards the end. Um, and by the time the ring constricts, it's reached its more or less maximum asymmetry value. Okay, so in order to provide a context for the quantitative measurements I want to tell you about, we wanted to build a very simple mathematical model that just predicts how the act in form and alignment should evolve, given rules for local action. Given rules for local actin filament assembly and disassembly and rotation by flow. So we build, imagine a very simple model where we think about a patch of the equatorial cortex, which is, you know, which is an annular ring. So we use periodic boundary conditions to represent the top and bottom of this patch. And we imagine that the left and right bounds of this patch are moving at the same rate as the cortical flow that this cortex is executing. Is executing so that there's no net flux of actin filaments across that boundary. So we imagine that this patch is compressing at a constant rate everywhere, and filaments within that patch are doing three things. They're assembling, initially we assume with random orientations. They get rotated by this compressive flow, and then they disassemble. Again, at a rate which we assume initially doesn't depend on the orientation of the filaments or anything else. Filaments or anything else. And so one can then just write down a very simple equation that represents the density of actin filaments with different orientations, theta, over time, and how that evolves as a consequence of local assembly, disassembly at a rate proportional to the local density, and as a consequence of rotation. So this last term here is just a conservation law that says how the distribution of orientations evolves. Distribution of orientations evolves given some local velocity of some angular velocity of filaments in compressive flow, which depends on their local orientation. And we can scale, just scaling by the steady state density, we get a slightly simpler form for this equation in which there's essentially only two parameters that matter, the disassembly rate and the contraction rate. This is a strain rate of contraction. And so we can just map out a phase space. And so we can just map out a phase space for those two parameters and ask for what values of such parameters would you achieve after 90 seconds, as we see in the embryo, an asymmetry value of about three. And this shows you what you would have to achieve. So this provides a target now that we can test our measurements against. And so now for the measurements, again, we used this basic approach in which we use single molecule imaging. Single molecule imaging to follow single molecules of actin as they arrive at the cortex, which means they assembled into actin filaments, move around, and disappear. We use particle tracking analysis to compute the trajectories of all these individual molecules. And then each one of these trajectories essentially contains two pieces of information. It contains information about the axial displacement versus time of that material point of reference and the duration of the trajectory corrected for photobleaching. Trajectory corrected for photobleaching contains information about the lifetime and thus the disassembly rate. And this is just a chymograph showing you just the axial displacements of single molecules over time, showing you that during this initial assembly phase, there's no flow, but we can see during the period in which the contractile ring is assembling itself that there's a compressive flow that you can clearly see in the trajectories of single molecules. And what you can also see from this is that. Can also see from this is that there is locally coherent movement of single molecules. That is, the cortex, the actin network behaves more or less as a coherent patch of material in which filaments are embedded. And that's an essential assumption that underlies the model that I told you about earlier. Okay, so we can then just take from all these individual trajectories, we can just pull out the axial component of the displacement. Displacement, convert that into a velocity, and then we can average along this axis all the axial displacements and velocities of molecules at a particular equatorial position to get curves like this at different points in time that give you the velocity profile from the single molecule displacements. And what you see is that initially here, the velocity profile has a negative slope in this region that's relatively. Negative slope in this region that's relatively shallow, but that slope increases over time. This gray bar here marks the equatorial region, and that negative slope implies a locally compressive flow. And if we just compute the derivative of the velocity profile to get a local contraction rate, we see that that contraction rate starts out low and increases gradually over time. This is just a plot showing you those values measured for multiple embryos. And what you see is that they can. Multiple embryos. And what you see is that the contraction rate starts out low, it increases to a maximum rate of about 0.01 per second, which is consistent with what others have measured in the past. And so that gives us our measure of local compression rate within the equator. And then to measure actin filament lifetimes, we can plot so-called survivor curves, where we take all the trajectories, line them up at the same starting point, and just measure the fraction. Measure the fraction of single molecules whose lifetime at the membrane is greater than some specified amount. And if there is just a single underlying decay process, this assembly process, then you would expect that this would give you an exponential, a single exponential. And in fact, these curves for individual embryos are well fit by single exponentials, allowing us to infer a disappearance rate. And then because we have measured the photo bleaching rate. The photo bleaching rate of single molecules of GFP in the system under the imaging conditions we use, we can subtract that to obtain a true disassembly rate, which is about, which is remarkably fast if you think about these things. The average lifetime of an actin filament at the equator is about eight seconds in these cells. Now, for those of you who are actin assembly aficionados, you probably know that Tom Pollard's group and others have shown that foremans, which are Formins, which are the elongation factors that are assembling most of the filaments for cytokinesis, really don't like to use GFP-tagged actin as a substrate. So we and reviewers of this paper were concerned that we might be measuring, actually biasing our measurements by measuring turnover of branched actin instead of linear actin. So we did a control experiment in which we knocked down one of the components of the R23 complex strongly and Complex strongly and repeated these measurements. And what we find in those conditions is that we still have a single exponential decay. If anything, the disassembly rate we infer is a little bit faster, which suggests that the form and assembled filaments may be turning over even faster than the measurement I showed you here. But for what I'll tell you from now on, we use this eight-second lifetime as our primary measurement. Okay, so we can go back to this phase space and ask where do we live in this phase space? And the answer is way. Space and the answer is way up here. That the given the measured disassembly rate and contraction rate, there's no way that this basic mechanism of compressive flow aligning filaments, if it's just working on single filaments, there's no way that it could explain the emergence of filament alignment. So there's got to be something else going on. What could that be? Well, we sort of imagine two general possibilities. One is that this assumption that filaments assemble with random orientations may not be true, that that could be somehow biased. Be true that that could be somehow biased. I'll come back to that in a moment. And the other possibility is that somehow correctly oriented filaments could be preferentially stabilized. For example, if coaligned filaments are bundled together and bundling factors are attracted to them and protect them from disassembly, you could imagine that that would be a way to stabilize correctly oriented filaments. So it's very difficult. And in our experiments, we don't have the power to be able to find. Able to find a unique population of long-lived filaments at the equator. So instead, we used a slightly different approach. We just used simulations to ask, to basically implement the assumption that there's some local dependence of disassembly rate on filament orientation, which we model as just a hill function, an inhibitory hill function, with tunable steepness and threshold and tunable minimum and maximum. And tunable minimum and maximum disassembly rates. And then we just incorporated that assumption into the previous model and just systematically sampled values for these parameters that tune the strength of this effect and look for values of those parameters for which the simulations reproduce both the mean disassembly rate that we measure and the orientation bias that we measure after 90 seconds of simulation. So this is the cloud of points in that parameter space. Points in that parameter space for which we achieve that outcome. But then we took one step further and asked: could those simulations also reproduce the dynamics of both filament, you know, of filament density that we measure and of orientation that we measure. So, filaments, as I told you earlier, increase rapidly initially, and then they reach a stable plateau over time, whereas the orientation, Whereas the orientation starts out low and increases slowly for a while and then increases rapidly. So we just ask: could for what choices of these parameters could we reproduce this late phase where you have essentially a constant slope, no change in Nachin density, but a sharp increase in orientation bias? And the answer is there's just simply no parameters in this model for which you can even get close to hitting those values. And in retrospect, we probably could have just We probably could have just made a hand-waving argument on this because it makes a lot of sense that if the local density of films is just set by a balance of assembly and disassembly, and if there's a dependence of disassembly rate on orientation, then a sharp increase in orientation will lead to a sharp decrease in disassembly rates, which should all other things equal, lead to a sharp increase in density. So there's no way in this model that you can decouple the increase in. Decouple the increase in orientation from an increase in density. So there's no way that this model can reproduce that decoupling. So that doesn't rule out the possibility that density dependent or that orientation dependent stabilization of filaments could contribute, but it can't be the dominant mechanism. So that took us back to the other idea that there could be some orientation bias to filament assembly. And so to look at that, we took advantage of the fact that there's a single We took advantage of the fact that there's a single formin called Psych1 in C. elegans that assembles most of the long, unbranched Nachin filaments in the early embryo. And so we used a strain expressing that forman endogenously tagged with GFP, and again used turf microscopy now to image the individual formants with the idea that if we could follow individual formin dimers, as you can see moving around in this movie, then we could get a direct readout of the orientation of filament growth. Of the orientation of filament growth. So, this is what the raw data looks like. You have lots of individual speckles which represent Foreman dimers. A large number of them, if you look for a while, are actually moving directionally over many micrometers in one direction or another. And then there's a stationary fraction. And to make it easier to analyze these data, we did a first, just a slow average to isolate the stationary fraction of cycles. The stationary fraction of psych1s. And we subtracted those from the raw data to better highlight the rapidly moving fraction. And from this, we could then use particle tracking analysis to track all these individual foremans and get a direct readout of their local speed of assembly and direction of assembly. And this is what that data looked like, just plotting the speeds of many individual foremans as a function of time. What you see is that these foremans are elongating at a rate of about Hormons are elongating at a rate of about 1.5 micrometers a second. And as I said earlier, many of them are elongating for many micrometers across the cortex to assemble a network of long, unbranched actin filaments. And so we could then, from these data, now take all of the individual form and trajectories and filter out the short trajectories that can't be distinguished statistically from something that's just diffusing. Statistically, from something that's just diffusing around. So we filtered out those and selected for the subset of trajectories that are undergoing rapid directional movement. And then we just simply asked, okay, what is for shorter sub-segments of those trajectories, what is the orientation of growth? And what is the distribution of growth of orientations at the equator where the contractile ring is assembling versus out at the poles where it's not? And here's what we find. At the very beginning, just before anaphase onset, just as actin filaments are starting to assemble at the equator, we see that there's absolutely no orientation bias either at the poles or at the equator in the orientation of filament assembly. But by about 60 seconds later, just shortly before O begins to ingress, we still see that same kind of isotropic distribution of orientations at the pole. Distribution of orientations at the poles, but now at the equator, the direction is highly biased perpendicular to the long axis. So that suggests that there's something which is biasing the orientation of filament growth within the equator at a time when the contractile ring is itself already becoming aligned. And we wanted to rule out the possibility that there could just be something aiming, who knows what, aiming act and films independent. Aiming actin filaments independent of the orientation of filaments at the equator. So we turned off myosin II activity to block the compressive flow. And under those conditions, you never build up an anisotropy, an orientation of filaments in the equator. And the orientation of actin filament growth remains similarly isotropic. So that suggests that there's something about the fact that there's an oriented population of actin filaments at the equator. Actin filaments at the equator that in turn biases the elongation of newly growing actin filaments. So, to sort of take a closer look at that, we did two color imaging where we image formins at the same time as the marker for filamentous actin. And what we see about 15% of the time is what you see here on the left, which is a formin molecule that's a formin dimer that's elongating and leaving behind it a newly assembled actin filament. A newly assembled actin filament. So we interpret that as a formin that's growing, it's a filament that's growing into a region where there wasn't a filament yet. But the majority of the time, we see something quite different, strikingly different, where individual foremans are moving along existing actin filaments or bundles. And oftentimes you can see, as in this movie, that a formin that was going in one direction hits another bundle and turns and reorients and grows along that bundle. So this suggests very Bundle. So, this suggests very strongly that somehow newly assembled acne filaments are using existing filaments as a template to orient their growth. We can look at that a different way by just looking at again at foremans as they, you know, foremans that happen to start outside the equator and grow into the equatorial region, and then ask what do they do as they enter the equator and encounter this population of filaments, which is becoming a line. Moments, which is becoming a line. And so you can see some examples of foremans that are hitting the equator and then starting to turn. And we can take all those individual trajectories, align them to the point where they cross the equator, and put them into a canonical orientation. And then we can compile a bunch of data on many trajectories to ask what is the average influence of this equatorial zone on actin filaments. And here's what that data look like. If we look early on, just shortly before. Just shortly before or shortly after anaphase onset, when there's very little orientation of actin filaments in the equator, there's very little influence on the trajectories of formants that enter the equator. A little bit later, that influence increases. And by the time we get to the beginning of rapid contractile ring assembly, when there's a much more highly aligned array of actin filaments, we now see that these formins as they come in are turned. Formans as they come in are turning sharply and orienting strongly along the equatorial axis. And this just shows you how that orientation bias of filament growth changes over time relative to its time of entry into the equator at this late stage. And you see that you go from a very low orientation bias coming in to an extremely high after four or five seconds of growth. So that suggests that. That essentially local actin filaments or bundles act as templates to orient the growth of new filaments. And that's now a way in which existing filaments can convey information about their orientation, their history of movement to new filaments before they disassemble. And so we put that into the earlier model in a very simplistic way by just assuming. In a very simplistic way, by just assuming that some fraction of newly assembled filaments assemble with an orientation given by an existing actin filament, and the remainder assemble with random orientations. So lambda, this fraction, represents the strength of this effect, if you will. And one can just build that into the same equations that I told you about earlier, scale the equations. And what you see is that this just introduces a single multiplicative term out here. Multiplicative term out here in front of the disassembly, just one minus lambda. So basically, what it does is it just scales the effective disassembly. It scales the effective rate at which the actin filament orientation distribution approaches an isotropic orientation distribution by a factor one minus lambda. So that suggests that by increasing the strength. By increasing the strength of this templated assembly mechanism, you can build in essentially an arbitrarily long memory of the history of local filament alignment. So the effective memory, the effective lifetime of this structural memory is just the effective lifetime of the filaments themselves divided by one minus lambda. And by making lambda close as close to one as you want, you can make this effective lifetime as long as you want. How am I doing for time? Whenever you're ready for. Whenever you're ready for questions, but you can take a couple more minutes. Okay. I'll just say a few things very quickly. I'll just say that we can estimate the size of this orientation bias by asking how big does it have to be to explain the observed orientation bias after 90 seconds, given the rate of compression? And the answer has to be about 0.9. And we can ask, how big is it? We can estimate how big it is by asking how big would it be? Asking how big it would have to be to produce the observed filament assembly orientation bias given the measured filament orientation bias, and the answer is: it looks like it's about 0.9. So that tells us that, in essence, that the strength of this effect is sufficiently large to account for the observed buildup of orientation that we see. I'm just gonna skip this summary because it's just a summary of the points that I made. Just a summary of the points that I made, but I want to make very quickly two points. So, one is, you know, why would you bother? You know, why not just make all the individual filaments more stable instead of having this more complicated form of structural memory? And the answer goes back to thinking about what these embryos actually do. So these embryos are specialized to generate rapid deformation and flow. And it turns out to do that, they have to be able to turn over their filaments very rapidly. If we reduce filament disassembly by Reduce filament disassembly by removing a disassembly factor called cophilin. If we reduce it by a factor of five, the flow speeds in the embryo go down to effectively zero. So increasing the lifetime of filaments would have the effect that you could no longer generate flows to reorient filaments at all. And similarly, you know, if filaments are very stable, this is shown by many people, actin networks have a tendency to coarse and fragment. To coarse and fragment, to tear themselves apart. That's observed in vitro under conditions where there's no filament disassembly. And building filament turnover into a cortical network of filaments like this allows them to continuously generate contractive force against whatever they're attached to while maintaining structural integrity. So we think that this idea of building in having structural memory. Having structural memory in which actin filaments read the orientation of previous filaments in order to get a longer memory is a way to essentially have your cake and eat it too, to have a structural memory of a history of deformation while being able to rapidly turn over your individual elements to accommodate really fast plastic flow in a network. And I just want to, I could say a bit more, but I'm going to stop there. I'm happy to talk more about other ideas. Talk more about other ideas, but I just want to thank Yunan and Rachel, who did the work, Baishu Yao, Francois Roban, and Will McFadden, who contributed. Francois in particular spearheaded developing the single molecule imaging methods that I told you about. Okay, thanks. I'll stop there. Thank you so much for the very interesting talk. Orion has his hand up. Hand up. Yeah, great talk, Ed. I love the. We've certainly known that ARP actually cares about where the rest of the filaments are for what it does. So it's neat to see the formants might as well. Wondering how far we can actually take that parallel. And so can we think about the existing actin network as just a steric barrier to the formance? Or is either the survival or probability of nucleation different when you're guiding along a filament versus on its own? And or is there any actually any actual connection? Is there any actually any actual connection between the filaments? I could imagine if actual cross-linkers or others actually kick in. Yeah, if you increase the connectivity, there's other interesting behaviors that might arise. Yeah, yeah. So if I had another 10 minutes, I could tell you, and I'm happy to talk to you about this offline. So we think that the zippering mechanism depends on very fast cross-linking via a cross-linker called plastin, which is abundant in the embryo. And we can see in turf movies, we can see plastin decorating growing filament as fast as they grow. As fast as they grow. And in particular, we know that the plastin binds very weakly to single actin filaments, but with high avidity to bundles. And so it's really recognizing bundled filaments. So if you put all that together, and what that suggests is that basically this is really a mechanism for generating small bundles in the cortical network overall, and that in the presence of a compressive flow, those bundles get oriented. Compressive flow, those bundles get oriented into a highly aligned array. But we think there are all sorts of implications for this basic assembly mechanism and for the fact that filaments are rapidly assembling, they're getting quickly zippered onto existing filaments, they're disappearing. So, you know, if it takes nine seconds to assemble, you know, if it takes six seconds to assemble an actin filament nine micrometers long. Actinfilm at nine micrometers long. By the time it gets to that length, it's already starting to disassemble. So, this is a network in which the architecture of the network is determined by this very fast dynamic balance of assembly, zippering, and disassembly. And we're just starting to think about the implications of that for how contractility works, how you build different kinds of architectures. Yeah. So there's a lot more to say about that, but not time to say it. There's also a question from Fred Chang. Feel free to unmute. Hey, Ed. Hey, Fred. This reminds me a bit of our early models for the actin cable, in which the formins nucleate at the tip of the yeast cell and then are released and they basically act caps where they're not tapping the ends of the active filaments. The ends of the active filaments. And so the cables are bundles of all these short filaments. Do you know in your system whether the dots of foremost you see are actually being nucleated or could they be just extra caps of existing filaments? And do you have any sense if the formins are just acting, just active in nucleation at the surface or is it yeah, yeah, so there's a couple of different things, questions there that are really interesting, I think. So, I mean, we're quite certain that the forms. So, I mean, we're quite certain that the foremans that we're observing that are moving at a characteristic speed of 1.5 micrometers per second, those are foreign dimers that are sitting at the tips of elongating filaments. If we get rid of Rho, we no longer see that activity. If we tune levels of profilin, which is an elongation cofactor, we can tune the speed of elongation from 1.5 effectively down to zero. We see two different populations of Different populations of formants, a stationary population and this fast-moving one. And interestingly, we see that those interchange with one another. So, stationary formants can start to move and moving formins can become stationary. And we're particularly interested in the ones that are moving that become stationary because they seem to, they must be, they still have formins at their tips. So it's not like they're getting, like the formin is getting kicked off by capping protein. It's like the formin is still there. And we're And it's still there. And we're curious to see: is that an actin filament that was growing and got anchored, you know, bound to an existing actin filament? Because that's another, that has huge implications for how contractility could work in the system. We also don't know for sure whether we work pretty hard to ask: is it the case that stationary foremans are extruding actin filaments? So that would be something more like what happens in the case. What happens in the cables for a while before they leave the cortex? And if that were the case, we should be able to see single molecules of actin, single actin monomers that incorporate into those formins that are zipping away. And we can't detect that at the cortex. Now, it could be harder to see those going into the cytoplasm. So we may be, it could very well be, and this is actually, I like this idea, it could be that the stationary formins at the membrane are Formins at the membrane are extruding actin filaments into the cytoplasm. And then those actin filaments could be captured by motors that are in the cytoplasm and pulled back up. So that's a lot, that starts to look more like, you know, like Ben O'Shaughnessy and Tom Pollard's idea about how the contract, the fish and yeast contract, the ring constricts. So, I mean, we don't have the tools to look at all these things. It's just a matter of time. Yeah. Thank you. Any questions from the Any questions from the in-person people? Yes. Yeah. What makes the formins turn around and go along the oriented filaments? Is there some kind of attachment or adhesion or what's gluing them together? Yeah, let me just quickly share my screen again for a second and try to answer that. I took too long, kind of the first part. So, can you see my screen? So, can you see my screen, Leah? So, the model is something like this: that you have basically a filament that's already growing along an existing actin filament. Its end is sort of undergoing thermal fluctuations. But if there's a pool of cross-linkers, those cross-linkers can bind and rectify the fluctuations and zipper the growing filament to the existing one. And then you would predict that even a newly growing filament that's just growing through empty space. Growing through empty space, if it encounters an existing filament, there's going to be some probability that it could get zippered by the same mechanism and then continue to grow. And we can reconstitute exactly that kind of behavior, and other people have done so too. In vitro with purified plastin and actin. So that's a behavior that these cross-linkers can for sure implement. And it's a question of whether, to me, and the fact that Me, and you know, the fact that, sorry, I'll just show you one more. This gave me the opportunity to show this. So, you can see in this movie these rapidly elongating streaks of this plastin. They are elongating just as fast as filaments grow. So, that would not be true unless there's a sufficiently abundant pool of the cross-linkers with a sufficiently high on rate that they can find and bind growing filaments as fast as they grow. So, that to me is. They grow. So that to me is sort of strong evidence that this plastin could actually act in vivo as a zip ring molecule. Whether it's the only one and whether it's required for the zip ring is something we're still sorting out. Thank you. Yeah. So then the off-rate would have to be equally large so that there's enough of them diffusing the pool to To yeah, right, that's right, yeah. What's single sizes once they're zipped? Yep, so we've we've using the same kind of single molecule methods, we've measured the off-rates of plastin at the membrane, at the cortex, and we see two distinct off-rates, one which is fast, which is sub-second, which we interpret to be plastins bound to single filaments by a single actin binding domain. And then the other off-rate is essentially. The other off-rate is essentially the lifetime of an actin filament. And so the interpretation of that is that if you have a plastin that's cross-linked to an that's cross-linking two actin filaments together, that's a high avidity bond because if it lets go of one end, it's still held by the other end and it can rebind very quickly. But if one of those two filaments disassembles, now the plastin is left with only one binding site and it can rapidly dissociate. So I think that that's what's going on, that the plastin is binding. That the plastin is binding with much higher avidity wherever there are bundles. But because the bundles that we see at the cortex are bundles of probably, you know, two or three filaments, no more, there's a high probability that a two-filament bundle would become a one-filament bundle transiently and release its cross-linkers before another filament comes along and makes it a two-filament bundle again. Thanks. I think we probably need to move on to the next talk. Yes. Yes. Thank you again very much, Chad Monroe, for the interesting talk. All right, so next up in this session, we have Dr. Orion.
