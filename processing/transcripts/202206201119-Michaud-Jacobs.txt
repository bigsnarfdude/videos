Say a huge thank you to the organizers both for inviting me here and for giving me the opportunity to speak. This is actually, because of COVID, the first kind of in-person talk on my research, which is really nice. And so I'd like to talk to you about some generalized Fermat equations. And let's maybe start by considering the generalized Fermat conjecture, which has lots of names, also the Eul conjecture or the Fermat-Catalan conjecture, but this is one name for it. One name for it. And it says that this equation, x to the p plus y to the q plus z to the r is zero, has finitely many solutions. In fact, we kind of know 10 after permuting the coordinates, or permuting x to the p, y to the q and z to the r, as x, y, and z range across non-zero co-prime integers, and p, q, and r is going to range across any triples of integers, at least two, of which. At least two, of which the sum of the reciprocals is less than one. And the important thing here, well, let me just mention that we call PQR the signature of the equation. And the important thing here is that this is for PQ and R, which also range. So if we fix the signature PQ and R, it's known that we have finitely many solutions. But the idea is here, PQ and R arranging across any triple. Ranging across any triple of integers, at least to whose sum of the reciprocals is less than one. Now, many of these kind of cases, which I'm going to list below, have been solved. Now, when I say solved, I usually really mean that the only possible non-zero co-prime solutions in x, y, and z, correspond to one of kind of our ten known solutions. That's kind of what I mean by solved. That's kind of what I mean by solved. And they really fall into two categories. So either we have this first group, which normally consists of about three small-ish primes, there are many more, and most of the work on these types of things have been done either, I guess, by people in the room or maybe listening online. And usually when you have three small primes, how people have studied these are to study rational points on certain curves, maybe using Chabouti-style techniques. And then the other group kind of depends on a prime. And the prime is going to be L today. So L for the whole talk is going to be this prime that's going to vary. And so we try and solve an infinite family of signatures, all in one go. So for example, LLL here is the case of Fabmat's last theorem, but some others that are known might be LL two or four two L three. And the idea is that L is variable. And the idea is that L is varying. And in this case, the only real way we know how to try and attack these questions is to use the modular method, which kind of I guess Barinda mentioned earlier. And we'll have a look in more detail today. Because our aim is going to be to study a certain kind of class of equations of the form x squared plus y to the 2l is z to the p. And you'll notice that this differs from the title of the talk, which had an n, and that's because Which have an n, and that's because I really want to focus on the case of kind of l being a prime, that's all that's really going to matter. And so we'll have an L there, and you'll also notice that the z to the p has moved over to the right-hand side of this equation as opposed to what we have at the top, but that's not too important, it's just a minus 7. And the idea is here is that p is going to be fixed, maybe 3 or 5 or 7, and this prime L is going to vary across all. L is going to vary across all primes. So, one aim is to study this equation, and the second aim is to highlight the role played by modular curves. So, in this kind of modular method, which we'll see, modular curves really play a vital role, and the role they play is often kind of hidden behind the scenes. And so, I guess one of the aims of the talk is to give some insight into how these play in a corporate platform. So let's discuss a little bit the modular method. And as an example, we'll look at this equation, x to the L plus 19y to the L plus z to the L is 0. And I've popped a coefficient of 19 in there, so it's not kind of of the same form as the equations we were looking at earlier, but that's still okay. And I'm now going to outline what the modular method actually is. So it's going to really be It's going to really be five steps. And the first step is going to say, well, let's suppose we have some solution, x, y, z, so we suppose we have something satisfying this equation, and we're going to associate what we call a Fry curve, sometimes called a Fry-Allagroas curve, to this equation. And I've put a subscript x, y, z, l here, because this elliptic curve depends on the solution of our equation. And the next And the next step, and I'll recap this as we go through the talk, so don't try and kind of memorise the whole method. The next step is to ensure that the mod L Galo representation of B is modular. Now, I won't kind of go into the definitions of being modular today, but I'll just remind you, I guess we've seen it before this morning already, but this mod L Gala representation of this elliptic curve is telling us how the This elliptic curve is telling us how the absolute Galois group is acting on the L torsion points of this curve. Now, thanks to the work of Wiles and then further people afterwards, we know that any elliptic curve over the rationals is indeed modular. And so in this example we're looking at, there's nothing to worry about. It tells us that this model Galois representation is modular. Next step is going to be to ensure that we have irreducibility, that the model Galois representation That the model Gau representation is irreducible, or equivalently to show that the elliptic curve doesn't have any rational L isogenies. And thanks to the work of Major, or especially I guess part B of the theorem that Barinda stated earlier, we're basically happy. Okay, maybe you need to worry about some small values of L, but as a general kind of method, what we're going through, in this case, we are happy, so we don't have to worry about irreducibility too much over the rationals. Rationals. The next step is going to be applying Ribbert's level lowering theorem. And the basic idea we just need to keep in mind for today is that we're going to relate this mod L Galois representation of E to the mod lambda Galois representation of some new form F. Now, what's lambda here? Why is it a lambda not an L? Because this new form F could have a coefficient field. Could have a coefficient field larger than the rationals. So lambda will just be some prime of that product L. And in this example we've been following on the right-hand column, we find that the mod L gala representation of E is either isomorphic to the mod L gala representation of F1 or of F2, where F1 and F2 happen to be the two new forms at level 38. Yeah, there's a question. Sorry, you said level lowering. What level did you start? Level lowering, what level did you start at? Yeah, so I'm not, I haven't really mentioned what the levels here. The idea is that you first relate F to, you first relate E to a new form whose level is the conductor of the elliptic curve, and then you reduce that level. And one of the key points, it's a really good question, one of the key points I was just about to mention is that this conductor of our elliptic curve, kind of our starting level, if you like, depends on L. But once you've apply this level lowering process, Once you've applied this level lowering process, and we've reached, in this case, 38, it no longer depends on L. And that's going to allow us to kind of get rid of many values of L, or hopefully all L, in one L sweep. So we level lower, we get this relation between E and a new form, and then we try and eliminate. So we try and obtain a contradiction or show that, okay, our original solution maybe had to be have x, y, or z equal to 0. And one way of doing this might be kind of comparing. Doing this might be kind of comparing traces of certain elements in the absolute Galois group. Not too important what's going on here, but in this example, what we find is that we do some computations and we see that L is at most phi, so we've obtained a bound in this way. That's a very brief overview of this kind of whole modular method. And as we go throughout the talk, we're going to revisit every part of this. What I will mention is that this has all been over the rationals. This has all been over the rationals. But this modular method really carries through very nicely into totally real fields. When I say the modular method, again, I mean Fry curve, modularity, irreducibility, level lower, eliminate, which almost spells smile, but unfortunately it's a fry curve, so it doesn't quite work out. What different over totally real field? Well, Yeah, what's different is that we don't have this blanket modularity statement. So over the rationals, we know that any elliptic curve over the rationals is modular. Don't have the same thing over a totally real field. And same for irreducibility. If we don't assume GRH, then we don't have irreducibility results. We don't have an analog of Major's theorem over totally real fields. So we've got some work to do there. And the final point, which I'm going to basically kind of hide the whole talk. Basically, kind of hide the whole talk is that new forms, kind of when we shift to a totally real field, become hill-between forms. For the purposes of today, we can treat them as more or less the same thing, which might sound a bit shocking for some people, but for today, the difference between new forms and Hilbert new forms won't really be playing a role. So you can just view Hilbert new forms as usual classical new forms. So, this might be a good place to pause and see if there are any questions. To pause and see if there are any questions so far before we carry on and take a deeper look at some of the equations. This is actually a question I wanted to ask in the last talk, but we didn't have time. Okay. So there's a GRH here. Usually, when it comes to look at the curves, you want to use GRH with BSD, right? Because you want to say something about these L functions. And the L functions actually need to tell you something about the rank, which is why you need BSD. So what if you just use GRH, if you don't need VSD, then what what What's the context? So you only need GRH in, and maybe Brenda can correct me, but in these results, you really do need only GRH, and it's to do with getting certain bounds on the primes you need to consider when looking at isogeny primes. So there's no BSD going on, so this is only GRH. Yeah? Is that right? Okay, good. And this comes from some sort of tariff? Yeah, I believe so. Okay. Yep. The new forms of level 38. What weight? Sorry, uh, weight two. I should have mentioned. Yeah, thanks. Okay, so maybe let's now dive into this equation. x squared plus y to the 2 under z to the p. And again, p fixed, it'll be 7, maybe it'll be 11, and L is going to vary. What we would like to do, given what we just saw, is associate a Fry curve to this equation. We suppose we have a solution, we associate a Fry elliptic. Solution, we associate a file of dicking. The problem is that we don't actually know how to. We don't have a recipe for doing this, and so you might think, okay, we're stuck, we can't use the modular method, but obviously we're not stuck because this is what we're looking at, and so we're going to instead come up with an equation defined over a totally real field linked to this equation, and then try and prove something using that. We'll start by noting that we can factor the left-hand side over qi, and then Over qi. And then using kind of co-primality, we get that y to the l plus xi is itself a perfect power. So y to the l plus xi is some power of a downstream integer. What we'll now do is we'll compare the real and imaginary parts. We'll get an expression for y to the l, and then we're going to have some factorization to give us an expression over this field k. So for the whole talk, k is going to denote. K is going to denote the maximal totally real subfield of this p-th psychotomic field. It's a totally real field. So here's, it's a bit ugly, but this is what it is. What we get is we get y to the l is some product of numbers living in k. What the numbers are, not too important. The first one is a, this integer from above, and the others I'm going to call beta j. Just a comment. You you call it other thing, that's very beautiful. I think that's very beautiful. Maybe ugly for this slide, but yeah, no, it's a pretty factorization. And this is coming from the factorization of a sum of two powers in a psychotomic system. Now, there are a couple of kind of niggly cases one really needs to consider, but for today, at least for the moment, let's focus on the case that P doesn't divide Y and also that L is not equal to P. So there are other terms, there are other cases to consider, but for now, let's just go with this. Let's just go with this. And the idea is, again, kind of using co-primality, since we have a product of numbers which is a perfect power, each of the numbers themselves is a perfect health power. And you have to be a little bit careful here, because really, I should be speaking in terms of ideals. But again, let's just go with the fact that each term on the right-hand side is going to be an alpha term. So what do we have? Well, we've got that one. Do we have? Well, we've got that y to the l is a product of numbers in this totally real field, k. And we know that each is an lth power. And we can get some relations between these numbers. So let's take p at least 3. This is going to ensure that in this product up here, we have at least three terms, and we can find some relation between them. Now, what does that mean? It means that there are coefficients r and That there are coefficients r, s, and t. And I've written down what r, s, and t in small grey writing below so that you can't see them properly. The idea being that it's not important what they are. But there are some coefficients which are going to say that something times beta j plus something times beta k plus something times a squared in this case is zero. And each of these is an alpha path. And this should look familiar, familiar from our example right at the start. Right at the start. What this is, is we can view it as one of these Fermat equations, yes, with coefficients, but of signature LLL. And so we know, in this case, we do know how to define phylactic curves. And so this is what the curve is. Again, kind of the numbers aren't too important. It's E subscript XYZ L, and it's given by this. When P equals 3, We don't have kind of three terms in this product, so this kind of whole relation doesn't work in the same way. But it's actually a little simpler, and we can just define a phrylliptic curve to find the rationals. And again, this is another instance where I'm lying too little bit. I'll try and point them out as I go along the talk. You really need different cases here, but this is the main case. When p equals three, we've got this fry curve which we can define over the rationals. Over the vegetables. So let me just take a pause and recap what we've done. We've started with an equation to which we don't know how to associate a Fry curve, at least for any value of p, and we've come up with a new equation defined over this totally real field k for which we do know how to associate a Fry curve and hope that we can continue with this modular method which I outlined at the start. And let's try and do that. So we need to make So we need to make sure that we have modularity and irreducibility, but let's say we're feeling optimistic and we think we can prove this. So let's assume we have modularity and irreducibility and proceed with the modular method. What do we get? Well, we get that the mod L Galois representation of E is isomorphic to the mod lambda Galois representation of a new form, F or a Hilbert new form, depending on whether P is 3 or larger than 3. Or larger than 3. And in the Hilbert New form case, the level, again, the level is an ideal of the ring of integers. And I should note that these Hilbert new forms are of parallel weight too. So to kind of extend the answer to the question earlier. And now we can say, well, let's compare trace to Frobenius. Let's look at standard elimination strategies to try and achieve a contradiction. Problem is something. Problem is, something goes wrong. We do actually have a rather annoying solution to this equation. If I consider the solution where x is 0, y is plus or minus 1, z is 1, and L can be any prime we like, then this is a real solution. It's an actual solution to our equation, and we can substitute it into our Fry curve. Remember, our Fry curve depended on our original solution. Depended on our original solution, and so we can substitute this in. And what we get is that I'll call it E-triv, the Fry curve at this trivial solution, its mod L Gao representation really is isomorphic to the mod L Gao representation of some Hilbert new form I'm going to call F stand. So at this trivial solution, we really do have an isomorphism. Now, if you can follow that graph, Now, if you can follow that grit, if you can't follow it, or if it's kind of these are new concepts, then just think the fact that we have a trivial solution really messes up our process. We can't actually get a contradiction as we would expect. We can't eliminate the isomorphism between our original Fry curve and this model Galois representation at X star. This trivial solution really makes things go wrong. And you might notice, well, You might notice, well, you've got another trivial solution too. Here, I've got y is plus or minus 1, but there's another trivial solution where y is 0 and x is plus or minus 1, because I've got like an x squared term and y to the 2l term. This other trivial solution, which I haven't written down here, doesn't cause a problem. The reason that one isn't a problem is because when I substitute this second trivial solution into my phry curve, I'm getting a singular curve. I'm getting a singular curve. So it's not really an elliptic curve. So I don't have this type of isomorphism. So one trivial solution when y is plus or minus one creates a problem, but the other trivial solution when y is zero isn't creating a problem. But this one really is. And so we're going to look at a couple of ways we can work around this. One is to change the equation and introduce an Lth power into x squared. By doing this, we make the equation By doing this, we make the equation symmetric about x and y. And what this allows us to do is it says, well, if the trivial solution when y is plus or minus 1 is causing a problem, no worry, let's swap around x and y. It's no longer creating a problem. This is one thing we can do, and we can get results in this direction. So here's a result, which is that L is at least 2, and P is in the range 3 to 17, and I'll explain the colour. 17, and I'll explain the colours afterwards. Then, this equation x to the 2l plus y to the 2l is z to the p has no solutions in non-zero co-prime integers x, y, and z. Now, this theorem is due to a bunch of people spread across about four papers. So, Bennett, Annie Sixet, who are there, and Birich and Dembele Dürichet Freitas, and then myself just extending it in the case P equals seventeen. case p equals 17. And the different colours here are when p is 3 or 5, you can actually write down a Frey curve over the rationals. And for these larger values of P to 17, this uses a Frey curve over this totally real field, K. And maybe it sounds quite easy, as in, oh, the trivial solution no longer creates a problem, we've got the swap, and so we can continue with our usual modular method. There's kind of Modular method, there's kind of maybe worth noting that quite a lot kind of still goes into this. So I'm just writing it as kind of like a consequence or a straightforward solution, but other problems do arise, and I'll also note that the results kind of covered in these papers are more general than what I've stated here. So that's one solution. Let's look at another solution, which is completely different. And this is a solution which will only work in the case p equals 3. case p equals 3. What happens in the case p equals 3 is something a little weird and helpful, which is that our trivial e-trip, the curve of the trivial solution, has complex multiplication. And this fact is going to be really, really helpful. Actually, this is really the only way in the modular method that we can deal with trivial solutions. Why is this helpful? Well, it tells us something about the mod L Galois representation. Galois representation of this curve E triff. What we have is that if we're in this tricky case when the mod L Galo representation of E is isomorphic to the mod L Galo representation of this new format star, so if we're in this horrible case that we can't eliminate because of the trivial solution, the fact that e triv has complex multiplication gives us information about the model Galva representing. The mod L galva representation of E triff, and consequently the mod L gamma representation of E. So, in this hard setup with a trivial solution, because of some complex multiplication phenomenon happening, we get extra information. What this extra information is, well, it tells us something about, like I said, the model of Galois representation of E, in particular, according to whether P is split or not split in the field. Split or not split in the field Qi, E will give rise to a point on either the split or the non-split carton, a rational point on the non- or non-split carton curve at level L. And you'll notice that I've got a smiley face here and a frowny face here, and they're very easy to do in later. And why do I have a happy face and a sad face? Face and a sad face. Because in this first case, we understand, and we've seen this already this morning in Navi's talk. We understand certain mod L images, and we don't understand others. And we understand rational points on X plus split L, but we don't understand rational points on X non-split plus L. The reason for this kind of diplomacy. The reason for this kind of dichotomy is that the Jacobian of a split Cariton curve has a rank zero quotient, whereas the Jacobian of a non-split Cariton curve does not. And this difference means that in the non-split Capton case, we can't use the same techniques. But all is not lost. We have some extra information, which is going to turn that frowning into a smiley, which is that we also know that this curve E has a two-torsion. This curve E has a two-torsion point and therefore a two-isogeny. And so we actually get a rational point on this fiber product of modular curves, which is really the modular curve which classifies elliptic curves with non-spit Carton image and the two isogeny. And the Jacobian of this curve has a rank zero quotient, and so we can therefore work with it. When I say we understand in this setup, what we find is something kind of close to CM, where we get Close to Cm, where we get certain potential grid reduction at primes away from L. And this tells us that the curve we started with, E, actually is equal to E curve. We don't just have this isomorphism of representations, but we have the same elliptic curves, which told us that our original solution was actually this bothersome, trivial solution in this case. And so you might kind of think that's the end of the story. When P is End of the story. When p is bigger than 3, okay, we can swap equations, get some information out, and when p equals 3, we're done. The problem is we're not done when p equals 3. I haven't told you everything. But before that, let me just note that this idea of complex multiplication is appearing somewhere else when L equals P. This is one of the cases we kind of discarded early on. I said, let's assume L is not P. When L is P, the same idea of The same idea of complex multiplication is arising again to deal with the trivial solution. So, yeah, all of this was in the case P didn't divide Y. This was another of the assumptions I've made earlier. And I kind of made it back because when P does divide Y, this trivial solution is no longer a problem, and we expect that this modular method should work. But turns out that something goes wrong, unfortunately. Or maybe it's not a problem. Goes wrong, unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, otherwise I might not be giving this talk, which is that if p is 3 and p divides y, so 3 divides y, you have to associate a different Fry curve over the rationals, you try and use the same method and so forth. I call the Fry curve w in this case. And there's another isomorphism we can't eliminate. So this isn't coming from a trivial solution, because this trivial solution, since 3 divides y, it's no longer playing a role. But there's another But there's another of these isomorphisms, once we've level-lowered, that we can't eliminate. At least we can't eliminate for every value of L. What we can do, and I won't go into the details of this now, but we can eliminate it for certain values of L to get the following sort of result. So due to Chen for most values of L in this range and Darman for a few leftover values. Which is if we have a solution to this equation, when? To this equation, when equals 3, so x squared plus y to the 2l is z cubed, then a, we know that 3 divides y. Right, because when 3 doesn't divide y, we have this complex multiplication trick we just saw. And secondly, we know that l is bigger than 10 to the 7. The idea being that we can eliminate this isomorphism for any small value of l, small being less than 10 to the 7 in this case. And if you had a good computer, And if you had a good computer and enough time on your hands, you could increase this to maybe ten to the eight. But as you kind of get higher than that, it's going to become harder. And what we really want is we really want a statement for all values of L. So at this point, we don't really know what to do to get this for every value of L. So we're going to look at, again, a slightly different equation, which is going to allow us to actually obtain some sort of result. What we're going to do is we're going to look at What we're going to do is we're going to look at x squared plus y to the 2l is z to the 3p. And the idea here is that on the right-hand side we have a cube and we have a PFPL. And the idea is that we're going to combine these two facts together. We're going to use ingredients from both sides to try and obtain some type of resolution for this family of equations. Let's assume that p is at least phi, simply for the moment because simply for the moment because the cases p equals two, three, and five have been solved previously using Fry curves over the rationals. And again, for the moment, I'll come back to this. Let's again assume we're in the case that p doesn't divide 1. What do we know? Well, since we have a Q on the right-hand side of this equation, by this result of Chen and Darman, we know that L is a We know that L is at least 10 to the 7. That's already pretty nice. Any small value of L has been dealt with. And we know that 3 divides y. This gives us information about our Fry curve. Now, which Fry curve am I talking about? There's been Fry curves chucked around left, right, and center. This is the one defined over this totally real field, K. Because we have a p-th power, we can just define the Fry curve in exactly the same way. And the fact that 3 divided by the And the fact that 3 divides y tells us something about this elliptic curve. And that's natural, right? It tells us something about our solution, and our Fry curve depends on our solution. So it tells us something about the elliptic curve itself. In this case, it tells us about some local behaviour. That this elliptic curve is a multiplicative reduction at any prime above. So now let's rewind and go back and again try and apply. And again, try and apply this modular method, hoping that this time we're not going to have some issue arising, which is going to stop us. So, we're going to assume modularity and derivativility, and we'll come back to these. And we're going to level lower. And so, just as before, we have that this mod L Galois representation of E is isomorphic to the mod lambda Galois representation of some Hilbert new form F. And now, And now we're going to continue and try and obtain a contradiction. And how are we going to do this? Well, we're going to compare traces of Frobenius. We're going to choose some element in the absolute Galois group, like that's a Frobenius element at sort of prime above 3, which I'll call Q3. And we're going to compare traces of Frobenius on both sides. We literally substitute this element into both sides of this kind of isomorphism and take traces. And since we And since we have multiplicative reduction at the primes above 3, on the left-hand side, we get plus or minus the norm of this ideal, plus 1. And on the right-hand side, we have, less just for today, I've called it AQ3F. The idea that you want to be thinking of the Fourier coefficient of this Hilbert new form, that doesn't work in general, but for today we can think of it like that. And this is really kind of the Hecke eigenvalue of f under the Hecker eigenvalue. Value of f under the Hecker apparatus at q3, if you're familiar with this type of vocabulary. And this gives us something about lambda. So lambda divides the difference of these two numbers. And so taking norms, we get that L divides the norm of their difference, because lambda is a prime above L. So what do we have? We've compared traces of Frobenius to tell us something about the prime. To tell us something about the prime L. And I've called this quantity here. I'm using the laser pointer enough, but I realize I can just use my hand to do it. I'm going to call this quantity BF. It's going to depend on this Hilbert new form. I've just repeated what I've just mentioned on the slide here. And let's see what we can do. So let's take p equals 7, and let's compute these values a, q, 3, f, and let's just plug into this formula. And let's just plug into this formula and compute the values of BF. Well, there are a bunch of Hilbert new forms at this level. We don't know which one we need to deal with, but we can compute all the possible BF values, and we find that BF is one of these values here, and we know that L must divide one of these. We don't know which, but it must divide one, and so we deduce that L is at most seven. And even if you had a long flight yesterday, and you're You had a long flight yesterday and you're feeling a little jet lagged, we can agree that that is less than 10 to the 7. And so in this case, we are happy. And that was 7. And you think we can carry on. Let's do 11, let's do 13, let's do 17. Let's keep on going until computing these new forms becomes hard. Unfortunately, it becomes pretty hard pretty quickly. As soon as P is 11, It's at least too hard for me, I'll put it like that, to compute these values AQ3F. The spaces of these Hilbert new forms, they blow up really, really quickly. And so it becomes really hard to actually compute these values. What we can do, however, is not give up just yet and still try and obtain a bound on L. Now, the bound might not be as nice as 7, but if we could obtain some bound, that would still be nice. Bound, that would still be nice. And so we can use the fact that the size of this AQ3F under any embedding is at most twice the square root of the norm of Q3. And this is really the analogous result of what we have for classical new forms, or if you like, you could think of this as kind of the Hasse bound for elliptic curves, using the correspondence between new forms and elliptic curves. So let's using this, we will be able to obtain a bound on L. To obtain a bound on L. The idea is L divides this quantity up here, and we know something about the size of AQ3F. And so I've put some intermediate steps here, but what we really get out is that L is at most 1 plus the square root of this norm to the power 2d. What's 2d? It's the dimension of the space of Hilbert new forms at this level, 2q. So maybe we can't compute the Hilbert new forms. Maybe we can't compute the Hilbert new forms, but we can still obtain some bound, at least in terms of the dimension of this space, which is maybe something we could compute more easily, or at least we can say that there is kind of a bound living out there in terms of something which is a bit nicer than just using traces of the unique. So you only need the largest degree of a field of rectifying code by these free coefficients. Exactly. So if you could split the space into... If you can split the space, then you can get a much nicer effect. Space, then you can get a much nicer backdoor. So, this is really, it's in terms of the degree of this coefficient field. So, if you knew how it split, then you could get a much nicer backdoor. If you knew the splitting, but again, computing the splitting, even at p equals 11, at least I couldn't do it. Here's an example when p is 17. We have some rather large numbers here. We have the d, this dimension, is that. Is that, and therefore L is a little bit bigger than 10 to the power 7. But the idea is that we are getting a number out, right? So that's more or less the strategy of the modular method there. And just in the last five minutes, I'd like to make a few comments about modularity and reproducibility and then state a couple of results. So for eleven, I mean, what's found there? It's ten to the power of something in the thousands. 10 to the power of something in the thousandths. So it's huge. Yeah. So for modularity, I'm just going to state this result due to fright us, which is if k is a totally real abelian number field, which is the case for us, in which 3 is unramified, which is the case for us. And if we have an elliptic curve which is semi-stable at any prime above 3, which is the case for us because we have multiplicative reduction at any prime above 3. At any prime above 3, then we have modularity. So we've got this mod L gamma representation, it's modular for any L greaten city. What about irreducibility? So there's a lot to say here, and I've crushed it into one slide. Let's suppose we have reducibility. Then I guess we've seen in Barinda's talk just earlier that what we get is that we get a k-rational point. A k-rational point on X0L. But we don't have, at least not assuming GOH, we don't have an analogue of Major's theorem over any of these number fields we're working with. But what you can do is you can still study the points on X over L. You can study these points, and you can try and obtain at least a bound on L. And here's an example of the type of result that you can get. This bound in particular might look familiar. This bound in particular might look familiar. To some people, it comes from kind of Merrill's uniform boundedness theorem. This bound in particular, I've lost a factor of two from what you might expect, which comes from some of my own work on L-isogenies of elliptic curves. But this bend is actually coming from studying certain points on the modular curve X1L. So another instance of this modular curve, of a modular curve playing a role. Of a modular curve that I in a role. And okay, so either L divides some norm of a fundamental unit, so 12 minus 1, or L is less than this bound. So for any value of P, we're bounding L, and HK is just a class number of the field we're working with here. This is assuming that E is semi-stable? This is this uses semi-stability. Actually, this is particular to this case. I think it's Particular to this case, I think it's working in, but more generally, for this type of result, you need semi-stability of the primes above Kerala. Now, when P is seven, this bound I've just plucked out isn't quite good enough. So it tells us that the model Galois representation is irreducible, but the bound's a bit too big, it doesn't quite work, it's bigger than ten to the seven. There are now we know lots of ways of trying to prove irreducibility. Of trying to prove irreducibility. And one way in this case is that P reduces to a cusp on this modular curve, modulo, the unique primer of three in this field. That's because we have multiplicative reduction. And using, I won't go into it here, but using some formal immersion criteria and a bound by parallel, that's if I didn't, I'll be one minute, we have that L is less than 65 times 6 to the 6, which is less than 10 to the 6. So let's, in the final two slides, just state a few results. First is that if p is a prime, then, and this works for any prime, we have a constant such that when l is larger than this constant, we have no solutions to this equation, x squared plus y to the 2l is z to the 3p. Watts' constant is something we could take, and these are just the bounds we've looked at throughout the talk. The only difference being this very first one, which comes In this very first one, which comes from the case p divides y, which I didn't discuss. You get a bound there, too. So that's the type of bound we could take for this theorem to work, and you can compute this. You could also take like the maximum of these different bounds if you wanted to be a bit more precise, but we're so far off when we compute these, it doesn't really matter. And just to finish off, I'll just state the result when p equals. When p equals 7, here we really could do everything really precisely, and we can prove that this equation x squared plus y to the 2l is z to the 21, that this has no solutions in non-zero co-framing to just any l at least 2. And I think that's probably a good place to say thank you very much for your attention and to start. Any questions for Pete? So if I understand, again this time you never make explicit where you would use GRH. So there's no GRH in this talk at all. I should make that clear. I was answering the question. Sorry, I don't know whether that's what you meant. There's no GRH in it whatsoever. I was in Bering's talk. Are you sure? I asked you this question because I think. I asked you this question because I think I saw GRH on one of your slides. So I said GRH. So sorry, maybe I'll just explain that we don't have an analog of Major's theorem unless we assume GRH. But if we assume some conditions on our elliptic curve E, for which we're studying L-isogenies, in this case, our elliptic curve E is precisely this Fry curve, then we can get that. So I can't say, oh, I can't say, oh, over this number field, an elliptic curve with an L isogeny has to have L smaller than something. But what I can say is that for the specific curve E and the specific point P it gives rise to, by specific I mean the fried curve we're working with, there I can say things about L. For example, L is L satisfies this, or L is less than ten to the seven. Or L is less than 10 to the 7. Here, this could be made into quite easily L is less than 73. So there's no GOH whatsoever in this talk, but if you wanted a complete analog of measures result, then you would need GOH, if that makes sense. Yeah, that makes great sense. But I think the comment that I want to make still applies. Sure. So a lot of the flavor of your result kind of reminds me of something like Universal's Geramar. Of something like the Rados theorem on turnip. So he proved a long time ago, 90 years ago now, that for every sufficiently large audio integer, it's a sum of three prime, but he didn't actually give a bound off what sufficiently large means. And then eventually, by like the 90s, it got kicked down to something like 10 to the 1,000. Sure. Right? And then the last little bit was finally settled by HealthGuards. Yeah, a few years ago. Okay, nine years ago now. Yes. Nine years ago now. Yes. Didn't feel like that long ago. Yeah. But, and the technology that he used was that he kind of used like an explicit zero-free region where you can actually verify up to a certain height that these L functions actually have no zeros on a critical strip within this rectangle. And then after that, you use the usual zero-free region where you can true theoretically. And then he slammed enough of those together. I mean, I didn't look at the truth. I don't think anybody looked at the trimmings. But he shrunk it down. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But I think that was a key idea: that you use like these explicit zero-free regions. So I'm wondering, like, if you do that, can you actually drill some of these bounds down a little bit? So the only band that frankly really matters is this bound here. It's really the D isn't enough. So even if you know the D, you're way too big. So really, you need to know something about, and again, the coefficients. And again, the coefficient fields aren't really enough because when you get as soon as p is like, I think already at 11, even if you know, even if you kind of didn't know how imagine all these coefficient fields, it's still not enough. So you really need to know something about these hacker eigenvalues, these AQ3F values, these Hacker eigenvalues. So you really need to be able to compute, for example, the characteristic polynomial of this HECA pack. Polynomial of this Hecker operator. I don't know whether there's kind of any way around that getting a bound. The other way is: can you say, well, if I've got a really big bound, could I take 10 to the 7 higher to reach that bound? And that's also kind of completely out. Maybe you can get it to 10 to the 8. Maybe with improvements you get up to 10 to the 9, but you're certainly not reaching these levels. So it's kind of an interesting comment. Could you bring this down? And Could you bring this down? And I think probably not unless you have new methods. Well, obviously, unless you have new methods. But you really need something new computationally to be able to compute kind of some of these values. Yeah, I think that's how I would answer that. Other questions? Maybe this is a ninth question, but when you go back to the first equation. Go back to the first equation, so the title x squared plus y equals x equals z t. The problem is you get a trial solution with z equal to easy one, right? So what happens if you if you want to protect what z is even? Does it allow you to prove the whole method or I imagine that if you knew that z were even that I imagine that that type of thing would allow you to prove results because basically assuming z were even. Because basically, assuming Z were even, it's going to tell you, like we said before, something about the solution and that or something locally about the fracode. So I imagine, I'm not sure, but I imagine that type of solution. Also, a more direct way. So it's got well I'm thinking of three or five options. Yeah, right. Sure. It would be something uh which would be hopefully uh quite small in terms of the triangle by which. Small in terms of the prime divide by which? Uh, I mean, I imagine, and I'd have to kind of think about this, but if if you knew that some prime divided z, that would likely give you information about kind of this A and B I said before, it's likely giving you some local information about the fry curve. And any local information, which is kind of therefore ruling out this nuisance of the trivial solution, unless you're in an unlucky case like you are in the case d equals three. Like you are in the case g equals 3, then most likely you can. There's quite a few results on these types of equations where people say, okay, we can't solve this, but with some local condition, like maybe e divide something or three divides something, then you can get a result out. And the reason for these additional assumptions is precisely to rule out this trivial solution. But before that, we should think a bit once more. Shut up.
