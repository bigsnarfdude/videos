So, kind of like Simon, I was given this title, Pylogenetic Moles and Infectious Disease, Epidemiology and Evolution, which I was excited to write about. And thank you both to Noah and to Tanya and to Mike Steele for inviting me to contribute to this issue. And the more I thought about it, the more it became a little bit of a daunting task to contribute one manual. One manuscript on this huge topic. And that's because, you know, phylogenetic models are used so ubiquitously in infectious disease epidemiology and evolution at this point in time. They're used to estimate times of emergence, you know, for, you know, SARS-CoV-2, for example. They're used to study kind of the spatial spread of infectious diseases. They're used to reconstruct infection population, the population dynamics of infected individuals. Dynamics of infected individuals. And they're also used to study the process of adaptation, of course. And so the first thing I did actually, kind of once I was given this, was to try to narrow the scope a little bit. And so focusing first on just viral infectious diseases, because I haven't studied bacterial diseases in a long time, and I've never studied fungal ones or anything like that, or protozoan ones. So really to focus on viral infectious diseases, and then to even limit it a little bit. And then to even limit it a little bit further to looking at phylodynamic models. So these are phylogenetic models that really aim to reconstruct infection, population dynamics of infected individuals using phylogenetics and coalescent models, birth-death models, et cetera. And then at this point, I start thinking it would be really fun to work with someone on this. And so I pinged Dave Durasmussen, who Dave Drasmussen, who was actually a graduate student in my group about 10 years ago. Then he went on and did a postdoc with Tanya, and he's recently been awarded tenure at NC State. So I pinged him to see whether he would be interested in working with me on the special issue, the manuscript for the special issue. And we started thinking about kind of, well, you know, should we focus on a review paper or should we do contribute a research paper? And so we started talking about actually pilot dynamic. Actually, polydynamic inference. So, reconstruction of infected population dynamics when mutations actually impact viral fitness. So, if you remember from Ewell's paper from 1925, he talks about kind of mutations as being either viable or non-viable. And so, also there's this assumption of kind of neutrality. And I think a lot of what we've learned in terms of infectious diseases has been that there's Mutations are generally not neutral. And so, really trying to come to terms with phylodynamic inference in the context of specifically incomplete purifying selection. Okay, so let me backtrack a little bit. You guys have all seen this picture before, this cut and paste of the first page of this 1925 paper. This is, of course, where Yule introduced what is now known as the Yule model. What is now known as the Yule model. And I actually was up yesterday night, you know, trying to figure out whether anyone in infectious disease epidemiology phylodynamics has actually used the Yule model. This is generally not a model that we use in infectious disease phylodynamics. And that's, of course, because we consider recovery or death of infected individuals and the UL model is kind of a birth process. And so that. And so there have been actually a couple of instances. So I don't want to say it's never been used, but really, kind of, it's been kind of applied in kind of limiting cases of like the birth rate being much higher than the death rate, for example. But the models that are more generally used here are, you know, instead coalescent models as well as birth-death models. And generally, the, let me see if I can put up a pointer here. Bit of a pointer here. Can people see the pointer? Great. Okay, so coalescent models and birth-death models. And generally, what kind of we do in the field is we have some samples that have been sequenced. And so we have these sequences, which are consensus sequences from infected individuals. We have the sampling time of those samples. And then we either kind of, you know, apply a coalescent model or birth-death model and try to estimate certain. And try to estimate certain parameters from that interface with data. Things like the exponential growth rate, the basic reproduction number for birth-death models, also, you know, the birth rate, the rate of becoming uninfectious. And we do this by also kind of integrating over phylogenetic uncertainty. So here's an example of this, just with the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. So here we see kind of an example of Omicron emerging in. Example of Omicron emerging in South Africa at the end of 2021. You can see that over here in these case daily case data. And the authors of this paper had about 500, 550 sequences sampled from South Africa and nearby countries. And those were really sampled kind of in November and early December of 2021. And then they applied kind of these different phylodynamic models to those data. Models to those data, estimating things such as the evolutionary rate, the time of the most recent common ancestor of those Omicron infections, the exponential growth rate, and then from the exponential growth rate, the doubling time. And similarly, kind of application of birth-death models yield similar estimates. So I just want to kind of go back to these models and really kind of just mention that neutrality is a really common. Is a really common assumption that people have here in terms of these applying these models to sequence data, right? And so, first, the question being, you know, should we expect neutrality? And for viruses, you know, especially, you know, we don't expect neutrality here to actually be the case. For one thing, just like in most organisms, most incoming mutations are. Incoming mutations are, you know, deleterious, a chunk of which are lethal deleterious, but then there's also a lot of sublethal deleterious mutations. You know, we see this from studies of influenza A virus. We also see this in SARS-CoV-2. It's very kind of general phenomenon in RNA viruses and also beyond these acute respiratory viruses. So, incoming mutations, many of them are sublethal deleterious. And then there's been some really just wonderful work. And then there's been some really just wonderful work by Ali Pybus and also Mahang Dafari, which has really kind of demonstrated that there's incomplete purifying selection. So this paper by Ali Pybus looked across and colleagues looked across 143 different RNA viruses, you know, infecting humans as well as, you know, other kinds of animals and as well as plants. And what they did was they derived this deviation from neutrality statistic. Neutrality statistic. But all you really have to kind of see here is that kind of this mean and this statistic is, you know, is, you know, or just, you know, this distribution is kind of, you know, deviates from zero. And what this is showing is that the non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate from external branches exceeds the non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate as calculated from the whole tree. Right. And so this indicates that there's incomplete. That there's incomplete purifying selection. This more recent paper by Mahangafari was actually looking at time of duration of time for sampling and how that affects substitution rate estimates. But all I wanted to point out here with this paper was that they applied inferred clock rates for external branches as well as internal branches, and both for influenza A virus, this is the pandemic. Virus, um, this is the pandemic 2009 one, um, not the imminent pandemic H5N1 one, um, but uh, but um, both for influence A virus as well as for SARS-CoV-2, the clock rate on external branches exceeds sometimes pretty substantially that of internal branches, indicating, again, that this, you know, consistent with incomplete purifying selection for these viral pathogens. Okay, so at this point, we were thinking, you know, let's ask a question about, well, Let's ask the question about: well, does incomplete purifying selection bias phylodynamic inference? These phylodynamic inference methods like the birth-death model, coalescent models, have been used over and over again to estimate exponential growth rates, R0, et cetera. So are those results biased at all? And so to ask that question, what we first wanted to do was actually look again in the population. Look again in the population genetics literature here and see how, you know, weekly deleterious mutations and also incomplete purifying selection, how that has been kind of looked at in terms of changing the shape of trees and their topologies, as well as the mutation distribution on trees. And so I first want to point out, I really love this paper, this Williamson-Narie paper. And what they point out in this paper is that In this paper, right, is that if we have, let's say, a neutral tree as depicted here, constant effective population size, and here we see the mutations that are distributed across that tree. If we have kind of deleterious mutations and incomplete purifying selection, that could impact the tree in two different ways. One is it could impact tree shape and also tree topology. So this is. You know, so that it impacts tree shape as shown here in B. So you can see here tree shape as being defined by the kind of the length of external and internal branches. Here, you can see that in the context of deleterious mutations, what might happen is that these external branches might actually be longer, right, and the internal ones shorter than would be expected on neutrality. So that's when a tree shape is impacted. So that's when a tree shape is impacted. What you could also have is you could still have something that looks like a neutral tree, but the mutations are distributed kind of non-randomly. So they're no longer proportional to the branch length. The number of mutations on a branch is no longer proportional to the branch length. And you could see here that in this case, you know, you might actually have more mutations here on the external branches than you do on the internal ones, you know, controlling for length. So these are two kinds of separate effects, right? Right. And so, what previous work has done in this paper, as well as in many others, has shown, first of all, that incomplete purifying selection to some extent, but not very substantially, impacts the shape of genealogies. So this is primarily done with forward simulation models, where, for example, here, if we look at the simulations where the cost of deleterious mutations is increased. Of deleterious mutations is increased. And we look at things like total tree length or the external branch tree length or the time to MR to the most recent common ancestor. What you see is there are kind of some changes in these kind of tree shape statistics, especially kind of at intermediate strengths of selection. But compared to kind of that stochasticity inherent in the genealogies, right? Inherent in the genealogies, right? Their conclusion was: well, it's not a huge impact, right? And this is consistent with kind of earlier work in that area. And then there's other papers that especially kind of talk about asymmetries of trees and so forth. And so, generally, kind of from this literature, I don't want to, you know, maybe it's too strong of a conclusion, but that the Strong of inclusion, but that the shape of the genealogy is somewhat impacted by incomplete purifying selection, but not to a huge extent, right? So maybe we can ignore that, right? But what about mutation distribution? So this paper, as well as a few other ones, have looked at actually the proportion of singletons on external branches relative to internal branches, so forth. What you can see from this slide is just here is the strength of selection increases. Here is the strength of selection increases. The average proportion of segregating mutations that are external increases precipitously, right? And whereas the average proportion of tree length composed of external branches stays pretty constant. And so what this indicates is that with incomplete purifying selection, that a lot of these kind of mutations on the tree, they're not randomly distributed. Tree. They're not randomly distributed, you know, according to branch length, you know, but they're actually, there's kind of more mutations on the external branches than would be expected. Okay, so many of you have probably already know all of this. Okay, so they have in their paper this kind of one paragraph, and I'm not going to read the whole thing, but they say that the shift in the distribution of mutations towards the external branches. External branches is particularly relevant to the large number of coalescent estimation procedures that have been developed over the last decade. All those methods assume that observed segregating mutations are selectively neutral, and applying these methods could lead to considerable bias, both in estimation of effective population size, the population growth rate, et cetera. And I'm underlining population growth rate here because this is what's oftentimes being Oftentimes being really kind of estimated, and there's a parameter of interest, you know, in these phyodynamic models for viral and infectious diseases. Okay, so this is going to be a research paper. So what we decided to do was actually structure our analysis to see how much tree shape and oxygen mutation distribution would actually be impacted in the context of kinds of parameterizations that are relevant to viral infectious diseases. To viral infectious diseases, and then to actually see whether phylodynamic inference would be biased. You know, do we actually get biases in intrinsic growth rates that are estimated, et cetera? So what we did, we used SLIM. And I know that the VERS hybrid program actually had a whole session on how to use Slim. So that was great. So what we did, we used Slim to We use SLIM to simulate stochastic exponential growth under realistic epidemiological parameters. So, here we used a birth rate of 0.3 per day, a death rate of 0.1 per day, corresponding with an average duration of infection of 10 days. This yielded, of course, an exponential growth rate of 0.2 per day with a doubling time of three and a half days. So, something that's similar to kind of pandemic flu or SARS-Copy 2. A basic reproduction number of three. Mutation rate. Um, mutation rate, um, which is similar to that of SARS-CoV-2. Um, and um, we simulated for 55 days, um, sampling kind of serially, um, 1% of infected individuals upon recovery. So, we had about 200 samples, you know, per simulation. And we consider different fitness effects of mutations from zero, so it's neutral, you know, to 0.02, 0.04, you know, 8%, 16%, 32%, 64%. And we being And we being, you know, David did this, ran, you know, 100 simulations per parameterization. Okay, and then what we looked at was based off of those simulated trees and those simulations, we looked at tree-shaped statistics and then generated kind of these trees to generate sequences to go into the phylodynamic inference, which were. Inference which were used those trees but distributed mutations on those trees according to just branch length. So we didn't use the mutations that actually occurred, so we could just look at tree shape. And then what we did was we actually used the mutations that also occurred in the simulation so we could ask about phylodynamic inference and whether it would be impacted if there was that change in mutation distribution. Okay. Okay, so let's look at first the impact of incomplete purifying selection on just tree shape and also tree topology rather than mutation distribution. So what we found was under that parameterization, if we look at just the proportion of the tree length that's external, remember these are serially sampled sequences, right? We don't see any We don't see any effect of fitness cost of those deleterious mutations on that proportion, right? So this is pretty flat. We also looked at the second index, which tells you kind of how asymmetrical a tree is, and it's kind of a normalized version of it. And we also found that the fitness effect of the mutations wasn't actually impacted, sorry, did not actually impact kind of the asymmetry of those trees. The asymmetry of those trees under those under those mutation rates that we looked at. And then we, you know, because we didn't find any kind of effects here, we then actually looked at mutation rates, which were in order of magnitude higher so that each transmission event, there'd be on average about three mutations that occurred at the birth of a new infected individual. And what you can see here, again, is the proportion of the treatment. Is the proportion of the tree length that's external that increases slightly here as the fitness effect increases. If we looked at the second index here, we can see kind of this little U shape, which is very consistent with previous simulation work outside of infectious diseases, where you see kind of more asymmetry in, or you expect to see more, and you do see more asymmetry in the topology. In the topology of a tree at these intermediate fitness effects. Okay. However, then, when you, regardless of whether we look at kind of the low mutation rate though, or the high mutation rate that actually has this impact on tree shape, when we perform phylodynamic inference, and this is just with a coalescent exponential model, what we find is that there's actually not That there's actually not much bias at all, which is great. So, here the true exponential growth rate is 0.2, and you can see, regardless of whether we have a high mutation or low mutation rate, we can recover that. And we can also recover kind of the age of the root. The true one is zero, right? And we can kind of recover the clock rate as expected. So, here we didn't really expect that there would be bias in phylodynamic inference, mainly because tree shape was not that impacted by incomplete purifying selection. So next, what we looked at was whether incomplete purifying selection would then have an impact on the mutation distribution as it was shown to have kind of in these previous studies. Studies, which were not, you know, specifically looking at infectious diseases. And what we see here is: if we look at the proportion of mutations that are on external branches, right, we can see that there's an increase here, you know, with an increase in the fitness effect. And this is at the low mutation rate, low and kind of realistic mutation rate. We can also see that the ratio of mutations to tree length that are external, so we expect that to be one, actually. Expect that to be one actually increases, right, the higher the fitness effect. And then the clock rate also increases, right? So this is consistent with what I showed beforehand with before of Mahan Dafari's looking at external versus internal branch clock rates. So we have these impacts on the mutation distribution, right? However, then, you know, reassuringly, Reassuringly. We also, you know, when we use these trees that have that mutation distribution, which is observed, if we do phylodynamic inference based off of those simulated sequences, we can actually still recover the true exponential growth rate and the age of the root. I put in your preliminary analyses, things still kind of have to converge. But here you can see at least kind of up to about a six. You can see at least kind of up to about a 16% fitness effect. We can recover that exponential growth rate and the age of the root. And as you can see here, the clock rate is of course kind of higher if the mutations are just neutral and it declines when there's kind of delterious mutations that arise. Okay, so just to conclude here, You know, previous work has shown that incomplete purifying selection is really readily observed in viral populations, you know, sampled at the epidemiological level. From the population genetic literature, we know that the primary impact of incomplete purifying selection is not to change the shape or topology of the tree, but instead to actually just change the mutation distribution, right? And so when we looked at this in the context of these simulated This is in the context of these simulated biophylogenies using serial sampling, at least. We kind of found our results were consistent with these previous findings, right? But it seems like none of these impacts on mutation distribution and also the tree shape actually biased biodynamic inference, which is really, again, nice and reassuring. One thing we're kind of finishing off right now, and we didn't, you know, we don't have ready quite yet, we have still a Don't have ready quite yet. We have still a week left to put in our final analyses. It is really kind of how much of this, you know, I think it's wonderful that there isn't this bias, you know, that we're seeing, but how much of that lack of bias is really because of just the serial sampling nature, kind of, and that these sequences that we have are actually sampled over time rather than just at a single time point. And so we are. And so we are performing some simulations right now that are actually looking at sampling in different ways and seeing whether phylodynamic inference really is just being rescued because of the serial sampling that is generally done. And with that, I want to just call out David Ross Musman again for kind of really fun collaborative work here. Collaborative work here. And then thanks again to Noah, Tanya, and Mike for the invitation. That's it.
