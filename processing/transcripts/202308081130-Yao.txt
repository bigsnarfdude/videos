Thank you for the introduction. So, first, I'd like to thank the organizers for the kind invitation. It's my great pleasure to participate in this workshop in Hangzhou, this beautiful city. So, today I'm going to talk about the Bussy Nest equation, and I'm going to focus on the small-scale formation aspect. This is the joint work with Sasha Kiselev at Stuke University and my former student, Jamie Park, who is currently a postdoc. Park, who is currently a postdoc at the University of Basel in Switzerland. So, let me first introduce to you the 2D incompressible Boussines equation. So, throughout this talk, I'm going to use rho to denote the density of an incompressible fluid, which is the scalar-valued function, and u is the velocity field, which is vector-valued. Throughout the talk, I'm going to assume that we live in 2D. Assume that we live in 2D. So the spatial domain is either the whole plane, the 2D torus, or we also consider a strip with the upper and lower boundary. And for simplicity, we can assume the periodic boundary condition in the horizontal direction. So throughout the talk, I'm going to assume that the density equation does not have diffusivity. So the only thing that the density is doing is being transported by the incompressible velocity. It by the incompressible velocity field. Okay, and then the incompressible velocity field satisfies this equation right here that is similar to the there's the learning curve in using this presenter. So the velocity satisfies this equation, which is similar to the Euler equation or Navier-Stokes equation. So the viscosity coefficient mu can either be fixed. can either be fixed, sorry, can either be zero or positive. And then so the two equations are coupled by this term right here. Okay, so it means that the gravity is pulling the density down. And I'm going to denote the positive density by the red color, which means the gravity is trying to pull it down. And the negative, which means lighter density, I'm going to do. Which means lighter density, I'm going to denote it by blue color, where the buoyancy is trying to pull it up. Okay, so notice that I'm going to allow rho to be less than zero, but this doesn't, the positivity or negativity doesn't really have any meaning, okay? Rho equal to zero doesn't mean vacuum. I know that most of you are from the compressible fluid community. Of course, that makes a lot of difference, right? But for incompressible fluid, so if you subtract So, if you subtract rho by a constant, it's going to satisfy exactly the same equation because the velocity of u is incompressible in the whole domain. Okay, so without loss of generality, we can consider rho equal to zero being the average density, and then the rho positive means heavier part, rho less than zero means the lighter part. Okay, so for both the viscous case and inviscid case, our goal is to show that the solution can have small The solution can have small-scale formation, which means that its certain Sobolette norm is going to grow to infinity as time goes to infinity. So, that is the goal. And let me start with the viscous case. So, when mu is positive in 2D, it's well known that's the global well-posedness of regular solutions. So, namely, the result is known by for both the whole domain. Whole domain. This was done by Ho and Li and also Chai in different slightly different soboleft spaces. And also for bounded omega, the global regularity is also known by Lam, Han, and Zhao, and also Hu Kokavi Sansa in different sublife spaces. So these are the global regularity results. And it's also a natural question of, well, once we know the global regularity, what can we say about the upper bound? What can we say about the upper bound of the Sobolev norm of solutions, right? That is also known. So, Zhu shows that for a bounded domain, the H1 norm of the density can at most grow like this super exponential growth, e to the ct squared. This bound was improved by Kukavita and Wang into an exponential function for the H1 norm of density. And they also shown that the W2P norm of the velocity is uniformly. Of the velocity is uniformly bounded in time. And for the whole domain, they got something that is the slightly worse bound. And more recently, this bound has been further improved by Tukavita, Massad, and Zyn, where they show that for a bounded domain, the H2 norm of the density will have an upper bound that is still exponential, but the growth rate can be made arbitrarily small. Of course, at the expense that if the epsilon is smaller, Explains that if the epsilon is smaller, the coefficient will become bigger, though. And the same thing can be said for the H3 norm of the velocity. Okay, so these results all deal with the upper bound of the so-called norm of solution. And a natural question is that, well, how good are these upper bound? Can they actually be achieved? Or can we have some lower bounds to say that, well, the solution can actually have their sobolet norm growing to infinity as time goes to. Growing to infinity as time goes to infinity. So, to the best of our knowledge, the only lower bounds that we are able to find in the literature is obtained by Brendel-Lees and Schoenbeck. So, their results deal with the whole domain R2, and they show that if the initial density does not have mean zero, then the L2 norm is going to have a polynomial growth rate with power one-quarter inch. So, the way that I So, the way that I picture this is that let's try to imagine that in the whole plane, everything has the density zero, except that there is this heavier ball of fluid initially hanging in there. Okay, so then the gravity is going to try to pull it down, and then the more it pulls it down, the potential energy is going to keep converting to the kinetic energy, and therefore, this blob of heavier fluid. Blob of heavier fluid is going to go faster and faster as it goes more and more downwards. However, this is just the growth of the L2 norm of U. It does not necessarily imply that the higher derivatives in U or the Sobolev norm of rho will be growing in time. So, to the best of our knowledge, we were not able to find any example of infinite in-time growth of the Sobolev normal row in time. So, this motivates our In time, so this motivates our study. Together with Sasha and Jimmy, we proved the following result in the torus. So in the viscous case, if our initial data is smooth and it satisfies some conditions that include both some symmetry assumptions and sign assumptions, then we show that the H1 norm of the density is going to grow to infinity. is going to grow to infinity with a pretty slow rate, which is the power law rate that is t to the 1, 6. Okay, so the, okay, let me now walk you through the symmetry and sign assumptions. We assume that the initial data row 0 is even about the x1 axis and odd about the x2 axis. Okay, so this is what the initial density looks like. And then as for And then, as for the initial velocity, we assume that the horizontal velocity is not even and the vertical velocity is even odd. So, notice that the symmetry is going to be preserved for all time. And then, in addition, we also assume that the sign of the initial density is non-positive, is non-negative on the upper half of the torus and non-positive in the lower half. In the lower. Okay, and finally, we made one extra but crucial sign assumption that initially along this vertical line, we assume that the initial density is equal to zero. Okay, so that is the symmetry and sign assumption. It's easy to check that these assumptions will be preserved for all the time, and then we prove that under these assumptions, the global in-time solution has this rate. Okay, so one natural. Okay, so one natural question is that how sharp are these estimates? So one easy thing that one can check is that under these assumptions, one can show that the H1 norm of rho actually has a sub-exponential upper bound for some alpha between zero and one. And therefore, the actual growth will be somewhere between L G. Somewhere between algebraic growth and sub-explanation. So, before talking about the proof, let me see whether I can. Talking about the proof, let me just briefly talk about the motivation, why we believe that there should be the growth of the sole norm in this case. So, the idea is as follows. Well, so under this initial Well, so under this initial configuration here, due to these symmetry assumptions, we are going to have that both this line and that vertical line, they are going to be streamlined. Okay, so it means that whatever that starts in the upper half of the torus will be remaining in the upper half forever, and so does the lower half. So then, and also they are not allowed to cross this line because that vertical line is going to be a Is going to be a streamline as well. So, under these topological constraints, because also that this density is just transported by an incompressible velocity field, right? So, under these constraints, the configuration that one can possibly get with the lowest potential energy would be that the heavier parts try to go down as much as possible and the lighter parts try to flow up as much as possible. Blow up as much as possible, right? So, if you believe that this should be the asymptotic behavior as time goes to infinity, then you should believe in small-scale formation because the density here is pinned down to rho equal to zero for all time due to these symmetry and sign conditions. And therefore, there should be a very rapid change of the density across this vertical axis. Right, so that is our motivation of why we want. Of why we want to prove such a result to begin with. At the end of the day, unfortunately, we are not able to justify this is the actual asymptotic behavior. So that part is still open. The only thing that we are able to show is that, well, the H1 norm do have to grow to infinity with this polynomial. Okay, so our proof works to make use of a, it's a quite solid. It's a quite soft argument, it's pretty short. So, we define the potential energy and the kinetic energy, which is well known to this community. And it's also well known that when you are adding them up to have this total energy, it is not increasing in time. And actually, for due to the viscosity, it's decreasing in time where we have this term that relates to this viscosity coefficient on the right-hand side. Okay, so this means if we So, this means if we are grabbing the right-hand side and integrating it from zero to infinity, then we are going to have the time integral is going to integrate to a finite number, right? So that is going to be one crucial fact that we will use. And the other fact that we are going to use is that because the two equations are coupled by the gravity force, let's also just track the evolution of the potential energy itself. Okay, so we take. Okay, so we take one derivative of the potential energy, which gives us something that is not too exciting. It's just rho times the vertical velocity. So this term is uniformly bounded in time, but other than that, we can't say too much of it. However, something more useful will happen if we take one more time derivative. So taking one more time derivative of the potential energy and do some manipulation, we get these three terms on the right-hand side. Three terms on the right-hand side. Okay, at the first glance, they look a little bit scary, but looking at it more carefully, we have that, well, this term, which is very lengthy, it's actually small in the sense that if we are integrating it from zero to infinity, it's going to give us a finite number. This is because this multiplier here is something that is very nice because rho is already bounded. This guy is one derivative better than... This guy is one derivative better than rho, so that is uniformly bounded. And here it's bounded by the gradient u squared, which we know that its time integral of the L2 norm is finite. Okay, so this term A of t really has a finite integral, even if we are integrating it from time zero to time infinity. And then what about the rest of the term? Well, so let's say that towards a contradiction, let's assume that, so I actually want to So, I actually want to prove power law growth, but let me now prove an easier argument to say that it has growing to infinity in some way. Okay, so this is because towards a contradiction, if we are assuming that there is no growth in this H1 norm, then we can use Cauchy-Schwartz to say that if we are integrating V from time 0 to T, it can grow at most T to the power one half. Okay, so understand. One half. Okay, so under this assumption, if we integrate this whole expression from time zero to time t, we know that a integrates to a finite number, b integrates to at most t to the one half, the left-hand side integrates to a finite number, and therefore this orange term there, which is the crucial thing that we are going to use, can integrate to at most t to the one. Okay, so if we are having something whose time integral integrates to something that is sublinear. Integrates to something that is sublinear, it means the integrand will need to decay to zero in some way, right? Roughly, it has to decay like t to the negative one half. Otherwise, the integral would be exceeding that value. So, and then what does it mean by this term decays to zero? Well, the way to intuitively understand it is that, well, we are going to show that if this quantity becomes This quantity becomes super tiny as time gets large, then under this assumption that rho is pinned down to zero, it actually implies that the positive sub-life norm of rho needs to be huge. So I won't be able to show you the proof of the lemma, which is by a free argument, which is not too hard. But let me just give you a proof by a picture that this quantity being tiny means that. This quantity being tiny means that rho is very close to a horizontally stratified function, right? Because the only way that this quantity is equal to zero is that rho is perfectly horizontally stratified. So you can imagine that this quantity being tiny means that rho is in the distribution sense very close to a horizontally stratified function, but it is pinned down to zero along this line. And therefore, if this is the case, Therefore, if this is the case, it must have a pretty rapid jump across this line, which results in a huge positive solar level. So more precisely, we are able to establish this kind of relation between these quantities. And then it means that, well, we actually have this H1 norm is growing to T to the power one. So this is where the contradiction comes out. And then a more careful argument balancing these power. For arguments, balancing these powers will give us the algebraic process. So that is the viscous case. So we also have some results for the inviscid case. So in this case, I'm going to work with the density and the vorticity instead. And for the inviscid case, whether smooth initial data can lead to a blow-up in the absence of boundary is an outstanding open question. And people hear about this question not only because People care about this question not only because they care about the 2D Bucinesk equation itself, it's also because this equation is strongly connected to the 3D axis symmetric Euler equation if we do this conversion. Okay, so the two equations share very similar feature except at the axis of symmetrization. So and for the inviscid equation, if there is a presence of boundary or Boundary, or if the initial data is not smooth. So, in either one of these two cases, there has been many exciting developments on finite time blow-up. The first result in this direction is the very convincing numerical evidence by Ho and Lu, where they consider the 3D axis symmetric Euler equation set up in the periodic cylinder, and their numerics suggest that there can be a finite time singularity formation along the boundary. Formation along the boundary of the cylinder. And motivated by such results, rigorous proofs of singularity formation were done by El Guindi, John, Chen, Ho in either the case where the domain has a corner or the case where the initial data is not smooth but only C1O. Okay, and there has been also some recent results using the numerical results using the Numerical results using the physics-informed neural network. And very recently, Chen and Ho put up an argument. It's a very impressive argument that is the combination of both computer-assisted proofs and also a lot of different analysis tools. And they rigorously proved that so for 3D axis symmetric Euler and also for 2D Bussinesque, there is a nearly self-similar blow. A nearly self-similar blow-up or smooth solutions, where they have to choose their initial data to be really close to the blow-up profile. And the proof is a lot of work. So their two preprint add up to more than 300 pages. So together with Sasha and Jane Pegan, we want to look at the problem from a different angle. So if we are not so ambitious to prove blow-up, if we To prove blow-up, if we just want to understand why the norm has to grow to infinity, either in finite time or infinite time, then can we construct some initial data with infinite in-time growth for a broader class of initial data? Okay, so that is our goal. And we were able to do this for the 2D Business equation on the strip. The proof is something that is very Proof is something that is very simple, so I would like to show you briefly. So, our setting is as follows: So, this is the two-dimensional strip, and we are going to assume that the initial density is even about the vertical axis. The initial vorticity is odd about the vertical axis. Okay, so these symmetry properties will be preserved for all time. And in addition, we assume that the initial density along this axis is heavier. This axis is heavier, so the gravity will always be pulling it down because this axis will be a streamlined forever. So, whatever particle that stays here, starts here, have to remain there forever. And the initial density there is lighter, and therefore the gravity force will always be trying to pull it up. Again, because these boundaries are also streamlined due to the symmetry assumption. Okay, and for a technical assumption, we also assume initially. Assumption: We also assume initially the vorticity integral in this right half is positive, but that can be removed at the expense of having these growth at starting at a later time. Okay, so under these assumptions, we are able to show that as long as the solution is still alive, its L infinity norm of the velocity needs to be growing linearly, its L P norm of the vorticity. norm of the vorticity needs to grow superlinearly. So the L infinity norm needs to grow at least like t cube. And also the gradient row needs to grow at least quadratically. Okay, so the proof is a very short argument and I can actually show it to you in the next page. So let's look at this right half of the strip and so let me name this yellow part to be Q and I'm going to And I'm going to look at how the integral of the vorticity is evolving in this right hand. Okay, so we just take the time derivative of this integral, and some very elementary computation shows us that there are two terms. The first term is the contribution from the velocity, the invection effect, which is actually equal to zero due to rho being incompressible. And also, Being incompressible, and also the left-hand right, all the boundaries of Q are actually streamlines of the flow. Okay, so the only contribution comes from this integral of the partial one of the density. And the fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that this integral can be broken down into the two integrals on the right-hand side minus on the left-hand side. And because we know that's the density. We know that the density at the zero at x1 equals zero is forever heavy, and the density on the other boundary is forever light. It gives us that the integral of vorticity is really increasing linearly. Okay, so what does it mean? Well, it means that, well, Green's theorem tells us that the integral of the velocity along this boundary is exactly equal to the integral of the vertices. Equal to the integral of the vorticity in the interior, and therefore the boundary velocity integral is growing linearly, and therefore the L infinity norm of the velocity is growing. Okay, and combining this with the fact that, well, we are having a huge integral along the boundary, but the homokinetic energy inside the domain is bounded due to the energy conservation. And combining these two facts together, we can These two facts together, we conclude that the velocity has to change very rapidly in the very thin boundary layer of the boundary of Q, because otherwise we do not have enough budget of the kinetic energy to support these huge contour integrals of Q. Okay, so that leads to that is how we improve the linear bound of the U into the U into the super linear bound for omega. So that is the idea. And so for the domain without a boundary, we were also able to get some infinite in-time growth, although it is of a worst rate. It is only t to the power one-half. But to the best of our knowledge, so in the domain without a boundary, this seems to be the first time. This seems to be the first time that infinite in-time growth are obtained for the Bucinesk equation. And we were also, so I mentioned that, well, there is this analog between the 2D Bucinesk and 3D Euler. So we were also able to adapt our arguments to 3D Euler. We were able to show that, well, in a cylindrical domain where the cylinder has an inner and outer boundary, in this case, if the initial velocity Case, if the initial velocity is such that the angular velocity along this ring is large, but the angular velocity along that ring is small, then for any such initial configuration with the right symmetry and they satisfy that assumption, as time goes to infinity, it needs to have its velocity growing at least linearly, whereas the kinetic energy is going to be found at. Energy is going to be bounded, okay? And also, the vorticity is again going to grow with some super linear rate. So, these are all the results that I would like to talk about. So, the main idea that we would like to do is that we want to track some physically relevant functional. Some are conserved, some have the right monotonicity. And by combining them and look at By combining them and look at how they interplay with each other, we want to use these softer arguments to show that the solution can have its certain norm growing to infinity. Okay, so hopefully this is like a new approach compared to these previously more hardcore approaches of small scale formation. So let me conclude with this free boundary Bussinesk equation. Free boundary boosting as equation in Singapore airport, and you guys are welcome to visit me. Thank you. Thank you.
