Yes. Can you hear me? Yeah. Okay. So it is my honor to introduce Alan Pillet from University of Notre Dame, who will talk about definable Galois theory at homomorphic vector bundles. Okay, thank you. Thank you to the organizers for inviting me to this online workshop. Somehow there's been a lot, a lot of online Somehow, there's been a lot of online talks been listening to and been participating in. And it's anyway, thanks for the invitation. By the way, I'd be happy to sort of have questions, interruptions even, because I feel really weird giving these talks when no one's, it really feels strange. So just interrupt for any, interrupt for some gratuitous reason if you feel like it. Okay. Gratuitous reason, if you feel like it. Okay, it doesn't. I don't mind. Just so this talk is, it also doesn't, it doesn't fit completely into the workshop. There's no dynamics, but there's a little bit of complex geometry and some differential fields. Okay, so and maybe there's a bit too much model theory, although it's just I'm just using a few words, model theory words, but I'm not going to explain. Words, but I'm not going to explain. In fact, I'm going to use a lot of words that I will not explain what they mean. Just hopefully, I convey some gist of things. So, what I'm talking about originates in a certain paper by Remy Jawee, Leo Jimenez, and myself, relative internality and definable vibrations, vibrations, definable vibrations, vibrations. And also, this is part. And also, this is part of which we just wrote a couple of months ago. It's also connected with just ongoing discussions with Remy Zhaoi. So, Leo was my student and he's now in Lyon. Remy is still here for another year and we're talking about this material a lot. The idea is to transplant what the idea, not so much of the paper. Not so much of the paper, that paper I referred to, but of what it's become, is to transplant the Galois theory of linear differential equations, or more generally, log differential equations on algebraic groups, to compact complex manifolds, using partly the analogy between the model theory, the theories DCF0, differentially closed fields, and the theory CCM. Theory CCM compact complex manifold. So CCM means compact complex manifolds. There's no connection with the Chinese Communist Party. Okay, it's just cease, it's compact, complex manifolds. And now, in fact, Rahi mentioned to me that he has a student thinking about similar things, but one could also look at compact, complex manifolds, and you could kind of add a derivation in some suitable sense. But I don't want to do that. I'm just looking at. Want to do that? I'm just looking at that theory of, and the point is that the general point is that in DCF0, we have some so-called algebraic objects, which are things in the constants. And we have some non-algebraic objects, if you think of the finite dimensional part, and how these interact is very interesting. And the same thing in CCM, we have algebraic varieties and non-algebraic manifolds, and that's the kind of analogy. Now, the standard model. Now, the standard model of CCM, so CCM we think of as a theory. The standard model is simply the many sorted structure. And this is the language people use for the category. This is the language people use. This is kind of what they people call bimeromorphic geometry. It's the geometry of compact, complex manifolds and related objects, such as Zariski open subsets, Zariski open sub-varieties. It's a structure whose Structure whose sorts are the compact complex manifolds up to isomorphism as compact complex manifolds. Or if you want varieties, you allow singularities. So I hope people know what that means, complex manifold, compact. And the relations are simply closed analytic sub-varieties of Cartesian products of sorts. That's it. Okay. And an analytic sub-variety is Variety is a subset which here which is closed and locally given by vanishing of holomorphic functions. Okay. And all elements of this standard model should be named by constants because a single point in a model is like a sub-variety. So all elements are named by constant symbols, essentially, morally. And this theory cc. And this theory, CCM, in this language I described, in the language what I described as quantify elimination, totally transcendental, and finite morning rank sort by sort, which is basically Zilber from 30 years ago. Okay. That's my first slide. I've got about I've got about twelve slides, so maybe five eleven slides, maybe five minutes or so a slide will be okay. Five minutes or so, a slide will be okay. That is just introduction to CCM. All right, on the other hand, in differential Galois theory, the basic objects consist of a pair of things when characteristic zero. We can also ask characteristic p, but characteristic zero, a differential field k with a derivation together with the solution set of some linear differential equation dy equals ay. equation dy equals ay over k. Now dy equals ay, this is in vector form. So y is going to be a column vector, n by one column vector of unknowns. This is a derivation applied coordinate wise. A is going to be an n by n matrix over k. This is the typical vector form of a linear differential equation. Okay, now what do I mean by solution? What do I mean by solution? So, a solution of this is going to be an n-tuple. Okay, and the solution set, I mean what? The set of solutions can be taken in an ambient differentially closed field, U containing K. You could take the differential closure of K. You could even take less. You could take, if you want, a differential field maybe containing K, maybe algebra. Maybe containing k may be algebraically closed, maybe, and containing a fundamental system of solutions of my differential equation. So this V would be a subset of, I don't know if anybody can see, maybe, okay, I'll just say it, this V will be a subset of U to the N. It'll be a collection of n tuples. Okay, in fact, it'll be a vector space over the constants. The differential Galois group attached. Galois group attached to this data is what? It's the group of permutations. So I'm thinking now of V as a solution set in some ambient differentially closed field, for example, is the collection of permutations of V, abstract permutations, which preserve all polynomial relations on tuples from V with coefficients coming from both the base field K and the The base field K and the field, I'll call it math canographic C, of constants of my ambient differential field, differentially closed field. That's the Galois group, right? Preserving all polynomial. Now, I say polynomial relations, maybe you should say, shouldn't I say differential polynomial relations? Well, because it's a first order equation, it's enough to fix just the polynomial equations. That'll imply fixing all the differential polynomial relations. Okay, that's the differential Galilee group. Okay, that's the differential Galois group analogy with the Galois group attached to an ordinary polynomial equation over a field. And this Galois group has naturally the structure of an algebraic subgroup of G Ln C, where C is the constants of my ambient differential field, and N is the dimension of this vector, n to one by. Of this vector, it's an n by one vector, that's the n. Naturally, it has a structure of an algebraic subgroup, and this is differential Galois theory. Of course, the Galois group depends not only on the equation, but it depends on the choice of the base differential field K. And when K itself is differentially closed, or when P is even Picarvesio closed, I mean, when K, for example, contains example contains a fundamental system of solutions of my linear differential equation then the Galois group is trivial okay so non-triviality non-triviality of the Galois group so the Galois theory here depends on the base field not just on the equation okay I think we all know this okay that's my say a little bit about uh about the uh rights. Right. What about an analog in CCM of this picture? I'm talking about CCM. I'm not adding a derivation to CCM. I know there was some work by a few people, Rahim Moshe is here, Martin Hills maybe, on taking CCM and adding an automorphism, a little bit like what Piotr was talking about. Talking about. You add it and right, you, but I'm not doing that. I'm not even adding a derivation. It's just straight CCM. What's the analog in CCM of all this? Well, the analog of the field of constants, in fact, the correct analogy is not between differentially closed fields and CCM, it's between the finite dimensional part of differentially closed fields and CCM. Anyway, the analog in CCM of the field of constants is the sort of projective line. Is the sort of the projective line, P1 of C. This is a sort, right? This is a complex complex manifold. It's a sort. And in that sort, algebraic geometry lives on that sort. So when I talk about in that sort, I don't mean just subsets of P1C. I mean subsets of Cartesian products of P1C with itself. And all of algebraic geometry lives there, including non-projective. Non-projective so first of all any closed analytic sub variety of P1C to the n is a projective variety by Chell and the rest of algebraic geometry is there too affine space lives in P1C as P1C take away a point and a point given a point is named so so all of algebraic geometry lives in P1C and we call this sort just P because I want to refer to P as the sort not only in a standard model but in a Standard model, but in a non-standard model, of course. Okay, any interruptions at this point in time? No? Now, to get any reasonable analog directly for differential Galois theory, we better work in an elementary extension. I call it a star. When I add a star to some object, I typically mean Object, I typically mean that object viewed in the elementary extension of my universe, non-standard model. We better work in, I don't want to go into the reason why, but the reason is because all elements of the standard model are named by constants. By constants, I mean constant symbols, and therefore this is a model, and inside that model, there's no Galois theory going on. There's no Galois theory going on, you better work in an elementary extension. So, what do I mean? So, what do you have? You have a suitable non-standard compact complex variety of manifold, V. This is a, you know, how do you view this thing? Well, typically, I'll mention later, what do you mean by a non-standard, compact, complex variety? You typically have some vibration in the standard model. The vibration makes sense in the non-standard model. Makes sense in the non-standard model, and then you take a fiber over a non-standard point. This is a typical example of a non-standard compact complex variety, and they orderize like that. So, defined over A, a non-standard point in A star, over which V is defined, we consider, what do we consider? The group of permutations of V, abstract permutations, right, abstract algebra, abstract set theory. Abstract set theory, permutations of V, which preserve all quantifier-free definable relations between tuples from V, where these relations have parameters from both A, this tuple A, and from the sort of the projective line in the non-standard model. Okay, that's what I mean by that group of permutation. So this is the analogue of what I. Of permutations. So, this is the analogue of what I said before about the differential context. And we'd like that group of permutations to have the structure of an algebraic group over this non-standard. So, C star means the complex field upstairs in the non-standard model. We'd like it to have the structure of an algebraic group, which I'll call Gal V over A. So this is. V over A. So this is so this definition is exactly as it's the exact definition we gave for the differential context, but it's now with because right is now in this other in this other context. We'd like it, indeed not have, we'd like to have a structure of an algebraic group. Now, what is the connection of all this stuff? This looks very kind of weird because you're doing non-standard analysis in some sense. What's the connection with actual actual With actual complex manifolds. So V lives in a non-standard universe, okay, but it can be considered, you could think of it as the generic fiber of a vibration of compact, complex varieties in the standard model, essentially unique up to what we call bimeromorphism. Bimeromorphism is the complex analogue of birational bimeromorphism. So we view this. So we view this non-standard set V variety V as a generic fiber of a fibration of actual compact comics manifolds. Let's say what I mean exactly. Well, this element A in the non-standard model, you could think of as a generic point of a compact complex variety Y. A standard complex variety, look at the generic point upstairs. Take B a generic point of V over A in this non-standard model. A in this non-standard model, then the pair BA is a generic over A point of some complex compact variety V in the standard model, and the map B A to A induces a meromorphic dominant map V to Y. So this V to Y are compact, complex, complex varieties in the standard model. Okay? I'm sorry for this non-standard stuff. I think one can translate everything I'm saying back into the standard world, but we didn't do it yet. But we didn't do it yet. So, in any case, this Galois group, if it exists, is an invariant of this vibration, V to Y. So, you find a vibration V to Y, and you hope to get an algebraic group, the Galois group of the generic fiber, attached to this vibration. So, we can ask lots of questions. First of all, so which vibrations of compact, complex varieties or manifolds does this even make sense? The technical question for model theorists is technically, when is the generic fiber V internal to P? I'll say internal to the projective line. This will mean that sentence, an algebraic, it'll mean. Number two. Number two, right? So what is the, so for which vibrations do we actually get this Gal V over A being an algebraic group, even being defined? Secondly, what's the vibration analog of a linear differential equation? All right, what's that? And I claim the answer is a holomorphic vector bundle. All right. I'll say more about this later. Three, this is the analogue of the inverse problem of differential Galois theory, which possibly linear algebraic groups are realized as the Galois groups attached to the suitable vibrations and vector bundles. Okay, so this is what I want to talk about, and I will try and deal with these questions at the I will try and deal with these questions at the very end. But at this point, do we have any questions? I'm sorry, things look a little bit weird with the non-standard stuff going on, probably, but never mind. Okay, now I'm going into some background. I'm going as a background. I'm going to have four slides of background. Let me see. Background, background, background. Yeah. Four slides of background, a lot of which will be about differential context. So where did this thing come from? So among the motivations for where this discussion came from was an attempt in the paper by Remy, Leo and By Remy, Leo, and myself to find essentially new DAV means differential algebraic varieties. This is now, we're now back in differential algebra. To find new DAVs, differential algebraic varieties, X, this just means set of solutions of systems of algebraic differential equations living in my differentially closed field, which are orthogonal to the constants. So, again, the context here is a differentially closed field. I'll write it U with a derivation, field of constants C, and a differential algebraic variety X assumed to be finite dimensional. So X is not the full, could not be the full affine space over U, which is infinite dimensional. It's finite dimensional or finite order. It means if you take a It means if you take a point in X and you start taking derivations of that point, of that tuple, then the transcendence degree you get over some base field is finite. Now, what's it mean to be orthogonal to the constants? It means there should be no means not constant, it doesn't non-constant differential rational maps from X to C. So we look at this definable set, this differential. This definable set, this differential algebraic variety in my universe. And we're looking at differential rational maps, maps from x to the constants, given by quotients of differential polynomials with parameters anywhere you want, with coefficients anywhere you want. And differential rational is like a rational fact, means it's defined almost everywhere. Fact means it's defined almost everywhere. You know, for differential algebraic varieties, we have the notion of irreducible, and if x is irreducible, a differential rational map should be defined on a Colchian dense set, open dense set. Okay, so it need not be defined everywhere, but defined generically. And orthogonal means there are no such, a non-constant means not a single value, not with a single value. That's what orthogonal. So there's no such. That's what orthogonal. So there's no such maps. This is the right. I'll come to the CCM situation later, but the CCM analogue of this is having algebraic dimension zero. In certain situations, such maps can be seen as rational first integrals. So we're working very, very model theoretically, but sometimes your differential equations are over, say, Ct and you. Are over, say, Ct, and you can view all these notions as coming as integration in some sense. The opposite property to being orthogonal to the constants is when x is internal to the constants. What it means is that there are many such differential rational maps to the constants, many such. In some situations, it means complete integrability of the corresponding differential system. Many such would mean, for example, if I take my x. For example, if I take my X and I take two generic, two general points on X, they can be separated by such maps. Okay, that's what you mean many. And for order one sets, internality coincides with non-orthogonality, up to some such factor. Now, by the way, and a certain aside, this internality to the constants, this internality of the constants is what gives The constants is what gives rise to differential Galois theory. For example, the solution space of a linear differential equation is a vector space over the constants. So when you fix a basis, it can be identified with c to the n. So is that internal to the constants. So all my rational maps from the vector space can be defined over the basis B. And the Galois group is parametrized by the orbit of this B, this basis under all. B this basis under automorphisms of the ambient differential field which fix k and the constant point by point. So that's the connection with internality. Now there's been lots of work in finding new strongly minimal differential algebraic varieties or Fognon to the constants and this was the content of part of the content of Ronnie's talk on was it on Tuesday? Ronnie's talk was Tuesday if I'm not mistaken. Mistaken. So used or strongly minimal or Pan Leve Nishioki irreducible. It turned out the notion of strong minimality was already known to Pan Leve, it seems, and to Nishioka, who made it more precise. So that's what they were doing. New strongly minimal. Strongly minimal means a differential algebraic variety with no proper positive dimensional differential algebraic sub-varieties. Varieties, but we're interested in something different. We want composite examples. So we want examples where X has a fibration with the fibers in themselves internal to the constants. So we want to get new examples, very new examples where X is orthogonal, but it actually has a vibration over some other differential algebraic variety Y with a fibers internal. With the fibers internal. So it's kind of covered by a bunch of fibers, which are themselves internal in the constants, but the total space X is not, is orthogonal. This was the notion of a new example. Now, this is close to the work of Jin and Musa and Rahim, who studied the following thing. This is all differential stuff going on. They looked at the pullback X, they looked at the set. Pullback x, they looked at a set y defined by x prime equals fx. This is all defined over c. So we think of c as the complex numbers, part of the constants of my differential field. Look at x prime equals fx called the set y defined by that. Look at the pullback under log derivative. Log derivative takes y to dy over y. Okay, so they were looking at studying x. So the So the fibers are going to be solutions of linear differential equations. However, Jin Musa assumed x, the base y was internal to the constants, were interested in character, and they wanted to characterize those x when x, so sorry again, they look at x, a pullback under log derivative of a set y defined by x prime equals fx. They assumed y internal to the constants. They wanted to characterize. Constants, they wanted to characterize when X is or is not internal to the constants. Right? And remember, internal to constants means has enough differential rational match to the constants. They succeeded in doing this. They gave a criteria for doing this, a very nice criteria. We want to do something quite different. We want to assume orthogonality of y to the constants and characterize. And characterize when x is itself orthogonal to the constant. So we're doing something a little bit different. We want to assume the opposite of what Jin Musa assumes and characterize when x is itself. So you assume y has no rational functions, differential rational functions to the constants. X is fibered over Y by solution of limb differential equations, and you want to calculate when X itself. And you want to capture it when x itself has no differential rational maps to the constants. We succeeded in doing that in this paper that I refer to before. Okay, we did that. I don't want to give, I do not want here to give the actual theorem. I just want to say that we worked. Say that we worked with slightly more general systems than Jin and Musa. We work with systems x prime is fx and y prime equals y g of x, where g and f are both rational functions. So they write they work with y prime over y equals x. They had y. over y equals x they had y prime equals y x without any lg of x rational function so the total space is the x y space is fibered over the base with fibers y prime is y g of y times ga where a is the element in the base and this of course is a linear differential equation over a over the base a now among the new examples so in fact i The new examples, so in fact, I talked about this in Kent. There was a meeting in Kent representation theory in July of last year, like a different time and place. And I think quite a few people who are here, I mean, Jason was there, Rahim, Moshe, and I wanted to talk about, try to give such examples. And I wrote something down wrong, and Omar found a counter, Omar found a mistake in what I was saying, but eventually we found. Was saying, but eventually we found the examples. In any case, among the new examples is the following: the base is x prime is x cubed, x minus 1, which we know is orthogonal to the constants. And y prime is yx. So this is log derivative, y prime over y equals x. So the conclusion is that this total space defined x, the collection of x, y, with this satisfying equations, defined by the system is. Defined by this system is orthogonal to the constants, has no differential non-constant rational match to the constants. Okay, that was the so this was just an example of one of the things we found, but we actually had a nice characterization of when of when this works. Now this context, the general context here, pi x to y, where the fibers are internal to the constants. Fibers are internal to the constants, we called a situation of relative internality. And orthogonality of x to the constants was closely connected to the notion of, to Jimenez's notion of non-uniform relative internality. So the point is you have here x to y. Each fiber in this case is simply a solution of a linear differential equation. Okay, so you can the fiber. So, the fiber can be identified with C or C to the n after naming some parameters. And the point is, this is happening to get orthogonality of x. This should be happening very non-uniform fashion. And that's part of Leo's thesis. Okay, background four. Can you find analogous examples? So, this was also part of our examples and this was also part of our what we're going to do can you find similar examples in ccm okay where you have now so similar examples where you have x and y should now be compact complex manifolds in the standard model y should well i will i will define what i mean by the analogues now you take an irreducible compact complex variety x or manifest Complex variety X or manifold. What's called, so this is here living in the standard model. A of X means this is called the algebraic dimension of X, is the transcendence degree over C of the field of meromorphic functions on X. So Meromorphic functions on X is the analog of rational functions. These are, these would be quotients of holomorphic functions. Quotients of holomorphic functions, they're not defined everywhere. So, what is the look at the transcendence degree over C of the field of metamorphic functions? You call this the algebraic dimension of x. Now, a of x equals zero means exactly that x is orthogonal to p, where p is this sort of the projective line. P is the sort in CCM which supports algebraic geometry. What's algebraic geometry? Algebraic varieties. So A of X is zero means exactly, so we can define orthogonality in the usual way in model theory, but it just means that exactly A of X is zero. So you could take X orthogonal to P, it's the analog orthogonal to the constants, it's just no non-constant meromorphic maps. The opposite case is when the algebra dimension of X is the dimension of X, and it means Of x and it means basically you can separate points by meromorphic functions. It exactly means x is internal to p at least you can separate generically points in x. That's also known as moishes on. And moisture on manifold has this property, or even just algebraic. So to be algebraic is like being an algebraic variety. Like being an algebraic variety, it's something we're here defining generically. So you could be moisturizing. I think could be moisture zone, even though it may a manifold could be moisture zone, but it may have a little small sub-variety, which is which is not moisture zone. But generically, it's connected with the, with, is algebraic. So that's what they call algebraic. So the word algebraic here, in fact, algebraic in model theory has another meaning. It means finite. meaning it means finite when you say the algebraic closure we mean uh of something that of a field you mean the elements which satisfy a definable in a formula with finitely many other solutions but algebraic here means something else it means like an algebraic variety and it's the notion of algebraicity uh okay in complex in in complex geometry you can say when is a complex manifold an algebraic variety that's what's going on here so mateo So Matteo Toma in 1989, I mean the paper was 1989, gives examples of rank two holomorphic. So I think we know what a holomorphic vector bundle is. A vector bundle over some manifold is a total space, is a map of the manifold where the fibers of vector spaces over C, over the complex. Over the copper and it varies holomorphically. Okay, yeah. Uh, Tom asked a question here in the chat. Should I, yeah, I didn't, I didn't. Oh, sorry. I'm not, I'm getting so. I can just say it so you don't have to read it. So in the motions on, when you're describing the motions on manifolds, why does algebraic dimension equal to dimension of x mean that you can actually separate points? Why wouldn't it just be that it's a finite cover? Wouldn't it just be totally right, Tom? This is there's a few subtle things, not subtle, there's a few fudge things, but it's true. It is true that such for different reasons, it's a true fact, okay? Okay. It's what we call a true fact. Maybe Raheem can remind us at the end why it's true. But it's true, Raheem, isn't it? Is Raim still there? I don't know. Anyway, it is something which is, yeah, on the face of it. Yeah, on the face of it, it looks like it's in the algebraic closure. But but uh yeah, okay good, thank you. So Toma gives examples of rank two holomorphic vector bundles over suitable K3 surfaces and two-dimensional complex tori y. So y can be either a two-dimensional complex torus or a K3 surface. K3 surface, there are certain compact, complex surfaces, where the assumption is that y has no curves. So this is a surface, it contains no one-dimensional analytic sub-varieties. By the way, this exactly mean that y is strongly minimal. Precisely, right? So it's like these people know what strongly minimal means in the same way as Nishioka knows what strongly minimal means in differential. They know strong minimality, and it means a surface, well, in this case, a surface with no curves. No curves, and you and then you like, and the point is that so you take E, now take this vector bundle, it should be called E, vector bundle E over Y. Now you take the projectivization of E, you make every vector space projective space, right? By looking at the collection of lines through the origin, you would do it again. This works hollowed by this works over the charts. And the requirement is this has no, I should say. Requirement is this has no, I should say something, it has no this would be a three-dimensional each each fiber is dimension one, the base is dimension two, and uh the condition he says it has no surfaces, two-dimensional sub-varieties, which produce, these are all complex dimension, which maps onto Y dominantly. I messed up little things. He gave an example of this. He called them strongly irreducible. irreducible and uh yeah uh so let x be this total space pe pi x to y the projection then we show actually the same thing we show that x is orthogonal so so the base here y it'll be a strongly minimal locally modular set it'll be strongly minimal and orthogonal to p. To P, very non-algebraic. Just because it's a surface with algebraic dimension zero, it couldn't be. So y is orthogonal. X would be orthogonal. Okay? And yes, that's right. Yeah. So, so, right. So, AMX is zero. The generic fiber, which you see outside in the non-standard. Which you see outside in the non-standard model will be actually definably isomorphic to P1 of C star. So the generic fiber, which is going to be you take a point of Y in the non-standard model, take the fiber of above it, that'll be isomorphic definably to P1 C star. So this will be an exact counterpart of what we said before, an exact counterpart of the differential context. So it gives examples. Now in Thomas' paper, he doesn't actually say this has algebraic dimension zero, but it's Say this as algebraic dimension zero, but it's which it's true. Now, I want to now talk in the last three slides, this will be 10 minutes maybe if I can do it, about projective bundles. So, I will now give a few details. I want to give a few details of what I just did and bring in different, bring in the Galois theory back into the picture. Okay, good. Let's do some theory. You take a. Let's do some theory. You take a rank n plus one holomorphic vector bundle over a compact complex manifold s. Okay, let p e be its projectivization. So this is a definable set in my standard model. Now, a very basic result which Rahim worked out explicitly in his thesis and in a paper he wrote on standard Riemann existence theorem, Transactions AMS 2004, is that for is that so i've got e i've got p e goes to s vibration projective projective bundle is that there's some subjective holomorphic bat pi t to s pi t to s so it's like a base change and t the final product of t and p over s in a natural sense t goes to s p goes to s is bimeromorphic with t cross p n With T cross Pn over T. There's a bimeromorphic. So after base change, you can identify this bundle with T cross Pn, where all the fibers are Pn, where N is the PN, such that for general T, G sub T, you put T in for here, induces a biolomorphic map between the fiber P E over pi T and Pn. And PN. This is Raim, I think, says that it's somehow implicit literature, but he wrote a proper proof. A consequence of this is that for generic S in S star, so S is now S by S star, I mean the non-standard model. S star, S is the S in a big model. Take generic S, so it lives outside the standard model. There's an isomorphism in quotation marks between the fiber. This is P E, this is the. Pe, this is the star version of PE, the fiber over S, this should be S star, and P n of C star. But this is defined over an additional parameter T star. So you get exactly this new parameter T star is needed to see the isomorphism, in particular with its nality to P of the S star definable set, this fiber, the fiber, the generic fiber. And we can ask about the Gal. And we can ask about the Galois group, as described in the introduction. If the base S was algebraic, an algebraic variety, then by Gaga, so is PE algebraic, and the Galo group is trivial. Everything inside is internal, is contained in the sort P without additional parameters because A was chosen to be a model and all elements are named. Are named. So interesting Galois theory come into the picture only when S is not algebraic. Let's assume now that algebraic dimension of S is zero and that N equals two as in the Thoma context. So in Toma context, algebraic dimension of S was zero and N was exactly two, right? So dimension of the projective bundle fiber is one. Now non-orthogonality Non-orthogonality of PE to P, non-orthogonality of the total space to the constants, means exactly there's some non-constant meromorphic function f on PE. It means exactly this. So if A is a generic point of the fiber above S star in the non-standard model, then actually I can apply F star, the meaning of F in the non-standard model to A, and I get an element C, which is a Which is a non-standard complex point. But as S has algebraic dimension zero, C is independent from S star. So I'm using some model theory, whereby it follows by rank computation that this element A is an algebraic closure S star C. And we see the Gaunt group is trivial, right? Because this is a generic point of this fiber. And it's in, it's already algebraic over. it's already algebraic over the the base point and some point in in the in in the in the in in the sort B so this implies the Galois group is the the Galois group is is finite okay so in fact under our Carol assumptions the fineness of the Galois group is equivalent to non-orthogonality of P e to P it's equivalent so largeness of the Galois group is a strong version of orthogonality Strong version of orthogonality. So orthogonality of P to P can be a little bit quantified with a very strong case being large Galois group. Now this large, in this context, we're talking where the basis has algebraic dimension zero, and there's probably some connection with the Kadira Spencer map. All right, now we've got a few minutes left. I've got not much more to say. What I want to try and say is that in this particular example, And say is that in this particular example, I want to try and prove in this particular example the Galois group is as large as possible. So it's a very strong form of orthogonality. So first of all, using the description of projective bundles P E to S that Rahim made explicit here, by that description, you can show that the Galois group of the You can show that the Galois group of this generic fiber I talked about is naturally an algebraic subgroup of PGLNC star. In fact, yeah, in general, in general, in the context where, okay, I'm going to mix between C star and C. It doesn't matter. Now, in the Tomer example, which we described, mentioned before, PE has no irreducible analytic sub-varieties of dimension two mapping onto Dimension two, mapping onto S dominantly, mapping onto S. We claim that the Galois group G of the generic fiber is precisely PGL2C. If not, its connected component is a proper connected subgroup of PGL2C. It could be C or C star, it doesn't matter. So a proper connected subgroup of PGL2C is contained in a Borel subgroup of PGL2C. So stabilize is supposed to be. 2c so stabilizes a point so right so pgl2c is the automorphism group of p1 or p1 star so uh it's acting on p1 right so otherwise so otherwise g0 is a proper connected subgroup of pgl2 so contained in a borel subgroup which so stabilized at a point in p1 going through the whole galois theory setup yields going through the whole galois theory Through the whole Galwarth yields a multisection, S to P. We have this vibration P of E to S. A multi-section means, you know, it's like a finite valued meromorphic section gives this multi-section using going through the whole Galois theory setup. And this yields a two-dimensional analytic sub-variety of PE projecting onto S, which is a contradiction to the to the to the to the uh properties of this uh of this projective bundle okay so what i've what i've shown here is that uh in this particular situation uh you can quantify orthogonality by uh by galois theory right uh by the way this whole galois theory i'm i was talking about galois theory upstairs you know but you can translate all of Know, but you can translate all of this probably routinely into just talking about the original bundles of vibrations. Additional things. I've got two minutes left. Additional things. We've so far been discussing projective bundles, which are compact, so projective bundles are themselves compact complex manifolds, so they're sorts in A. There's no, but take the original holomorphic vector bundle. Now, Now, why should a holomorphic vector bundle E to S, where S is now compact complex manifold, defi as a vector spaces? Why should that also be definable? Well, in my structure A. And in fact, Jean-Benoît Boss just told us a little brief argument why that's the case. I can maybe say that at the end if there's a question. Yeah. Yeah, so again, we now pass the holomorphic vector bundles. The general fiber ES star will be a C star vector space, and the Galois group will be an algebraic subgroup of GLN, C, or C star, if you want, where N is the rank of E. So this looks like the analog of the Picard-SEO theory, although it's funny that so when the base So, when the base S is an algebraic variety, E, the vector bundle is also algebraic, the Gao group is trivial. So, this only makes sense when the base is algebraic. And this was, and I would claim that the analogue of the Picard-SEO theory is the Galois groups attached to Holomorphic vector bundles. Okay, there were other classes of vibrations, such as elliptic vibrations, even over an algebraic base. Even over an algebraic base such as P1, where the Gamma group makes sense. And it's not necessarily linear algebraic. And Remy, I think Remy, Joey, will give a seminar at Notre Dame, Model Theory Seminar will have one next week. And Remy may be discussing such examples, in particular, special case of this inverse problem in next week's model theory seminar. And it's actually, it's my It's it's it's my time is 12:50 because I'm two hours difference on the dot. So at this point, I'm going to stop. Thank you very much. Thank you. Other questions? Any questions for Anand? Yeah. Yeah, it's true. I mean, I guess I can't remember why, but I think it's actually Moshezon's theorem, right? But if the algebraic dimension is equal to the dimension, then the manifold is bimeromorphic to an algebraic variety. Yes, yes. You go from a finite. Variety. Yes, yes. You go from a finite to one relationship to that might have been the original theory that that got being model theoretically algebraic over something algebraic implies being generically in bijection with something algebraic. That's the point. Yeah, that's exactly. It's an important result of Moish's office. Yeah. But the corresponding thing is not true for differential equations. Thing is not true for differential equations. No, it's not true. In fact, this was something which was something which I wrote something about this actually a long time ago, I think, exactly about, yeah, about that in, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, there's this where you take square, a two-to-one cover of the constants, which cannot, which is not. So almost internality and internality are not the same in DCF, but they are the same in CCM. I wrote something called Remarks on Comp. Yeah, I wrote something called remarks on compact remarks on I know something or other 2000 2000 something okay so that's the end of my that's the end of my talk. Yeah sorry sorry if it's a bit different a bit remote or different Can I ask actually I did have one one little question about this the difference between the projective bundle The projective bundle and the holomorphic vector bundle. I mean, I don't see why there'sn't why is there a question there, but it being definable? I mean, isn't it risky over? You'd like it to be, take a holomorphic, take an arbitrary, first the projective bundle. The projective bundle is itself a compact, complex manifold of variety, okay? Yeah, just a fact. Each fiber project, I think it's a fat compact. So it's one of my sorts. But to be, you know. But to be, you know, for an arbitrary complex manifold to live in this world of bimeromorphic geometry, it should have a nice compactification. We know, right? Not every complex manifold lives in the world of bimeromorphic geometry. Algebraic varieties do, but not other complex. So you want a compactification or something like that. And the point is you can do it by doing the following. You can find it definable as in the form. It definable as in the following. I mean, you take, sorry? I was just gonna. I mean, the construction of the projective bundle corresponding to the vector bundle exhibits the vector bundle as Zariski open in the projective bundle. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, because the projective bundle is a quotient of the. You're not embedding it. You're taking projectivization. I mean, the other way to see it is to embed it in one higher. other way to see it is to embed it in one higher in one higher dimension you take your you take your vector but your vector bundle v okay now you you take product with it with a trivial that with a trivial line bundle over the base s let's call it e v cross e take projectivization p of v cross e inside that you have projectivization of v Have projectilization of V, and the difference is exactly V. So, okay, it's not a big deal, but it's you have to see that, okay? Yeah, yeah, no, no, I was mistaking the projectivization with exactly the construction you're describing, the embedding in one higher dimensional. No, no, no, no, it's the it's becomes a smaller dimensional thing, sure. Yeah, so Okay, so let's thank Hannan again. Okay, thank you very much.
