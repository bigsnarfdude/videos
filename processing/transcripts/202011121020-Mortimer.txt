Organizer for inviting me to give this talk. My name is Tatum Mortimer, and I'm a postdoc in Yonatan Grads Lab. So we just heard from Kevin about using GWAS to identify novel antibiotic resistance determinants in Neisseria gonorrhea. And now I'd like to tell you about the work we've been doing in the Grad Lab to understand genetic mechanisms of. To understand genetic mechanisms of antibiotic susceptibility and also adaptation of Neisseria gaudoriae to its primary sites of infection. So we have observed that Neisseria gaudorhea occasionally reverts from antibiotic resistance to susceptibility. Sometimes this occurs just through a recombination event where the resistance-associated allele is replaced with a susceptible allele. However, we also Alleles. However, we also see isolates encoding resistance alleles that are more susceptible than we would expect. So, in this same collection that Kevin talked about of almost 5,000 genomes, we used multiple regression to predict MICs from the presence of known resistance associated alleles in the genomes. And we found that for azithromycin and ceftraxone, which make up currently recommended dual therapy, as well as for ciprofloxacin, some isolates. Ziprofloxacin, some isolates have measured MICs that are lower than we predicted. So, if you define unexplained susceptibility as an observed MIC that is at least two doubling dilutions below the predicted MIC, we find that over 5% of isolates have unexplained susceptibility to azithromycin, and we also see unexplained susceptibility to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. So, we wanted to know what the genetic mechanisms of What are the genetic mechanisms of antibiotic susceptibility and how frequently they occur, and then also what selective pressures result in this increased susceptibility. So to do this, we used GWAS. And in case anyone joined late and missed Kevin's talk, I'll quickly go over how we've been doing GWAS in the grad lab. We've been using a linear mixed model approach, which is implemented in PISER. So I would encourage Piser. So I would encourage anyone who is interested in bacterial GWAS to check that out. I put a QR code here. And so briefly, we use UNITIGs as our genetic variants, which should include SNPs and small insertions or deletions, but also differences in gene content. And we use MICs as our phenotype instead of like a binary resistant or susceptible category. And we've also been incorporating population structure using a similarity matrix. Structure using a similarity matrix from the phylogeny. And while Kevin talked about in his talk how we've also used known resistance determinants as covariates, here we just use the country of origin of each isolate. So here is a Manhattan plot showing the results of this GUAS for azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin. The genomic position for a gonococcus referenced For a Gonococcus reference genome is shown on the x-axis, and the significance of each variant is shown on the y-axis. So, points correspond to variants associated with increases in MIC, and crosses correspond to variants associated with decreases in MIC. So, you can see that we identified known resistance determinants for all three drugs, including GIRA for ciprofloxacin, 23S, rRNA for azithromycin, and PENA. For zithromycin and PenA for ceftriaxone. However, we also found a variant associated with increased susceptibility to all three drugs that map to the gene MTRC. So, Kevin mentioned in the last talk that we might have predicted resistance-associated unitigs mapping to the MTR efflex pump, but this is actually a susceptibility-associated variant. So, MTRC is a component of the NTR Eflex plan. Is a component of the NTR efflux palm, which is the major efflux palm for antibiotics, fatty acids, and other hydrophobic molecules in Neisseria gonorrhea. The variant is in, it's a two-base pair deletion in this dinucleotide repeat region. So it leads to a frame shift in MTRC and a loss of function. And actually, when we looked at MTRC in our whole data set, we also found that there were other mutations resulting in. Mutations resulting in premature staph codons. But this two-base pair deletion is by far the most prevalent. And we think this is probably just because of maybe a slightly higher mutation rate in this repeat region. So we confirmed that the NTRC loss of function mutation was associated with susceptibility both in our data set and in the lab. So here I'm showing the isolates with the NTRC loss of function mutation have. Loss of function mutation have lower azithromycin MICs than those with intact versions of MTRC. This is also true for ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin, even in the presence of known resistance determinants. And we also confirmed this in the lab by comparing a clinical isolate with the MTRC loss of function mutation to an isogenic mutant transformed with an in-frame version of MTRC. So these two isolates, the only difference. Isolates. The only difference between them is that one has the MTRC deletion and the other one does not. And you can see that the MICs are higher for all three drugs and in the isolated where MTRC is in frame. So we were kind of surprised to see this susceptibility associated variant so often in our data set. We found it in almost 4% of isolates. Of isolates and previous work in cell culture and in the mouse model had actually shown a fitness benefit for expression of the NTR efflux pump, even in the absence of antibiotics. And MTRC mutants don't have a different growth rate in the lab, so it doesn't seem like it's just a fitness cost related to production of the pump. And so we wanted to know what environmental pressures might select for loss of the E-flight. For loss of the efflux pump. We know that the primary infection sites, which include the urethra, cervix, pharynx, and rectum, differ in oxygen content, iron availability, pH, the presence of other microbes, immune responses, antibiotic diffusion. And we've also observed that some Gonococcal lineages seem to preferentially transmit among heterosexuals, where the primary infection sites would be the urethra. Infection sites would be the urethra, pharynx, and cervix, or as opposed to some lineages that primarily transmit in men who have sex with men, where the primary infection sites would be the urethra, pharynx, and rectum, suggesting that gonococcus might adapt to infection of particular anatomical sites. So you can actually see this here on this phylogeny. This is just a collection of genomes from New York City and From New York City, and there's two main lineages. The one in that's labeled in orange seems to preferentially transmit among heterosexuals, which are labeled in orange and yellow around the outside. And then the lineage in black preferentially transmits among MSM, which is labeled in black around the outside. So, when we looked at the available metadata for our collection, we found that the loss of We found that the loss of function mutations in MTRC occurred more often in isolates from heterosexual patients and specifically in cervical isolates. So, to verify that this association was not just a result of our sample, we also looked in a validation data set of over 2,000 Gonococcus genomes that represent all the cultured isolates collected in Victoria, Australia in 2017. So, this is a data set that was recently published by Deb Williamson's group and should be relevant. Group and should be relatively unbiased, and that there was no selection for resistance isolates when they were considering what to sequence. And in this validation data set, we also observed that the NTRC loss of function mutation was associated with isolates from the cervix. So, previous work in other species showed that overexpression of proton-dependent efflux pumps result in a And efflux pumps result in a fitness cost under anaerobic conditions due to cytoplasmic acidification. So, we hypothesize that cervical infections, which would be a microaerophilic environment with low pH, may select for loss of proton-dependent euflux pump activity in Neisseria gonorrhea as well. So, to test this hypothesis, we wanted to show that the association between pump inactivation and cervical infection holds true for an activator. Cervical infection holds true for an activator of the MTR efflux pump, other proton-dependent efflux pumps in Neisseria gonorrhea, and the NTR efflux pump in other species that cause urogenital infection. So the components of the NTR efflex pump, NTRC, D, and E, are encoded in an operon that is regulated by a repressor, NTRR, and an activator, NTRA. There are two alleles of this activator and This activator, and there's a wild-type allele, and then an allele with an 11-base pair deletion that causes a frame shift. And so, strains with the loss of function form of NTRA no longer increasing expression of NTR-CDE in the presence of antibiotics. And when we looked at the distribution of NTRA loss of function in our data set, we also observed an association between the loss of function allele and heterosexual. Functional allele and heterosexual networks and cervical infection. Okay, so we've shown that this is true for MTRA. What about proton-dependent efflex pumps, other proton-dependent efflex pumps in gonococcus? Neisseria gonorrhea encodes several efflex pumps. So we looked for loss of function mutations in all of them. However, loss of function mutations were pretty rare, except for in FARA, which is a component of the FARAB efflux pump. Notably, Pump. Notably, Far AB is the only other proton-dependent efflux pump in Neisseria gonomia. And again, we found that this loss of function mutation in FAR A is associated with cervical infection in both our global collection and the validation data set. Okay, so this is like a little bit of a tangent, but when we looked at the phylogenetic distribution of these mutations, we found that the MTRA and NTRC. That the MTRA and MTRC loss of function mutations are essentially non-overlapping. And we think that this is because of the regulation of MTR-CDE expression. I mentioned earlier that MTR-A is an activator of MTR-CDE and that there is also a repressor, MTR-R. And so in many Gonococcal Isolids, and certainly the majority of our data set, there are mutations in either NTRR or its promoter that result in over. Or its promoter that results in overexpression of MTR-CDD. So if the repressor isn't functioning correctly, you essentially get constitutive expression of the pump. And so in these isolates, a loss of function mutation in the activator, MTRA, is not really expected to change expression of MTRCDE. So the only way to decrease expression of the pump is loss of function in one of the pump components. Also, function in one of the pump components. Yonatan likes to say, and I apologize if Yonatan is on the call because I might not be remembering this exactly right, but that the strains with NTR-CDE overexpression mutations are like a radio with the volume button broken. And the only way to turn it off is to break the whole radio. And in our data set, we do find that the NTRC loss of function mutation almost exclusively occurs in genomic backgrounds that already have a mutation. Backgrounds that already have a mutation associated with NTR-CDE overexpression. And I won't get into all the details of FARAB regulation, but NTR-R also influences FARAB expression, and we think that the distribution of FARA mutations across the biology also makes sense. And if you actually look at all the cervical isolates in our data set, 43% of them have a loss of function mutation in either MTRC, MTRA, or FARA. Okay, so lastly, what about other species that cause urogenital infections? Most Neisseria, with of course the exception of Neisseria gonorrhea, primarily colonize the pharynx. And when we looked in Neisseria meningenidis, which is the closest relative of Neisseria gonorrheae within the genus, we found that only 0.6% of genomes encoded an MTRC loss of function mutation. However, However, there is a Neisseria meningitis lineage that has acquired some gonococcus alleles that allow this lineage to grow anaerobically. And this lineage is associated with urogenital transmission among heterosexuals in the United States. When we looked at this lineage, we found that NTRC loss of function alleles were more common than in genetically matched pharyngeal Neisseria meningitis from Neisseria meningitis from the same sequence type. So, in summary, we used GWAS to identify a loss of function mutation associated with increased susceptibility to multiple antibiotics in the efflux pump component NTRC. And loss of function of NTRC and other proton-dependent efflex pump-associated genes are associated with cervical infection in both Neisseria gonorrhoeae and a urida. Neisseria gonorrheae, and a urogenital adapted lineage of Neisseria meningitidis. We are currently working in the lab and with our collaborators to further pin down the pressures in the cervical environment that are selecting for these loss of function mutations. And we are also working on further genomic analyses to look for other loci that might be involved in adaptation to particular sexual networks or sites of infection. So, if you're interested in reading more about this project, our manuscript was recently published in May 2019. Our manuscript was recently published in Nature Communications. Also, Kevin put together a really great Jupyter notebook to replicate all of the analyses in this paper and in his paper that he just talked about in the last talk. And you can find those on GitHub. So I'd just like to acknowledge everyone in the Groud Lab, especially Kevin, who worked jointly with me on this project, Ali, who helped us put together this genomic data set. This genomic data set, Dan and Yi, who worked on the experimental validation, and of course, Yonaton, and our collaborators and our funding. Kevin and I will both be at the discussion sessions later, but if you want to talk microbial GWAS or adaptation, please reach out to us on Twitter or at our email. And thanks, and I'll take any questions now. I was muted. I didn't realize it. Thank you, Tatam, for the excellent talk. I have one question now on the board. Toby was asking, how does the frequency of unexplained susceptibility compare to the frequency of Compound to the frequency of unexplained resistance? So, in this data set, actually, most, if you look at the total number of isolates that have MICs that are either greater or less than two doubling dilutions from what we would expect, there are more isolates with unexplained susceptibility than unexplained resistance. So so I I you you were very fast actually. I didn't realize I didn't understand this MTRC, MTIA, loss of function mutation. Is that you conclude because they used the computational method at the GWAS study and you say they are strongly related to the susceptibility. Susceptibility or it's actually experimentally confirmed. So the MTRC loss of function, we experimentally confirmed in the lab that it is associated with susceptibility to all three drugs. And then MTRA, the activator, has it's already known in the literature that in the presence of low amounts of antibiotics, it increases. Of low amounts of antibiotics, it increases the expression of MTR-CDE, and that the loss of function mutation means that the expression is no longer inducible. So, actually, one of the really commonly used lab strains in Gonococcus has the MTR-A loss of function. So that's been known for a while. So, it's more like a computational method that is confirming this. It's already known. already known uh the function is known but you would you didn't know that uh it's the cervical uh it's the cervical uh infection that a special um condition that is related to this right right so we um we didn't we didn't know how frequent these loss of function mutations were um they you know no one had looked for them and you know and these No one had looked for them in these large clinical data sets before. So we were surprised to find them at such high frequency. And we didn't know what selection pressures were relevant. And so the metadata really helped us start to answer that question. Looks like no other questions. If there are no other questions. I'll hop. If there's one minute, I'll hop. If there's one minute, I'll hop in with a question. Great talk. And this is both you and Kevin. I haven't got, admittedly, seen both of your papers. I haven't gotten to read them yet. So I appreciate the talks with the highlights. I will get to reading them eventually. But I guess sort of just a quick sort of technical question. Is it really important to control for or to include both the phylogeny and the geography in the GWASH? Like, did you try without the geography? The geography, and do you get a lot of spurious hits with that? Or, I mean, was it really important to do both? Yeah, so the geography, the reason that we put the geography in in the first place is just to potentially control for differences in MIC methodology across labs. For example, the CDC changed their methodology, which their uh their methodology which meant that every all of the thromycin at myces um doubled uh over over the years and we know about that so we can correct for that but we don't necessarily know about all changes in in all um in all geographies and and also uh we didn't do this in this in this gwas but we've since found that it actually helps to control for the for the individual study of each um of Of where the isolates came from, because we think there are some studies specific like sequencing artifacts that you can control for that. Right, that makes sense. Makes sense. Great, thanks. Related to that, it's not possible to control both, Jesse. It's because geography and phylogenetic structure are relation related. If you put both on, you may be double. So, in Ghana. So, in Ghana Kakis, actually, there is very, very little geographic structure. The lineages are sort of spread all over the world, all of them. And really, in just different data sets, you just get a different distribution of the lineages. Thank you. Now we are doing this later. So we have our coffee break and come back. Our coffee break and come back in eight minutes. Thank you.
