Start by recapping some of the stuff I talked about yesterday. So we start with like a specific type of algebra, gentle algebra, and then to that type of data we can associate a bunch of things. One is a marked surface, which was oriented by construction. This has a bunch of distinguished points on the boundary, which we call marked points. On the boundary, which we call mark points, and then there was this extra data which I didn't really talk about so much, and I still won't today, which was a line field, which sort of you can think of a generalization of a vector field. And maybe the only important thing you hopefully can remember towards the end of the talk is that this gives you a way to associate integers to curves, loops, things which are closed. And then I kind of started to say, oh, what can you do with that model? Um, what can you do with that model? And one thing was you can describe objects indecomposable objects in terms of curves in a certain way. And just one thing, maybe also to remember: in case these curves were loops, so these kind of closed objects, we've seen the Kronika example. Then these curves carry some extra data. There was like a side parameter we can also forget about, but the important things there was like a, they come in families, parameterized by some parameter. By some parameter, like band modules. So, if you can think of like if you have an arc, this was the other type of curve, you have sort of a single object living over that, up to shift. But for loops, you have a have a whole family of objects living over that. Okay, so this was one thing you can do with the models. You can relate objects and curves, and you can ask, can you go further with that? This relationship between topology and the triangle. The triangulated structure, and then so the answers you can, and I will keep this very short and just kind of give an idea what you can do with that. So, you have a bunch of relationships. So, if lambda is a dental algebra. And access further relationships and just make this in the form of a table. So let's say here we have the surface side, and here we have the surface side. The surface side, and here we have the side where we're in the bounded drive category. So, if you kind of classified objects, you can ask for morphisms between these indecomposables. And you can do this maybe in terms of a basis. So, an x, y in this case are supposed to be indecomposable, but it is just like a vague way to formulate these theorems. So, what can you do? Theorem. So, what can you do if you have curves? You can ask if they intersect, and this is exactly what kind of measures the basis. So, you can encode the basis in terms of intersections. Once you have morphisms, you can ask for mapping cones of maybe at least these morphisms. You can do this as well. So, Anest, this is maybe what you would call resolving intersections. So, vaguely, if you have a curve like this, you can kind of cut it at this point and glue it together in a different way. So, you get something like so. So, these are this is one curve, another curve, they're intersecting here, and then I cut that intersection point and then I glue them together in the other way. And that kind of procedure corresponds to these curves. This might be like several curves now, these are the indecomposable summons of the mapping column. That's the idea. You can do it for some more prisms, yeah, for all models. Yeah, if you give me an arbitrary linear combination of these, I'm not sure how to do this. This kind of boils down to similar to like. Like making transformation with matrices, and it's not so easy to describe what happens afterwards. If you just give me like a single basis element, I can do this, and that's also sufficient for most purposes. So you're a bit limited in that regard, but yeah, for some offenses, you can do that. So, what you're talking about is so the basis of the intercessions, but mapping them into the basics of all packaging. Basically, what is more valuable? Yeah, yeah, maybe I should specify that. Yeah. Being pretty vague in this kind of so there would be a basis between that. There would be a basis for that honest race and the corresponding description, provided that we take the minimal. Yeah, there's a lot of like things you have to do. A lot of like things you have to take care of and detail, so yeah, exactly. You have to make sure that there's sort of a minimum number of intersections, and then also if you have things corresponding to loops, there's certain morphisms which you can't see, namely identity you can't see, and you can't see the schedule of the identity in terms of intersections. So, there's some details. It's a very vague statement, it's not precise. Every intersection, well, every intersection corresponds to a basis element, but there's some basis. A basis element, but there's some basis elements which don't correspond to, but they're very controlled. Like, for example, if you have a band module, then obviously you have the identity and you have sort of the connecting morphism in the Auslan-Rayton triangle. You know this a priori. So you're not really losing much in terms of information, although you can't see them in terms of intersections. So that's the kind of idea. So you have all the information geometrically that you. Um, that you that you need with left outside course, right? Yeah, I didn't really talk about this so much today. Um, so you have you have a line field, and then I mentioned briefly yesterday, yeah, I didn't say what this is, this was isomorphism and shifts, but you can get rid of the shifts, but instead of taking curves, you take graded curves, and the grading on the curve you can define once you have a line field, and it's an extra choice you make. It's like instead of taking your projective, you can shift it around. Instead of taking your projective, you can shift it around in your draft category, and kind of that grading parameter tells you which shift you took. It's kind of an artificial choice. And then when you have intersections of graded curves, you can assign a number to that intersection. That's a topological thing. And then that corresponds to the degree here. So this is how you do that. But if you just talk topologically, then Talk topologically, then this would be the space. But if you don't have them graded, you can't recover the grading, so to say. But you still need to take it's not just from x to y, it's from x to all the shifts of y. That corresponds to the intersections. So if you want, you can model the orbit category of a gentle algebra topologically. And then, if you want to recover anything connected to the grading, you need a line field. You need a line field. Well, you also need a line field for these loops. That's roughly the difference, maybe. Yeah, exactly. This is what the next point. So this is kind of an extra thing I needed. This is like in the other paper, composition. And this is again, it's very vague. I just want to give you a flavor. What you do is you count triangles. Um, what you do is you count triangles, um, although this has to be interpreted in a loose term, so a composition of these spaces. So, maybe if I draw this quickly here. Quickly, here. So let's say that's, I don't know, X. This would be a morphism to Y. Morphism here. And then you have a curve corresponding to an object Z. And there's a morphism. Let's say this would be F, this would be G. Then you have an intersection. And if you have an intersection here, but there could potentially be many if because you. Be many if because you sort of have to consider this on a universal covering of the surface. Um, but so this this is uh this will show up. So this morphism corresponding to this intersection will show up in the composition. So like you type fg, this might be a sum of morphisms corresponding to some h i's, and this might be one of them. So if you have like strings, there's only one of them, but if you So, if you have like strings, there's only one of them, but if you have something with loops, and then if you go to numerous cover they come with infant curves, you can have several of these. So, but roughly speaking, this is what triangles contribute, tell you how the composition works. But if we're like, for example, on the boundary, and I didn't explain that, but these were the edges, or actually the projectives. And then this intersection also corresponds to a morphism, namely. To a morphism, namely the arrow, basically, and this as well, but there's obviously a composition of the path. So, this is kind of this big sector here. So, this is also what I mean with triangles and brackets. So, it's yeah, it's in details is always like a bit little bit more complicated, but so you're the rough idea is something geometrically triangles and the generations of those are compositions, mapping cones, and then maybe finally. So, we can do AR theory also very conveniently. And that would be what you would say, boundary rotations or twists. And so the picture is you have like a boundary component like this. And then, for example, the outside writing translation corresponds to a Else line-a-riden translation corresponds to rotating this boundary, every boundary at once by one mark point. So you would see rotated that mark points go to mark points, but you sort of twisted it like that. So and then yeah, that's the idea. This gives you topologically the Auslan-Royden translation. The Esloin-Wrighten translation. And you can read of the connecting methods and everything as well, but I'm not going to go into that. So, I mean, the upshot basically was very vague, is you can model everything of interest almost in the category. I guess you could if you do this properly, it's not something we've done. This properly is not something we've done because, yeah, the commentaries get a bit more complicated, but yeah, I mean, you have this lifting and stuff, yeah, yeah. Um, yeah, I guess you can, but yeah, going backwards, can you interpret a daint on the surface representation, right? Sorry, can we interpret the dame which on the surface anyway? Yeah, you can. Um at this, I mean, if you have a dim twist, and so this this needs to be so this needs to be around. So, this needs to be around the loop, so like the winding memory needs to vanish. And otherwise, you can't. The thing is, because sort of the symmetry group, we would see this later as not the whole mapping class group. So, not every D interest is in there, but only maybe some. One didn't wind it. Yeah, exactly. So that's the difference. So, but if you have every loop in terms of that's an embedded curve and you have vanishing winding number, then you have the spherical twist. And yeah, so like if. And yeah, so like at the end, we will see some like map from something into the mapping class group, and that also sends vertical twists to the interests of this sort. Okay. Yeah, something I wanted to say. So there's like as As a remark, so like this is for the for the drive category, but there's also a similar model by Karen Bauer and Raquel Valius Samesh or there's something missing for the module category. For the module category. And at least I think I can do objects and irreducible morphers over here. I hope I didn't forget anything. This also exists. And then yeah, maybe that is sort of the part where I would wanted to start a new section last time. And yeah, I'm like, okay, I haven't really said anything about Foucault categories, and also won't really be, I won't really. But so I mean, these kind of correspondences, from that point of view, something you would expect. But it's something what typically happens in Foucault categories. Well, at least in these surface cases. So something geometric corresponding to something algebraic in the rough sense. The question is now if. The question is now: if we understand this category very well in terms of topology, what can we do with that? And one is to try to answer the following question. So if lambda prime are gentle algebras When do we have that their bounded derived categories are equivalent? And at this point, maybe I should also say, because I will introduce that later anyway, this isn't out yet, but we're working on updates, so you can also do this for graded gentle algebras. And when I say grade, Gradiental algebras, it just means you just associate a grading which is potentially non-zero to an arrow, and then the grade algebra you get from that is the gradient algebra. So there's not nothing really specific to ungraded ones. And then in this case, you would replace the bounded derived category by the category of homologically finite-dimensional modules, modules. modules. Okay. So if it's one graded, then you should take this because, yeah, it's the appropriate ID. But you can think of that if you want. So I will just mention graded at some point because something will happen that doesn't happen for ungraded. So it's more interesting. Okay. January Mark, so like in the ungraded case, you might think, why is this even like a, well, this may be generally an interesting question, but these central algebras have the nice property that they're close under derived equivalent. So this is a result by Schrewer and Simmerman. So if lambda is gentle. Lambda is gentle. And when I don't write explicitly graded, I just mean degree zero. Okay. And P is an algebra, finite dimensional such that the boundary draft category of B is equivalent to the boundary rough category of lambda, then it already follows that B must be gentle. So there's a gentle quiver. So there's a gentle privilege, so that this is isomorphic to this kind of algebra. So if you just stay in degree zero, you would wonder: okay, then I only have to answer when does this happen? And the idea is to answer this with help of the surface. Syndigo, can do a theorem, and I will state a bunch of names, and I will explain. Bunch of names, and I will explain which cases did what. So here's one by Amio, Plamodon, and Ox Schroll by myself, then more recently Jin Schroll and Guang. And then with the update for the graded, which is not out yet, you can Update for the graded, which is not out yet. Yeah, I would explain that. So there's a theorem, and I will go write this on this side. So if lambda and lambda are prime. and lambda prime are graded or ungraded gentle algebras then then we have that there are bound drive categories of DFD they are equivalent if and only if they exist an orientation preserving Preserving diffeomorphism, say F from sigma lambda to the other one, which preserves the old structure. So it preserves mark point in the line field in the sense that. That if I take the pullback, which is you can define in a similar way as you pull back vector fields, then it's just homotopic to this. In a vague way, you can say everything we have in terms of structure, mark points, line fields, orientation is preserved. Okay, so Now, now, in terms of these things. So, in the first, this was independently and but in different with the different methods. This was in the ungraded case. Currently, this is graded and tomologically smooth. I mean, in that paper, they say also proper, but by our definition, these things are finite-dimensional. These different things are finite-dimensional by convention. So it's ungraded. And then if you have the, once you have the graded version of this model, you can basically do the same proof here and then just have graded. But yeah, this is as soon as this out, and there will be an update for that. And that's not yet. So, like, so far, it's only ungraded, and graded homologically smooth. But I will also tell you something now. But I will also tell you something now about the proof strategy because I will need it later and then you can see that this will won't change much. In the finite dimension case, just finite global dimension. This I think is equivalent, right? Otherwise, that the diagonal biomodule is perfect. I think we maybe seen that yesterday. That yesterday. So, in the sense that we have here, it's like you sort of don't have unmarked components. That's the geometric interpretation of that. Okay. So he All right, I see this might be a stupid question. You're talking about the graded ones. I mean, it's graded or differential graded. And no, I mean the damn minimum also, just like graded algebra. But I mean the drive categories are the same if you add like the NDHK. So you can always resort to that. Um where was I? Yeah okay so so um one direction I should attribute to this is already in HKK, Heidi-Nkatzakov-Konsevich, which is the independence of choices when they define the partially replaced category. And then here, as I said, like we have. Here, as I said, we have two different proof strategies to show that the surface and all the structure are derived from variance. And for the strategy that I have, the main ingredient is a certain map. So the main ingredient is the following. The main ingredient is the following. So, given an equivalence, you want to assign a diffeomorphism like that, right? And there's a way to do this canonically in almost all cases, but you can always find one. So, if you have an equivalence This determines a diffeomorphism check of psi of F between the surfaces. Between the surfaces. So, not only is there one, but like an equivalence gives you an actual, like, if you have different equivalence, you get different diffeomorphisms. And these preserve all the structures, like in Ethereum. And if I say this verbally, this is also a desikonomical one for almost all surfaces. There's a finite number of surfaces where you can find one, but you have a bit of choice there. Find one, but you have a bit of choice there. But for almost all of them, there's a unique choice. So there's a bit of an exception again going on. So how would you describe something like this? We have a bijection between objects and curves. So you would want something which kind of mirrors what this does on objects. Here, this should do on curves. And you can find something like this. So, this satisfies, so, like the following diagram computers, I should say. So, if you have an indecomposable, you can go to curves with this projection that we had. Let's say we call this gamma x. This sits inside this surface. And then you can go via your equivalence, get an indecomposable object here. Here. And you can also use the bijection you have here, and you get a curve which sits in the surface of the second gentle algebra. And then you want that your psi of f makes this commutative. But if you remember the chronicle example I gave at the end of last time, this should always. This should always send arcs to arcs and loops to loops, right? But this is not if, like, there were auto-equivalences which don't do that. So I have to blur this a little bit to make this true. But yeah, yeah, you like, yeah. Again, not going to be super precise with that. But I say, let me just say this is almost always true for almost all X. And then at least certain exceptions. Certain exceptions, like an Econica example, where I have the loops and the strings, where this is not true, but it's still close to being true. No, no. So, the idea is that you go through the R complex. So, if you have an equivalence like this, you know, so you can, so the R complex is a simplicial complex whose simplicities are collections. Simply, C's are collections of certain arcs. Like, for example, the projectors would be such a collection. And these are kind of rigid in a sense, so this kind of blurring between arcs and loops doesn't happen. And to an equivalence like this, you can associate a simplicial automorphism of the R complex. And then from homeomorphisms to simplicial, like isomorphisms on the R between the R. Isomorphisms on the arc between the R complexes, this is almost always an isomorphism, so you can go back. And it's always subjective, but sometimes not injective. So this is why sometimes this is not canonical. So this is the idea. So you don't really use the Vokai category, it's more like a theory about R complexes and their automorphisms. But some still some sort of topological facts, maybe. Yeah, yeah, I mean, this is a theorem. Like, I mean, this is like a whole Like, I mean, there's just like a whole branch where people compare automorphisms of, I don't know, comitorial gadgets out of surfaces, and this is one of them. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, these curves are up to isotopy, yeah, yeah. And they're like curves which are embedded in the interior, so like some simple, simple arcs, except for things on the boundary. So you kind of run, yeah, I don't have this spell of logically. Run, yeah. I don't have this problem logical. Um, yeah, this would what you call a triangulation, yeah. Um, maybe it depends on your definition of triangulation if you allow certain, yeah, but yeah. Um, so this is true for, I just say that, for almost all. And for the rest, it's kind of almost true, but I'm not going to say what this exactly means. Is the difficult unique up to action now in class groups? Yeah, except for these finitely many cases, there's a canonical one, yeah. There's a yeah, yeah. And like, yeah, this is really like from here you get a central isomorphism between the R complexes, and then except if you're in one of the special surfaces. Special surfaces, then there's a unique diffeomorphism which realizes that on the R complexes. Up to isotopy, sorry. Yeah. Well, you fixed me. I don't care about that, but it seems to me that if you act on the surface by a okay, okay. Yeah, this has to do with so like you want this, sorry, with this property. So it Sorry, with this property. So implicitly, here is this kind of chosen bijection which corresponds to your fixed model. So yeah. You've inputted the preferred equivalence to start with. Yeah. So like if you want this, then you have a unique choice, except for finitely many surfaces. Yeah. Okay. So this is this is one thing. So you can so before we had this theorem of, okay, we can compare draft equivalence glasses. But as I said, like this ingredient here suggests you can do even more. You can maybe say, oh, what if I have an auto equivalence of this category? I should get diffeomorphism. And this is what we want to exploit now. So, this would be like the last section. So, this is about Raf Picard groups of gradient dental algebras. And you also can obviously do this for ungraded, but it's a bit less interesting, let's say that. So, maybe just very quickly. So, if you have, say, this is quite a gentle, then just let me remind you real quick what the drive Picard group is. So, this are of lambda. This would be quasi isoclasses of invertible. Of invertible bimodules, e.g. lambda bimodules. Inadvertible, this means, so let's say we have one which is called n. This means there exists an n such that the derived tensor product over lambda. So, it's directed drive tensor product over lambda of this. It's isomorphic to the diagonal one, and vice versa. And otherwise, this gives you an equivalence of the drive categories and use one of those. Each of these. Suspension, you mean I can converse with a shift functor? Yeah, yeah. So, um, what I kind of glossed over is you not only get a diffeomorphism, but you get a great diffeomorphism if you keep track of that. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you can do it like this, and you get something sort of the shift in a kernel, or you can keep track of that and then like a slightly bigger group than just a mapping class group. Um, this will appear, but yeah. This will appear, but yeah, so that's it's better to do in include it with this because then you get you get a split, but yeah. So there's that, okay. So now if you apply this, just to So, this kind of correspondence what we have with the psi, so f goes to psi of f, this gives you a group homomorphism. Maybe, so sorry, so this is a group under the tensor product, the derived tensor product, like here. Um, this gives you a group homomorphism from derived. And from the Rife Pippa group, where it's beneficial to view them, yeah, I mean, okay, as equivalences of that, which I will also call psi into the graded mapping class group of this, which are orientation preserving. Preserving diffeomorphisms from this to itself. Again, preserving old structure. So it also means the line field. So that's a subgroup of the, well, yeah, of the mapping class group, if I write it like this. But as I said, you don't really consider just normal ones. Really consider just normal ones, but you consider graded ones. And that's just a way that you keep track of shifts as well. And that's an extra datum on the diffeomorphism. I won't say much more. But this group is a central extension of a normal mapping glass group. And the fact that it comes in is sort of a shift that you can do here. This is what I would call the graded. The graded class group. Okay. So you have a homomorphism, and then you can ask for the kernel, and you can ask whether this is subjective or anything. And in fact, it's not only subjective, but there's a split map. And that's exactly the group action on the Pokéa category. Collecting those so what you can prove if you do this carefully, so psi admits a split. Maybe you could call this alpha. Could call this alpha. This is arising, I guess is the action homomorphism from the group action. Of this mapping class group on this category. This category and I mean I guess in maybe like in slightly different setting, but this existence of such an action follows from DeGov Coprano's work. In this specific case, it's also very convenient to sort of use what they've done in HKK, which basically already gives you the group action, and then you sort of make this. Sort of make this explicit enough, and then you can calculate that this is a split. So, what you get is that you have a semi-dial product. So, the derived Picard group of lambda, so far we know it's semi-direct product of the kernel and the mapping class group. So, your final ingredient is to describe that. That. And now we're coming back to the blurring of lines between arcs and loops. Because let's go back to the example with the Kronika quiver. We have this whole group action of PGL2, the automorphism group of P1. But on the surface, it doesn't do anything. Once you identify the loop with the degenerated arcs that we had on the boundaries, this whole group actually would. This whole group action would be functional, would be in the kernel. So, this is sort of the idea why the failing of this commutativity for some objects, this contributes to the kernel exactly. And then maybe this is a bit of a jump, but these kind of loops that can generate into arcs have to do with the Husshertchomology. This kind of governs that. And I, yeah, it's maybe a bit. I didn't plan to say much on this. It's just like an intuitive thing actually to convey. I can't really maybe explain why exactly that is something you would expect. But so. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's a bit easier if you have ungraded, you can use Ricketts' result. You just like you have a tilting object, every equivalence senses into a tilting object, and then you get A equivalence, which does that. But in the ungraded case, you can't really do that. So it's a bit more complicated. Plus, you don't really get that it's split, you just get that it's objective. So yeah, the yeah, the group action here is the group from the Far is from being injective? No, no, it's always subjective. It's just that injector, sorry, maybe the disk, but even then, I don't think so. Maybe the disk case, because you always have a contribution from the fundamental group. So that only leaves the disk. And then I think, well, you have to. I think, well, you have the rotation. I don't think you have anything else. I'm not sure. Yeah. So, this, yeah, I don't think this is ever injected. Well, except for this. Right. So we want to describe the kernel now. And I sort of superficially said it has something to do with the Hochert chromology. So, this is why we want the whole shortcut homology comes in. But this failure is like this, and so it has something to do with this. And what we want to do is, so this lives in the Rife Picard group. Well, and this is just a yeah, this is this is a Lie algebra, right? Lie algebra, right? And we want to integrate glasses from here into the Reif-Picard group. And maybe I don't state the goal, I just state the theorem. Or maybe I'm still not sure if I should call this a proposition. I mean, you have something to do, but some of the stuff is already done. So you can do this much more generally. And this is why I stated like this, because I think it's maybe interesting, because I was looking. Maybe interesting because I was looking for a theorem like this and couldn't find it. So you have an A infinity algebra over a field of characteristic zero zero do I want to do then there exists exist a group Exist a group homomorphism, which is sort of a very non-commutative version of the exponential map. Not from the whole Holshot chromology, but from this should be a B, maybe this also should be a B into the Rife Picard group. Into derived Picard group of B. Okay, the way I stated it now, it's a bit. I mean, yeah, you should maybe think of this as an A-infinity functor, but okay. This is a proniopotent sub-algebra in here. And roughly speaking, so like this is really uninteresting if your algebra is not graded. If it is, this is sort of this splits into a product of the. This splits into a product of these bi-graded Horseshoe homology groups, and then you have something sort of in degree one zero, and that's the part you can't integrate, and you can't integrate the rest. So it's a sort of new potential. Anyway, so you can integrate always a part of that, at least over characteristic zero. And this uses heavily like this theory on pre-Lie algebras. Theory of on pre-Lie algebras by people. So then the Hochschule complex is an example of a pre-lie algebra, and then you have the sort of exponential map you can do and some other stuff, and then you need some pro some more stuff, but yeah, anyway. Probably some more stuff, but yeah, anyway. So you can integrate classes into equivalences, at least some of them. And the question here is, and that's something one should not forget, you might think, okay, what's the group structure? And you think, oh, it's just maybe additive. But that's not true. Like, this is a crypt. With the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff product. And well, I guess people taking Lie theory at some point know this. So if you have elements X and Y, and then the Baker-Kempfl-Hausdorff product of these two things, and remember, this is a Lie algebra. This kind of is a deformation of the addition, but it's changed by commutators and iterated commutators. So, yeah, I'd like, I mean, there's this evaluation for matrices. For example, this is already when it shows up. So, in general, if you take the products. General, if you take the products of two exponential maps of matrices, then it's not like just the exponential of the sum, but you have this kind of other part. And I mean, if you over the real numbers or something, you have convergence. In this case, there's no convergence. So you need like, this is why you need this plus here. But you have convergence, but only in a certain way. But like, as in a classical case, so if these things commute, this just degenerates. This just degenerates into the normal sum. But in general, it's more complicated. So there's that. Yeah, and then I'm at the theorem. So, like, the reason why, yeah, this is also the reason why I call this integration, because literally, like, as in Because literally, like as in Lie algebras and Lie groups, you have a sort of exponential map. And by Keller's result, the Roshut cohomology here, the first Hossit homology, is the Lie algebra in a certain sense of the derived Picard group. So that kind of matches exactly what you would expect. Lie theory is just a very slightly like different context. But it's kind of overarching idea is the same. Okay. Okay, so yeah, and then you can describe the kernel in a lot of cases, except for some sort of degenerate ones. So if lambda is greatly gentle, then you make two exceptions, and I can say maybe afterwards why. So you don't want that this is derived equivalent to The Chronica case. This is very special. And you also don't want it to be in a case where you have kx model x squared, where x is of degree one. So on the Cojel's dual side, you would be, this would be the polynomial ring, right? Um, okay, yeah, I can say something afterwards. So, like, these are slightly pathological, it's not like the whole thing doesn't work, it's just that there's something very special that happens, which doesn't happen in all the other cases. And by the classification of great gentle algebra, well, you know exactly, you just know that the surface of this is not exactly the surface and the line field of these two cases. And these two cases are An annulus we've seen. This has winding number zero. And then this is the case. We have an unmarked component here, and this is winding number zero. Because in these cases, sort of the central curve, in a sense, has two ways to generate. Usually it has only one, and then something different happens. Oh, yeah, sorry. I used the notation yesterday, but it's not. Should say this again. Back to Chronica. Okay, one more minute, and I'm done. So, there's two kinds of scenarios where you can move. Scenarios where you can move what we want to do, describe the kernel. So one condition is that the characteristic is zero and no further condition. Or second condition, we have characteristic at least not to, because gentle algebras behave a bit weirdly in this case. And we exclude certain Exclude certain boundary components. So it's not like we exclude all unmarked components, but only ones with a very specific winding number. It's not unmarked boundary components. If winding number One. And when I say winding number of a boundary, I just mean the winding number of the curves that follows the orientation of the boundary and just runs around it once. So for this bit, we don't need this integration exponential, but it's the same spirit. There's an exponential in the background. It just truncated. And here we need that. But then we can integrate everything. So the theorem is now. Everything. So the theorem is now. If one of these two conditions holds, then we can describe the kernel and hence the Rife Picard group is isomorphic to something, which is a semi-direct product of the homology of the surface with k star coefficients. And then we had this semi-direct product with the mapping class group. And I will say something about you real quick. This is why I said it's never injective because of that contribution. So the fundamental group makes this non-zero. And in this case, And in this case, there's that. And so this U, this lives in the Holstead homology of lambda and is again equipped with, I say, truncated in positive characteristic, truncated. Truncated data can for house of product. And in the first case, well, the technique gives you the group, but it's not very explicit. And that's a bit difficult because the positive part of the width algebra shows up. And I don't know how to describe the product here in this case. But in the second case, if B holds, then it's very simple. Then U. Simple then u is just isomorphic to power of the additive group, which is just k with addition. And m is exactly a number of two things. So you have boundary components, and they either have one mark point or zero mark points, and have one. Mark point or zero mark points and have winding number zero. So boundary components B such that the winding number vanishes and m was the mark points. So the number of mark points on B is less or equal than one. So then if you remember like the Kronecker example here, this for example happens. So this is the explanation sort of why we have something in the curve. Explanation: sort of why we have something in the kernel. The same here, but um, so we say we also count unmarked components. So, these are exactly the two cases where you have sort of two boundary components which are sort of connected to a loop at the same time, which kind of fall into this. And the other surfaces, this can't happen. So, you need you need an annulus to have that. And then you have to kind of these two cases. So, this is why they are special. These two cases. So, this is why they are special. Because there's a bit of a mixture. The group structure here changes a bit. Yeah, and that's it. Sorry for the overtime. Any questions for a public?  The status we're just going to recommend just one. Because if you have a curve around the boundary, it can't degenerate to another one unless you're on a cylinder. Okay, okay, thanks. Just add well, and so you well, it's now gone, but you had this theorem about that this surface state together with the line field is a derived invariant of the surface, and of course. Of the surface, and of course, one can see that the surface is a kind of combinatorial gadget, but the line bundle is kind of a bit more wobbly somehow. Yeah, yeah. And so is there a way to quantify this also? Yeah. So you can up to the topological part, which is just a genus, number of boundary components, you can also extract the number of mark points and everything. And this has to do with the elevation. Points and everything, and this has to do with the Avella and Yos-Geison variant, where this was the algorithm I kind of roughly described last time, where the question was: how can you determine the mark points on the surface? This is basically what this invariant captures. And then the line field itself, you can also from the from this invariant, you can also determine the winding numbers of the boundary components. And these winding numbers form. These winding numbers form part of a complete set of invariants of line field, like orbits of line field, under the mapping class group action, which is due to legal in Polishuk, which builds on like a similar classification for the same with line fields, frame surfaces by Kavazumi. So you have an explicitly computable set of invariants. Some of them are a bit trickier to compute than others. Like for some, I mean, the winding numbers of the line fields. The winding numbers of the line fields, there's the Kromi and Torial algorithm, which is very easy to do. And then there's some of the invariants which you sometimes need, which are a bit more tricky to get hold of, but you can do this everything in terms of quivers. Any other questions or comments? If not, let's thank the speaker.
