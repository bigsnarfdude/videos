Thank you. So first of all, I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to this beautiful place and possibility to meet all of you again. So I will talk about isotropic and numerical equivalence for Chao Groups and Marawki theories.  This is related to isotropic realizations. So, what are isotropic realizations? So, these are local versions of material categories. So, material category of Ivotsky or the matropic category of Maria Ivotsky. No problem. Realizations is a lot of fun. It's a local versions. Local in some sense. Okay. Let's start with Wywoldsky category. So we would like to reduce certain realizations, certain factors from Wivolsky category to some simple and small categories where we can read matrix information. Generate magic information in some handy way. It will be much easier to see the information. And it appears originally, no, this was the original aim just to produce these simple versions, but it appeared in the end, and this will follow from what I will discuss, that they actually provide points of the binary spectrum in the terms of triangulated category of detail. These are sort of the same, they play the same role as points of the As points of the Zariski spectrum plan of the ratio. The meaning. Right, well, let me introduce these categories. So, first of all, we need to choose the prime. Choose P. Choose P. And then we construct this isotropic material particular, which I denote dm k over k with FP coefficients. It's nothing else but the localization of all. But the localization of a global category, of the category of Lybovsky, by the subcategory generated by P and is atroc varieties. Just there's the localization, localization of the global criteria of Lykotsky by the subcriteria generated by motives. My motives of p-anisotropic varieties. A variety is called p-nisotropic if it doesn't have points of degree prime to p, points of degree prime to p. And so what we do is just kill the motives of all such varieties. And we hope that the resulting category will be simple and reminiscent of topological categories. To remind you that the biological material category is just derived category of abelian groups. It's a very, very simple category. And if you consider the periods, it will be derived category of F p vector spaces. Graded F p vector spaces. It's a very simple, very simple category. And we would like to construct something which is as small as that. Well, unfortunately, if k is an arbitrary defield, it will not happen. Example, it will not happen if k is algebraically closed, right? Because there are no antisattribes. Close, right? Because there are no inside perfect varieties. No varieties, so no localization. So, category as it was, right? So, as large as it was. So, what we need to do to make the result, the result handy, we need to restrict to special kind of fields. So, we need special fields. To make this category simple, small. And unfortunately, there is a large class of fields, the fields which is fit for the role. So these are so-called flexible fields. So k is called flexible if it is a period of signal extension. If it is a purely transcendental extension, things in a transcendent degree of some other field. And you can notice that any field can be embedded in the room. It's flexible closure. Into its flexible closure, so you can always set these parameters and embed your field into a flexible field. Right, and it appears that for flexible fields, the result will be really simple. Yes, we can see as follows. So, how to see it? We may look at the bean structure. The instruction is continuing, and in the same way, just for the whole global skin continuum, you have a big structure. But here you have a v structure, chow weight structure, in the sense of one dark, a weight structure, which is similar to T structure, but a little bit less harmonic, but still very useful. In the sense of Mandarka from this category, and it is constructed in the same way as for the global. As for the global category. So it is generated by motives of anisotropic variety. So the heart will be isotropic. Sorry, by motives of small projective varieties. So here we will be with the heart. Also, we have this category of isotopic oitters. So, the objects will be direct summons in the objects of small projective varieties. Of course, motive, isotropic motive is obtained from the usual motive by the natural projection from giving into heat. Because it's a localization, we have a projection from variables. You just localize. And morphisms, all those are given by isotropic cell groups. Right, where, so what are these isentropic child groups? Isotropic shell groups that can be defined, you don't need to know anything about their dialocalization, you can define it in simple plots. So, this is just a quotient of the usual shell groups mod P, modular isogroupic classes, classes. Classes. And anisotropic classes are classes which come as push forwards from anisotropic varieties, from p-anisotropic varieties. And you can see that you get an array of the homology theory in the sense of Livian Morel. And so, this way, you can extend it to real gamma theory in the sense of Linu Marie. And there is another, another similar theory, which is numerical regression, of course. Numerical regression. So, this one is obtained again from this channel here by modding out the kernel of the national pairing, degree pairing. Degree pairing from shell root mod P of x to trans shell root mod p of x to fp. So we have two cycles, two cycles on x, and the pairing is the following. You multiply them, get an element in soul ring of x, and then project to the Shall we of x and then project to the point? This is a pairing. Pairing, and there will be some, there could be some kernel, you know doubt is kiernal. And then you get certain arrays of economic theory, and moreover you have natural subjection between the two. Very natural subjection of isotropic reaction of a numerical reaction. Because any anisotropic class will be automatically trivial with respect to the pairing. And it will be trivial because on the degree pairing on an anisotropic variety is always zero. The pairing is identically zero on such variety. Because there are no zero cycles of degree prime to it. So they all project to zero. It's any switch pair as zero, if anything. Yeah. And then you can extend the an area and the pigamology here. You can define it in particular for non-cropomarians by looking at one. Right, and we have this subjection, right? Because any n is a perfect class, the altar might be in the kernel. Right. And so So many important properties of this isotropic material category can be reduced to the following result. So many properties of DLP, DLK over Q, Q all. Result, which was a conjecture for some time, but now I can finally prove it completely. So it's statement. So suppose k is flexible. Flexible. Flexible field. Then isotropic reaction coincides with the numerical one. So this is a nice one. So, this is an isomorph. And I said, look at shell groups inside the numerical shell groups. So, what are the consequences of it? The consequences of it, for example, is that isentropic chunk groups of flexible fields are almost finite groups. Some of flexible fields are always finite groups. We can trust the global child groups, which can be huge. So, either truck groups and more flexible fields will be always fine. Is it true? Show groups are final groups. Finite groups? It's because numerical child groups are finite groups. And numerical child groups are finite groups because numerical pairing can be defined on the level of topological realization. So you can first pass the topology that intersect, and then you get the same numbers in algebraic geometry. Break geometry. And this implies that numerical child groups are subclusions of topological pedagogy. Topological pairing is different. Because pairing is defined in topology. It follows that this will be a subclusion of topological pedagogy, which is final. So this is why we get final. And the second corrogory, and this is the one which you need most, means that the category of isentropic charomotic is a. Of isotropic geomotics is equivalent to the category of numerical geomotics. Okay, flexible isotropic. Yeah, category of isotropic geomatics is equivalent to the category of numerical geomatics with F P P efficiency. with m S P efficiency. And this category is semi-simple. Category is semi-simple. And also it doesn't have tensor-0 divisors. There are no tensor-0 divisors, and this implies various useful properties of the isotropic material category. Because we have some good grip on the heart, on the heart of On the heart of our weight structure, we can conclude something about the full isopropymatic idea. So, when we have all of that, we can produce a family of isotropic realizations, proper isotropic realizations, which will have a needed property. So this will be the number psychic P comma E, where P is a prime number and E is some extension, the Gravity law. So it will be a factor from the Raymond pateger, D of P to the isotropic material page. Oma, not the field E itself, but the flexible closure. So here, P is a prime number, E over P is any extension, any extension, not necessarily finitely generated, at the end, any extension, and ETILDA is a flexible poser. Flexible program. So we just added infinitely many parameters. Flexible closure of the field E. And notice that our realizations take values in flexible isotropic materials. So such criteria should be really simple. It's a bit critic. Right. And the fact that we don't have tensor zero divisors on this category implies that we don't have them also on this category. On the category of how flexible is that point. Sibilizer to the point. Theorem one implies one implies a zero ideal zero ideal VM eterial eternal is prime. It's a prime tensor related idea. And this implies that the kernels, kernels of isentropic realizations, will give us points of the Weimar spectrum. The Weimar spectrum of the Wavotsky activity. Clearing two. Actually, we get clearing two. Right. So let us define ideal APE, which is a pure norm of this realization. Restricted to the compact part. So compact. We are interested only in the compact object. Compact also. And then you have the following three statements. First of all, this is a prime ideal. It's a consequence of the fact that the zero ideal in the target, of course, is prime. And hence it gives a point, point of the biomass spectrum. Because biomass spectrum consists exactly of tensor of prime tensor triangulated ideals. We have related ideas spectrum which is denoted this way, spectrum of DMK, but we were categorized. So this is the first statement. The second statement is we can say when two such Yeah, two such uh points will coincide. And uh so they they don't see that uh two points will be the same. A P E will be equal to AQF if and only if, first of all, prime is coincide, because prime is exactly the characteristic of the respective point. This determines the prime, so P is equal to Q, and also extension E into. Extension E over K is equivalent to extension F over K. I should have explained what P equivalent is before on the lateral criterion, but I forgot to do it, so let me do it now. So two extensions are called P equivalent if and only if P isotropia is equivalent over these extensions. P isotropia of K varieties, varieties of K rounds. Say that. Say that E over K is equivalent to F over K is not the E. For theater, the variety Q over K. Q restricted to E is isentrotic, or unisent, doesn't matter, is equivalent to the fact that Q over F is isentropic. So the conditions that you have. So, the conditions are equivalent. Isotropy is equivalent of these extensions. No, and of course, this can be formulated in terms of the existence of certain correspondences of degree prime tropy between smooth models, smooth models of this extension. If extensions are finitely generated, so they are represented by some smooth varieties, whatever, R and S, right, then the fact that they are equivalent means that there are correspondences of degree prime duplicated between R and S in both directions. Between R and S in both directions. So, this is what that means that two extensions are equivalent. Right, in particular, you can see how many points you will get, right? By just looking at the number of equivalence classes for extensions. And yeah, and that's it. So, now we get many points. Get many new points of the biomass spectrum. New points of the spectrum in in addition to the topological points given by topological organization. And to see maybe how many points you get, you may look at the f field of real numbers. If you look at the field of real numbers, then of course you will immediately see that for odd primes, of course, all extensions are equivalent. All extensions are equivalent. What primes they all will be equivalent, because there are no odd-degree extensions. But for p equal to prime two, you will have a lot of points. There will be many if you have classes. For example, two to the two value zero. Value of zero points of characteristic two of characteristic two as a tropical point of characteristic two of characteristic two of the spectrum. of the spectrum for the binary spectrum for the k for the case uh k bomb Right. You notice the number of these points, the cardinality of the spectrum in particular. This shows that the cardinality of the spectrum is equal to the cardinality of the set of all subsets of the petigree, of the compact part of the pentigram. It's as large as it could be. It's really huge. Right. So this is what we get from theorem one eventually. But so what is the approach? What is the key for proving theorem one? Actually, to prove it, you need to generalize it first. So we we need to consider a more general more general situation. Mainly we can generalize all of it to a market prediction Of it to an arbitrary idiot economy. Consider A to be any adiantal pedamogy in the sense of living marine, example. Any moments here on the category of smooth varieties, okay? Well, that means that you have a Well, that means that you have a, to any variety, to any smooth variety, you associate certain ring, certain ring, and then you have pullbacks and push forwards, which satisfies various assets. So this is what a reality is. Then you can play the same game, basically. You can define what it means for variety to be A anisotrop. Suppose now x is, let's say, smooth trajectory variety. You have trajection. You have projection to the point, which is pi. And we say that x is a n is atropic. If projection is zero on this area a. Perhaps projection to the point is zero. A n is atropic. If this push forward of A goes x to A, A is the coefficient. The coefficient of the theory is zero. Of course, if you apply it to Child Group's mod P, you will get just the usual pianism, the usual definition of Pianisatro, if you apply it to Child Group's mod P. But you can do it in general for any theory. Any oriented theory. And then you may introduce the notion of, you can introduce anisotropic version of the theory. Reaction. Dipheria. You can define A isotropic. Isotropic reaction. By definition is dipheria, modula, A anisotropic classes. Classes? No. In other words, classes which come from A anisotropic varieties. In the same way, you can introduce a numerical version, of course, of any theory. Numerical version of the journal of the padding, padding, which is defined in the same way. Which is defined in the same way. Because to define it, you only need to pull backs and push forward. You need pulled up, then it's forward. And by the same reasons, you have national surjection. Judgment from isotropic reaction to numerical one. Right, and now you probably may guess to what sort of theories I am going to apply, to apply this machinery, right? So, of course, to Moraviki theories. All right, move that meeting. Right, look, let me remind you what parabolic P theory is. So, parabolic P theory, it depends on two numbers, on the prime number P and then some M between 1 and infinity. So, it is obtained from the BP the P theory by change of coefficients. Just tensor over the coefficient ring of BP is Fp of VM, VM index. So, in other words, you invert, you invert a variable VM of VP and you kill all other variables. Just aside, so VP, the catiation ring of VP is ZP, a z allies that P, to which you are joining variables V1, V2, etc., up to infinity and dimension, dimension of Vi. Dimension of Vi is equal to T to the I minus 1. In contrast to the Lazardi, the coefficient of Libyan Maria, algebraic abortism. In the Libyan Marauder algebraic abortism, it will be C, the generators in every dimension, from 1 to infinity. And for DP, you will have, first of all, it will be always EP, localized, and then generators will be only in spatial dimensions. But otherwise, it's also in the polynomial. Polynomial infinitely many variables of CP. And then this homomorphism just maps every other generator site from Vm to zero and then works Vm and also maps T to zero. Right. So this is morale keys. Morale T. So it's small uh I I I'm talking only about small theaters, right? I'm talking only about small theories, right? Are you able to pick a major theory? Theories in the sense of living variable. So I'm not talking about theories represented by spectrum in SH, but only about theories on smooth varieties. And consider only values on smooth varieties, not on factory values. Right, so this is Maravo Easy. And then you yeah, you can You, yeah, you can, and actually, the theory which is sort of crucial for all these results is another theory. This is the main player, Pm. And Pm is also an what is called three areas of pigmental C, so it's obtained from algebraic comboism of Libyan marriage by change of coefficients. And this time, the change of coefficients is the following. So they take BP. Is the following. So the tech BP and they just mod out the invariant ideal on the vehicle, I am. So I m is ideal generated by the first m generators, including P, which is, you know, that is P0. 0, 1, W, B M minus 1. It's our ideal inside V Pside the coefficient green from V P A. Inside the coefficient principle PPA, and it's a variant under Lambert Neurofigurations. Variant ideal of one wave. So one wave classified all invariant, prime invariant ideals inside PP, and they are all of this shape. I m, where m, no, I didn't say actually what where. No, I didn't say actually what M is. M is between 1, 1, and infinity, including infinity. Number n is from 1 to infinity. Yeah. And to complete the classification, you just need to add the 0 ideal. These guys, plus the 0 ideal. These are all prime ideals of dp invariant under material. Of dp invariant under multi-economic configurations. And maybe it's worth looking at what happens when m is equal to infinity. When m is equal to infinity, then p infinity is the same as a p infinity. And this is equal to chunk of 1. So when m is equal to infinity, then both lines collide and you get the old childhood span. In particular, theorem one is a particular case of the following large result. Getting one with a particular piece of the form result, getting three. Suppose case case flexible first of all, there is a true. First of all, uh the isotropic version of Pm coincides with the numerical version of Pm and the same for morality the version of morality coincides with the numerical version of moral theory or flexible things. And actually, it's the first part of this result which is key to everything else. Everything about what I talked and will be talking today. So, everything follows in the end from this result. So, this is the key to everything. Just the fact that isotropic and numerical given is the insightful for the theory. And not only permits to prove theorem, one, but permits. Theory one that permits to prove this conjecture is existed before, but also it also permits to approach stable homotopic category of Morel-Dyowski. Permits on the parameter spectrum state of materials. Step of maturity particularly of my radical and this is done in our joint paper with Jenko. Right. So what we do there, we construct also the local versions of the Marie-Lewywski category. So before that I was talking about local versions of the Pybotsky category. The same can be done to Marie-Wivot Marotsky category. How to define a isotopic well this is what I'm going to say. So Marada. Isotropic matter to get right. So first of all we choose P and L, right? As before, before we were choosing P, now we choose P and L. P now, we choose PLL. In other words, we choose Marau PC. This is what we do. We choose particular Mara ethereal. And after that, we define this local diversion. You know, the SHPM at indicate choice. And then hydropic, K and K. So it is again a Verde localization of SH of the global. Mariovsky Katita. Of the global, Marinoski category model is also sympathetic. So we have organization of SH by the subcriteria criteria generated by compact objects here compact. The MJ mode of U. To any object of SH we can associate certain MJ model. I don't denote MFJ of U. You want to determine the ideal and the ideal? And the idea of M-zero models generated by certain generated by MG motives of anisotropy varieties, KPM anisotropic varieties motives of Of KPM. And is it perfect? But right as well as before. But you need to add one additional object. And this object is the cone of L plus the unit, the unit of MJ divided by the L. Cone of Vl. But in Takuj, it would be the only object. It generates that option, okay? But in algebra, But in algebraic geometry, we somehow some mixture of isentropic idea and basically the standard topological one. So they mix two types of generators, what we have in topology and what we have in isentropic model. And then we get this category. Differential projection of SHQ. We have, as before, we have isentropic periodizations of parameter m from PSHP from the map global wherever you want. Particularly for this case, SHPM. And again, we need to consider narbed radio extension and take the flexible quote. So here, okay, we have field extension. Extension. And as before, each here is a flexible portion. Flexible process. Oh, and also we have the notion of KPM equivalence on the surface extensions which is defined exactly the same way, right? So, E over K. Same way. P over K is K P M equivalent, let me say, just P M equivalent of Pf over K, if and only if K P M is at root is equivalent. No, this will be such arbitrary Q over K, arbitrary variety. Q over E is K P M isotropic variety of isotropic C. If and only if Q F is K P M isotropic. This KPM, I said. Of course, you can do it for anything, not necessarily for KPM, but you need it for KPM. So we get some equivalency relation, equivalence relation. And this will distinguish the respective points, points of the binary spectrum, as we'll see in a second. Alright, so we get the following theorem. So let's introduce the ideals of the Maria River's competitor. E, by definition, is a kernel of this realization restricted to comparison. Realization restricted to compact button. Journal is psi restricted to the compact pattern. So then the first statement is that these are prime ideals. These ideals are prime. Also, here. So, hence, one of the points of the Bulmer spectrum of Maria Riboski category: the Balmer spectrum, SHC. Okay? And then two such points you can say if and only if P is equal to Q, M is equal to Em and the extension side P with M. In this sense, P M T will be the same as P Q M T L F if and only if P equal Q equal N and extension take equal P equal K is equivalent to the CS. is equivalent in the sense of this equivalent relation to that. And finally, if you take m equal to infinity, then of course the point we construct here will be just the image of point constructed in theory 2 under the next moment of motive squares. A infinity is the infinite So the image A P and the natural map from spectrum of G L the spectrum of this we have Since we have material functor, right, from SH to DL, we have the induced map on spectrum in the other direction. So the image of the point APE will be exactly infinity. Right, no end. So we can get many new points. Many new points. Quince Quince Spectrum For example for any M from one to infinity we have still as many points Still, as many points of level M of level M and characteristic two of uh the final spectrum of of marine realized of R of the field right. That you have. So the picture is as follows. You have some sort of confined imaginary bases outside the picture, but then you have sort of sections. So if you, you know, PM is a set of TM equivalence classes of exceptions. TM equivalence classes. Then you can observe when m decreases, the relation becomes coarser and coarser and coarser. So you identify more things when m decreases. So for infinity, you'll get the largest, and then you see infinity, and then you start identifying things. So you get something smaller, and then with your G. And then, if you decrease further, then it's still smaller, right? And etc. And when you go to zero, it collapses. It collapses to a single point. So this is the picture. Also, there is meaning for this base. Maybe in the remaining minutes, let me say a few words about the proof, proof of theorem 3. Period three was about uh isotropic and numerical equivalence for P and T. Numerical equivalence for P and P. So, actually, what I do, I prove more general results about the theory Q, which is obtained from BP by holding out E invariant IT, not necessarily prime one, doesn't matter, it's prime of one, but J is in non-zero invariant IT more than ideal. Then there are a few steps, but the step one, what I do, I substitute. So, what I did before, what we need to prove. We need to prove that any numerically trivial classes n is a tropical. Proof. I mean, three little plus. The class is an atomic and we do it as follows. So we start with some class. So first we lift it to the algebraic commorism in such a way that the action, not only the class itself, would be cued numerically previous, but also the application of any land paper noise preparation on it would be numerically previous. If you want to algebraic proportion in such a way so that S tonal particular for U would be also q numerically takeoff also. And this is done with the help of the multiplicative projector defining PP theory. This algebra wasn't but It's algebraic words in one P. No, no, no, it's uh localized. Localized P, yes. Defining PP here. And this is where a lot of simplification happened in comparison to the previous versions. So originally the conjecture at least fearing one, but it's not fearing one. It was proven for some cases, namely for varieties of dimension at most five, etc. And it was done by some surgery-type technique using blue-ups and deformations and steamred and udden saturations. No, it was quite advanced. And now it is substituted by this completely transparent and simple argument with the picture project. Right, unfortunately, I don't have. Right, unfortunately, I don't have time to speak about skip two and three, but so let me have a stop. So, are there any questions? So, you said that for the case of GM, there is a deformation of being isotopic by you. So, in the case of GM, In the case of DA, you said that you can check that would be the same as the push over this zero power. Here, do you use something? Because it's not so how do you reformulate the fact that uh this spectra spectrum is issued. No, no, no, but I'm talking only about varieties, I'm not talking about any spectra. I'm killing the m uh the SOB the exact category generated by Category generated by sigma? Well, you mean the definition of SA local SH. So I'm killing all the. First of all, my ideal will be pulled back of some ideal of MJ. So it's maybe this already will clarify me. It's substantial, right? So I'm pulling certain ideal in MJL. So we have natural MJL motif from SH to MJL models. And what is the ideal in MJL which I considered? In MJL, which I considered. This is the ideal generated by all MJL motives of KPM and isotropic varieties, plus this cone of the VMware. These are compact generators explicitly described. And then I pull back this ideal. Any other questions? Very my use thing of this multiplicative proverb. Is it in some sense comparable to the multiplicative representative or which leaves something must be to some integral thing in a multiplicative way or one-dimensional objects? To be honest, I don't know. I don't know, but I know and I don't know what you have done with all different sides of the project. But it's the same project, of course, it's a topology. Topology is defined by BBC. Apology is defined by a very simple rule. So it does, it defined it by the rule what it does to projective space. It maps projective space either to zero or to itself. And depending on the dimension. If dimension is power of p minus one, then projective space is mapped to itself. If it is anything else, it is zero. And it defines it completely. Defining program. It's only ten minutes in between the Only ten minutes extend the bits to ten minutes to four thirty four thirty five four techniques out of four.
