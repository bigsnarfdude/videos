First, I would first like to start clarifying that this is a joint work with Handy, Elizabeth, and Robert. I think they are all here. And this is a preprint in the archive. It was published yesterday, I think, the day before, maybe, under this reference. So you can consult it. And well, first, my setup will be taking an algebraic closed field K. Taking an algebraic closed field K of characteristic zero. And unless I say otherwise, all algebras here will be associative and unital. So let's start with a little motivation. Let's take a very simple but effective algebraic structure. That would be a group. So we all know that we can define over a group two notions of action. The first one will be these of left G module, which is basically having an action map. Basically, having an action map of the group over a vector space, but we also can define the notion of representation of that group, which will be again a vector space, but equipped with a group homomorphism from G to the space of linear automorphisms of P. And of course, we all know that these two languages are basically the same, which translates into saying that these two monoidal categories, GMOD, the category. GMOD, the category of G modules, and REPG, the category of representation of G, are isomorphic as monoidal categories. And of course, the isomorphism is given in the natural way. So what is nice about groups is that actually both interpretations I just gave, module theory versus representation theory, can be extended to the world of algebras, to the category of algebras. The category of algebras. And actually, they are still equivalent. This is a very well-known result first appearing by Cohen and Montgomery in 1984 that says, okay, take an algebra, take a group, and if you have a G-module algebra that would be an algebra object, also called monoid object, the monoidal category G mod does the same as having a GMO such that it satisfies this. Such that it satisfies these additional conditions, these two formulas, which are the classical ones of a group acting on an algebra, which is also equivalent to the existence of a group homomorphism from G to this subgroup of the original GLA group, which will be the algebra automorphisms of the algebra. So, this is a very nice result, classic one. And actually, what And actually, what is nice is that you have a Lie algebra version of this. So, specifically, if you take a Lie algebra, you can also define what is a G module, which is basically the same idea, what is our representation of G. So here you are taking this special Lie algebra. And again, the two languages are exactly the same. So we have a quite similar result for Lie algebra. Quite similar result for Lie algebras, which would be: take an algebra, take a Lie algebra. So, being an algebra in this monoidal category, G mod is the same as having a G module over the Lie algebra, such as these two conditions satisfy, which is also the same as saying that you have, in this case, a Lie algebra homomorphism from G, and here the object that appears is the derivations of A. Derivations of A with the structure, of course, of Lie algebra, but still it's a subspace of the linear space of A. So we can see a trend here. So what we did was to try to generalize this setup to more general structures. So we start calling H a host-like structure if its category of commodules or modules is monoeidal. So we all know examples. So we all know examples of this that would be, for example, groups, as I just mentioned, group algebras, the algebras, enveloping algebras, hof algebras, of course, but also some examples of non-HOF classical hoff structures as groupoids, groupoid algebras, some Lie algebrais, weak hoff algebras, etc. So for a half-like structure H, we will address both approaches that I was mentioning. Approaches that I was mentioning, module theory and representation, as in the case of groups and Lie address. So, first, if you take the category of edge modules, we are, I didn't say it, but everything here is from the left. If you are taking the category of left edge modules, of course, that's by definition a monoidal category. An algebra object in that category will be called an edge module algebra. And in this case, Algebra. And in this case, we also say that H acts on A categorically. So that will be the module theory version, the categorical version. But at the same time, if I will say that H acts on an algebra A representation theoretically, if you have a certain sub collection of linear endomorphisms of A, which I will denote end A and will change from algebra to algebra, sorry, from setup to setup. Sorry, from setup to setup, of course, from Valdez to Algera, but also from setup to setup, such that this object admits the same structure at H. And at a certain point, I will have a structure-preserving map from H to N. So, for example, when H was a group, I was asking a group map from G to the algebra to morphisms of A, which would be a sub collection. And when I had a Lie algebra, so I was asking for a Lie algebra. So, I was asking for a Lie algebra map from G, a mat frac G, to the derivations of A. So, this object will change from setup to setup. So, the main question of our preparation is, okay, for which half-like structures, H, we have this equivalence, acting categorically being the same as acting representation theoretically. Thus far, in this motivation, Thus far in this motivation, I have mentioned that this is true, of course, for groups and Lie algebras. So, before going for more abstract things, let's try to make HOF join the meeting. By that, I mean that let's try to achieve to head towards something with a half structure, an explicit half structure. So, if I take a group, that's quite easy. Let's take, let's talk about the group. Let's take about the group algebra Kg. So, of course, Kg is a half-like structure that will be the category of modules is monoidal and actually is equivalent to GMAT. So, of course, as we know, talking about KG modules is the same as talking about G modules. And in this scenario, we have four functors. Actually, three, but one of them is very versatile. So, the first one will be the group algebra. So the first one will be the group algebra functor that takes a group and gives you either if you want an algebra or a half algebra, the group algebra seen as an algebra or as a half algebra. So let's say that we have two functors there. A third one will be the group of units, which takes an algebra and gives you back the, well, the group of invertible elements of that algebra. And fourthly, we will consider the group like the Will consider the group-like the group of group-like elements functor that takes a half algebra and gives you back a group that of group-like elements of that half algebra. So what is nice about these functors is that actually you have a pair of adjoint functors. If you consider k, the group algebra functor going from groups to algebra, then in this case it is less adjoint to Is less adjoined to the functor of invertible elements of the group of units, meaning that we have this nice bijection, natural bijection, of course. And if instead you take this functor, but landing in the Hof algebra category, then it is left adjoint, but with the functor of the group of group-like elements, meaning that in this case, you have this adjunction. What is nice about Adjunction. What is nice about this is that basically saying you that you can lift or you can translate maps from the language of groups to the language of algebras by replacing G and the group of units of P by these two elements, these two objects. And the same in this second scenario. You can replace group maps for half maps and of course interchanging these two. So that gives us That gives us, we can restate the coin-Montgomery result in this manner. Take a group, take an algebra. So, first, of course, as I just said, KG mod and G mod is basically the same category. It's the same, they are isomorphic. So, having a KG module algebra is the same as having a G module algebra. And the Coin-Montgomery result was saying, okay, two and three are basically the same, are equivalent. Basically, the same are equivalent. So, what is new here, the novelty here, is that three and four are the same. Having this group map by the natural bijection I was mentioning in the previous slide is the same as lifting that to a half-algebra map from D to this also half algebra. So, this is a nice setup that allows us to, instead of working with groups, start talking about something more. About something more half with half structure. And what this shows is that for the group algebra, acting categorically is the same as acting representation theoretically. And of course, everything is based on the fact that it is true for the group G, for the original group. We are just linearizing everything. And the same can be done for the enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra. So in this case, we will have, again, four functors, but Four functors, but in this case, the first functor will be considering the enveloping algebra functor that takes a Lie algebra and gives you ug either as an algebra or as a half algebra. And the third functor will be taking the underlying Lie algebra of an algebra with the commutator bracket that gives you canonically a Lie algebra. And the fourth one will be take the Lie algebra of primitive elements. The Lie algebra of primitive elements of a hof algebra. So you are given a hof algebra, you can take the Lie algebra of primitive elements, and that's also functorial. So we have a quite similar result as for the case of the group algebra. And this is that we have one and two natural projections saying us that Limaps can be lifted up to algebra maps in this setting, and also Limaps can be lifted up. And also, Lie maps can be left up to hoff algebra maps in this setting. So we have a similar result for Lie algebras. Again, one and two is basically the same because these two categories, UGMOD and GMOD, are the same. The second and third result were the ones given in the motivation. So what is novelty here is that this limup can be lifted up to this hook. Be lifted up to this Hof algebra map using here the enveloping algebra of the derivations of A. Of course, with the canonical Lie algebra structure in derivation of A. So what this shows is that UG acting categorically is the same as UG acting representation theoretically on an algebra. So we said, okay, we have the group version, we have the Lie algebra version. The Lie algebra version, and for the group algebra and the enveloping universal algebra of a Lie algebra, we also have that. So maybe we can glue that together to get a more general result. So I'm heading towards that. Recall that if you have a commutative Hof algebra, remember that this is an algebraic closed field of characteristic zero, we have this characterization theorem by Cartier, Gabriel, Constalino-Moore. I think that's everyone here in this theorem. I think that's everyone here in this theorem. That says that H as a Hoff algebra is isomorphic to this smash product, where G is precisely the group of group-like elements, which is acting by conjugation on mat frac G or little G, which is the Lie algebra of primitive elements of the Hof algebra. So, this is a very well-known result. And actually, if you take any algebra A, you can consider. Algebra A, you can consider a similar construction. By that I mean a co-commutative of algebra. You could take the group of algebra automorphisms of A, which already appear in the group case. You could consider also the Lie algebra of derivations of A, which actually is being acted by conjugation by this group. And we can form this Hoff algebra, this match product, which is a commutative. Product which is a co-commutative of algebra, and what we will prove, what I will mention in the next slide, is that having a co-commutative of algebra for that case, acting categorically is the same as acting representation theoretically. I'm giving this definition here. It's just a technical definition, so I'm not going to pay too much attention for this. But basically, what this definition says is you have two rings and two modules. rings and two modules either over each ring. What is being this map from between the two rings compatible with the map between the two modules? So I need just this technical notion for the next theorem that says take a co-commutative half algebra, which of course will be of this manner and for an algebra And for an algebra, it's the same as these things are equivalent. First, having a module algebra that will be being an algebra object in the category of H modules is the same as having these two homomorphisms, one of groups and one of Lie algebras, that using the previous results can be lived up to Hof algebra homomorphisms between these two objects, Kg and UG, which is also the same. Which is also the same, of course, these extensions being compatible with each other. And third, it's the same as having this half-algebra homomorphism from H to this smash product, this co-commutative half-algebra. So it's the same type of result, but for this case of co-commutative half-algebra. Of course, what we did, the underlying proof here, is showing that. proof here is showing that the smash product allows you to glue together these two maps that were appearing before and i'm gonna present a weak case i'm gonna take some minutes to present a weaker case which is not coming from the classical hoff algebra world so recall that a group point is a small category in which every morphism is an isomorphism and then in g naught the set of objects and g1 the set of morphisms Objects and G1, the set of morphisms. So, what I want to prove here, when I want to show you, is that for a groupoid, which is not a classical HOF object, acting categorically is the same as acting representation theoretically, the main thing. So, for that, I need some definitions. First, let's fix X to be a non-empty finite set. So, a vector space will be called X decomposable if you have a family of sub- If you have a family of subspaces of the vector space, such that when you add them up, when you have the direct sum, you recover the original vector space. And similar for an algebra, we will say that an algebra is decomposable as algebra. You have a family of unital algebras such that when you add them up as an algebra, you recover A. So basically, gluing together components. So take a group point. So, take a group point. I need to define what is a group point action. So, I'm going to use this definition. Take a vector space, which is a G naught decomposable, the same number of components as the number of objects in your category. So, that vector space will be called a G module, a left G module. If you have for each pair of objects in the group point, In the module, in the group point, linear actions of this form. So, basically, what I'm introducing here, satisfying these conditions, of course, is the notion of what in some books and some references is called a partial action of a group point. But I'm trying to use this more convenient notation for us. And of course, the category of left modules, G-modules, is monoidal. So this is a half-life structure. Half-label structure. So consider now at the composite algebra. Remember, that is saying that these are all algebras such that when you add them up, you recover the original algebra. So if I want to state a similar theorem to that of groups, and it's something similar to the group of algebra automorphisms. So I'm going to define the X algebra automorphism group point, which of course would be a group point. Which, of course, will be a group point dependent of X, where the objects are precisely the decomposition of A, and the maps between them will be the invertible unit of algebra maps between those two objects. So the theorem says that if you take a group point and an algebra, being an algebra in the module category of over J, over G is the same. Is the same as having a module such as these two conditions satisfy some well classical formulas for a group point acting on an algebra, which is equivalent also to having a groupoid homomorphism, that's just a functor between G and the group point I just introduced, which is similar, akin to that of algebra automorphism group. Of course, when you take a group point. Of course, when you take a group which is a group, this all collapses to the classical case. And just to finish my final words, you can consider also the group point algebra, which is in general not a half algebra, but a weak hoff algebra. Here, the unit is given by the sum of all identity morphisms. And of course, this is a hoff-like the structure. Half-like the structure, meaning that the category of modules is monoidal. So I need to, when we lift up from the group case to the group algebra, we use four functors. So I need to introduce the groupweight version of that. One of the functors was the group of units. So I need to define some weaker version of the group of units. So for that, I introduced the notion of local unit. If you have an algebra, If you have an algebra and a set of non-zero orthogonal idempotents, take an element in this corner algebra. So we say that A is local unit. If you have another element, but in this, we could call it up corner algebra, which I will call the local inverse of A, such that precisely when you do the multiplication in both the two options, you recover the unit of each of this. Each of these corner algebras. So for that, I will define the group point of local units as the following category. Objects will be precisely the indexes of X and homomorphisms, morphisms between two objects will be precisely these local units starting or leaving in this algebra. Of course, the inverse of Course, the inverse of a map here will be precisely the local inverse. So, this is a more general notion of that of group of units, which will be called the group weight of local units. And also, I use a founder of group of group-like elements of a Hof algebra. So, here I need a notion of group point of group-like elements of a weak Hof algebra. So, I'm not gonna dive into the details because I'm running out of time. Because I'm running out of time. But this is a construction from these people from 2014 that allows you to construct a group point of group-like elements with morphisms being of the way you would expect to define group-like elements in a Wickhaf algebra using the subco-unital algebras and maps. And with that, I can define the three main categories for these functors. For these functors, I'm trying to construct. One will be the category of unital algebras with given sets of non-zero orthogonal idempotents, such that the unit is the sum of all them, which I will call X algebras. The second one will be the category of groupoids, all having the same object set, which I will call X groupoids. And thirdly, all the Wickham algebras having an Algebras having a set of non-zero orthogonal idempotents such that the unit is the sum of all them, they are all group-like elements, these identities, and I'm calling this X-Wickhoff algebras. So with that, I can define these four functors analogous to the group case, which will be the functor of taking a group point algebra of a groupoid that's either can be seen as. Either can be seen as an X algebra or an X weak of algebra, the functor that takes an algebra and gives you the group point of local units, and finally, the functor that takes a weak hof algebra and gives you the group point of group like elements. So with that, of course, what you will expect, these pairs of functors are adjoined to each other, meaning that you have this natural bijection. That you have these natural bijections that allows you to lift group point maps to algebra maps and group point maps to weak off algebra maps. And this gives us the final result that says take a group point, an algebra. So of course, as in the group case, these two categories are the same, KG mod and G mod. So being a module algebra over them is the same, but that's equivalent to having a G node decomposable algebra. A G-naught decomposable algebra and a functor, a groupoid homomorphism between G and this groupoid, but you can leave that up to we have algebra map from KG to this group point algebra. So we have proven that acting categorically for a group point algebra is the same as acting representation theoretically. Unfortunately, I run out of time. So a summary of our work. A summary of our work, I presented here the group version, the group algebra version, the Lie algebra version, the enveloping algebra setup, the commutative hoof algebra setup, and the group weight and group weight algebra setup. But we also did it for certain class of Lie algebraids, for certain class or certain notion of enveloping algebra of certain class of Lie algebra. And that was used to also state this type of result for co-commutative we have. Result for commutative Wiehoff algebra using a weaker version of the constant Miller-Moore Gabriel, I think that's all theorem. And the objects, the end object for these cases are these ones. So yeah, that will be it. Thank you very much. Any questions or comments? Let's thank them one more time and we'll recover in 20 minutes with nice stuff.
