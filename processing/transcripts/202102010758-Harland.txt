There? Yep. Okay, can people hear me? Okay, so you can post stuff so I don't have to. Good. Everything's fine. Right. So can you hear me, Jack? Yes, I should say the BAMF recording tradition continues, but remotely. And so you will be able to sort of see the talks. Okay, thanks. All yours. Okay. So just to give me a minute to orient myself. I'm trying to get the chat window open just so I can. Uh chat window open just so I can see if anything is posted. Well, okay. Uh let's not uh dwell on that. Okay, um right so hopefully you can all hear me and see the slide that I've just put up there. So I thought I'd start by thanking. By thanking the organizers for all of their effort, both in organizing this workshop as a physical thing in the first place, and then on top of that, rejigging the event as something that can happen online. So that's quite a hard thing to do. I'm sure it's a lot of work, but it's great that they have done that for us all. And I'd also say. And I'd also say it's quite an honour to be able to give this introductory orientation talk. I'm sure there are lots of other people here who are very well qualified to give this talk. So, well, nice that I had that chance. And what I'm going to aim to do, I want to sort of make part of this just an introduction. Of this, just an introduction or refresher for people who maybe have are new to monopoles or people who studied them a long time ago and have drifted out and maybe want to reorient themselves. So, there'll be quite a lot of stuff here that's not new to many of you, although I hope everyone will learn something. And I'll also sort of try and give a sense of the history of the subject, where it started, where it's got to. But I would say it's a long history and I haven't been able to say everything. So if you think there's something important I missed and you want to comment on that, please I welcome your comments. And yeah, just to say that this is the first survey talk, so I'm focusing on construction of monopoles and transforms and things. There'll be other surveys looking at things like metrics and metric asymptotics. So I'm not going to say so much about that. And just one thing to flag up, so you can see maybe at the bottom of my intro slide, some of you might know. Some of you might know some of the many excellent pure mathematicians at Leicester. So their department is under threat of closure, and I invite you to sign a petition to support them. Anyway, other thing to say is please interrupt me and ask questions if you wish to do so. Right. So, as I said, Marpol's. So, as I said, monopoles have a long history, and I thought it would be kind of fun to think what the world was like when the subject started, which is either 1974 or 1975, depending on quite where you put the date. So, what was going on in the world in 1974? Well, a controversial American president had Uh, American president had just been forced out of office. Um, uh, that was in the US, whereas in Canada, uh, Monsieur Trudeau was the president. Um, and what was happening in the UK? Well, the UK was agonizing over its relationship with Europe. Um, well, maybe not so much has changed, but at least I can say a lot. At least I can say a lot of progress has been made in the world of monopoles, if not in all spheres of human activity. So let's start with the basic definition. So what are monopoles? Well, very briefly, you have what's called the Higgs field. Higgs field is a function for phi from R3 to the Lie algebra SU2. You have a connection A, because I'm working on R3, it's fine to think of that connection as just being a Lie algebra valued one form. You put together a covariant derivative DA and a curvature two form FA, and their monopoles, the things we're all interested in, are solutions of this equation, DA. Solutions of this equation, dA phi is equal to star of FA. That's called the Bogomolny equation, and it's accompanied with boundary conditions. Well, I won't say in full detail what the boundary conditions are, because that's a bit distracting. But the main thing to keep in mind is that as you go out to spatial infinity, the norm of phi goes like one minus. Goes like 1 minus n over 2r plus decaying terms. Okay, so what's this thing n? Well, it's not obvious why this should be from the equation I've written there, but n is always an integer, a positive integer, and it has various topological interpretations. The simplest interpretation would be to say it's the number of zeros of this function phi. But the caveat there is zeros counted with multiplicity. So just as holomorphic functions might have zeros of order one or of higher order, the same is true for monopoles. And in fact, there's nothing to rule. There's nothing to rule out a monopole having a zero of negative order. So that's a difference with holomorphic functions. For example, in theory, one might see a charged three monopole with four positive zeros and one negative zero. Okay, so this number of zeros, you can also think of it as a winding number. So restrict phi to a large two-sphere in space, then the norm of phi is non-valid. Then the norm of phi is non-vanishing. That means it maps to a two-sphere and target space in SU2. It's a winding number of that. The eigen spaces of this thing phi at large radius, they define line bundles over a two-sphere. And this n is the churn number of one of those. But the thing I'm simply going to call it is charge. So this thing n, I'm going to call it as the charge, and it's some sort of. Is the charge, and it's some sort of topological thing. Okay, so one thing to say about monopoles that they arise from a variational problem, they minimize this energy that I've written here, the L2 norm of d phi plus the L2 norm of F. And where do they come from? What's the interest? Well, as I said, I haven't written. As I said, I haven't written the full boundary conditions down, but one consequence of the boundary conditions I've written down is that for large values of r, if you work in a gauge where phi is diagonal, star F is also approximately diagonal, and it looks like this: IN times DR over 2r squared. If you remember high school physics, that's the inverse square law. Physics, that's the inverse square law. So that looks like, in fact, you can think of that as a magnetic field, and it's a magnetic field which is sourced by a magnetic pole. And magnetic poles are things that have long been suspected or hoped to exist in physics. And monopoles provide a sort of nice way to realize them. So, in other words, In other words, the observation of Tuft and Polyakoff was if you're very far from a monopole, it looks indistinguishable from some point source of magnetic charge in Maxwell theory. Okay, so that's the thing that kicked this all off. I should say Tufta and Polyakov were not looking at exactly the energy. I said there it's something slightly more complicated. And that interest actually. And that interest actually, surprisingly, maybe still hasn't died off. So, this was a conference at the Royal Society, I went, or a workshop that I went to a couple of years ago about what's called the metal experiment at the LHC. So, having got tired of searching for supersymmetry, the LHC also ran an experiment looking for monopoles. As far as I know, they didn't find anything, but the interest is still there. And yeah, I've written Holy Grail of Particle Physics. I think that's quite a good metaphor. So the idea of a monopole is one that's captivated physicists over many generations despite the lack of experimental evidence. And I think. And I think Holy Grail is maybe also a good metaphor because, well, they never did find the Holy Grail in the end. So, well, we'll like to see. There are other ways that monopoles appear in physics as well, but this was the kind of the first thing that got interest. Okay, so I mentioned Tifton Polyakov, and then the next thing in 19th century. And then the next thing in 1975 was this paper from Prazard and Summerfield. So they observed that you can actually find an exact solution with charge one. And it's a very simple exact solution. Here it is. If you're bored later in the week and haven't done it before, then I'm sure you'd be able to do the algebra and show that that solves the equation. That solves the equation, it's supposed to solve. So that's the solution, it's a spherically symmetric solution, and here the charge is one. Okay, and the funny story about that, how that came around was they were trying to find a numerical solution, and then they tried to find some analytic functions that fitted their numerical solution, and then they realized that their Realized that their fitted analytic function was actually the exact solution. That's the first indication that these equations would be integrable. Okay, so that's their solution. So what I'm going to run through next is a few different methods that can be used to construct monopoles that exploit its integrability. Oh, I forgot to say one thing. I'll do that in a minute. I should say something about moduli spaces as well. So, the space of solutions of this equation is surprisingly big. And various papers and books by Taub show that the space of solutions forms a manifold of dimension 4n minus 1. And also, that manifold. Also, that manifold has a natural Riemannian metric. It's just the quotient metric if you start with the L2 inner product for A and phi. So take a tangent vector, project it orthogonal to the space of gauge transformations. It's a moduli space, you need to quotient by gauge transformations. So predict your tangent vector orthogonal. Project your tangent vector orthogonal to that, and then that's the metric. Okay, and well, the interesting things to say about the metric. There's a manifold one-dimensional higher, which is hypercala. Probably Michael Singer will say a lot more about that. For this talk, the important thing is to do with dynamics. So the energy function I wrote down forms It forms well, that's the energy of a Lagrangian field theory. And a theorem from Stewart is that the low energy dynamics of that field theory is approximated by GAD6 on this moduli space with the metric that it carries. So that means GED6 on this moduli space is something that Space are something that have been of particular interest. They tell us something about the field theory that we started with. Okay, so now I'll do what I said I was going to do and tell you more about the integrable properties of this Bogomolny equation. So the place The place to start looking at integrability probably is in spectral curves. So, to tell you what a spectral curve is, I first need to tell you about mini twister space for R3. So, mini twister space, it's just the space of oriented lines in R3. And it's not hard to convince yourself that the space of That the space of oriented lines in R3 is the tangent bundle over the two-sphere. Here's a picture that does it. So I've got a line running across. n is a unit vector that tells me the direction of that oriented line. So n has length one. And then v is the perpendicular displacement from the origin. And because that's perpendicular, it's perpendicular to n. So you can think of that as a tangent vector to the two-sphere. Tangent vector to the two sphere. And then the tangent space to the two sphere, well, it's a complex manifold. It's also the tangent space of Cp1. And then there's a holomorphic interpretation of monopoles. So one way to look at it is with the spectral curve. So a line is called spectral. Fix a monopole first. A line is called spectral. Monopole first. A line is called spectral. If the following happens, you look at this ordinary differential equation for a function v on the line, a function v from the line to c2. And if that equation has a solution that decays at both ends of the line, then your line is called spectral. So typically, there'll be a solution that decays at one end and it says. Solution that decays at one end, and a solution that decays at the other end. If there's a solution that does both, that's a spectral line. And if you put together the set of all spectral lines, that forms the spectral curve. So it's an algebraic variety, in fact, living inside TCP1. So the fact that that's an algebraic variety is something holomorphic. Something holomorphic is surprising if you haven't seen it before, but it sort of follows from the special structure of the monopole equation that we started with. Okay, so that's what the spectral line is. And then it turns out that monopoles can be completely characterized by their spectral curves. So here's the theorem from the famous theorem from Hitch. From famous theorem from Hitchin, there's a bijection between the moduli space of monopoles and this moduli space of spectral curves satisfying various constraints, which I probably won't go into right now. But right, so that that's the big result there. Result there. So that means if you wanted to parametrize the space of monopoly, one way to do it would be to try and parametrize the space of spectral curves satisfying these constraints. And that sounds like it might be easy because it's just playing with holomorphic things, but the constraints are very difficult constraints to impose. Constraints to impose in practice. Right, so it's not quite as easy as it looks. I also meant to make a note there. So the genus of this curve for an n monopole is n minus one squared. And so you can see that the genus grows rapidly with n. And actually, the genus tells you how difficult it is to read. It tells you how difficult it is to reconstruct the monopole. So you can see that, well, if n is 2, it's a genus 1 curve, an elliptic curve, and that's kind of in the realms of being tractable, but very quickly you get beyond n equals 2 and things get quite difficult. Okay. I should say it's in principle possible, but in practice quite hard. Possible, but in practice, quite hard to go back from the spectral curve to the monopole. But there's one nice result from Hertibes, which is you can at least reconstruct the asymptotics of the monopole in quite a nice way, even if you can't reconstruct all of the monopole. Okay, so that's the NAM transfer, the spectral curve. Next thing to talk about. Next thing to talk about is the NAM transform. So, this is another miraculous tool for constructing monopoles. So, here we are. The NAM transform is something that relates monopoles to what we call NAM data. So, let me tell you what NAM data are. For R. So let me fix the open interval from minus one to one. And let's say I've got three matrix, three unvalued functions on that interval. And I'm going to ask them to satisfy this simple looking differential equation, the NAM equation, and also boundary conditions. Well, the boundary conditions are that That are that the T should have poles at both ends, and the residues of those poles form irreducible representations of the Lie algebra SU2. So there's a way to take a set of num data and construct a monopole and it goes like this, a very brief summary. A very brief summary. So for each x in R3, I define ex to be the space of solutions of this differential equation that involves all of the matrices T and the coordinates X. And I require my solution to extend to the ends of the interval. So if I require it to extend If I require it to extend to the ends, then the space of solutions is two-dimensional. And that means for each x, I have a two-dimensional vector space, EX. I put them together, I have a rank two vector bundle over R3. So you can think of that as a sub-bundle of the infinite dimensional space of all functions v and And if I take the induced connection on that bundle, that gives me a connection on this rank two bundle. And if I also take the operator that sends a function v to the function i times s times v, and I project that operator, then I get an endomorphism of the bundle phi. And those two things together, it turns out, are a monopole. They satisfy the boundary condition. Boundary condition and the differential equation, the Bogomolni equation. Okay, so very briefly, that's what the Narm transform does. And again, remarkably, this map that takes NAM data and gives you monopoles is a bijection. And in principle, that gives you another way to construct. That gives you another way to construct monopoles. But again, it's not straightforward to do that because to actually do the transform, you need to solve that differential equation that's doing some integration. You also need to do these projections, which involve L2 inner products, so that requires more integrations. And altogether, those are not things you'd necessarily be able to do explicitly. Explicitly. Okay, and then the Narm transform links in with the spectral curve. You can read off the spectral curve directly from the solutions of Narm's equations, and it's just that formula there. And well, in principle, the left-hand side of what I've written depends on S. But if you write Names equations as a lax pair, you realize that actually it doesn't depend on S. Okay. So that's my lightning overview of the different tools that we have to construct monopoles. And I want to tell you in a lot more detail now the story of the two monopoles. So that's the next step up from the very simple solution that I showed you before, the Praset Sonofield one. So one One thing that's known very well for the two-monopole is its spectral curve. So back in 1983, Jacques worked out what the spectral curve would be. And it's given here, quite simple. And it's all in terms of elliptic stuff. So there's an elliptic parameter k and there's a complementary parameter k. there's a complementary parameter k prime and then capital k that's the complete elliptic integral of the first time and that's what the curve looks like so the curve is known and and well so this depends on one parameter in principle there are seven parameters in the moduli space of two monopoles but lots of those correspond to translations and rotations so And rotations. So, up to translation and rotation, every spectral curve looks like this one. And then that's the curve. What about the NAM data? Well, the corresponding NAM data is also known explicitly. And again, quite simple, it is given in terms of these Jacobi elliptic functions. And I can't remember who wrote that solution down first, but both the curve and the solution of norm equations have been known since the very early days of the subject. But of course, we're really interested in the monopole. So, what about that? Is the associated monopole something we can construct explicitly? So, a very early result in that direction was this result of Ward. So, Ward wasn't able to get a complete formula for the two monopole, but in the very particular case, k equals zero, he got close. So, when k equals zero, it turns out the solution is The solution has an axial symmetry, so that simplifies things a bit. And Ward was at least able to get formulae for the norm of phi on the axis of symmetry and in the orthogonal plane. So those are the formula I've written there. So, how did he do it? Well, actually, I'll tell you how in a minute. Another thing he did, just I'll mention this here to compare later, he also worked out the energy density at the origin. So, although he doesn't only know the monopole on a plane and an axis to get the energy, An axis to get the energy density, you effectively need to work out the Laplacian of that function. And you can't do that everywhere, but you can do that at the point where the axis and the plane meet. So he got the energy density at the origin. And okay, now I'll say what I was going to say. So the method he used to get this was something called the AKANZATS, which I haven't told you anything about, but Which I haven't told you anything about, but there's also a holomorphic bundle over Twister space. And the AKANZATS is a way of trying to describe that bundle and then more clever tricks let you take that bundle and turn it back into a monohole. To a mono hole. So that's what he did. And so that looked quite promising. 1981, already we had these formulae, but from then on, it proved a lot of work to get any further with this problem. So my next slide, I'm going to try and sort of summarize all the effort that has been put into. That has been put into extending this result. So Ward wasn't the only person to make use of the AKANZAS. There were quite a lot of other people involved, some of them people who were here, in fact. And yeah, that sort of covered two or three. That sort of covered two or three years working on that. And quite a lot of progress was made. So, in terms of constructing the holomorphic bundle, I think, well, Corrigan and Goddard in particular were able to do a lot of that for general charge N. But when it comes to actually explicitly constructing the monopole itself, I think that approach. I think that that approach didn't really get much further. I did want to mention Arafati, Rouhani, and Singh. So they did some algebraic geometry and then tried to construct phi itself numerically. And they were looking at where the zeros of this function phi was. And their numeric suggested that. Numeric suggested that they were at plus or minus elliptic parameter k times elliptic integral capital K over two. So that was one thing that did come out from that. Another approach was this 4-gash, Horvath, and Paller approach that was maybe a bit more grounded. So they started thinking about axial monopoles. They used the Ernst equation and Beckland transformations. Transformations and their approach got used a bit later. There's a famous video of two monopole scattering. Some of you might have seen it. Michael Singer, I think, showed it last time we were at Beers. So that's what they used. And then another school tried to use the Narm transform itself. And one positive result there was for Jen. To result there was for general k that Brown, Presset, and Panagopoulos could at least get a formula for phi on a portion of one axis for general k, not just for k equals zero. And that's just mentioning again, not only the Arafati group, but also the four gash, Horvath, and Palat group also suspected there were zeros of phi. Zeros of phi at those points on one axis. Okay, so a lot of work, but it's a long story, but progress is still happening. And just in the last couple of years, there have been some real breakthroughs. So, Braden and Dinolsky have been plugging away at this themselves for about 10 years. And just to Years and just a year or two ago, they published some explicit formulae for phi in the case k equals zero. And as far as I can tell, those formulae are valued everywhere, not just on the axes. And in the case of general k, they published formulae for phi which valid on the three main three axes, the x1 axis, x2 axis, and x3 axis. Axis. And well, I can't show you those formulae, but I can at least show you the energy density. So if you know phi on three axes, you can work out the energy density at the origin. And this is the formula they get there. You can see the more complicated formula in their paper on the axes. And they also looked at this question of where the zeros are, and they found that. And they found that the zeros are not where everyone suspected they were, but they fail to be at those places in a very interesting way. So their expression for phi on the axis is written as a fraction, and the numerator has a zero in two places. One of those is plus or minus k k over 2, and the other is not. But the denominator also has a zero at k k over 2. So the parent. So, the Haren zero at kk over 2 is not a zero. There's another zero that's very close to it, but they don't have an explicit formula for that one. Okay, so that was, I guess, brings us right up to date on that problem of constructing two monifolds. Okay, so just pausing a minute. Just pausing a minute, let people catch up. So, what I want to go on to do next is, well, tell you about other constructions, maybe not quite as explicit, and other geometries people have been thinking about to sort of try and fill in some of the activity that's been happening apart from this pioneering problem. Engineering problem. Right, so yeah, I'll start by talking then about higher charges and so on. So constructing the monopole explicitly, even for k of equals two, has been n equals two has been a very hard problem. So what other approaches can you do if you maybe Maybe don't settle for, don't insist on having an explicit solution. Maybe you can do a bit better. So, one approach that has worked well is this thing called the rational math construction. Well, because I'm behind where I wanted to be, I'll not explain it, but just tell you the theorem of Jarvis. Well, it looks similar to an earlier theorem of Donaldson, but Theorem of Donaldson, but this is the one I wanted to flag up. So there's another bijection between the monopole moduli space and the space of rational maps from CP1 to CP1 of degree n moduli rotations of the target. And this is a nice construction because there's no constraint on the rational map. It's very easy to rational. It's very easy to write rational maps down. And it's also nice because this construction represents nicely the action of rotations of space. So what that means is that if you want to find molecules invariant under the action of some discrete subgroup of SO3, to prove their existence, all you have to do is prove the existence of a rational. Prove the existence of a rational map variant under the same subgroup. So this approach led to the discovery of some low charge monopoles with platonic symmetries. And here are some pictures of those monopoles. So it turns out for charge 3, there's a unique monopole with the symmetry. Hole with the symmetries of a tetrahedron, and that's shown in the top left of that picture. And for charge four, there's a unique monopole with cubic symmetry, that's shown in the top right. And then lower down, we've got something that looks like an octahedron, a charge seven that looks like a dodecahedron. And then for charge 11, it's known that there exists Known that there exists a unique charged 11 monopole with the symmetries of an icosahedron, but no one's ever made a picture of it. Okay, so how did those four pictures get made and why is the fifth one difficult? Well, those four pictures were made by solving the Narm equation explicitly and then doing the NAM transform numerically. And the reason you can And the reason you can solve the Narm equation explicitly is that the quotient of the spectral curve, although the spectral curve is not elliptic, it has an elliptic quotient. So that means gives you access to a solution involving elliptic functions. In the charge 11 case, the spectral curve is not elliptic, neither is its quotient. So that's the thing that makes that harder. Okay, so I also wanted to mention that these pictures inspired some further discussion about sizes of monopoles. So there was a conjecture made in 2006. Stefano Bolognazi asked the question: what is the smallest charge-N monopole? Monopole? And he proposed an answer to that question. He said it should be approximately spherical, and its scalar field phi should, Higgs field phi should look something like this. So zero inside a sphere and doing the obvious thing outside the sphere. And that conjecture was inspired in part by those pictures that we saw. By those pictures that we saw earlier. And well, actually, that's no longer a conjecture. So, Taubes, I didn't give the date, but within a few years of the conjecture, Taubes proved at least a version of it. So, if we think about for small epsilon, think of the set of all points in R3 where phi is less than epsilon. Where phi is less than epsilon, and think about the diameter of that set, where the diameter is the smallest ball that, the diameter of the smallest ball that contains that set. Taues came up with a lower bound on that diameter, which agrees bang on the nose with Balamazi's conjecture. Aisy's conjecture, and well, Tabes did various other things. He also constructed analytically solutions that come close to meeting that bound, and he looked at various other measures of size. But so I thought I'd flag that up. I mean, I think that there's more to be done there. So, Taub's result is just looking at one way to measure the size of a monopole, but I'm sure there are lots of other ways. I'm sure there are lots of other ways one could define the size of a monopole, and it would be nice to think about that. In fact, I have a new student working with me who's already thinking about those kind of questions. Right. Okay, so that's magnetic bags. Right, I guess at this point, I'm going to start. So, at this point, I'm going to start generalizing a bit. So, up till now, I've been talking about monopoles and R3 with gauge group SU2, but one can think about other gauge groups. And I wanted to flag up that quite a lot of activity has and still is happening there. So, if you go away from gauge group SU2, you have to think. Pair C2, you have to think more carefully about the boundary conditions that you involve, and there's a lot of choice to be made there. But the simplest thing to think about, it turns out, is a boundary condition of maximal symmetry breaking, which the main feature there is you look at your asymptotic. Asymptotic value of your Lie algebra-valued scalar field or Higgs field phi and look at the stabilizer that in the Lie group acting on the Lie algebra. And the smallest thing the stabilizer can be is a torus. So if the stabilizer is a torus, that's maximal symmetry breaking. And in that case, you can do quite a lot. You can do spectral curves. So, whereas before we had one spectral curve, in this case, you have a spectral curve for each node in the Dinkin diagram of your group. And those curves will intersect, and the intersections are governed by the lines in the Dinkin diagram. Dinkin diagram. And you can also do a Narm transform. And again, the Dinkin diagram appears there, at least in the case SUN. So you have Narm's equations on a string of intervals. There's one interval for each node. And the intervals have joining conditions. And you have a joining condition for each line on the Dink. Condition for each line on the Duncan diagram. That's for SUN. The other classical groups also work very nicely. And the pictorial way to think of that is in terms of folding Dinkin diagrams. So you impose some symmetry on your solution of Narn's equation that corresponds to the folding of the Dinkin diagram that gives you the group that you're after. Group that you're after. Okay. What about other things? Well, all of that was for maximal symmetry breaking. There has been quite a lot of interest from the physics side in non-maximal symmetry breaking. So different kinds of boundary condition. And there's been some recent work of Charbonneau. Recent work of Shabano Nagi looking at that, I'm sure they'd be able to tell you more about it if you ask them. And the other thing that seems understudied to me at least is the non-classical groups. So spectral curves work for any simple group, but as far as I know, there's not a simple way to do the norm transform for non-classical groups. There was an interesting paper a few years ago. Paper a few years ago by Yasha Schneer. They tried to construct monopoles with gauge group G2. There were some people in Lattice QCD who were particularly interested in gauge group G2. And the way they did it was, well, they thought G2 is a subgroup of SO7. So they try and construct a monopole with gauge group SO7, arrange the root structure so it has a chance of being in G2 and G. Being in G2 and cross their fingers and hope that it is. And at least when they tried it, that approach worked. But it's not clear that's always going to work. So that's something people might think about, how to find all monopoles with non-classical groups using the Larm transform. Another kind of group you might think about is loop groups. Is loop groups. So a monopole with a gauge group, a loop group, is the same thing as an instanton on R3 times S1. And those have been of interest in their own right for a long time. They're called calerons. They appear in studying quantum field theories. Studying quantum field theories at finite temperature. They're the instantons that one needs to study if temperature is non-zero. And again, there's a NAM transform on spectral curves that one can do there. So Nai Singer, well, Nam himself proposed the form of the Narm transform. Nye Singer did a lot of analysis of the Narm transform. Narm transform to show that it works how it should. And at least in the case n equals 2, Shabino-Hertabes have shown that the Narm transform is a bijection. And again, the Narm transform knows about the Dinkin diagram for the loop group. So on the left, I've got, this is for SU three. On the left, I've got three intervals, and on the right, there's the Dinkin diagram. The Dinkin diagram for the loop group with three nodes. Okay, and then there's been some work in actually finding the solutions too. So famous results from Harrington Shepherd, Kran van Paul, Li and Liu gave some explicit calorons quite intricate formally, but But again, using the Narm transform, they were able to get these some colour ones completely explicitly. If you're looking at just classifying things with symmetry, then Josh Cork did some work on his PhD with me classifying calorons with cyclic symmetry. And the reason that's an interesting thing is a sort of novelty for calorons is you can have a symmetry group simultaneously. Can have a symmetry group simultaneously acting on space and on the Dinkin diagram. That leads to quite an interesting problem to solve, which Josh did solve. Okay, so one could also think about different geometries, not just different groups, but different geometries. And one easy way to, well, a natural way from the point of view. Well, a natural way from the point of view of the Norm transform to generalize the geometry is to replace some of the factors of R with circles. So for example, instead of R3, you can think about R2 times a circle. And there is a NAM transform in that case. That was worked out by Sergei Cherkis with Kapusti. Cherkis with Kapustin. And the interesting thing there is the transform relates the monopoles not to solutions of Narm equations, but solutions of the Hitchin equations. And they themselves are related to Higgs bundles. In fact, to be precise, to parabolic Higgs bundles of a very particular type. Particular type. And again, you can do things like looking for symmetric solutions and, well, at least for certain choices of groups, those have been classified now. There's a picture on the right of that's a charge for it's a charge for monopole chain with a Z8 symmetry. With a Z8 symmetry, and the way to think of it is right, I'm thinking of R3 as the universal cover of R2 times S1. So imagine that as a sort of repeating extended object, which I've just shown you a small piece of. Okay, so there's that, and people that have done some interesting things looking at dynamics there as well. Looking at dynamics there as well. Maldonado Ward in particular. One can take this a step further and think about monopoles on R times T2. There's been quite a lot of work there, which I've struggled to summarize in one slide. But an interesting thing that happens there is, well, Cherkis and Ward found a NARM transformer. Mord found a Narm transform in that case. This time, the Narm transform takes a monopole on R times T2 and gives you another monopole on R times T2. So it acts as an automorphism on the space, on all moduli spaces of these so-called monopole wolves. And it's not the only automorphism. It sits inside a group SL. A group SL2Z, or I think in fact, GL2Z, that's acting on these moduli spaces. So there's sort of interesting extra structure that appears there. So I mentioned Cherkis and Ward. Rebecca Cross recently has been doing work with Sergei looking at metrics. I won't say much about that, but there's But there's activity there. And then, I mean, the other thing one might hope to do is to make pictures of these things. So Cherkis and Ward did have a little bit of that. They had some numerical solutions and some explicit perturbative solutions that they were able to graph. And what they also did was find ways to describe the moduli using Newton. Describe the moduli using Newton polygons and amoebas, which some of you may have heard of before. That's just a reminder, a picture there to remind you about that approach. Okay, are we not yet out of time? Good. Okay, so the last interesting geometry to mention is hyperbolic space. So, a famous observation of Atia is that the monopole equations on hyperpolic space are integrable. And so, one can set up a similar problem. We'll go back to gauge group SU2. And this time I'm going to ask that my scalar field phi tends to a positive constant V as I go out. To constant v as I go out to infinity. And if I say that the scalar curvature of H3 is minus one over R squared, then the combination VR is dimensionless. So that means if I want, I can't just set V equal to one, or if I do set V equals to one, I've sort of limited the problems I'm looking at. I'm looking at really, there's a different problem for every value of the real number VR. I can't just set V or the combination VR to one by rescaling. So there's a bit more to think about there. So there is a twister transform. So there are special. So there are spectral curves that they live in the mini twisted space, which this time is Cp1 cross CP1 minus an anti-diagonal. And one can once again find, construct spectral curves from monopoles. So Norbri and Ramau had a very fine effort doing that. So they Doing that. So they constructed spectral curves for two monopoles on hyperbolic space, but also three and four monopoles with platonic symmetries. And what about a Narm transform? Well, for general values of this parameter VR, there is no Narm transform, but if it's a half integer, there is a sort of a Narm transform. There is a sort of a Narm transform that's been known for a long time. It comes from thinking of R4 with R2 removed as being conformal to H3 times a circle. So in effect, for those values of V times R, hyperbolic monopoles are just circle invariant instantons, and one can rephrase the ADHM equations as NARM equations. As norm equations. Okay, so that's sort of what's been known for a long time. Or I should say the discrete norm equation, not many solutions known, but I think people haven't tried. What's emerged very recently is that if this parameter v times r is exactly one half, then Then you can construct hyperbolic monopoles in various ways, most simply from harmonic functions on R4. That's a well that's a very old trick, in fact. So Corrigan, Goddard, sorry, Corrigan, Fairley, and Atuft and Jakiv Noel Rebbe finded that approach in the early. Planet that approach in the early 80s, but just recently, Sutcliffe, Manton, and others have been thinking about using that to construct hyperbolic monopoles. And the great thing there is you can construct monopoles for this particular value of VR, and they're just rational functions. So that function there for phi squared, that's the analog of the, well, analog of... The analog of the recent result of Braden-Enolsky, but in hyperbolic space. So it's a complete formula for the charge two monopole with axial symmetry. And I mentioned this high-cosahedral charge-11 monopole that was very hard to construct. It's very easy to construct for this particular hyperbolic space. And there's a formula released along an axis. At least along an axis. So that's one thing. They also, Mant and Suckler found a new way to impose the circle symmetry on the ADHM construction that seems to work much better than what Brahman Austin had done before. And what's really nice is that they've been able to connect these approaches to the sort of spectral curve approaches. The sort of spectral curve approaches, and so now, well, the very recent result was to get the spectral curve for the seven monopole on hyperbolic space by solving the ADHM equation. So that's kind of doing a similar thing to what Norbri and Ramau had done before, but now there's a much more streamlined way to do it. Okay, so I've got to the end. I had meant to show some videos at the end, but I don't want to eat up the question time if there is some question time. So let me end there and let people ask questions. And your question could always be: can you show me a video of hyperbolic monopole scattering? Poliscattering. So, well, thank you very much, Derek. It was a beautiful talk. Is there any questions? Probably the simplest if you just pipe up. So, does anybody want to see the video? Or maybe we can show it during the discussion period? Show the video now. Okay, let's let's. Okay, let's have some pictures. So, right, so I'm grateful to Paul Sutcliffe for that these are videos that Paul Sutcliffe and his collaborators have made. So, this is showing a scattering of charge three monopoles in hyperbolic space. So at the beginning of the video, you got three spheres. Those represent the three monopoles and the ones at the edge look small. That's because I'm in the Ball model of hyperbolic space. And this is showing a one-parameter family of monopoles with a discrete symmetry. I think it's a dihedral symmetry. Symmetry and well, you can see in the middle of the video, it stops on the tetrahedral charge 3 monopole before. So, it's a family that goes through that tetrahedral monopole. And the other thing I could say is: well, if there was a metric on this moduli space of hyperbolic monopoles, that would be a geodesic. Monopoles that would be a geodesic for the metric, and it would describe scattering. But as far as anyone knows, well, there are metrics on the space, but no one knows that those metrics have anything to do with dynamics of hyperbolic monopoles. So at the moment, it's a mathematical curiosity. So that's just a one-parameter family. I mean, there's not any claim about dynamics, is that right? That's correct. That's right, uh, that's correct. The dynamics is another open problem that, yeah, yeah, described to me by Nick Manson on one occasion as a can of worms. Yeah, that's not a bad description. I would say a can of infinitely long worms. But somehow the problem is that these hyperbolic monopods have long tails which are very heavy and they're very difficult to drag around. Very difficult to drag around. Yes, so not, I don't think anyone believes that's an easy problem, but that's not stopped lots of people trying. Okay. Any other questions? Okay. Well, thank you very much. And it's, oh, we've got a new one. We've got a new one.
