Tell us about generalized braid group actions. Thank you, Rina, for agreeing to speak. Yeah, I would like to start the talk with thanking the organizers for organizing this conference and giving me opportunity to speak. And it just occurred to me right now when I was staring at this slide that there is a mistake in the title of my talk. Because yeah, I've made the Because, yeah, I've made the title and abstract, I've made the slides, I've sent everything, and I only realized it just now. Of course, generalized braids are a category, not a group. So you can either put parenthesis around braid group, so generalized braid group, which is a category, or just think of it, generalized braid group category actions. So So let's start with talking about weak break group actions on a triangulated category. So weak action of a group on a category is an assignment of an exact, well, assignment of a functor. And if we're talking about triangulated categories, we are interested in exact functors from t to t to every. So, we assign such a function to every element of the group so that the composition, the functor we assign to the product of G1, G2 is isomorphic to the composition of the functors we assign to G1 and the functor. G1 and the functor we assigned to G2. So these isomorphisms are in general not so there are no conditions on them. There are just some isomorphisms. And I'm going to concentrate on three examples or rather on one and a half of them. But the examples of brain group actions on direct Of brain group actions on derived categorical coherent sheaves on algebraic varieties, there are several. So, first, there is the toy example of C2 with the standard linear action of the permutation group with three elements. So, if S3 acts on the plane, then the braid group with three strands also acts on it. And then, so if And then, so it induces the action on the derived category just by push forwards. Then, if x is the minimal resolution of a Kleinian singularity, then there is a break group action on the derived category that does not come from automorphisms of the base. And the generators of this break group action are spherical twists in the spherical object. In the spherical objects, and the objects are the structure shapes of the exceptional curves. And the third example, which is going to be the most important example today, is if we have the cotangent bundle to the flag variety, and here I mean flags, so for GLN, so type AN only. And only. So I'm talking about just the usual flags in the n-dimensional space. So collections of subspaces of every dimension. And then the break group action on the derived category of that is induced by spherical twists in now spherical functors. And those functors are given by sort of Fourier Mokai transforms from From a derived category of the cotangent total space of the cotangent bundle to now partial flags. If we take the full flag and drop the space of dimension k, that's now a partial space of partial flags. We denote by p sub k comma n. And there is a functor from the direct category of t star of that to direct category of t star of full flags. So So those functors, yeah, and they generate the break group action on the derived category here. Well, T star to flags is of course not a compact, so not a projective variety. So one can circumvent the badness of its derived category of coherent. Derived category of coherent shapes by either considering some compactification or considering, so only considering the objects with support on the zero section of this cotangent bundle, or so considering some equivalent shapes. However, the define so the So the property of this example that's going to be the most important for today's talk is that there are more of these categories and these functors than just the cotangent bundle to the flag variety and the break group acting on it. Because there are also cotangent bundles to all partial flag varieties. Varieties. And we see that it is the functors from the cotangent bundles to flag varieties where we drop one flag. Those are the functors that induce, in a sense, this breakgroup action. So there are also other partial flag varieties. And in fact, whenever we drop a space from a flag, we get adjoint functors between those. Between those cotagen bundles to those spaces of partial flux. So there is a whole network of functors. And this has been studied extensively. And the representation that exists there is a categorical SL2 action. And this was established by Kautis, Kamnitser, and Likota. Kaminser and Likata. And they have proved that there are, so between some of those categories, there are equivalences. So some functors that we can cook up from this network of functors between T-star to partial flag varieties are surprising equivalences. And those functors were constructed as convolutions. Convolutions of certain complexes, which they called Ricard complexes. And so the theory that I'm going to establish today, so for the theory that I'm going to establish today, this is going to be one of the examples that we have. So we are trying to construct this theory based on one side of this example. So, on one side of this example and this network of functions and equivalences, but on the other side, we have also constructed another example, which bears some similarity to this one, but does not repeat it. So, let me discuss it. So, the phenomenon that we observe there is a representation of a Representation of a diagrammatic category that we're going to call the generalized braid category. So think about a braid group, but where the strands are allowed to come together and split apart. So every strand still goes in one direction, and we are going to read this from the bottom up. From the bottom up. So we start the bottom and then we read the diagram from the bottom up. And every strand still, so in so every strand only goes up. So at no point does it turn back like in tangles. But strands are allowed to stick together and then come apart in various combinations. They're also allowed to cross like the usual bread group. So we can define a category. So, we can define a category. The category where the objects are points with multiplicities. For example, in this picture here in the slide, the bottom has multiplicities 3, 1, and 1, and the top has multiplicities 1, 2, and 2. So, the total multiplicity should still add up to n. So, the same in the top and bottom naturally. And you can see that for all such diagrams, and we view these diagrams after a zotopair. And you can always perturb this diagram like this so that merges and crossings don't happen at the same vertical level. And then you can cut it into strips and see that every Into strips and see that every diagram is then a composition of some generators. And we're going to call these generators: so a fork where a strand comes apart, a merge where two strands get together, and two types of crossings. So where two multiple strands cross over or under. We would also like to give these diagrams a framing. Groups of framing. And so they're best thought of as cables. So think about a computer cable where several cablets are glued together side by side. And then we can rotate this whole thing all together, or we can split it off in one. in in in in one or several groups or we so we can we can twist and and then when when we twist the whole construction we can either think of it as twisting the root of the fork or flipping the the two branches and twisting each of them so topologically it's like several threads glued next to each other into a ribbon Into a ribbon. So, which and thinking about generators and relations, this adds a generator that twists a strand and adds some relations about it. So, this is a topological diagrammatic category. And this is, so these generators are very similar to the generators of the category of. Generators of the category of webs. However, this category is not webs because webs is a Z linear category. So this category is just purely topological. So composition is concatenation and we are viewing these diagrams up to isotopy, but we don't add them yet. So instead of giving it a Z linear structure, like in Like in webs, where your morphisms are essentially linear combinations of diagrams. We are going to impose conditions on a representation. So our goal is to take representations of this category on triangulated categories. So we impose conditions on functors that represent the generators instead. So, denote this category by FGBR sub n for frame generalized braids. And we would like to consider representations of this category with several conditions. So, and the first of all is that merge and fork generators are adjoint. So, we would like the merge to be the left adjoint of the The left adjoint of the fork that we get by reflecting this merge with respect to the horizontal axis. And then our know-how is that if we can assign a functor to every fork and assign its left adjoint to the symmetric merge, then we can construct complexes indexed by pairs of numbers. Indexed by pairs of numbers. So complexes PQRS, where P plus Q equals R plus S. And those are complexes of morphisms from a point with multiplicity P, point with multiplicity Q, to point with multiplicity R, point with multiplicity S. And if our representation Representation is in fact a categorical SO2 action, so which is more restrictive, so more conditions hold that we want to require. Then those complexes are going to be quasi-isomorphic to the recurrent complexes. And then we place the condition that those complexes are equivalences when so this fancy way. Fancy way to say that either Rs equals Qp, so we have complexes from PQ to Qp, or we have complexes N0, N0. So we want them to be equivalences when either Rs equals Qp. RS equals Qp or PQ and RS both equal N0 or 0N and acyclic otherwise. And then we so those complexes where we have complex from PQ to QP, those are essentially crossings. So one of the types of crossings. So let's assign the crossings where the left strand passes over to be the convolution. To be the convolution of this LP, QQP. And then the complexes where we have M0, M0, that's the twist of a multiple strand. Then the twists of single strands are tweezers. So if so a single cable does not have any width to it. So in fact, that framing is the memory of, so if we have. So, if we have several strands going next to each other, the memory of which came from the left and which came from the right. There is one more relation about which it's not clear where we should place it into this category or in the previous category. Sorry, my looks looks like my scrolling just got frozen. Sorry. Sorry. Okay. Let me stop sharing for a moment and then resume it because it looks like my exorno stopped responding. Okay, now it works. Sorry about that. Works. Not sorry about that. Sorry, can I ask? So are these representations of this category, are you saying they're into derived categories then? They act on derived categories. So such a representation exists in this example with T-star flags. With T-star flags. Then the category that corresponds, the objects of this category are sets of points with multiplicities. The object that corresponds to assign a category to a set of multiplicities, that would be the derived category of T-star to partial flags. And in a partial flag, we take the spaces that correspond to the intervals. So, for example, 3, 1, 1. So, the first two intervals are collapsed. So, that would be a set of the space of partial flags, will have flags of dimension three and four. So to a set of uh so to a set of points with multiplicities who assign a partial partial flag, and then the category that uh corresponds to this object. Corresponds to this object is the derived category of the cotangent bundle. Sorry, may I add a little bit to Rina's answer? Sure. If we are talking about scan-tranglated representations of the generalized braid category, as Rina does on the next slide, we mean any scan-triangulated is a property of any representation where these objects of the category, this multi-party. Of the category, these partitions are mapped to enhanced triangulated categories of any sort. So, in the example that this all came from, they are direct categories of cotangent bundles of flag varieties. But in general, the theory we are developing can apply to, and all the conditions I'm reading in the next slide, can apply to any representation of FGBRN on any set of enhanced tangulated categories, DG enhanced or any other higher categorical enhanced. Sorry. Sorry. Yes. Yes. That is correct. So skin triangulated representation is just a property of representation. So we have two examples of those right now. And one of them is with those cotangent bundles to partial flags. And that example, so in that example, the categories in question are derived categories. Are derived categories on potential bundles to partial flux. And the other example I'm going to introduce in a couple of slides. So can I just, sorry to keep asking questions, can I just, let's say you have a representation in GG enhanced triangulated categories. Yes. So where does this LRSPQ live in the as a bi-module module? Digibimodule, this is a Digibimodule. Yeah, so these are complexes of morphisms. So if so every category is category of DG modules, then those diagrams correspond to DG by modules. Yeah, there is one more relation that we can think of leaving on this level, so as a restriction in the category or on the Restriction in the category or on the previous level because on so on one hand it is not topological, on the other hand, it can be stated for so without invoking the triangulated structure. So relation that we call the multi-fork relation. And it says that if we split a strand into two and then again into two. And then again into two. It doesn't matter in which order we do that. So here we split first into K plus L and then into K plus L and M, and then K plus L is split furthermore into K L K and L. Into K and L. And the second one we split into K and L plus M, and then we split the L plus M into L and L. Those must be isomorphic. And then considering that the merge functors are adjoint to this, the same thing also holds for merge functors. Sorry, so does that so we can either consider the topological category as the category of diagrams. Category as the category of diagrams up to isotopy and that relation. Or we consider a skin trend-related category to be a category that satisfies all these conditions plus this existence of these isomorphisms. So, how to so in yeah, so we have two examples, and let me now discuss the And let me now discuss the second example, which is going to be the focus of this talk. Oh, now, yes, so the complexes. So let me first talk about the complexes LPQRS. Where do we get them? So suppose we have a set of forks and a set of merges, and the merges are left adjunct to forks. Then we have two adjunction maps. If we split and then merge back, And then merge back, that maps to identity. And identity is max to first merging and then splitting. Then the terms of this complex are enumerated. So this n here, by that I mean p plus q, which is equal r plus s. So if I have n strengths which are grouped into p Which are grouped into P and Q in the bottom and R and S in the top. The terms of the complex are enumerated by all possible splittings of N. And so in the middle, I must have an object which is a partition K1, K2, and up to Km. And then this diagram I have, so first I split P and Q into a common partition. Into a common partition, so into a common refinement of PQ and K, this K bar, and then I merge if needed to get K. So the bottom part of this diagram is the most straightforward way to get from partition PQ to partition of case. And the top half of this diagram is the most straightforward way to get from the partition of case to the partition RS. Can I just ask? So, is this a condition or is this? This is the definition. I'm defining the complex which I denote by LPQRS. Let those be the terms of this complex. And let this, so this is a complex of diagrams. And this diagram, and then when we have a skin triangulated representation. A skin triangulated representations, those diagrams become functors. They are functors between DG-enhanced categories, so they're DG by modules. This is a complex of DG by modules. And the object indexed by a partition K1, K2 up to Km sits in degree negative M, negative M plus one. So that in the So, I'll have an example on the next slide. So, in degree zero, we have only the object where P and P come together to multiplicity N and then split apart. That's degree zero. Then, all partitions with two groups are in degree negative one and so on. And the differential takes so takes a partition and glues two parts of it together. Lose two parts of it together. So a differential then, so a partition K1, K2 up to Km is mapped to all partitions that we get by adding to two neighboring terms of this partition. And then there are two ways to do it. We can either close, so we can either glue together two strands that Together, two strands that so such that nothing happens to them in between. So they come apart and then they come together. And then this is just a junction counit. But then there are also, so we can also need to glue together two strands such that something does happen to them. So other strands, yeah, so other strands come in or come out. Strands come in or come out. And then this map illustrated in the bottom of the slide. This is a composition of first and adjunction unit. So first, so we take the middle of the diagram and glue two strands together. So that's the adjunction unit. Then we use the multiform. Then we use the multi-fork to turn it into a picture like this, where we have a bubble on one strand and the bubble on the other strand. And then we use the adjunction co-units to hop those bubbles. So do adjunction co-unit here and here and get the diagram that we want. So, the differentials in this complex are compositions of adjunction units, adjunction co-units in the multi-four chisomorphisms. So, here is an example. This is what the complex for peak U equals 3, 1 and Rs equals 1, 3 looks like. So, the partitions where the label Where the labeling comes from are indexed by green lines. So let's look at in degree zero. The partition in the middle is just four points together. So from three, one we go to four, from four we go to one, three. Then in degree negative one, we have a partition where from three, one we go to three, one, nothing happens. So this guy is indexed by three. This guy is indexed by three and one. This by four and zero. So three, one, two, three, one, nothing happens. And then three, one, two, one, three. So two strands go. So this is the guy indexed by two and two. From three, one we go to two and two. And then from two and two, we go to one, three. This is indexed by one and three. And this is. And this is two one one and this is one two one and this is one one two and this is one one one one so uh these terms uh so these complexes always have the same uh this is so always look like uh n n-dimensional cube n minus Dimensional cube, n minus one dimensional cube. And so always have the same structure. Note, though, that there are, so in this particular complex, there are a lot of redundancies. A lot of these diagrams are the same, so they're they're isotopic or relate related by so isotopic up to the multi-fork isomorphism. The multi-fork isomorphism. And it is easy to see that the maps, so the differentials in this complex between two isomorphic diagrams are in fact those isomorphisms. So a big part of this particular complex is a cyclic. So this is an isomorphism. This is an isomorphism. This is an isomorphism. This is an isomorphism. So essentially, this convolution of this big complex is the cone of just one morphism from degree negative one to degree zero. So why then consider this whole big complex? Well, because this is not going to be This is not going to be that simple for all PQRS. Then, second, so we cannot prove yet that for any skin representation, this complex has a unique convolution. But since this complex is built upon adjunctions, there is a big chance that this is the case. And so far, we have been able to prove that with an additional condition, that complexes with smaller P plus Q, those, so remember that the complex PQ R S must be acyclic unless basically Rs equals QP and and the complexes with smaller if the complexes with smaller p plus q are not not only acyclic but if they split after you um add so after so those are complexes from pq and into r s uh and there are some that so there And there are some so there is something happening in between. Suppose that we compose them by with a fork and emerge on both sides so that there are now maps from n to n. So if complexes with all smaller n that are acyclic, are not only acyclic, but if they split when you do this to them, then the convolutions of The convolutions of complexes with next values of n are unique. And this is the case in both examples that we know for t-start partial flags and in our special example with new HK play modules. So now let me go and introduce our example. First of all, let's First of all, let's stop working with triangulated categories and start working with DG categories. So, a DG category is an enhancement of the triangulated category if the triangulated category is its H0. And we would also like to work with Merita enhancements. So, do a triangulated, so do a category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a quasi-compact quasi-separation. On a quasi-compact, quasi-separated scheme, or a category. So, we can assign a DG algebra such that this category of quasi-coherent sheaves is enhanced by the category of H-projective modules over this algebra. And the continuous functors can be Can be that is represented by age projective bimodules. And for bounded category of coherent shapes, we have Morita enhancement. Here it should be P. If we are talking about bounded categorical coherence, then the same thing, but we also want our H-projective bimodal. We also want our H projective bimodules to be oh, no, actually, this is already written in here. So, we want our H projective AB bimodule to also be B perfect. So, we'd like to construct the example in terms of DG by modules rather than in terms of triangulated categories. So, the downside of it is that at this point: The downside of it is that at this point we lose geometricity. So, even if we had a category of sheaves, the derived category of sheaves on some algebraic variety, the construction I'm about to introduce is not a priori. So, the categories that I'm going to introduce are not a priori categories of coherent, derived categories of sheaves on some varieties. However, However, so this is an open question. So we construct them as categories of modules over some DG category that we construct from the category of our algebraic variety. So it is an open question whether those are equivalent to some categories of sheaves on some algebraic varieties that are related to the initial variety. To the initial variety. So, this is a hint at a possible Mach correspondence type of thing. However, we do this construction in terms of DG modules and bimodules. So, let me introduce some notation and terminology and not spend too much time to this because I don't have a lot of it. So Define the so let W be the group of permutations. So, in general, this can be done for a Coxstrue group, but right now we're only interested in Sn and define the Neil-Hacke algebra as an algebra generated by n minus one generators and with relations that distance generators, distance generators compute. Distant generators commute, adjacent generators satisfy the bridge relation, and the square of a generator is zero. So it would have been the group algebra of Sn but for this relation. Then this algebra has a standard basis that consists of words of the generators. So those generators correspond to the Generators correspond to the standard permutations. And then each permutation has a length, which is the length of the minimal decomposition of it into standard permutations. And then we can define the multiplication in the Nil Heike algebra such that by this condition, basic element corresponding to two basis elements. To two basis elements corresponding to two elements of the group multiply to the element corresponding to their product if their length lengths satisfy this and zero otherwise. Now we can take this and define a Nielheke algebra in the category of bimodules. Suppose that we have a small digit category and AA bimodules. AA by modules, so n minus 1 AA by modules, such that now we want Hi tensor HJ to be homotopy equivalent to HJ tensor HA. And the braid relation we also satisfied as a homotopy equivalence. And then we can, so to each basic element in the new Hecke algebra, we can assign. Algebra, we can assign a bimodal. And like we could have said that just take this element of the Neil-Hecke algebra, it's a word of generators, and assign to it the tensor product of capital H by modules. However, different words produce tensor products of H's that are only homotopy equivalent. If we want to define multiplication in this, multiplication in this. And if we want this multiplication to be, so if we want to make a DG category as in not an A infinity category, if we want this multiplication to be actually associative, we need to do better than that. And it turns out that we can construct a twisted complex of all possible words. So consider an element of the permutation group. The permutation group, then it has several minimal presentations as a product of standard transpositions. So take all those tensor products of generators, and we can find a twisted complex which is where all these words are listed in degree zero, in particular. And so we more. So, more precisely, we can assign a twisted complex of words of H's to every element sigma, such that if we multiply two elements and their lengths satisfy the requirement so that their product in the Niel Hake algebra is not zero, then tensor product of the correspondent. Tensor product of the correspondent complexes is a sub complex of H sigma 1 sigma 2. So this is done by certain topological trickeries. So now I know more about the combinatorics of the permutation group and about point set topology than I used to know. For example, for n equals 3, so for five of the six elements of S3, Of S3, there is only a unique word of standard transpositions that gives you the required element. So we have just A, just H1, just H2, just H1 tensor H2, H2 tensor H1. But then for the H1 tensor H2 tensor H1, we need a twisted complex. And here is this twisted complex. In degree zero, we have both words: H1, H2, H1. Both words, H1, H2H1, and H2H1H2. In degree negative one, we have one of them, H1, H2H1, which is mapped to degree zero via identity and homotopy equivalence. So this twisted complex is homotopy equivalent to either H1, H2H1 or H2, H1, H2. So it gives the correct thing in the derived cardinal. So in H0. And when you multiply, you concatenate, and then you just put it. Just put it in the corresponding terms. So either this or that, depending on whether the concatenation gives you 1, 2, 1 or 2, 1, 2. So, and what we get is an honest play as a not homotopy associative algebra in the category of dg by modules. And then we can consider the category of modules. We can consider the category of modules over it. Yeah, and we can all so, and now this algebra has a ton of sub-algebras. We can choose a subset of generators and only take those direct summons that are generated by those generators. So, for each subset of generators, we now have a block subalgebra H sub I, and it is a DG algebra. So consider a category of modules for each of them. And those, so this network of sub-algebras induces adjoint pairs of functors. So induction and restriction functors between their categories of modulus, because this is what sub-algebras do. And we have a hypothesis. have a hypothesis/slash partly theorem that if so if we start with a weak brain group action on the on a triangulated category, that we can DG enhance it and do this this construction so and take this network of categories Categories of DG categories of modules over those block algebras. And that their homotopic categories, their H0s, will carry the generalized brave category action. And then the forks and merges are induction and restriction. So when we split, so when we Split or so when we so splitting so splitting a trend is like adding a generator in so in in the middle we can so we we have proved this for n equals 3 and we have made progress for general n so this is like the uh the usual so we're doing this the algebraic geometry way and but so so far so this is our So far, so this is our second triangulation point for this generalized braid group actions, because this is not an SL2 categorification. So a lot of things are different. So things that should be direct sums in an SL2 categorification are not. So instead, there are just extensions or convolutions of complexes. Then the Then the twists, so the functors that correspond to convolutions of L M0, M0 complexes, that are shifts for T star flat, so for this for an SL2 kid graphification, are not shifts here. And then when we started all this, we expected the forks that split That split a strand into 1 and n to be pn functors. Because this is what happens with T star flux. If you split K into 1 and K minus 1, so this is a P K minus 1 functor. And to them, so the correspondent twist. So, the correspondent twists are essentially the correspond to the diagrams where we cross this one and k minus one strands and then cross it again so that the crossings is not undone. In this example, those forks are not the n functors. The n functors, but there are still twists. So there are still odd equivalents that are in a loose sense associated to them. It's just that if the conditions of an SL2 categorification hold, then this functor can be defined entirely just from this functor. But if they don't, then we actually need the, so we meaningfully need the other category. We meaningfully need the other category. So, not only the category 1, K minus 1, but also the category K minus 1, 1. So, there is more information that's just cancelled out when we have an SL2 categorification. And so, in the SL2 categorification example, the Compositions of first fork and then merge like this are split. So are direct sums. So they're basically identity tensor H, so tensor of the cohomology of the corresponding Grassmannian. So, in this NeoHake example, they don't. But in the NeoHacke example, the other ones are direct sums. So in the Neo-Hack example, these compositions are direct sums. So, yeah, so this is work in progress with Timothy Logvinenka, and we feel that there is still more to find out. So, one of the more interesting questions here is that what we get is an algebra over the algebra that enhances the derived cut. Enhances the derived category of shifts. So, what we get is, in a sense, is a shift, so a shift of non-convutative algebras over your algebraic variety. So, is there another algebraic variety such that the categories that we get are direct categories achieved on that? So, Thank you for your attention, and other questions write thank you messages to Rina in the chat. The chat. And so, are there any questions? Try to monitor. Okay, can you go back one slide, please, Rina? Yes. Yeah. So at the end, you were saying that you get some kind of Non-commutative algebra over an algebraic variety. I didn't quite understand what algebraic variety over all algebraic varieties? No. I mean, so suppose we have, right, so that our, yeah, I did not state explicitly our hypothesis. So it's if we have a weak braid group action on a triangulated category, then Then it can be extended to a weak generalized braid category action. In particular, if we start with a weak brave group action on an algebraic variety, so on the derived category of shifts of an algebraic variety, then what do we get? Well, this derived category of sheaves is equivalent to some derived category of modules. And we get so over some algebra, DG algebra, and we get a DG algebra over that algebra, which is but which is not commutative. So it's an algebra object in the category of bimodules. So if your derived category of sheaves is equal Of sheaves is equivalent to derived category of modules over A. What you get is an algebra R, which is an AA by module. But the action of A on it on the left and on the right is not commutative. And that's where you have this Skyn grade group app. Sorry, this representation. I don't remember the Representation. I don't remember the terminology, but that's where this categorical action lies, right? On we are constructing a bunch of algebras. Oh, I see. Over A. So a bunch of algebras over A, but they're like there it's there are not even There are not even algebras in the usual sense, as in the elements of A are not scalars, they act differently from left and right, so maybe not even the sheaf. So each partition is going to an algebra? Yes. Each partition is going to an algebra like this. So for each partition, we can assign a set of generators. So the generators correspond to the missing intervals. So if we have, say, three, one, and one. Sorry, can I add just one minor little point to Rina's answer? There is a sort of important perspective here. There is a rather snappy paper. There is a rather snappy paper by Ed Siegel called All Otto Equivalences Are Spherical Twists, where he proves that any auto-equivalences arises as a spherical twist. Well, an ota-equivalence is a representation of braid group on two strand, because that's the only thing that there is there. And a statement that can be lifted to a spherical functor is, in our language, precisely the statement that can be lifted to a representation of GBR2. Of GBR2, because our scan translate representations of GBR2 is just a spherical functor. And what Ed did is he took the original category, which was which usually in cases of interest is direct category of algebraic variety, and did a square zero extension of it. So what we do, we have n auto-equivalences. And then for each of them, we take a square zero extension. And then we start taking square zeros extensions of those extensions. Square zeros extensions of those extensions. And all of this builds up to sort of an ultimate thing at the very, which then we realized can be actually viewed as this Neil-Hecke algebra over the original thing, with everything else, with all these previous layers being the sub-algebras in it. But roughly, what's happening here is a more complicated version of the square zero extension in Ed's paper, which everybody knows, which is why I brought it up. Everybody knows, which is why I brought it up. Sorry. Yes, thank you. Yeah, I should have said for one generator, this is exactly a sequence construction. All right. Do we have other questions? Okay, let's thank Rina again, and you should again take a look at the chat. Again, take a look at the chat. There's many silent thank yous for you there. Thank you very much. All right, we'll continue again at 12:30.
