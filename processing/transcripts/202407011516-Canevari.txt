No, it did not. We had to again remove it, put it on, especially also the system. So we will delay. The next speaker today is Definite Parivali, who would tell us a little bit about the pre-discontinuity problem for selective usings. Well, thank you very much for this introduction, and thanks to the organizers. Introduction and thanks to the organizer for having me here in this very, very beautiful place. So, I have a small disclaimer that I need to make before a start, for real. This is going to be, again, free discontinuity problem and smacketic liquid crystals. I'm not really an expert on smacketic liquid crystals because I pretend I am a mathematician, not really a physicist. I'm not really an expert in free discontinuity problems either. This is my first time that I'm working with them. Time that I'm working with them. So, well, as you will see, there's also many, many, many, many. We have a few results, but just a few of them is early stages and many, many open questions. But there will be parabolas. I promise that. It's all two-dimensional, though, so it's much, much, much, much simpler compared to what we just saw. Also, Irani's talk, it was all based on geometry. And here, what we wanted to do is to build up an What we wanted to do is to build up an energy function of some sort of function. So, we wanted to do some calculus evaluations. But in the end, it seems like this energy function likes for operators and this sort of objects. And it's also a very important thing. It's joint work with John Ball from Heriot Mott in Edinburgh and Hong Kong, and Bianca Sarfolini from Naples. She's in the audience. Very well. So, the physical motivation we had in mind was about smack tick with liquid crystals. About smack liquid crystals, this phase of matter where the molecules have orientational order, they want to say align more or less in the same direction, and some positional order because they tend to form layers. So layers are the important part. And just to be clear, today I will be looking at semantic A-liquid crystals, so the molecules tend to point in the orthogonal direction to the layers. And our motivation wasn't the picture that Randy just The picture that Randy just showed us, even though maybe there's some sort of vague similarities, it is. It was some experiment by some physicists in Paris. It's Emmanuel La Caz's group, I believe. What did they do? They had a substrate. Don't ask me about the details, but a bit fuzzy, but sorry, but they had a substrate that was prepared in a suitable way, so they had planar anchoring, and then they put it, they poured a smacketic liquid crystals on top. Smectic liquid crystals on top of the substrate. And then they did some spectroscopy to try and understand what was going on with the smectic layers. So this is a picture, it's a drawing really, that represents thematically the behavior of the outcome of one given experience. So I'm not quite sure that you can see them, but there's plenty of small, small lines, thin, thin lines, and they represent osmatic layers. So the molecules are supposed to be. So the molecules are supposed to be orthogonal to the layers. And here towards the bottom, the layers are vertical because the molecules want to be planned, parallel to the substrate. Here there's the interface with the hair. This is, I forgot to say, this is of course a two-dimensional cross-section. But I sort of think that the configuration is mostly invariant with respect to the direction that's orthogonal to the plane of the screen. So you should think that these objects. So, you should think that these objects repeat themselves in the third direction, more or less as they are, in a parallel way. And there is some profile here. This is the interface with the air. It's not flat. It has some sort of indentation and they repeat themselves in a periodic fashion. It's very, very interesting, a pattern. And they have all these layers here that are parallel to the interface with the air because there are omeotropic boundary conditions, so the molecules want to stay alphabet to the air, or the interface. So there is some. So there is some variation in orientation of the layers. Sometimes the variation is rather smooth, say. Sometimes the variation is very localized, very sharp. Some surface defects in the orientation of the layers. So what we wanted to do to try and understand these things is that we wanted to focus just on one aspect of these pictures. These are very complicated pictures, but we only looked at one feature, and that is the presence of surface discontinuity. Presence of surface defects in the layers. And we wanted to try and model this by means of some free discontinuity problem. So I probably skipped this line and many, many other slides, but let me just tell you, of course, you know better than myself that there's plenty, plenty of ways to model selected lipid crystals from the point of view of the calculus variations and continuous theories. And what we wanted to do was to take possibly the simplest theory, so in Frank really. Theory, so Zin Frank really, cosmetics. It's written with a Q tensor, but it's really Osin Frank. And then we included some extra feature to this energy, to this basic model, so as to make it a free discontinuity problem. And now, I suppose I should really tell you what is a free discontinuity problem. This is a problem in the calculus of variations where the unknown function that we solve for is not necessarily a smooth function, it's not even a sublimate function. Function, it's not even a subonet function that rings a bell. It's going to be a function that has jumps, a function that has discontinuities. And ideally, the discontinuities are supposed to represent, perhaps, these very regions, this very sharp region of change in the orientation of the magnetic layers. So the function that we look for has some sort of discontinuity. We don't know exactly where this is going to. We don't know exactly where this is going to happen. It could be anywhere. And in order to find out where the discontinuity is going to happen, we minimize a function. This is why we call it a free discontinuity problem. It's not constrained to be somewhere known a priori, it's wherever it wants to be. And when we talk about free discontinuity problems in the calculus of relations community, there is one very important example, which is the Manford Sha function. It was proposed for function. It was proposed for image processing, so it's a very different motivation and the details will be very different too, but the mathematical structure overall will be similar. So we have a function in the case of the Manford Schaff function is just a scalar function, a real-valued function. For us it would be a Q tensor, but the overall structure is similar. It's defined over a two-dimensional domain. Everything I'm going to tell you today is two-dimensional. To the right. And then there's an energy which is composed by a gradient part, and an energy which is composed by a jump part. S of u, that would be the singular set of u, so the set of discontinuous points for u, so the jump set. And if the domain is 2d, the jump set will be one-dimensional, and this funny h with a 1 on top of it, it's just a weird symbol for length, you could say. So overall, you are computing the. Overall, you are computing the gradient energy of U away from the jump set, and then you're adding the length, the total length, of the jump set. This would be the Mumford Shah functional, at least the basic skeleton of the Mumford Shah functional. Typically, there will be some lower order terms or something similar, but these are the two main contributions to the energy. And there's plenty of people who have worked on that, so I will not talk about that, of course. Being Italian, I should at least mention the name of the Georgi. At least mention the name of the Giorgi, the Giorgio Lambrozi, they related, and then the Giorgi, Cavier and Liacci, they had very, very important mathematical contributions to the theory of this function. So overall, what I'm going to tell you will have a very similar structure. There will be an unknown, for us, it's a Q-tensor. There will be a bridge energy, which is an elastic energy, and an energy localized on the jump set. Very well. And then the details will be different. The details are more reminiscent to some other. The details are more reminiscent to some other things. The other is Giga functional, if that rings a bell to some of you, but I will skip all of this because we are late already. So, what do we do? We take a two-dimensional domain, a bounded and smooth domain. It's given to us from the very beginning, which is not the case in the physicist experiences, because they were pouring some fluid on top of substrates. So, the domain was free to do whatever it pleases there. There's no telling the priority. There's no telling a priori where the liquid crystal is going to be. But this is too complicated for us, so we just assume that the domain is given from the very beginning and it's two-dimensional, so it's a cross-section of your material. And then we represent, not quite the orientation of the layers, we represent the orientation of the molecules by means of the Q-tensor, roundout the Jean-Q tensor, except it's two-dimensional, so it's a two-by-two matrix because it's a 2D domain. And we also assume. And we also assume that the Q tensor is going to be a unioxial one, and the scalar order parameter is given. It's a certain constant. It doesn't really matter what constant it is, just for simplicity, we took one over the square root of two, because it turns out that it simplifies a few equations a little bit. The Q tensor is uniaxial and has a fixed scalar order parameter. So there's a first constraint which is embedded in the theory because you need to take values in this particular. And need to take values in this particular set of matrices. So, this is a pointwise constraint that's built into the theory. And then there is a second constraint, which is a differential one this time. We require that certain combination of grad Q, the derivatives of Q and Q itself, is equal to zero. So it doesn't really matter for us. This is a combination of London, the G, and elastic energy terms. We've seen that already. First of all, this morning. It's some sort of combination of the derivatives of Q and Q itself. We require it to be equal to zero. And why is it so? Well, we are building a continuum theory. We do not see explicitly the layers. In the continuum theory, the layers have infinitesimal thickness. I mean, the thickness of the layers is proportional to the molecular length scale, so we do not see them in a continuum theory. But there is something in the theory that tells us. Theory that tells us that there should be equally spaced semactic layers. And it's in here. It turns out that if you compute this constraint in terms of the q n sorry in terms of the molecular director n, this is equivalent, having this equal to zero, is formally equivalent to having the curve n equal to zero, which is the way Yosine proposed to talk about semantic implicits. So there is a pointwise constraint, and at the There is a pointwise constraint and a differential constraint, which are built into other models. But then again, Q is not smooth, Q is supposed to jump. So if I can get a bit technical for the mathematical-oriented people. Q is what we call an SPV function, a special function of bounded variation. What does it mean? It means it's a function of bounded variation. The distribution of the derivative of Q is a measure. It's a radon measure. Derivative of Q is a measure, it's a radon measure. And moreover, the derivative has a special structure. There's a component which is absolutely continuous to the vector, and another component which is carried by the jump set. So, in less technical terms, you have a jump set, which is what I denote here by SQ. Again, it's the singular set for Q. It's a one-dimensional set, because we are in a two-dimensional domain. As soon as you are away from SQ, you have a well-defined notion of. From SQ, you have a well-defined notion of gradient, which is what you use in the theory away from the jump set. But then you have the jump set, which is again one-dimensional, it's rectifiable, meaning there's a well-defined tangent direction to the jump set almost everywhere. So there is also a well-defined normal direction, and I can take a normal vector to the jump set, which is what I call here. And niq, at a given point x in the jump set, there will be a niq of x, which is the Be a niq of x, which is the normal direction to the jump set. And then, since this is supposed to be a jump set, if I approach the point x, except I'm coming from this side of the jump set, or I'm approaching the same point, but I'm coming from this other side of the jump set, well, the values of q will converge to two different things, because they're supposed to be a jump discontinuity. So these are my traces, q minus of x and q plus of x. Of x and q plus of x, they're well defined almost everywhere, and generically they're different at the jump point. So, this is the structure of the function that I work with. I do not know a priori where this step is going to happen. It's a free discontinuity problem, but I must be prepared to the possibility that it's there somewhere. It would represent a region where the direction of the layer is jumping. So, oh, we want to. This is a technical detail, if you will. We want to include some boundary conditions into the theory, except working with boundary conditions in the Sandra sense is mathematically a mess for this sort of problems because of continuity issues of the trace operator. So, what we do instead of having a proper boundary condition is that we take a neighborhood of the boundary and we impose boundary conditions, sorry, thickened boundary condition, meaning that the behavior of Q is prescribed not. The behavior of Q is prescribed not only at the boundary, but really basically everywhere in my blue region here. This is, I mean, if you do that, you're adding some contribution to the energy, which would be the contribution, the energy of this blue layer here, but it's the same contribution that you consider for any configuration in the admissible set. Effectively, you're just adding a constant to your elastic, to your energy functional free energy functional, so it doesn't change. Free energy functional, so it doesn't change dramatically, I suppose. And mathematically, it's much, much, much, much simpler to work with. So, this is what we do. And this is just to sum up the space-up at mystical configuration. This SBV here means that they could jump. And they satisfy, well, technically speaking, there's something on gradient, and that's neat. They could satisfy, they satisfy methicken boundary conditions, so to speak. So to speak, so this replacement of boundary conditions. And then again, I have two constraints, which are the ones I showed you at the very beginning. There's a point-wise constraint, and there's a differential constraint, which corresponds to the presence of semantic neighbors. This is the space of admissible configurations. Okay? So BD satisfies some equation, or QBD is just the. Well, now there's an energy function that I minimize on this. Functional that I minimize on this setup. Here's an energy that I want to minimize. Sorry. Is this answering to your question? I'm sorry, maybe I probably misunderstood. No, no. You mean, well... I was asking, does QBD satisfy any equation or? Oh, this QBD. QBD, sorry. No, in principle, it just needs to be compatible with the constraints that you put. But it could be, in principle, anything. In principle, anything. I mean, you won't have an equation in here, but you don't care. It's just a replacement for the boundary condition, but it could be anything so long as it's reasonable, let's say. It doesn't satisfy an equation. Yes, thank you. Now I understood your question. Sorry. So these are the configurations we care for, and now we minimize some sort of function. Here it is. Again, there's an energy contribution, an elastic energy contribution. Contribution and elastic energy contribution, and there's something on the jump set. The elastic energy contribution is really the lambda, the simplest form of the Lambda Ardeshan energy. Actually, it turns out that because we have done already so many simplifications, that there is a two-dimensional model, the two-by-two matrices, and we have the differential constraint built into the theory. It turns out that this is really the most general form of the London-Design energy that you could have, subject to these constraints that we have. Subject to these constraints that we made already. So, this is not really a further restriction. Anyway, this is a quadratic energy, something by the standard, and it's not really evident in my notation, but you should think that this is taken away from the jump set. This is the regular part of the energy. And then there is something on the jump set itself. It's an integral with respect to the length measure. Sorry for my weird notation, which is something mathematicians like sometimes. I apologize for that. But it's a length measure. That, that it's a length measure, and you minimize, sorry, you integrate the energy density, a jump energy density, which in principle could depend on the traces of Q on either side of the jump set and the direction of the jump set itself, so the unit normal to the jump set. And now the question is, how do we choose the function far? This is the main point theory. So, actually, before I go to that, it really was something It really was something non-trivial, like just providing an example of one given function phi that did the job. We wanted the function phi to satisfy some geometric conditions, and this is where parabolas are going to happen later on. But also, we wanted to do some calculus abariations, so we wanted to build up a functional that has all which minimizers exist. And having both things at the same time wasn't really easy. It took us quite a long time, actually. It took us quite a long time, actually, to find just one example. So, basically, what I will do in the rest of my talk is to provide you with just the one example, just one, and probably, I mean, I'm not claiming it's a good one or anything, but it's just one example of an energy density phi that has both properties. So, parabolic lubricants and lubber semi-continuity of the energy, say, existence of minimizer. Energy, say existence of minimizer, mathematical niceness, well-behavedness. But I'm sorry for my bad use of English. Very well, so what is the geometric condition that we want to have? Here are a few pictures. These are supposed to represent some piecewise constant configuration where you have a jump, and the jump is happening along a straight line here in red. Again, we are building a continuum series, so the layers should be infinitesimal, but I've drawn them at a finite size, otherwise, we wouldn't be able to do it. A finite size, otherwise, we wouldn't be able to see anything. So, what do we see? Generically, when you have jump sets, the layers do not match on the inner side of the jump set. There is a mismatch of the layers. And this is just the way it is. Generically, this is what happens. Except if you're in a very, very specific situation. For instance, what you see here in the middle and what you see here on the right. And what you see here on the right, in these examples, here and here, the direction of the jump set is a bisector of the angle between the semantic layers on either side of the jump. And the same thing happens here. And when you do have this geometric condition, it turns out that you can indeed match the layers on either side. You can continue them consistently across the interface. Across the interface. So, if and only if this geometric condition is satisfied, then we could say you have, I mean, let me say this for a moment, we could say we have, so to speak, no dislocations of the smactic layers. Of course, it's much more complicated than this, because smagnic layers are not really something greater. I mean, I think they're composed of molecules, so it's not exactly as simple as it is in my pictures. But at least we thought At least we thought that having these geometric conditions should be favorable from the point of view of the layers. That there should be, if not no dislocations at all, at least fewer dislocations. That somehow it should be preferable in terms of the energy. And you can write down this condition in terms of the Q-tensor, these geometric conditions, which corresponds to fewer dislocations. It's something like this. It's a condition that you can phrase in terms of the traces of Q on either side of the jump and the normal. On either side of the jump, and the normal to the jump satisfaction. So, if and only if this condition is satisfied, then you are in this setting, in this case, or in this world, where you do satisfy your geometric condition and the layers do match. So, what we wanted to do is to find an example of an energy density that somehow prefers configurations satisfy this condition. So, here is an attempt. It doesn't work, but still I'm going through the stages of the process. I'm going through the stages of the process, so I'm going through the attempt that doesn't work, and then I show you how to modify this. We take a parameter alpha between 0 and 1. This has to do with mathematics, compactness in this case, SPD. But I'm not discussing that, unless there are questions. So alpha equals 0 is allowed. Alpha equals one is not allowed, at least not in the talk I'm going to present today. Who knows? But it would be more complicated to do. Be more complicated to do. Anyway, you take alpha between 0 and 1, you take perhaps a parameter μ, proportionality parameter μ, and then you could say, very well, if my configuration here satisfies the geometric condition, then I define the energy density to be proportional to the distance between the traces q plus and q minus to the power of alpha. And there's a distance between the traces because ideally, we saw in the previous, ideally, Ideally, if the distance between the direction of the layers on either side of the jump is small, the energy should be smaller. So we took something proportional to the distance between the traces to the power of alpha if this geometric condition is satisfied and only in this case. Otherwise, we set the energy density to be infinite, which is a way of saying we do not want to see configurations that do not satisfy the geometric condition. And this is all nice and good. And this is all nice and good, except when you try to work with this energy density, it leads to a mathematical tautology. So here is an example. We have a piecewise constant configuration with either horizontal or vertical layers. So the molecules will be like this or like this. And here the jump set is a zigzag line. And the angle is at 45 degrees with respect to the horizontal direction. So almost each point in this zigzag line. Almost each point in this zigzag line, except the vertices, I mean, the direction of the jump set is at a forty-five degree angle with respect to this and this. So my geometric condition is satisfied. The direction of the jump set at any point but the vertices is a bisector of the angle between the layers. And again, I should think that my layers are infinitesimal in length in my continuum theory. So now I could make a jump set that's small. I could make a jump set that's smaller and smaller, closer and closer to a straight horizontal line. So long as I keep the zigzag angle at 45 degrees, my geometric condition will still be satisfied. And now you can compute the energy. It's a finite number because my geometric condition is satisfied. And it turns out to be independent of the distance between the zeros. I mean, you could take something that's much, much smaller, and you would get the same energy. And you would get the same energy. But now you take the limit, you take the limit as a zigzag x infinitesimal, and you get a configuration here which has just a horizontal straight line as a jump set. And here in the limit, my geometric condition, of course, is not satisfied anymore, which means I have a sequence of constant energy and finite energy, but when I take the limit, I get an infinite energy for the limit configuration. Infinite energy for the limit configuration. So I suppose we can agree that this is an example of a mathematical tautology, lack of lower semi-continuity technically. And this is pretty, it's really bad news if you want to do some calculus evaluations for this sort of energy. How much time do I have still at last? Okay, well, thank you very much. Very well, thanks. So, what is the problem? Now I'm getting a bit more mathematical, I'm sorry, but. Mathematical, I'm sorry, but the problem with this energy is that it's not PV elliptic. PV elliptic is the mathematical condition that's key in the sort of business that it was proposed by Ambrose and Brian as it's a necessary condition to avoid, to have, sorry, it's a necessary condition to have the Western continuity of the functional. It's sufficient as well if you're prepared to make some additional assumptions, which are very mind. Essentially, B V ellipticity would be analogous to quasi-convexity. For the standard problems in the calculus of variations, we know that quasi-convexity is the key property in this business, is pedi ellipticity. So, how is this thing defined? It's defined in a very elegant, I think, but also a very implicit way. And this is a bit of a problem. What does it mean that my sump energy density phi is BVN? Some energy density phi is revealed. I take a triple q plus, q minus, and ni. These are all constants. Q plus and q minus are given q tensor in my admissible set. And ni is a unit vector in R2. And now I take a square. It's a unit square. And I rotate it so that the edges of the square are parallel to knee and knee perpendicular, like this in my page. I want to impose boundary conditions, so, and I do work. So, and I do work with thickened boundary conditions. So, what I do is that I take a slightly bigger square, a slightly larger one, as in here, still parallel, and then I consider this sort of square ring, or whatever it's called, I divide it into two pieces. On the top half of this square ring, I put the boundary conditions equal to q plus, which means the layers here will have. The layers here will have a given direction which is orthogonal to the direction of Q plus. And on the bottom side, I impose a boundary condition which is given by Q minus, which would be another constant direction for the molecules and therefore another constant direction for the layers, and the two are perpendicular to one and one. Q plus and Q minus are constant, but it could be anything. And now I'm looking, just for the purposes of this definition, I'm looking at a slide. This definition, I'm looking at a slightly simpler variational problem because I only consider piecewise constant competitiveness. So basically, I subdivide my square into a finite or countable number of pieces. And on each piece of the square, I put a different constant, a different constant orientation for the layers. So technically, I only consider competitors that satisfy these boundary conditions and have only finitely many values. Have only finitely many values in the range. So I consider piecewise constant competitors, and now my energy functional reduces to the jump part only. There's no gradient of Q because I've taken piecewise constant competitors. And now we'll say that my energy functional is, sorry, my energy density phi is p-v elliptic if and only if, when I consider my restricted minimization problem over piecewise constant competitors. Constant competitors, the infimum of this energy turns out to be exactly equal to phi of q plus q minus the mi. And if you think about it a little bit, this is exactly the same as saying that a minimizer for this configuration would be a piecewise constant competitor with just two values. So something really simple. This is the square ring where This is the square ring where I put the boundary condition. I divide my square into two halves using a straight cut in the direction orthogonal to knee. I put Q plus on the top half and Q minus on the bottom half. So this is the simplest competitor, I suppose, you could think of that has this boundary, second boundary values. And I will say that. Values, and I will say that the function is pv elliptic if and only if this turns out to be a minimizer for this problem. This is what it is. This is an abstract definition, but mean, it's rather, I mean, I think it's just it means essentially that your energy density prefers the jump set to be locally a straight line. And so I suppose it makes sense that if you want the jump set to be locally straight line line, Want the jump set to at least look at a straight line, then things shouldn't be too crazy. They could be a bit crazy, but not too much. And indeed, it turns out that if you do satisfy this condition, everything works very smoothly. You have no mathematical pathologies, you can prove existence of the only monitors essentially, and so on and so forth. And now, going back to the jump energy density that I showed you before, the problem with this, again, The problem with this, again, this is the jump energy density that's proportional to the distance of the traces to the power of alpha, if you satisfy the geometric condition, which prevents dislocations from happening. Otherwise, it's infinite. Now, if you consider this energy, the problem with that is that it is not bibly elliptic. It doesn't satisfy the definition I just shown. And that this is why we have this pathological behavior. This pathological behavior. So, in order to avoid these complications, what we could do is that, okay, we have something that is not VV-electric, we make it VV-related. Yes? Can you talk a little bit about why it's not VVing very briefly? Well, it turns out that if you consider this energy, for instance, if you have this energy density, If you have this energy density and you have this competitor, but your Q plus is something perhaps that corresponds to, say, this direction for your layers, and Q minus is basically almost everything. For instance, something like this. So in this case, I'm not so sure it's clear from my picture, but I wanted to choose directions of all the layers in such a way that this is not about. A way that this is not a bisector of the angle between the layers. So, in this case, this particular configuration would have infinite energy. And therefore, it really cannot be a minimizer. In order for the energy density to be big-aniptic, it should be a minimizer. And instead, what I see is a configuration that has infinite energy, so very, very far away from the minimizer. So, my condition is not satisfied. So, the usual thing to do would be: I relax a little bit my energy density. I take a relaxation. In this case, relaxation means a BV elliptic envelope, which means instead of having this psi alpha directly, I modify it by considering the solution to some original problem. Exactly the same variational problem I had before. I make it the new energy-density excitement. The new energy density xi alpha bar, I make it to be the solution to my original problem. So basically, by definition, oxi alpha bar, I'm enforcing that xi alpha bar should be dv elliptic. The problem with this is that now it works mathematically, so if you do that, you can indeed find a v elliptic function, but it's very implicit. I mean, to compute, just to compute the value of your energy density, you would have to solve a whole new variation of. Solve a whole new variational problem each time. And this is just to compute the value at one given point. Have to solve a whole variational problem. It's very implicit, it's very non-convenient. So the good news, and also my main result, is that we can indeed compute explicitly my energy density xi alpha bar, so the B-V-elliptic relaxation, the B-V-elliptic envelope. And it turns out to be equal to this one function. To this one function, To this one, function. I mean, it may or may not look good, I don't know. At least it's an explicit equation and it fits one line, so it's not too terrible, it's something that you can effectively compute. There's some structure actually hidden beside the equation, but I will not go into that. And it turns out that this is indeed a B V elliptic function. In fact, it's precisely the same thing that was written here in a very implicit way. Here, in a very implicit way. Here it's the same thing, but written in a more explicit way. And the main result of my story is that if you take the energy functional that we were talking about, and we consider this particular choice of the energy density for the jump set, you do get something that mathematically is sort of nice. You get a well-defined problem, a well-posed minimization problem, minimizer. Minimization problem minimizer success. Technically, the functional will be Logos and continuous with respect to the nature of topologies. So it's a nice function. Now, a cut short has kicked many, many things. We have something about the proof. The proof is actually... I mean, the result is very, it's short to write down, but proof is an awful mess of computation. It's really not something I really should advise you to read. To read notable mess, really a mess. There was a trigonometric system of inequalities. It's not a good memory. But perhaps, okay, we have some regularity results, but they are very simplified. I promised you parabolas. Here are some parabolas. So what we wanted to do now is that we wanted to try and play around with the functional that we wrote down in very, very, very, very, very simplified settings. So we are really far from what it is. So we're really far from what the physicists are doing, of course. Really far from anything. It's too simplified, it's a toy problem. More than a toy problem in some way, but okay, I'll tell you what it is. So we consider some configurations that are very, very special. Let's say our domain is some sort of rectangle, as in the picture. And then let's say we know from the very beginning that the jump set is going to happen along some rough. Along some graph of a scalar function. It doesn't look like a graph, but this is because it's supposed to be a graph in polar coordinates. So when you write it down in polar coordinates, this is something that you can explicitly write down by means of just one scalar function of one variable. And then we assume, we know for some reason, that the layers in here, they are circular, and the layers... And the layers outside here are horizontal. This is something we assume, so we make an unsettled on the type of configurations that we want to see. And then what we want to do is that we want to optimize for the optimal shape of this chunk set that makes the energy smaller. So this is what we did. And it turns out that because of the way you've defined things, the channel said that Some set that means things, the energy smaller is a parabola. I'm not telling you why, because we know we've learned that already. But it's hidden in the condition that this parabola at each point is a bisector of the angle between the smagged layers on either side. Oh, we are neglecting the elastic energy so far, and this is why we have one half discontinuity here and one half dislocation here, which otherwise must cost us would cost us an infinity. us would cost us an infinite amount of elastic energy. Neglecting this contribution and focusing only on the jump contribution, this is the optimal profile for the jump energy within this very restricted class of competitors. This is a theorem actually. This is something that we can prove. And how do we construct a parabola? It's not because we imposed a priori that we want the geometric condition to be satisfied. We wrote down the energy functional and we let the minimization process do its job. It's continuously since. Job. And continuously, it seems that at least within this very particular class of competitors, it lies a parallel class. And here is something similar, but it's numerics. So in this case, the domain would be a quarter of a circle. And we still assume from the very beginning that the jump set is going to happen along the graph of a scalar function, but we do not know what the scalar function is. A graph in Poland will Linux again. And we do know, we assume from the beginning that the layers were. The beginning that the layers will be circular or horizontal. And then we minimize with respect to the optimal shape of the jump set. And it turns out to be this is not quite one parabola, but it's still a union of parabolic arcs. And again, at each point, except the vertices we hear, at each point of the jump set, the direction of the jump set is a bisector of the angle between the semantic layers, the ether and psi. The semantic layers, the e d and psi. So, this is it, really. We wrote down an energy functional. It's a pre-discontinuity model, which means there's some jump set. And we do not know a priori where that is. The jump set seems to be constructed in such a way that it wants to satisfy a geometric condition. And mathematically speaking, this model is the minimization problem, it is well defined in the sense that minimizer success. We have this. Systems. We have this very simplified, explicit example. We do have some sort of regularity results as well, which I skipped for up time. But there's plenty, plenty, plenty of things. We do not know, for instance, this is all two-dimensional. I have, for the time being, no real idea of what is going to happen in 3D. And that would be very nice if we want to compare to the previous picture, for instance. There's other questions which are related to the experiments by. Experiments by the people in Paris. We're still very, very millions of light years away from understanding what's happening in these pictures because, okay, there's one feature of the pictures, that the presence of surface defects, but also many, many other features in these pictures that so far we have neglected entirely. For instance, the presence of the boundary interface with the air, and so on and so forth. There's plenty of questions so far that are open. But I think that for the time being, this is enough. Being this is enough, and well, benefit to Canada because apparently this is issue with these days. So, that's all Canadian and non-Canadian people in here. I'm sorry, but please stay as much as you can. In your example, where the lines meant the straight lines meant to be concentric circles, did you include? Circles. Did you include the curvature energy of the concentric circles part in the minimization problem? No. In this one, no. Because it was something that we... It was a... No. In this one, we neglected it in order that it was easier for us to prove a theorem. But in this one, we did include it. And indeed, it turns out that there's a parameter which tunes the strength, the relative strengths of the two terms. And if you make that parameter higher or lower, That parameter higher or slower. I don't remember which is the good direction, but if you tune it suitably, then the jump set gets bigger because, in this way, you pay a higher energy for the jump because it's longer, that you pay less for the elastic energy because you also have a smaller area where you have this variation. So, in this example, we did include it. In that picture, the spacing between the layers is the same on the other hand. The same? Yes, yes. I mean, again, there is no explicit spacing because it's supposed to be infinitesimal in all this business. But the constraint, the differential constraint that we have in here, is derived assuming that we have uniform and constant spacing everywhere. Now, the way I draw the picture, it makes it seems like there is non-uniform spacing, but this is because just Uniform spacing, but this is because just because my plot is not so. Oh, okay. Oh, because okay, okay, but it looks so uniform because in some way it is. In some way it is. A quick question. I mean, the model is based on the assumption that they are thinking this. Yes. And a possibility would be to do that, such as. Okay well the quick way to answer your question, but it's really and really cheating. So one quick thing that one could do is Thing that one could do is that, well, the presence of this differential constraint reminds us of the presence of uniform spaces. So I just dropped the constraint and I replaced it by some penalization term in the energy. And this is actually something that we have done in order to prove regularity results for the jump set. But then we kept the same jump energy density, so it's not precisely going in the direction you have in mind, right? Probably. With regard to With regard to what you are proposing, that is a very, very interesting question, but we haven't considered it. So I wouldn't be able to. Much of your trouble actually comes from the fact that there is constraint on the final channels. I wonder whether you might be an easier way to cure lowest and continuity basically you have an extra energy that you Okay, so you have an extra energy that's in a high um with regard to lower semi-continuities, what I can say is that at least so long as we remain in the SBV setting, so long as we remain in that setting particularly, a lower semicontinuity of the elastic energy uh sorry, the elastic energy and the jump energy seems to live some they are sort of separate. They are sort of separate in that lower semi-continuity on this side is depending on the properties of this one and not so much on the properties of the elastic energy. But for instance, if you move to other regimes, such as the B V setting or something even more wild, then that might not be true. And then if I have one second, perhaps I could mention that somebody else Precisely Gaudemann, Merit, Pegot, and Serferti, they did something which might be, again, heuristically or morally speaking, might be vaguely related to what you are suggesting, but it's really not the same sort of approach in that it's the Aginus equal functional. So in principle, there is no jump energy which is there from the very beginning. They have a continuum model. And then in the limit, there is some sort of jump energy hidden. Jump energy hidden, but it's all more complicated. I also pointed that in your jump energy, you had this penalization very sharp. You have class infinity if the compatibility condition is not certified. Of course, you need not have such a compatibility. So, whether also the semiconductor coming from the jump set energy would be effective. Be probably, no, probably, probably, probably, probably. But we haven't done it, so I cannot tell you for sure. But you must be right. That condition was relaxed eventually because your energy was an integral. Yes, exactly. The energy in the final energy, so to speak, has no infinity whatsoever. This is just the way some sort of did the scalic way of presenting it for the purposes of my talk. And if you don't like plus infinity, you could just represent. If you don't like plus infinity, you could just replace it by a very large constant. It doesn't change substantially what I was telling you about. Go back to the picture I asked you about. One or two? Sure. Go back to one. And so it answers Dan's question too. So I'm working with Emmanuel for Kaz who did the experiments. Fantastic. Okay, so here's a cool thing. Okay, so here's a cool thing. She can do X-ray volume model. She can do X-ray measurements where she can see that the layers, those round layers, are not equally spaced. But in fact, they get further apart as they get... Since they're higher, more tightly curved on the inside, they actually expand a little bit to lower their energy. Okay. And you can use the AVUS GIKA model. The Avila's GICA model to calculate the 1% change. Wow. With no Finny parameters. That is amazing. I mean, other than just guessing that the parameter is 1. Just saying the parameter is 1. So what's amazing is that these systems, not only are they interesting for all these boundaries we're talking about, but it turns out they're actually a way of probing the nonlinear areas. You can probe the non-linear areas a slightly more quantitatively. That is amazing. I didn't know. Oh, this is cute. Okay, so before we reveal any more secrets, let's take a break. So we have a technique. Well, I wanted to keep up with time with you. There is hologram crossing potential. This is for arcane lighter to make layers of. Layers of state structures and they interact in a very simple way. Yeah, the form of that looks physically justified, I guess, was interesting. Am I correct in understanding each other's side, but you then have a normalized operator? Sorry, I just wanted to talk about the answer. Yeah, you don't exactly have to do it. Yeah, but then it is right. Yeah, I think so. And what is it that you mentioned, by the way, the Commodore of Christmas? Could you please send me a reference? Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Right, okay. So I suppose it's similar. So this is the projection operators and training. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Right, okay. Right. Okay. So this is the magnet, so honestly, you don't need this right. You just need to do that. Yeah, yes. Okay. That's what's really interesting. I'm sure I can send you. Thank you. That would be great. I can. Sure. Let me just take a picture. This is an R. G-Ma, but I think that's also other ways that try and be professional. Or at least pretend. Which one is an article? This one. Makes sense, right? Yes. Yeah, yeah. Name, docser name at Uni Verde. Well, thank you. That was a really interesting thing. That's that's very interesting to know.   Jump on the words, but if you want to find that chat formality, where we're not going to be able to do it, exactly.  Is everything working like you want? I think so. I'm going to try and see if I can fix the aspect ratio. See, it's a little bit too much to the pictures. I spent too much time on the pictures not to have. I spent too much time on the pictures not to have them read the power.  So that's like the whole thing.   It's from the side. So you're set or? Yeah, I think so. I was thrilled with the aspect ratio, but it's fine.
