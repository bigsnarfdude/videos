The conclusion is that should I do some so so then then the then the conclusion is that the positive fraction of all sets intersect yeah sorry ah going too fast yeah and if you replace three by d plus one this Plus one, this is called fractional Halley theorem, was proved by Kachelsky and Liu. And maybe at the beginning it looked like a toy variant of the original problem, but somehow it turned out it's much more robust. And I want to convince you that it's also kind of important. So not only for geometry, but also in applications, because sometimes when the convex set. The convex sets, sometimes in optimization, for example, come up from some measurements, and in measurements, typically we have some errors. Like on the picture, everything intersects except for one set, which is misplaced. So it's clear, clearly, we cannot have Halley, but at least we have fractional Halle, like having or like describing the situation that most of the sets still intersect. Okay. Second. Okay. And last theorem I want to talk about is so-called PQ theorem. And it says that PQ condition is if among every P set some Q intersect, then we can show that we can pierce the whole family by a constant number of points. Here, the constant is important, meaning it does not depend on the number of the sets in our family. Our family. So, this was also a beautiful result, or this is a beautiful result by Alan Kleitman, and it uses the proof uses this fractional Halley theorem. So, as I mentioned, I want to focus on this fractional Halley. So, here I stated more precisely what it means. So, I say that a family of sets, a fractional Halley property of order D, if for every alpha between zero and one, there is some beta which depends only on D and alpha. Depends only on D and alpha with the following property. Anytime I have a subfamily of my original family of size M, and I know that positive fraction of D plus 1, doubles intersect, the conclusion is that there is a point contained in at least beta times n members of the family. So this is fractional Halley property of order D. And you can notice if it happens that if alpha and beta both equals to one, Alpha and beta both equals to one, that it reduces to Halley because it says all d plus one d plus intersect. This is the assumption, so the conclusion is there is a point contained in all sets. Okay, good. So now I want to show you or like here three examples, three very different one examples which have fractional Halle property. First one is combinatorial one, and it says that set systems And it says that set systems with bounded VC dimensions, they have fractional Halley property. This was proved by Yerkama Toshek. And in fact, the proof is not hard. It's just about expanding the definitions and then you get the result. Second example is geometric one. It uses the geometry of Rd and this is for convex lattice sets. What do I mean by that? Those are just points with integer coordinates containing. With integer coordinates contained in a convex set, in a convex set. And it was showed by Imre Barang and Irkamatus that such families also have a fractional Halley property of order D. What is interesting here that if you want Halley, it's not enough to test the plus one tuples. You need to test two to D tuples. So here the number is really different. Halle number is much bigger than the fractional Halley number. Is much bigger than the fractional heavy one. Which also slightly supports that maybe the fractional highly is slightly better parameter. Okay. Last example I have here is a topological one. It's about good covers. Good covers we had yesterday is a family of open sets such that every non empty intersection is contractible. And good covers also have fractional Halley property of order D plus one. Property of order d plus one, as was shown by Gill, I believe. Okay, and this is what I will try to expand this topological approach, these good colors, okay, to see under which conditions or how much can we relax cover condition in order to still have a fractional helling property. So for that. So, for that, I need to somehow measure homological complexity or like to say what does it mean that a set system is topologically easy or not. So, I want to define what is a k-level homological complexity of a family of sets. So, I have a key, k, which is some positive integer or infinity, and I have my family f. So, what will I do? So, what will I do? I just take any subfamily G. So, I take a subfamily. I intersect all the sets in this subfamily and take first k reduced petty numbers of this. Okay, and I do it for any subfamily, and then I take a supremum from what I get. And this is what I call homological complexity. And I count these Betty numbers over Z2. Yeah, so no orientations needed. Needed so examples here. We are in a plane. So, what does it say in a plane? So, if the first level homological complexity is trivial in a plane, it means that in your family, any intersection is either empty or path-connected. It can have as many holes as you have, but it must be path-connected. This means that the first level of homological complexity is trivial. Trivial. If I want that second-level homological complexity, it is trivial, I don't allow holes. It means that any intersection is either empty or simply connected. So it's more strict to have trivial second-level complexity. It's more strict restriction than just first-level homogeneous complexity. And in this talk, I'm interested. this talk, I'm interested, or we will be interested with sets with which have a homological complexity bounded by some constant. So what does it mean in a plane? So if I say that the first level homological complexity is bounded by some constant C, it basically means that any intersection has at most C plus one part connected components. If also the second or if the second level of logical complexity is at most C, it means not only that I have at most C. means not only that I have at most C plus one but connected components but also those components together have at most C holes. So here is an example for C equal to one. So some families with bounded homological complexity clearly convex sets because all intersections are convex clear and convex set is clearly part connected. Clearly, path-connected or simply connected, or whatever, like connected. Also, good covers because the intersections are contractible, meaning all the homology groups are zero. All radius homology groups are zero. For example, spheres or pseudospheres, another nice example, or algebraic sets of bounded degree. By algebraic set, I mean zero set of a polynomial, bounded degree. set of a polynomial bounded degree i mean that the polynomial defining polynomials have degree bounded by some constant then the homological complexity will depend on this bound so here is what we can say so a few years ago we proved uh together with xavier goaugh pavel martin and uli that uh if you That if you have this mid-level homological complexity bounded by some constant, so f is a family of sets in d dimensions in Rd. And if you bound the Betty numbers, like first d half-Betty numbers, then you can show that you have Helly theorem, that the Helley number is bounded in terms of the bound on this homological complexity and the dimension. Okay, so this is kind of a general setting. So, this is kind of a general setting. And also, what is here? As was shown by Alon Kalai, Matoshek, and Meshuam, fractional Halley also holds in kind of general setting. So, what I want to say, if you have a fractional Halley, then basic in kind of general setting, you can show that you have also PQ theorem. So, if you see this, then I guess you will immediately ask. Immediately ask if this constant homological complexity implies also fractional healing. This is at least what Yir Kamatusek asked us when we proved this. And if I remember correctly, we tried to prove it or we tried to see if we can external prove, but we didn't succeed. Somehow those two things are kind of different in proving in improved strategy. We were not able to show that. We were not able to show that. So, what happened is that Andreas Honsen and Dongyu Li, they showed that in kind of general setting, in abstract convexity spaces, Radon theorem implies fractional healing. So, and if you see this, then you ask, or at least I ask myself, that maybe, maybe this is a. Maybe this is a way how to prove everything, right? To show that this bounded that this bound, if you have bounded level homological complexity, whatever, then you have a bound. Yes, this is true. So this is the way how you get everything. Okay. So, and these red arrows basically were explained on the last iteration of the workshop for you for his ego. Of the workshop for you for his ago here. So we already heard this approach and that approach. Well, not really, but I will not repeat these things. I want to report on some progress. So what happened since then? Okay. Yeah, but before I report on the progress, maybe I have one slide to explain what a radon is. Because you know radon, probably, or most likely. Probably or most likely, but radon is about points. And what I talk about here was about families of like sets. So, how to relate this? So, for example, this radon fractional Halley, this was very vaguely asked by Gil Kalai, and one part of this of solving it was to give a meaning to that question. So, the question was, does Radon imply fractional Halley? And then you need to write it. Then you need to write it mathematically. What does it mean? There are several meanings. One of them makes sense, like really, one of them you are able to prove. This one. So, okay, never mind. So, radio number, for me, the easiest way to explain is via so-called closure operator. So, we have x is a set subset, and closure is some function from subsets of x to subset of x. Subsets of X to subset of X, kind of general, those three conditions are satisfied. A is subset of its closure, Z is subset of its closure, it's monotone, and also if you take a closure twice, you don't get anything new. You have the closure. So important examples for us are convex sets, convex HAL clearly satisfies those conditions. And also for us, very important is the second example if we have a family of subsets. We have a family of subsets. I define a closure of a set simply as an intersection of all sets from my family which contain my given set. So for example, if F here will be this family of all convex sets, you get the standard convex how. And then it's very easy to define a radon number. This is the smallest integer R, such that any set S of cardinality R can be Cardinality R can be split into two disjoint parts such that the corresponding closures have non-empty intersections. So you know it when we instead of closure here we have a convex hull. Now with this makes sense to extend the definition like this. And if no such R exists, we just say it's infinity. So basically if I'm saying that some family has Basically, if I'm saying that some family has a bounded Radon number, I mean it's not infinity and the bound does not depend on the size of the family. Radon theorem, you probably know convex sets have random number at most d plus two. Okay, so I go back to my big picture. So this is where we are. So we have a if we have a constant homological complexity. Constant homological complexity. Using all this, we can show we have a fractional Halle, but of very, very large order. The proof here, the bounds are not really good. They use or we apply Ramsey several times. So the bounds are really like big. Which then also translate here. We have PQ theorem, but this Q must be at least M, which is like a big number. Big number. So, one question I will talk about is if we can get something smaller here, ideally D plus one. Oh, sorry, ideally D. Yeah, but I will talk about it. But before I talk about that, I wanna say a bit more or another thing: what you can worry is here, the bound. So we say that the bound is constant, but you can ask. So, but you can ask: does it have to be constant? What if we allow it to grow a bit more? So, this is a question of Kalai and Meshulam. They have long-year project about defining homological VC dimension. And this is one conjecture there, saying that basically if the sum of the Betty numbers grows polynomially in the size of the family, so I take a G is an issue. I take G is any subfamily of G is subfamily of F. And now, if I look at the again at the Betty numbers and I sum all of them, then I want that it's bounded by some polynomial, the size of G. So that's the assumption, and the conclusion would be that this has a fractional Halley. So then we have a fractional Halley of order D. So this is a conjecture. It's still widely open. We don't know almost anything. Almost anything. And the result here I want to talk about is maybe like very, very weak evidence. If we don't bound it by a polynomial, but just by a constant, then we can show it. We can show that we have a fractional Halley of order D. Okay. And this is what I want to talk about. So here is a precise old statement. Is precise old statement F family of in Rd bounded mid-level homological complexity, then we have a fractional Halley property of order D. So before it was this huge number, now it's just D. So here is a sketch, like really very basic, basic sketch of the proof. So assumptions are in the bottom. Here I have a family with bounded mid-level. A family with bounded mid-level homological complexity. This is an assumption of fractional Halley. And on the left-hand side is what we had before. This is the fractional Halley with large order. So basically, I was saying I have positive fraction of some n-tamples at normal intersection, then there is a point contained in a positive fraction of all the sets. So this is what we had before, basically. So I will not talk about it. I will focus on this side. And this tells you. And this tells you how to get there from those assumptions. So if I have a positive fraction of d plus one taplus intersect, then I show that smaller but still positive fraction of d plus two taples intersect, then d plus three and so on until I reach the bound I already have. And then I use it and I have the conclusion. So this is called a stepping up process. And let me mention. And let me mention here that this left-hand side is really necessary. We need to have a stopping point. If we don't have it, then it doesn't tell us much, right? It improves this bound, so like it improves that, but this part is necessary for the proof. Now, I want to tell you a bit more about this stepping up process. So, here is a brief sketch. So, I have a family in RD of size N. In Rd of size n, moded homological complexity, I fix some k and I want to show if positive fraction of k taplus intersect, then also positive fraction of k plus 1 taples intersect. How will I do that? First, I form a hypergraph where vertices corresponds to sets in my family and edges correspond to intersecting k-tuples of my family. Okay, and then with some results from extremal Some results from extremal combinatorics from Erdesh and Chimonovich tells us if this hypergraph has many edges, like positive fraction of all edges are there, then for some n fixed, I have a positive fraction of all k-partite k-uniform hypergraphs there. Yeah, so I have, so this is the creature, I have positive fraction of all of those things. And key part of our proof is to show that each such creature That each such creature, for each such creature, we can find an intersecting k-plus multuple in our family. Why is this crucial? Well, because Arashimonovich tells us that we have a positive fraction of these creatures, and now each such creatures give us an intersecting K plus one tuple. So, in total, we have a positive fraction of intersecting K plus one tuples. There is some slight double counting we need to do to ensure. Counting, we need to do to ensure that those tuples are distinct. But this is like a simple standard double counting thing. So I think that kind of main insight for us was to represent this complete k-partite, k-uniform hypergraphs as grid, as grids. So, this was somehow crucial. You can do that. Well, basically, That? Well, basically, if so, I have three parts here. So, this is the first part, and if I have a third point here, this is the second part. I have first and last part and second. So, I simply represent it as a point in a grid. Okay. So, these intersecting sets correspond to that point. So, it means that now we can talk about grid complexes. And since some results we use are typically known for simplicial complexes, so instead of proving everything here, we embed in some sense or like map simplicial complexes into our grids in some nice way and then use the results which are known for simplicial complexes for the grid complexes. And the way how we do it, this resembles a Rely on a stair convexity, which is a very nice thing invented by Boris, Gabriel, Nivanos, and Jurka Matusek. And here is just highlight how we embed a triangle. So we have three vertices, we put them on a diagonal, on a main diagonal. And so this is how a triangle will look like for us. Okay, so I will tell you a bit more about this. Little bit more about this. So, this is a specific setting when we are in a plane, K is 3. So, this is the basic example, and the homological complexity is zero. So, all intersections are part connected. And the goal in the process is to find, so what I have, I have one such creature, three uniform, three partite hypergraph, and I want to show, I want to. I want to show, I want to find an intersecting for tuple among those sets. Yeah, so this was what was on the previous slide. This was here. For each such creature, we find an intersecting for k plus one tuple. So I just took the basic creature I can have, k is three on the plane. Okay, so I already mentioned that we associate this k-patite k-uniform hypergraph to a grid. And what we do now. And what we do now, we observe that we can embed a K5 into a grid in this nice way, that we put the points on a diagonal, and then each edge is mapped to a path that we go first up, then back, and then okay, first up, then left maybe, and then like front. Yeah, so this like clear one, then two, and then three. One, then two, and then three. And we can observe that for those paths, it's true that no two cells, meaning no two edges from distinct paths, are contained in a common axis parallel hyperplane. This will be very crucial for us. So if I have like strong edges, it goes like this. Is it goes like this? So we have a K5 in a grid. And now we need to somehow relate it to our family, right, of sets. So those points, they correspond always to an intersecting, yeah, to an intersecting triple. So for example, So for example, if I look here on say one, this blue point, this coordinates 555, so it corresponds to A5 intersection B5, B5 intersection C5. I know this intersection is non-empty, because this is how I created the hypergraph. So there is some point in that intersection. I take that point in the plane, and I take it for each such point. Here, this is just a subset. There was not in. Just a subset, I there was not enough space to put everything here. Okay, so I have points in a plane, and now I know that the homological complexity is trivial. So look at those two points, for example. So this one is in a set A4, B3, C2. This one is in a set A4, B4, C2. So both of them are contained in sets A4 and C2. In sets A4 and C2, but this is an intersection of two sets. By my assumption, this is connected. So I can connect those two points inside the intersection. So I do that. And I do that for all the points I have here. So what I get, this is, I just draw way how to, for the red part and for the blue path. You know, if I do it for all these points I have here, basically I have a subdivision of k5 drawn in a plane, and as we know, we cannot draw k5 in a plane without intersection, so it means there must be two edges that intersect. Okay, so I look at those two edges which intersect and now one is contained here in A4C2, second in A5C2. 4c2 second in A5C3, so it means the intersection point is contained in all those four sets. And here, by my since I knew that the distinct paths are contained, are yeah, so they cannot be contained in a common access parallel hyperplane. This gives me that those four sets are really distinct. Yeah so meaning so what I got was really intersection the point in an intersection of all four in in four of four sets So, any questions to that proof so far? So, here the fact that So, here, the fact that those two cells are not contained in a common axis parallel hyperplane, it really gives us that we get four distinct sets. So, we have a point in an intersection of four sets, and this is exactly what we wanted. So, that's it. But so, okay, so this was in a plane. So, if we want to go to higher dimensions, then instead of K5, we use this skeleton of a simplex and vancumpered fluorescent. And vancompered fluorescent theorem. Here you see that we have not edges anymore, but paths or like chains in terminology of simplicial homology. So we need to use like homological embeddings. I don't want to talk about that. But another thing I really don't want to talk about it, maybe just a little, is that the bound on the homological complexity here. The bound on the homological complexity here it was zero. It was easy that if the intersection is part-connected, we can connect the points. But now, if we allow it to be, for example, one, now we would have two connected components. And it's not clear that we can call, well, it's clear that sometimes we cannot connect the points. So there, that's a way where Ramsey comes in. We need to play this Ramsey machinery to be able to find small sense, but this is possible. Through and instead of going into that, let me just give you one So I don't know how to get to another slide. I wanna give you some very nice combinatorial lemma we we need ah, but how how you look at it? How you do it with it? Ah, so now it's okay. So, what it says: so I have a small grid on the left, the grid three times three, and the claim is that I can find a big grid such that no matter how I color the edges in the big grid with zero and ones, I can find a copy of the small grid in this big grid in such a way. This big grid in such a way that if you look at the images of the edges, so those are those parts here, and you sum up the points, you sum up the numbers, you will always get zero. So here, one plus one is zero, one plus zero plus one is zero. So you get it on all these parts. So I'm claiming that this is always possible. If I have a small grid, I can find a big grid such that no matter how I color. Big grid, such that no matter how I color these things, I will find a copy of the small grid in this big grid, such that, like a scaled copy, such that if I sum these things, I will get zeros. And it holds also more generally. I don't need to color only the edges. I can decide to color the full boxes or in high dimensions if I have a grid. I can decide to color k-dimensional faces. Okay, and here is sketch. And here is a sketch of the proof, how it works, because I think it's very nice. And it's a simple, so this is basic case when I color the four-dimensional boxes here. So now I want to find this subgrid such that if I sum up the things in the boxes, I will get always zero. And here is how I will do it. So I take a copy of that grid, and now I will assign number. I will assign numbers to the vertices in the following way. So if I take this vertex, I look at the rectangle it gives me, like which is spent by that point, that vertex and the left lower point. And I sum up the points in the boxes I have here. So here, one plus one is zero in Z2. Another example here is one because here are five ones. Okay, so I have this. Okay, so I have this. And now I claim that if I find a monochromatic subgrade here, monochromatic copy, this gives me exactly what I want. Why? Inclusion, exclusion. If I want to see what I sum up, for example, here, so the number I have here is sum of all these numbers. Of all these numbers, so I take them, I subtract what is here, subtract what is here, and these small things were subtracted twice. And those numbers are exactly okay. Now I maybe miss it. So these numbers are here. All of them are the same because I have a monochromatic copy, so this will be a zero. So now it's just a question how to find, or I need to find a monochromatic copy, but this is either a very easy exercise in Ram C theory or it follows. Or it follows from Galevit's theorem, which tells you that you can always find a monochromatic homototic copy in a larger thing. Okay, so and this is somehow what we need in the proof because our colors will be basically homology classes we have. So that's for the proof. And let me just summarize very briefly. So So we have a family of sets, bounded homological complexity, mid-level homological complexity. So we have a fractional Halle of order D, and also PQ theorem where Q is at least D plus one. So we were really able to reduce it from this big number. First note, we really need to bound all first d Half Betty numbers. If one of them is unbounded and all others are zero, it doesn't hold. Okay, yeah, so I'll assume. Okay, yeah, so our assumptions, at least in terms of how many betty numbers do we need to bound, is really like necessary. Second comment. In fact, we haven't used RD that much in our arguments. Either they were combinatorial and so on. But where we really need them was the embeddability. Like that K5 embeds in a plane or doesn't embed. embeds in a plane or doesn't embed in a plane and so on. This is the only thing where we need and this homological non-embedability for us or like this homological non-embedability results are known only for Rd where D is at least three. However, and we are on a surface then homological non-badability is the same as almost non-embeability. Is the same as almost non-embeddability, like something you don't need the homology, basically, you need something kind of like knowing. Meaning that with a bit of work, you can show that you still have the Dradon number, that it's still enough to count just the number of connected components, and you get the same. So, basically, what I talk about also holds for families on surfaces. Okay, we have fractional health. Okay, we have fractional helic, we have PQTR on surfaces for manifolds. We don't know, yeah. So, this is the first problem here. Is it enough manifolds to bound the homological, well, to bound only first the half-battery numbers? Of course, if the manifold is nice enough, you can embed it, you know, you can embed it into R22D, but then need to bound. But then need to bound first d numbers, not d half. So this is the first question here. Second question: upper and lower bounds on the number. This is somehow very important because in the process, you saw that it really depends. The number of steps depends on the number of the bound, the rather number of the bound. And since it's enormous, you need to take a lot of steps. You can get a Of steps, you can get a better bounds to improve the implicit constants like the beta or the constant for the pqtr. So, we don't know much, we have just like see not good bounds. But there are notes in RD by Pavel, very nice results that if you know that the number of The number of connected components is bounded by some constant C. Now all other homology groups are zero, and in fact, the random number is bounded by a polynomial. Before it was a normal Ramsey number, now it's just a polynomial. And it's the question if we here also get that it's at most, this would be excellent, but it seems like kind of hard. Yeah, it's it's not. Yeah, it's it's not easy to it's simple simply not easy way to attend it. But but this is first step and it's it's like really very nice result to show this even yeah and of course we have the conjecture of Kalai and Mashulem. We don't know but that would be very nice to solve. Yeah that's it. Thank you. Thank you very much for the very nice tool. The presentation is very well. Any other questions apart from this? Other commercial projects? No. So we define in the proof something that we in the proof we claim that we have for healing. So the component of our graph is kind of nice for hella thing. But for two fashion patterns a little bit of the name for second slides for the Why do we do that? Why is it a particular reason? Why is it the exponent deeper example? Why exponent deeper example? Why size of the diameter power D? Well, this D because is always the business about dimension and number of. Business about dimension and number of points. Like of a simple dimension, simple business for more points. So if you talk about nerves, and I think they wanna resemble like VC dimension when you have this shuttle function. You can talk a bit more about this because this is bit more about it because this is conjecture and then several say basic is not related to RP just in terms of syndical complexity yeah so it's taken in terms of syndical complexes that what you have there like you damaged any other question and in your diagram where you was playing uh where you explain uh the relationship between uh radon and early pressure that is uh does not appear karate because karate doesn't hold i see you can you can show that it's complex without a homological complexity it does not impact Any other questions? If not, I'm going to wait my data.
