Thank you, Luca. Thank you to the organizers. It has been a wonderful event so far. I guess there's not much left of it. But yeah, I'm grateful for the opportunity and also I've enjoyed all the talks a lot. It's been very interesting. So, as I said, although I forgot to put the part two here, but it is indeed just a control. But it is indeed just a continuation of what Silvester was saying previously, where so now I want to run you through just a few consequences and things that we have used this thing so far, but there's much to be explored, and I'll talk about that a little bit at the end. So, okay, just a quick recap. P-week differential is characterized Differential is characterized by this property. So, for modulus, for P, almost every curve, you have this at all the points of the curve that are in the get map to the chart. And the important thing here is this, or one important thing is the dimension of the charts, or this dimension bound, which then when you run the abstract machinery ends up. Ends up giving you that from here you get that the finite Hauptzorg dimension is enough to guarantee the existence of a quiet differential structure. And of course as we saw here, does it? Ah it works here. As we saw here ah the actually this is not that. But in general trigger charts are not the same thing as um as uh B week charts. As a B-week charts. And actually, this is an example because this guy is a differentiability space. And in particular, this is an admissible direction for the differential, for the Jiger differential. It's just not admissible for this P-Wig differential, which is curve-wise, because there are no curves going in, but there are many curve fragments. So this would be an example where the Chigar chart and P-Weak chart are different. And the P we chart are different. As I say, not even in differentiability spaces. But when you have a PI space, they are the same. And this is a kind of an important, let's say, consistency check. We kind of want that in the nice case things coincide, right? And the basic reason for that is that for PI. For PI spaces, you have for, I mean, now I wrote it for this xi.phi, where xi is a dual vector. But I mean, here you can't have any loops function, right? And this is an important piece of infinitesimal information that is essentially telling you that whenever you have a direction that is kind of determined by, let's say, curve fragment, so here you don't have this direction, then the PI Then the PI condition, so then you have, then that direction also exists for curves. And so just a quick idea here. So if you assume that you have a Chigger chart, then this equivalence here, this is actually an equality, but that's harder to prove this equivalence is a little. These equivalences are a little easier. Then Gigo charts are P-independent because this guy will be bounded from below after taking essentially T-moon over xi and therefore sorry this guy will be bounded from below away from zero and therefore this guy will be as well so that this will be p-independence and now the Tiger differentiability is expressed by the pointwise Lipschitz constant By the point-wise Lipschitz constant of this kind of linear combination here, having zero-point-wise Lipschitz constant, right? And now if you plug in a curve, so you can take any sequence of points Y control point of X. Now if you take that sequence along a curve, you end up with this for almost every curve. And then the Pi And then the PI inequality kind of guarantees that there are enough curves. And so the Chigo charts, therefore, are U weak charts. And the converse implication is a little more technical. And you need this kind of machinery that we got. But the basic idea is that, so this is how you, what the characterizing condition for G. Condition for Tiger differentials, and this would be the one for P-weak differentials. But of course, this doesn't make sense because, unfortunately, a point-wise Lipschitz constant is a point-wise-defined object that makes sense everywhere. These minimal weak upper gradients, where I've suppressed the dependence on P here, but in general they do, they are only well defined almost everywhere. So you kind of cannot choose an X here and then also choose an X. An X here and then also choose an X here at the same time a priori. But morally speaking, this is what's happening, and then the PI, if you're willing to accept this kind of favorite at this point, then this condition kind of through this tells you that also this. And that then gives you that. A a P week chart is also a chinder chart. This might have been confusing, I don't know. I don't know. If you have any questions, please feel free. But now let me tell you, okay, so a few constructions that will then have, that you can do now, that will then have a few kind of immediate consequences. So let's fix a P and say that space X that has a P with a differentiable structure. Here it's kind of noteworthy that we also include the end one end of this, P equals one. Of this equals one. Okay, so first thing is that we can define this pointwise norm that gives, that appears here. The way we define it is well using the charts and here this pi of x is a suit. Of x is a suitable probability measure that is concentrated on curves and time parameters, so a subset of the space of curves times the unit interval that land on x. And the way you obtain this is by using these Q plans that Simone was talking about. So So we proved that there exists a Q plan, so where Q is the dual exponent of P, such that if you denote by P this weighted measure, now this is a measure on unit interval times. Times curves where this is a measure on just curves and if you disintegrate so disintegrate this this measure That means that the measure, or let's put it this way, the measure of some set G now in this space is just given by these measures like this then. Then, when you have a chart map, or actually any vector value soblet map, you can find this eta so that the disintegrations well, that the disintegration exists and satisfy the nice properties that we want. In particular, when this is a chart, then this. Then this guy will always be a norm. And from that, we kind of get. So, here, if you now instead put instead of psi, the differential of f at x, you recover the minimal weak couple gradient. So, this is almost everything, of course. And then from this, now we have Rn, or the dual of Rn, equipped with a point. Or the dual of Rn equipped with a norm for almost every point. Using this machinery of Chiger from that famous paper, we can build a measurable cotangent bundle, which is just formally the disjoint union of all these cotangent spaces. And the basic philosophy here is that this p-buk differentiable structure allows you to move from point-wise, so from Pointwise, so from almost every curve information to pointwise, almost every word information, which is in general, I mean, often problematic. But that is the upshot here. And that's what was happening kind of there as well, that you are able to localize the curves at almost every point and obtain these point-wise objects. Okay, so. So, what this does for one thing is that it leads, for example, to a concrete description of this LP cotangent module defined by GV. So, here we have that, so this is an abstract cotangent module that I'm not going to define, but it's abstractly defined and in fact exists in full generality. When the space has a p-wig differentiable structure, for example, when it's finite dimensional. Differentiable structure, for example, when it's finite-dimensional, then you get this equality here where these are simply the integrable sections over this cotangent bundle that we just saw in the previous slides. And this is an isometric isomorphism. And what this means is that this theory, the public differentiable structure, fully recovers Julius calculus and is therefore. Genius calculus and is therefore also fully compatible with these Sobolex spaces. That means that you can kind of, I mean, they completely characterize the sobolex spaces. And another consequence here is that, so you have this infinitesimal inversionity, which the condition says that this space has to be a Hilbert space, if and only if this pointwise norm comes from an inner point. Norm comes from an inner product. And then you also get that this guy is reflexive for the correct range, right? And this is the same strategy that was mentioned in yesterday's talk: that this is kind of a standard procedure. Once you have a cotangent space, A tangent, a cotangent space and a norm in there, you can equip it with an equivalent inner product norm. You get an equivalent norm that is uniformly convex. And then another thing which was known for P strictly bigger than 1, but is actually totally new for P equal to 1, is that this bounded, so lipid function. The bounded, so Lipschitz functions with bounded support is dense in norm space in this case. So this comes from the density in energy, and this was, so this is what was known for P strictly greater one, but is new when P equals one, and it's Ambrosio, Genesis, and Warai, and Sylvester gave the proof which included P equals one. So the density energy plus reflexivity, I'll be thinking through this. And so, what we have used this for has been this, so this is kind of a property of the differentiable structures that they tensorize, meaning that if you have a P weak chart on X, U phi, and a P weak chart V psi on Y, then the product is a Is a P we chart of the correct dimension in the product space. And this is not so trivial and in fact quite technical, but it allowed us to make partial progress in something called the tensorization problem for solar spaces, where that problem asks if you have a function where you can control its x derivative. Its x derivatives, so the minimum weak upper gradients will be in the x direction for almost every y and in the y direction for almost every x. So if these two things hold, and moreover, the minimum weak upper gradients are integrable in the correct exponent, then if you have such a function, does that mean that it's already a Newtonian function? Already a Newtonian function, so a Sobolet function. That's the content of this tensorization problem, and it's been important in some things to do with CD spaces, for example. And in general, it's just an interesting question, a natural question to ask, and surprisingly, it is still open. What we were able to prove using this is that this inclusion, so you have an easy inclusion, a soft space certainly satisfies. Casopolar space certainly satisfies these. So it will be in this space. And it's easy to see that the minimal norm here will be bounded by square root of 2 times the norm here. But we get the isometric conclusion, and that really uses this of charts. But it's still a a partial pro uh progress because it we don't know that there is equality. That there is equality here. We only know it when p equals 2. So, just a word here, the differential should be that you freeze one variable and take the differential with respect to the other and vice versa. This is the only candidate when you test along x and y curves. But the problem is that these curves alone don't yet give you. Curves alone don't yet give you all the curves. And because of this, the modulus, because we're using modulus to characterize our Sobolev spaces, it's difficult to handle these diagonal curves in general. And so what we do is we take, first look at functions that are nice in this sense, that they kind of depend, you can kind of separate variables in a way. And the age is nice enough so that we can in fact. So, that we can, in fact, formally prove this. And then you also need that the norm tensorizes and this requires some more work. And this gives you that the differential is as you expect it for Sobolev functions, but it doesn't tell you anything about these functions or these J1P functions because there's no known way to approximate. And actually, this approximation. And actually, these approximation issues come up a lot, and it would be interesting if there was a way to, like a kind of a systematic way to approximate these. Okay, so then I finish with the slide with some possible questions and directions. So first here is this tensorization problem. So do we have a quality here? Equality here. This is known for people too when, for example, when x and y have this p-weak differentiable structure or more generally when the spaces n1px and 1py are what we call quasi, infinitesimally quasi-inversion. So they don't have to be given by an inner product norm, but they have to be equivalent to an inner product norm. Okay, so that's that. Okay, so that's that. But this would be very interesting to make progress on. Then the other thing is that, so here the p equals infinity case is missing, and it would be interesting to do that. So this duality theory, which kind of allows us to prove the existence of this eta here, that then gives us a way to pass from curve-wise almost every information to point-wise almost every information. This is not, doesn't. Is not does not really exist, I guess, as far as I know. And this is relevant for doing a similar construction for curved fragments instead of curves. And then these charts give you a way, just as a final thing, these charts give you a way of studying the infinitesimal geometry of generic spaces, so without many assumptions. And so And so, one thing that you can ask, and here it's kind of important to have these charts to even be able to pose this question, is that you, so the tangent spaces are the set of directions that are realized by curves in the space, are they bends in the tangent space? So these guys will span the tangent space. I'll take 10, 15. I'll take 10, 15 minutes, 15 seconds, not minutes, sorry. If this span the space, this is a consequence of the chart property, but are they dense? So we think so, but it's work in progress. And also you can ask questions about they are not injective charts, right? But how close are they to being injective? So what I wrote here isn't actually, strictly speaking, true. You need a more technical character. Being true, you need a more technical variant of a property like this to hope to be true. But these kinds of questions are what you can start asking and what are interesting to us. But there are, as I said, many, many possible future directions for this. With that, I finish and thank you for your attention. Any questions or comments? Yes. Yes. So yes, but there the reason is kind of trivial. So if you think that you have the unit interval, standard unit interval, and then times the unit interval with a small flight metric, then yes, but that's because one of the factors is One of the factors is trivial in the sense that the Sobolov space is simply LP, and there, yeah, actually, the Sobolev space on the product space kind of only sees the non-trivial direction. Exactly, yes, exactly. That's it. So, in that case, yes. What is special about the case we could do? What's special about that case is that there we can use Dirichlet form theory. So basically, the fact that Dirichlet forms tensorize and that you get this algebraic tensor product, when you look at the tensor product of two Dirichlet forms, it's kind of at first, I guess, defined on the, or you can define it on the algebraic tensor product, and then you prove that this set is dense in norm in the domain of the product. Domain of the product is left on. And we basically use this as a kind of black box. And we don't know how to prove the density of this algebraic tensor product or of the Sobolev space itself in J1 and E in any other case. That's why this approximation stuff would be interesting beyond the KP button. But we can use kind of no theory. What kind of metric do you put on the tensor product? Do you have the probabilities or? Yeah, so so you equip I mean the so you have the product that you're asking about the metric on the product yes. So you can actually put any kind of anything. So I mean the you can take a norm in R2 and put a metric like this. Like this. And then this has to be reflected because perhaps I didn't mention it really, but you really are asking for isometric equality. So it's not just that you want the spaces to be equal, but you want the norms to be the same almost, everywhere. And so then this choice of metric will be reflected in the choice of norm that you put in your Put in your for this for this J1P space. So this is actually not at all the correct norm most of the time. You have to have another expression here, which will be equivalent. So here you will replace this by some expression that involves a partial dual norm of life and equivalent. Yeah, just a bit more technical topics. That also means that you have a formula for That you have a formula for the minimal p V capital in terms of how they look on the different you use to give the size of them. Do you have any uh characterization? So lip lip is of course not the correct thing because the lip lip condition allows these curve fragments, right? Which our machinery just is blind to curve fragments, which is one reason why this stuff for curve fragments is an interesting project to do. But we so one way to characterize So, one way to characterize the existence of a T-wig differentiable structure is if G is this abstract cotangent module is what is called locally finally generated, which means that if you think of this as, you know, like if you think that M or X is a manifold, you have a basis of vector fields, at least locally, and vector fields that you measure. N vector fields, 10 dimensional space that span all these sections. So if you can decompose X into countably many pieces and on each of those pieces you have that kind of picture, so you have a finite number of vector fields that span the whole thing, then that is equivalent to space admitting a pure structure. But this, of course, is pretty abstract as far as characterizations go. It's not something that is particularly easy. It's not something that is particularly easy necessarily to check. And so this sufficient condition, finite Hausdorff dimension, or actually decomposing into pieces with finite Hausdorff dimension, optimizes you know, this is kind of, I guess, usually handle. Maybe we can wait for questions for the conference, but that's very important. The next coffee isn't to. The next coffee is it to me, it's breakfast. The coffee break will be at the end. There's a coffee break before the lunch. Coffee break and then lunch. Checked out.
