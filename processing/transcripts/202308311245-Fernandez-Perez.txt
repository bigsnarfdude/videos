Thank you for the presentation. Thank you for the committee for the invitation to talk here. I'm very happy to participate of this event. In this opportunity, I talk about the Brianzo. The Brian Song is called a Fioren for Foliations. The motivation, maybe it's better to. Ah, okay. This work is in collaboration with Ebelia, Garcia Barroso from Universidad de la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain, and Nancy Sarabia Molina from Pontificia Universidad Católica, Peru. Peru. The motivation, the motivation, the main motivation for our work is the Brianzón Escoda Fiorem. The Brianzones Coda Fiorem in more simplest form, it can be established as the following statement. We consider C2, a neighborhood at zero, the origin. Neighborhood at zero, the origin, right? F a function, holomorphic function on a neighborhood at the origin, and we consider no unit. The Briançones coda fiore asserts the f square belong to the Jacobian idea of Jacobian idea of f. The Jacobian idea of f is generated by the partial derivatives of the function with respect to the first coordinate and the second coordinate. This is the more simple form for the Branson Escota Fiorem. In general, there exists a general version in algebra, right? In CN, it's better to comment this. Good, it's better to comment this in CNCN better passage CN The statement is F power M belong to the Jacobian aldehyde In this talk, I focus on C2, right? On C2. The foliations, we study defoliation on C2, a neighborhood of the origin. We study germs of foliation in a neighborhood of the origin. The idea is to establish a similar theorem for foliations in the sense the Branção Escoda Fiorem calls. Calls. All right. Well, related to the preançon escoda fioren, we have the following theorem from sito. Caito fioren is the following. Assume that f, a function, holomorphic function, has an isolated singularity at zero. Then f belongs to the Jacobian idea. Belongs to the Jacobian idea of F if or only if the F is a quasi-homogeneous polynomial. This is a very famous theorem in singularity theory. It's similar, it's related to the Briançon-escota theorem. It's a very nice theorem, in fact. A curious fact is that the Vriançon Escoda Fioren was originally proved using analytic results of ESCODA. In particular, ESCODA used the L2 theory. And later, Liebman takes here. Gave an algebraic proof of this theorem. The statement is this, maybe it's not good to see, but the paper is very famous in the algebra area. The curious paragrapher is the following. I read this paragrapher and It's a curious fact for me. I would like to share with you. The proof given by Branson and Escoda of this completely algebraic statement is based on the quite transcendental deep result of Scoda. And the absence of an algebraic proof has been for algebraic proof. Has been for algebra something and a scandal, perhaps even an insult, and certainly a challenge. A challenge is well, this is a curious fact. The paper of the Liebman and Tessier is very famous for the proof, for the algebraic proof for the Brian Son Escoda theorem. Some is called a theorem in this context. Well, we focus on foliations F for me is a foliation as general, the foliation the C2 in a neighborhood of the origin, C2, right? It's a holomorphic volation, right? Right. Well, Brian Son Scott of Fioren has been generalized in different contexts. And there are abundant literature. For example, in foliation theory, Matei proved the following theory. Following theorem. Matei consider F, not the critical foliation, and assume the foliation is generalized core holomorphic foliation. This means it's related to the, there are not exist, sadly, not the singularities in the reduction of singularities of the foliation, right? He considers this hypothesis. He assumed, Mate assumed the F is generated by omega. Omega is given by P and Q, the coefficients of the form. And consider F, the reduced equation for the union of separatrices of the foliation. When you study not the critical foliation, the number of solution of the differential equation associated to the foliation is finite. The number of the solution is the separatrix we can consider a reduced curve. Right. Well, the Matei Theoren asserts F square belongs to the ideal generated by P and Q. This is very interesting theorem because generalized. Because generalized Braançon Escoda theorem, classical Brayançon Escoda theorem, in the sense observes that when you have the foliation is generated by a differential of the function f, consider f a holomorphic function, and consider omega the differential of f. The mate, this relation is not the critical, right? It's not the critical is uh Is a generalized core foliation and the equation for the separatrices is given by f equals zero. Matei Fiori implies f square belongs to the ideal generated by the coefficient of omega. But the coefficient of omega in this case is very simple to calculate, is the partial derivatives of Partial derivatives of the function, right? In particular, this is consigned with the Jacobian idea of the function. Well, this is a generalization on C2. Okay. Well. Well, consequently, Mate's result generalized Brandson's code of Fiora in this situation, on see the situation is C2, zero, the neighborhood at the origin on C2. And our proposal aims is to generalize the Matefi orange to a family ospholiation that encompasses. That encompasses generalized cofoliation. We admit the existence of sadly not the singularities on the process of the reduction of singularities, right? But no, we admit particular singularities of type sadly, not the singularity. Okay. This is the objective. This is the objective for this talk. Well, I need the preliminaries on foliation. This is very standard definition when you work on singular olomorphic foliations. The F is given by a one holomorphic form with the note omega, the generator of the foliation. The generator of the foliation and the coefficient is p and q. The algebraic multiplicity is denoted by nic f is the minimum of the orders of the algebraic multiplicity of the coefficients of omega, right? This is a standard definition for the multiplicity, algebraic multiplicity for the volume. It's not depends on the It's not depends on the local generate of the validation. It's well defined. And naturally, we consider the separatrices of the foliation is given by F in this case. It's a paratric is an irreducible invariant curves. And we denote set F at P. Set F at P, the set of all separatrices of F through P. If this set is finite set, it's a finite set, we say the foliation is not the critical, not the critical, right? And the total union of separatrices is the union of elements of the separatrices, right. Otherwise, we will say that the foliation is the critical, right? And we separate two types of defoliation, decritical and non-decritical. It's important to note the Mate result is for node-critical foliation. In this talk, I consider the critical foliation. In the proof, for the proof or result, we need the concept of the simple singularities or reduced singularities. It appears in the reduction of singularities fioren or Sedenberg Fioren. There is exist two types of singularities. There is exists there is a There is a no-degenerate singularity, which corresponds to the linear part of the vector field associated to foliation. It's necessary to calculate the linear part of the vector field and computate the AQ values lambda one, lambda two. We divide it in two types. The first type is the complex hyperbolic singularity or not the general singularity. The second type of singularity is the sadly noticed singularity. Mate, the rest of Mate only considers not degenerate singularities. Generalized corfoliation. The definition is the following. A singular foliation F is a generalized corfoliation if it has no, sadly, notice in its reduction process of singularities. Right? This is hypothesis, the hypothesis of the Mate field. The Mate theorem. This concept was defined by Camacho, Liznetto, and Pablo Sat, in a famous paper in the famous theory published in differential geometry. Right? And we focus now on sadly not the singularity. After a formal change of coordinates, right? This is a when you consider the second case here. The one N eigenvalues is zero. There is exists a normal four, normal four given by Dulak. For given by Dulac, this is a normal for of Dulac. The foliation is generated by this form, where lambda is a complex number and k is a integer number, positive integer number. Right? It's a very nice. Right, it's a very nice normal form for the nodded null singularities. Lambda and K are invariants, a formal invariance for the normal form. This is important for the study that studies notice singularities. It's important to note two curves. The first curve is x equals zero, is an analytic separatrix with correct. Separatories which correspond to the AQ values different to zero. This is called a strong separator, whereas y equals zero corresponds to possibly formal separatists. Call it weak or central separatists. They correspond to the eigenvalue equals zero. Eigen value equals zero. We have two separators in this case. This is equal x, and this is a picture, real picture, right? x equals zero is a strong separator strong. And this is a convergence paratris, and this is the another curve is a weak separator. In general, it's possible to formal separatrix, weak separators, right. It's necessary to introduce a tangent, sadly not the singularity to define the concept, important concept for this talk. We consider F foliation given by a one four omega similar to the omega equal. Omega equals one form, all right, and consider the reduction process of the foliation and the node D, the sectional divisor, right? And consider F tilde, the strict conforms of F and well, Sadre Noddy singularity is said to be a tangent Sadrenodi. A tangent subrenodi if its weak separator is contained in the exceptional divisor, and that's the weak separator is an irreducible component. The picture is imagine the point P, right the reduction process of the foliation. Of the foliation, for example, here a piece here appears a singularity, sadly nothing, and the which paratris is contained on the exceptional device here and the And the strong separator is transversal to D. In this case, Q is a tangent, is said to be tangent, sadly not really. Well, we work. Well, we work with this family of the foliation, second type foliation. A foliation is in the second class or of the second type. If there are no tangent sadly noticed in its reduction process of singularities, there are not this type of sadly notice. Is permit, for example. For example, the weak separator is traversal to the exceptional divisor, and the strong separator is contained on the exceptional device. Okay, we consider. We consider in this talk a second diffolation, right? This concept was studied by Matei Salim in the Naudi critical case and recently by Gesmer for arbitrary foliation. Arbitrary foliations in the sense in the critical case. Right? Maybe in the reduction process, maybe there appears. Process: Maybe there appears at the critical component, right? Appears the isolate separatrices correspond to not the critical components, and here appears the critical components on the deceptional device. So maybe here appears. Maybe here appears. Sadly, not the singularities, no tangents. Okay. There is examples in this situation. Well, in order to study the critical The critical variations, it's necessary to consider the balance equation of the separatrices. The idea is to consider, because when you have the critical foliation, there exists many infinitely separatrices through the origin or through the point. Many, many, many infinitely. The idea is to consider a finite set. Set a finite set of separators and reduce to a study to the nodic critical case. It's similar. It's very similar to work because the idea is the control of the critical case is controlled by the by the By the number as some separatrices through the origin. We consider only in this case, for this talk, second diffoliation, right? It's a particular case. What is a balance equation of the separatrices? This is a formal metamorphic function of this form f over. F over H we can observe, we can define the divisor of the F is a divisor of zero divisor, an infinity divisor given defined by F and defined by H and satisfies the following. The algebraic multiplicity of F of F is equal to the algebraic multiplicity of this equation. This equation, all right, minus one here. F and h are invariant curves by f for example. For example, this is a very simple example. Consider the radial radial foliation The picture here is the leaves are all lines through the origin, right? In particular, F is a decritical foliation and we you make a blow up at the origin. At the origin. The foliation is the leaf of the foliation is aligned transversal to the sectional device. The reducible process ends in this step, the first step. In particular, the The strict transform of the foliation is given by no singular form. In particular, has no tangent saddle nodules, has no singularities, in fact. In particular, is a constant link, consequently. Consequently, F is of the second type. And the idea is, maybe. Okay, for example, we can take you have infinitely many infinity separatories. You can take only two. For example, x, x. X X product Y X Y this corresponds to this curve and this curve, right? This is a balanced equation for separatives because the algebraic multiplicity of F is one and the algebraic multiplicity of the F is two. Of the f is two two two minus one right in particular this is a balanced equation of the parities for f in this case but there are and there are other balanced equations for example if you take when you When you make the explosion at zero, for example, we take x equals zero, y equals zero, and the diagonal, right? And another diagonal. Right and put f equals a Meromorphic function, form a Meromorphic function. In this case, what is this the algebraic multiplicity at zero? In this case, it's three minus one is again two in particular the The algebra multiplicity is of f is on is one. Again, we have two minus one. All right. Well, there is exist many, many balances equation for the separatories in the critical case. But this is a concept is very interesting because it's possible to It's possible to work with only finite a number of finite paratrices of the foliation. This concept, balance equation of separatrices, was introduced by Gessmere in a nice paper. Maybe I don't remember, but the 2007, I don't remember. Screen, I don't remember what, but 2007, yes, right get mailed to the colour. Well, my theorem for this talk is the following. Consider F second type holomorphic foliation, right? For example, the family of the generalized core foliation. Generalized scorefoliation JCF is here, and the second type volation is a bigger family, second typefoliation. Okay, particularly this family is bigger than the generalized co-foliation, right? Assume, suppose that F is generate, is definite, it's induce. Is definite is induced by omega again. P the coefficient of omega is p and q and consider f are reduced balancer equation of separatist for the f then the conclusion is f square belong to the ideal generated by To the idea generated by P and Q, right? Remember, here F is the set of this zero divisor of the associated to F capital F, right? There are no. There are no information about H. I don't know about the information about H in this URL. We lost the information of H, in fact. I don't know what happened with H in this statement. But in particular, we recovered the Mate result because Result because the second type foliation is you have no decritical foliation, there are not B infinity. There are no B infinity because in no decritical case, B0 considered by the union of separatrices of F. Right, H is a unit in this case, not the critical case, right? In particular, if you have generalized core foliation, in particular, the foliation is the second type. We recover the statement or the conclusion of the Mate results. In this sense, this And this theorem is a generalization for the Mate result. Another important thing is the Fiori is optimal. In the sense, the hypothesis of the foliation V of the second type cannot be removed. For instance, we have the following example. example consider this volation and why this volation is a polynomial form and the reduction of singularities of this volation is very simple and this this example appears on my previous paper with Belia Garcia Barroso and Nancy about the mean law anti urina number of defoliation Of the evaluation is on our type is not published yet, but maybe Miloranti, you're in a number of numbers. Of defoliation, this example appears, right? The derivation singularity is very simple because you have two explosions and appears the critical component. Here appears Here appears saturated singularity, and the singularity is tangent, tangent saturated node. Right. This is a strong this is a strong separator y equals zero is a separatrix and for complete the balance equation sorry for here this equation of separatrix Here, this equation of separatories, we could, for example, take the another x axis, the another axis, right? And this volation is not second type because not satisfies the equation of the multiplicities, the algebraic multiplicities, right? Because appear the appears Tangents are the node singularity, and in particular, this equation power two does not belong to the ideal generated by P, this is P and Q. This is easy to see because, in this case, is the degree is four and in this. and in this case the degree the order of the or the of the p is phi and the q is equal 5 when you consider the the if you assume this element belongs here and there are a contradiction for for degree for degrees okay Okay. In this sense, our result is optimal. It's optimal because the second type of volation cannot be removed. Well, the technique for maybe finally, if the time permit, I can explain the idea to the proof this. The idea to prove this theorem is right. The idea is to use techniques from Getzmer about the reduced valence equation for separatris, and the idea is to mate Fiore adapted to the second evaluation. But maybe it's important to comment application. Comment application about this theorem. The field application is related to the milon anti-urinal number of soluation because maybe I can explain the first application. And the second application is a lower bound to the global theory number of an algebraic curve. Okay, in this part is maybe. Okay, in this part is maybe to write how you can apply the Bréanção Escoda Fioren or in this case well consider F by omega right consider P dx plus dx plus Q the Plus q the the y d y d y and consider a balanced decritical or not the critical, no problem. Consider the balanced equation. If you have no decritical, we consider only f equals zero and the node b zero. B0 this is IF equals zero right this uh in by this is a union of separate some separatrices is if f is not the critical b0 the notes uh the sep coincide by the sep separator Sign by the separate result P. All right. Okay, we can define the miller number. The classical definition of the million number is the intersection number, the intersection number at P, right, the P singularity of P and Q. Okay, minimum number and we can define the T urina number of the foliation F we expect to be zero, right? Is a dimension of the germs of the holomorphic function quotient over by p q and f right this definition appears in the gomezman paper okay. Okay, Gomez won't prove it. In this case, a very interesting result about this number. The GEV number, the Bombes-Mon Siade-Berkowski index of the foliation will respect B0. Is equal to the Tijurina number of the foliation minus the Tiurina number, the usually Tiurina number of the core. This is a very nice result related to GCB index and the TG. Index and the T Jurin number of the foliation which respect the separatists. Right? Well, we use the Briançon Escoda Fioren, Briançon Escoda Fioren for foliation implies the following inequality. The minimum number two times That is zero. Right, which is a or the the bond is this is equivalent. This inequality bound B. Okay, this part is easy to prove because it's immediately from the definition. The definition: the Tiurian number is always smaller than the mid-lone number or equal. And this part is not trivial and is a consequence by the Brian Son Escoda Fiona for valuation in this case. This result is motivated because for hypersurfaces. And for hypersurfaces hypersurfaces isolate single coitato isolate singularity and CN Leo Leo Robert in Do you prove it in maybe 2000? I don't know remember, but maybe it's 2019. Prove the following statement. The Miller number of F of the hypersurfaces over the Turin number of F. And the Turin number of f is bounded by n or we consider here hyper surfaces with isolate singularity, right? Motivated for this result, I prove it using but by That by using Brian Son-Escoda theorem, this inequality is clear. We work on C2, C2P, diabolical photospain. Well, the idea is easy, it's not difficult because. Difficult because you have I can explain for example when you work P Q F this is equal This is equal or isomorphic to HU P Uber. In particular, the T Urina number of the foliation with B zero is equal. To the minimum number of the foliation minus the dimension of the ideal generated by P and Q and F Over a PQ The idea is to prove this is using the Brian Somme score of Fiore and Hero. Fiorent here to prove this number is at least the Tijurina number in particular we have the minimal number is satisfied inequality the inequality proposed here this Proposed here, this right. This is the idea it's necessary to use exact exact sequence, right? To use the F square belong to ideal P and Q is important with the proof. All right. All right. Finally, I would like to present an application, another application. In this case, we consider the global situation, consider foliation on P2, the complex projective plane, and consider F foliation of degree D. Suppose all single. All singularities of defoliation are of the second type. In the sense that if you look locally, the foliation has not tangent, sadly, notice in the reduction process of singularities. Then we have this bond is a bigger bond, it's a lower bond. Here appears the degree of the foliation and appears the The foliation and appears the GHB index with respect to the zero divisor of the balanced equation of the separatrices for F. And here is the sum of the Tigurina number for this curve. And in particular, is the curve is invariant curve globally. invariant curve global invariant curve and assume all singularities is contained in on the curve right and all singularities define a zero divisor of a balanced equation of the paradigm we have a explicitly lower bound for the sum of the the urina number along the singularities on singularities Along the singularities on C. This is the degree of the foliation and the degree of the curve. It's a global curve. This is a function, function maximum integral. There are various examples, for example, any logarithmic, the critical logarithmic foliation satisfy this property, for example. Volations satisfy this property, for example. Consider three lines and logarithms valuations on P2 and satisfy this. Okay, maybe this is okay. This is a, I would like to end here. Thank you. Thank you very much, Artulo. Do you have any questions here? And is is there any hope for higher dimensions or C infinity functions for such a type of theorems? And C infinity function. I don't know if there is exists theorem similar to Biançon squared Fiori. Maybe for analytic function is true, but for C infinity function, I don't know if the theorem holds. And in the case of the variations, it's an It's a natural question. Is we, for example, is possible to define for any dimension, any bigger at most three, for example, bigger dimension. If it's not true to question, is to the problem is the Brianzon Escoded Fiorent holds yet? I don't know, maybe it's important. I don't know, maybe it's an important, maybe it's important result for the theory, a volunteer theory. But I don't know in this case. Any other questions? Remarks? No? Hi, Arturo. Hi, Arturu. So it's just there's a more recent result about the bounds for the quotient mu over tau, right? By Patrice Almiron and Tambien, and also independently by Marcelo Hernandez, and I think a gentleman. And I think a gensled minute, I'm not sure, which says that μ over tau is less than or equal to 4 over 3, right? Do you expect that this will be also true for foliations? Or you know it's not true. Yes, yes. This is an important question because recently I continue to work with Debelli and Nancy about. To work with Debelli and Nancy about the find similar results to the Dinka-Groier inequality for the curves four over three. Because there exists a very close relation between the reduction of singularities of the curve and the foliations in some cases. All right. In some cases, the bound is true. I know examples. I know examples, simple examples, when you can establish Dinka Groyer bond for the citations on C2. But in general, I continue to work now in this problem. This is a very interesting problem. I see. It's interesting. Thank you. Thank you. For questions? Okay, we thank you again, Arturo. And we'll start again at 3 p.m.
