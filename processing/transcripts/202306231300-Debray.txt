Born is the crystal equivalence principle. Thanks. All set. Okay, well, first of all, I guess we've come to the last talk of the conference. This week flew by. So I'd just like to first of all thank the organizers for putting on a wonderful conference. So thank you. Okay, so what I'm going to talk to you about is an application of equivariant portism, well, really Borel equivariant portism, in a sort of in condensed matter physics or mathematically modeling these questions in condensed matter physics. So I'm going to begin the talk by saying, okay, here's a little bit of information about the physics. I'm really not going to get into the physics details because I am not an expert on said details. And then, you know, and then And then, you know, and then it'll be: well, here's the question. What are we trying to model? And then how are we going to do that? So why don't we get started? So the goal is to classify these objects called topological phases of topological phases of matter. And maybe I should say classifying gaps, topological phases. So, what are these? These are, so in condensed matter physics, people study, you know, people do experiments where they say, okay, well, we took this particular metal alloy and we cooled it to like this very specific temperature that's very low. And then we put an electrical field through it. And now it displays this bizarre behavior, you know, like superconductivity is, I think, a word. Superconductivity is, I think, a word. And there's a sort of background question of like, what are all the things that can happen? In the same way that, you know, historically, people said solid, liquid, gas, and then discovered a bunch of other ones. Well, now there's all these new things. Can we come over the paradigm classifying them? This is not a math question. We're going to get a math question out of this. And so, you know, it'd be nice to have a complete understanding of: okay, well, here are all the options that can happen. So if, you know. So, if you know, solve that math problem, tell the physicist: okay, here's what you're going to get. Here's what, you know, here's the behavior you can expect in your experiment. So, these things are modeled by the following data. Why don't I just say the data? Why don't I just say the data they're modeled by something called a lattice Hamiltonian? So what does that mean? So that means that we so we're working on so you triangulate space. Space, which is some manifold. And then using only the combinatorial, so we start off with, okay, physics takes place in like, you know, on manifolds, like, you know, we appear to be in R3, one, but we're going to triangulate, and then we're going to forget, we're going to lose all the smooth structure and only worry about the combinatorial data of the triangulation. So we get two things. So a complex Hilbert space of states curly H. Curly H. And I'll mention that this is since we've been, if you start with a compact manifold, then your triangulation is finite. And so this is typically finite dimensional. Like I didn't define it in a way that says, oh, this must be finite dimensional, but in practice, this is what happens. And if you were to formalize this somehow, I think you would want some sort of axiom there. So you have a Hilbert space, and you have a self-adjoint operator. Unfortunately, it's common for this to be denoted math calh and this just h. So I hope that that's not super unclear, but also I'm not going to be relying on that super heavily in the talk. So this is called the Hamiltonian. So there's also this condition that the Hamiltonian is gas. That the Hamiltonian is gapped. So, what this means, like saying what this means mathematically is a little bit like, it's a little bit strange. So, there's lots and lots of examples out there to study, but coming up with a mathematical formalism for this data runs into some roadblocks. And one of them is what does it exactly mean to be gapped? So, if you have like an infinite dimensional Hilbert space in a Hamiltonian, then you say, okay, well, look at these set of eigenvalues. Is there a smallest eigenvalue? Is there a smallest eigenvalue and is it separated from the next one? Or is there some sort of like, or is there some sort of pathological behavior where you have arbitrarily small positive eigenvalues? Did you have a question? Yeah. It can be. So I was just thinking that you, you know, you say something like, okay, to every edge, I get the complex, I get C to the N. Edge, I get the complexity, I get c to the n, and then I tensor them all together or something. Like a recipe that forgets the manifold and only keeps the triangulation. I think so. I'm being vague about this because it seems very hard to come up with a good mathematical formalism as opposed to examples. Did that help answer? Okay, cool. Did that help answer? Okay, cool. All right, who's got more questions? Okay, so doing this precisely seems hard. People have done some stuff, but in any case, examples tend to have this form. So, okay. So, this suggests an avenue of approach. To the classification problem. Where you say, okay, let's say M is this big old space of Hamiltonians. Oops, oh no. So we make a topological space of all. A topological space of all lattice Hamiltonians or fixed lattice? So great question. I'm going to say no. I'm going to say that what we fix is the dimension and the collection of symmetries that we care about. Symmetries we want to preserve. So, to get back to your question, typically we would like. So, in physics, people want things to be local, which is saying something like, you want to understand what's going on in a small neighborhood of a point. Well, you should only need information in a small neighborhood of that point. It shouldn't depend on stuff happening like 500 miles away, within a small neighborhood. And so, this assignment. And so, this assignment, you know, if you want to get into the weeds of how you might define this, there should be some sort of locality in both the definition of the Hilbert space and the definition of the Hamiltonian. And so once you have that, then you could say, okay, well, let's forget about M. Let's just define, let's just make an assignment which says for any triangulation, like, you know, for a triangulation of like Rn or of a neighbor, of an open neighborhood in Rn, we have an assignment from triangulations to lattice Hamiltonians. And maybe we'd like to consider. And maybe we'd like to consider the space of those assignments. So I'm going to be agnostic about which lattice do I choose. And again, if you, you know, the best way to understand this stuff is to look at examples. And examples seem to be, you know, is this, this seems to be what you can do. You pick, it's a local, in some sense, assignment from the data of a triangulation to the Hilbert space and the operator. So, we'd like to imagine that there's a space of all of these things. And we'd like to imagine that there's this sort of critical locus of Hamiltonians, which are not gapped. Great. So then the classification. Then the classification is very simple. What's the static connective coordinates? So, this is the dream. This is, unfortunately, very, very far from being made real. So, part of this is just like these things are difficult to formulate. Part of this is just like these things are difficult to formalize. Part of it is like this is related to the fact that it's hard to formalize quantum field theory. Like, you know, we're, we're, these things are like these things have quantum field theory stuff in them. That's not a precise way of saying it, but like they're closely related to quantum field theories in the physics sense. And so formalizing this data is, it runs into similar roadblocks that formalizing QFT does. But then there's additional problems that come up in the condensed matter world, where it's just like, okay, well, how do you know that your Hamiltonian is gapped? How do you which Hamiltonians are valid? Which Hamiltonians are valid, which ones aren't? Like, if you've heard of something called fractons, I'd like to throw those out. But I don't know of a good criterion to look at a Hamiltonian and say no before actually going through and like solving it. So this is the dream, and the dream is unreachable. Were you going to ask a question? That's a great question. I'm thinking of this as, you know, I'm thinking of this as sort of if this is an assignment for all triangulations to the Hilbert space and Hamiltonian, then that's sort of like maybe when you're formalizing this, you want to say, okay, well, what happens when I make my triangulation finer? Happens when I make my triangulation finer, I should be doing something specific rather than something random, but um, I mean, yeah, yeah. So, if you're stepping back into physics, like what is the triangulation? The triangulation is you have a bunch of atoms in a metal, and they form some weird crystal structure, and those are the the the those are the points and then the neighbors are. Those are the points, and then the neighbors are the edges, and so on, and so forth. And so, we'd like to be able to say: if we're in this particular phase, like if we're in the phase of water called ice, you know, ice should be something which says, given, you know, a triangle, like given, I guess, a hexagonal lattice in this case, well, we should be able to get out some information in physics because we have a block of ice of this size and this shape. Like I said, I'm being super vague because formalizing this is super hard. And the goal of the talk is to essentially avoid doing so. Great question. We don't know. But the motivation is something like: let's say you have an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and you have a self-adjoint operator on that. So the spectral theorem is telling you things about the eigenvalues. We'd like to say there is a smallest eigenvalue, and then there's a next smallest eigenvalue. So you can imagine a, it's possible to come up with examples where like the set of eigenvalues has like a limit point at zero. And this, this is, as opposed to zero being an isolated. This is as opposed to zero being an isolated point, and that's bad. And so I said this is probably finite dimensional, and that causes a big problem with what I just said, because, of course, you know, there's like finite linear eigenvalues. So I think what like what you want to say is as you make the triangulation finer and finer, you'd like some way of saying that the distance between the first two eigenvalues is preserved, even as there's more eigenvalues. But this seems to be like, again, there's just so many question marks on here. Yeah, I hope that this helped rather than being just more. Yeah, I hope that this helped rather than being just more vagueness. Yeah, yeah. So gapped is because I want to say topological. Great. I think I will say a little more about that in a sec, actually. It could be. I don't know a lot about the uncertainty principle. So my answer is that I'm going to be uncertain. So, I want to check if there's more questions about this stuff because, like, we're really going to move past this perspective on topological phases. Okay. So, this is way too hard. So, not only are we going to approach, so not only is this too hard from a math point of view, but if you are willing to take the kinds of dreams and leaps that physicists do, this is still too hard. So, they have their ways of classifying, but it's So, they have their ways of classifying, but it's different. And so, let's see. What? Great. Yes. So, let's simplify the problem. And we're going to do this in two steps. And so, this is the first simplification. So, like you mentioned, the toy model, topological phases, there's too many, it's too hard. There's too many. It's too hard. Let's throw out some of them. So only look at very simple phases. So there is an operation on topological phases. Topological phases, where, as I mentioned, and I'm always gonna like, I'm always gonna say, or sorry, I'm always gonna say implicitly, we fix the dimension and we fix the symmetries. So when I say fixing the symmetries, I want the Hamiltonian to be preserved by the symmetry. And so, you know, when I'm saying two things are connected by a path, everything. Saying two things are connected by a path, everything in that path has to preserve that symmetry. So, with that data fixed, there's an operation called stacking, which is take two phases and put them, so take two topological phases on the same medium. With no interactions. So, what do I mean by this? Again, if you're thinking of this as like actual physical things, you sort of want both of them to be in the same place, or maybe you've even literally stacked them on top of each other. And then you sort of zoom out and think of that as one, as your, as say a two-dimensional manifold. Or if you'd like, you can think of this as a tensor product. Tensor products. So, if you're familiar with the tensor product of topological field theories, where you say, okay, topological field theories are functors into like vect. So, I can just define the tensor product in anything by taking the tensor product of its image and vect. So this is closely analogous to the tensor product in topological field theories. So, what we're going to do We will restrict only to phases invertible under stacking. So what do I mean by invertible? I mean something specific, which is there is a trivial phase and And I'd like to be able to stack with so that means S fact with T is the trivial phase for some T. So again, this isn't math yet. Like what, like, how do you precisely define the trivial phase? How do you precisely define stacking? But what this means. But what this means is that invertible phases are an abelian group. I did not say stacking is commutative, but it turns out it is. So this classification, this sort of nebulous, like mysterious object, has been replaced with this other nebulous, mysterious object that's an abelian group. So hopefully we're a little happier. And this is good. So I mentioned you've picked a dimension, you've picked a collection of symmetries, and physicists have computed these groups in many examples. So that's good. You know, if we're doing something, if we're mathematically modeling something, we wanna know that we're going off into theory. We want to know that we're going off into theory land, and that in the end, we want to know that our model is correct. So, hopefully, we want some other way of testing it. So, the goal is to come up with a mathematical model for invertible phases of matter or invertible topological phases. That recovers and ideally also generalizes the physicists' computations. So that's the point of this talk and the work by various other people that it's built on. Various other people that it's built on. That is our goal. So I'm going to give you some examples, but before that, I'm going to mention that these are also called like some common names in the physics literature, especially for invertible faces. So invertible faces are also called the colours. Symmetry protected topological phases or short-range entangled or SRE phases. There are various There are various physics justifications for these names, but okay, and this may be an opinion that I think is not uniformly shared in the mathematical physics community, but I think the reason to care about these are because they're invertible, and that's why I call them invertible phases. So we are doing this as a simplification, but there's also these things do come up in examples where people are actually, you know, actually like theoretical physicists are actually studying these things. So this simplification, okay, we're throwing out a lot of stuff, but we're retaining something that's interesting. We're retaining something that's interesting. So let me tell you some examples. So, what do we want? So, the first thing that we can do is let's talk about the dimension. Let's talk about the dimension. Is this visible to everyone on the left or on the right? Okay. So we can do this in zero dimension, one dimension. So the two and four dimensional cases are the most interesting. So I'm going to write some things. And then I'm going to explain what on earth they mean. So, okay. So, T refers to a, so this is an internal symmetry that is anti-military. So, Z2 acts on this, oh, it's erased now, on the Hilbert space in a way that preserves the Hamilton. Space in a way that preserves the Hamiltonian. Let me try that sentence again. So Z2 acts on the Hilbert space in this model in a way that the Hamiltonian is invariant. And everything's complex. So we can say, well, how does it act? And the answer is, I want it to be anti-unitry. But another thing that we could do, and this is where things get interesting, and where equivariance comes in. Oh, let me clarify. Into unitary Z2 action on space. So we have an action which is anti-unitary on the on H, but it is, we make space into a Is we make space into a Z2 manifold or the triangulation into a Z2 triangulation. Let me just say on the triangulation. And to say that this is anti-unitary, well, the triangulation is just some triangles, but I really mean that we want, if the Hamiltonian depends in some way on that combinatorial data, I'd like to lift H into, you know, I'd like the Z2 action to extend to H. And then it acts on H in an anti-direction. And then it acts on nature in an anti-unitary way. So these are the standard, I haven't explained the difference between one and minus one to the F, but I'll get there. And so right now, people usually say T because this is supposed to be related to time reversal and R because, you know, typically this is given by a reflection. So let me explicitly say a reflection. So now here's another question mark. Like, are we looking at Now, here's another question mark. Like, are we looking at v square lattice in Rn? Are we looking at like an arbitrary lattice? What does it mean to do a reflection on an arbitrary lattice that may not be symmetric? I am going to ignore those questions because that's related to the point on the perspective on formalism I don't want to get into. Yes, great. Yeah, I'll say that next. So the other thing I want to do is I want to say that these are phases of fermions. Okay, so if you have a spin manifold, So, if you have a spin manifold and you have a group acting on it, then actually, sorry, let me step back down and look at oriented manifolds. If you have an oriented manifold and you have a group acting on it, you can ask the question, which elements of G preserve the orientation and which elements of G reverse the orientation? And so if you're saying, I want to study equivarian-oriented Bordism for G, you should really, like, you really get to specify for every group. There's a bunch of different ways of doing this by specifying which subgroup of G is the orientation-preserving transfer. Preserving transformations. In a similar way, if you're looking at spin manifolds, you have two different groups. One is the group acting on, like the group acting on the manifold, but on the spinner bundle, you could have a bigger group because the spinner bundle has this operation called spin flip. So this is spin flip, which is the identity on the manifold, but Is the identity on the manifold, but acts non-trivially on the spinner bundle. It's a Z2. So you could say, I just have Z2 here, and then Z2 on spinners. Or you could say, well, I'd like to lift Z2 to Z4. Z2 stays and Z2 acts on spinners. Or Z2 acts on space, Z4 acts on spinners. So this is, so this is saying how does this, how does this simulate? Does this um how does this symmetry lift to act on spinners? And you know, the physicist might have a different perspective where they say, You have, you know, this is some sort of physics theory, I have actual particles which are fermions, and how does the symmetry act on them? So people will call this the spin of these fermions with respect to the symmetry. So now I think I've more or less said what these symbols are supposed to mean. Are there questions before I write down some examples, like what the groups are? Okay. Okay, so um t squared equals one this should be should be z two z two z eight zero zero this is going to be z two zero z two z two z sixteen z two zero z two z two Z two z two z16 z two z two z8 zero zero. So I'm mostly interested in the 2D column because of that Z8, or sorry, the 2D row and the 4D row because of that Z16. So what features have we noticed? The first is that specifying how this action lifts to spinners really makes a difference in the classification. And this is something that we know the physical And this is something that we know the physicists computed these groups. So, even before we try and inject math into this, we know that this classification is going to have to take into account detail. And it matters whether you're saying, I have this action that doesn't move points versus the equivariant version where it does move points. Like the classifications change, right? So, if I said I have the no mixing, Z2 goes to just to lifts to a Z2 action on spinners, the classifications differ. Different. And the final thing to notice is this weird mirror image, where if you change one of these things, well, the classification changes. If you change the other one of these things, the classification changes. But if you change both whether the action is spatial and how it lifts to the spinner bundle, you get back the same classification. So all of this is kind of like, you look at it and you're like, huh, how, like, what math formalism is going to come up with this? Now, some of you might recognize sequences of groups that look like this. Groups that look like this. If you do, great. Feel free to spoil the answer if you want. I will later. So, I mean, you know it's going to be something to do with boardism because this is a conference on boards. All right. So that, okay, so what are we going to do? Yes. Great. More questions. Great. Great. So now I'm going to talk about. So I'm erasing the approach that's probably the best approach, but way too hard. And we're going to do a different approach. So it's going to start with something else that we don't know how to make rigorous, but that's going to be the last one. Everything after that's going to be math. I think that, oh, that's mostly true. Okay. So there's a hypothesis. Because the topological phases have some sort of low energy approximation. Oops. So, in physics, it is common for people to say, okay, well, these things, I don't really care about what's going on in very high degrees. So, I'm just going to pretend those don't exist. Now I have a So, I'm just going to pretend those don't exist. Now, I have a simpler theory. And so, something like this should be possible for topological phases. And again, starting with like this lattice Hamiltonian data, like this assignment data, defining this is unpleasant, and we don't really know how to do it in general. But, you know, from a physics point of view, this ought to exist. And this low energy approximation, This Low Energy approximation is a topological field theory. So remember, we started with data of a dimension and data of some collection of symmetries. So this is the dimension, and this is a Lie group with a map to O or just to O. group with a map to ON or just to O is determined by the collection of symmetries. And there's a procedure for going from the formulas that the physicists write down, like this or this, and saying, okay, great, here's what that group should be. So for example, if you have fermions and nothing else, you're going to get out spin. If you have fermions and this, that corresponds. Fermions and this, that corresponds to pin minus, this corresponds to pin plus, just the symmetry types. Moreover, yes. So there's a procedure, which the details are not interesting enough to mention right now, but it's just it's known. There's these physicists have these formulas like t squared equals one or t squared equals minus one of the f, going from that to an actual tangential structure, the sort of which you can define a Bordeson category. So if you just had fermions and nothing Had fermions and nothing else, you would be doing spin. This one is going to correspond to pin minus, this one to pin plus, just these formulas. So right now we're going to forget about spatial symmetries. So maybe I should write that explicitly. Yeah, I'll write that explicitly. If the symmetries do not act on space, so points are points stay the same. Points stay in the same places. So this reflection is a question mark right now. That's a different thing. Yes. No, that's a really good point. But No, that's a really good point, but these are two different reflections. Yeah, yeah, no, that's a good point, Phil. Ah, more questions? So this is the reason that we can start doing, like, okay, I've been super vague so far. And this is where the mathematics comes in. These are mathematically defined objects. So topological field theory, in the sense that a couple of people have mentioned earlier in this conference. Mentioned earlier in this conference. You start with the category of bordisms. You consider symmetric modal functors to vector spaces. So in addition. What? Well, yeah, this is the second approximation. It's saying, okay, instead of saying topological phases, which we don't know how to classify, let's look at topological field theories, which we do know how to classify. Except classifying topological field theories is still hard. And that's where the toy model part comes in. So invertible phases. So, invertible phases. So, I said that stacking is like the tensor product of TFTs, but it is hypothesized that this low energy approximation, stacking is literally sent to the tensor product of TFTs. So we should be looking at TFTs, which are invertible under tensor product. And this is a nice mathematical object. So a thing which I should probably mention is that concretely, what is this? Is that concretely, what is this? So, TFT assigns, among other things, you've got a state space on any codimension one manifold and a partition function on every codimension zero manifold. So, you were asking about this, actually. So, how do you know whether this matches with that? And the answer is we had a lattice and a Hamiltonian, and you could say, what's the space of ground states of the Hamiltonian? What is the space of eigenvectors for the smallest eigenvalue? And that should be the state space of this. Now, something really interesting. Now, something really interesting happened, which is this does not depend on a lattice, but the Hamiltonian and the information in there does absolutely depend on the lattice. So the fact that when you take this low energy approximation, the dependence on the lattice goes away is part of the mystery of like, well, what are these topological phases? How can we formalize them? How can you know that your formalism guarantees that that's going to be true? So there's a million questions there that I would love to know the answer to. So now. So now our goal is to classify invertible topological field theories. Oh, if I say TFT, I mean TQFT. They're the same thing to me. Sorry for the confusion. So the one other thing which I'm going to say is that Is that these quantum field theories that people consider are typically unitary. And so we should impose some sort of unitarity hypothesis here. And the correct word to say is reflection positive. And again, this is a different reflection than that one. So reflection positive is the, okay, quantum field theories, people do them in like Minkowski signature. Topological field theories, people do them in Euclidean signature. Field theories people do them in the Euclidean signature. Unitarity corresponds to reflection positive. So, this is just a jargon word here to make sure that what I'm saying is true. If you'd like to read more, there's a paper by Dan Fried and Mike Hopkins with reflection positivity in the title. And that is a good place to learn more about this stuff, along with a great deal of many other things. So, we want to classify invertible field theories. So let's say I have a map of commutative monoliths. And let's say that it factors through. That it factors through invertible objects. So, in a monoid, you might not be able to, you can't invert every object or every element, but you can invert some of them. And let's say that F factors through this. So, because we started with a commutative monoid, this is an abelian group. So then, F is equivalent to a map on the On the Grotendi group of A. So, what is this thing? This is saying I take my monoid, I pretend every element has an inverse. And I just say, and you define the monoid operation. And it's essentially the same process as constructing the integers from the natural numbers, where you say, okay, this is like minus f plus f is zero. Plus f is zero. So this is the Groton D group. So the point is that f of x inverse is by definition f of x. So x is an element of a, the monoid. x inverse exists here. We'd like to extend f to this whole thing, to this bigger abelian group. Since this thing has to be a monod homomorphic, Since this thing has to be a monod homomorphism, the only thing that works is to say f of x inverse. But since f lands in invertibles, we can always do that. So the takeaway is that invertible maps are classified by maps of abelian groups. So you can do the same thing with. So, you can do the same thing with these things. So, these are symmetric monodal categories, which are a higher, like a categorified version of commutative monoids. And for an invertible topological field theory, you land in the invertibles in here. That's what invertible topological field theory means. If you're invertible under tensor product, but tensor product is defined points. So, something like abelian groups is going to classify these invertible TFTs. These invertible TFTs. And that's something. So I'm skipping quite a bit here, but the upshot is this is due to Fried Hopkins Telemon is that invertible topological field theories are Classified by maps of spectra. And okay, if you're like, depend what exactly you put here instead of vect, I'm going to be kind of agnostic about. And Reed Hopkins then said, okay, for Then said, okay, for reflection positive, then the spectrum is this Bordism spectrum and something else. So this is the Bordism spectrum. So the H bordism spectrum. TH is saying I want H structures on the tangent bundle rather than the. H structures on the tangent bundle rather than the normal bundle. This thing I'm not going to worry too much about. It's the Anderson, I can't spell dual of the sphere, which is saying we get boredism invariance. So, in other words, we want to classify invertible topological phases. We should be classifying invertible field. We should be classifying invertible field theories on H manifolds, where H is determined by the collection of symmetries. And okay, well, Fried and Hopkins figure out that this is Bordism. So what do we get? It turns out that this is pin minus. This is pin plus. So this is indeed the zeroth pin minus Bordism group. This is the second. So this one, again, is relatively well known. The Z8 comes from the Arf Brown Kerr invariant. The Z8 comes from the Arf Brown Care invariant. And then this is pin plus Bordism. So Kirby and Taylor have a nice paper where they produce all of these groups. They weren't the first to calculate them, but theirs is probably my favorite explanation for it. What's up? Kirby Taylor. So. It's something like pin structures on low-dimensional manifolds. So, all of this is ordinary boredism and is due to Fried Hopkins. So, okay, I'm going to be a little bit, I'm going to be a little bit, let's see, for time reasons, I think I'm not going to say everything, which is fine. But let me talk through. We also want to be able to understand these things. If you're a physicist, like, okay, so if you're a If you're a physicist, like, okay, so if you're a mathematician, like adding equivariance on space, really, you know, things change, things become more of a headache. You know, you all know this in different ways because this is a conference on equivariant borders. But if you're a physicist, these symmetries and these symmetries, really, they're not that different. And we'd like to, like, if you're studying things that come up in examples, you'd like to care about these symmetries. You know, crystals have symmetry groups, and that symmetry group matters. And that symmetry group moves points in space, right? You rotate an ice crystal. And so this classification. This classification, while very good, is missing this half of the story. So, what do you do? So, the first step. So, step one. So, this is a separate paper. So, this paper was the one that I mentioned here was online. The one that I mentioned here was online in 2016 and then published in Geometry and Topology in 2021. Then, the next generalization, there's a different paper. I think it's like Invertible Phases of Matter with Spatial Symmetries from 2019, published 2021. And so they model these phases with spatial symmetries. Using Borel equivariant boards, by which I mean the following. So let's say, so we classify phases with a G representation V on space. So here what I mean by this is that space is the underlying space is Rn. Is the underlying space is Rn, and G acts on that somehow by a representation V. So in this case, V is the reflection representation. But they do not allow this group to mix with minus one to the F. So, in that notation over here, that's saying that we want to consider representations on space, but To consider representations on space, but we're not worrying about how that mixes with fermions. So, how do they classify it? Well, it's the following. So, let's take the spectrum of maps, mth sigma 2iz. Oh, did I say, if I said one here, let me say one here. So let me say what some of these things mean. So V is Rn is a representation. The one-point compactification of Rn is the sphere Sn, and the one-point compactification of V, the G space, is S V. It's called a representation sphere. So it's the sphere SN, one point is fixed. The rest of it is acted on as the representation. Then, actually, sorry, let me not. I wrote this poorly. So here we go. So this is. So, this as a G space, you can take a G homology theory and get a Belian group set. And so, the G homology theory we're doing is we're just going to say this thing invertible field theories in the absence of a G action, and we're just going to take the equivariant homology for that thing. So it's, you know, you can rearrange this and say, I'm looking at equip, like, we're equivariant portism invariance, is what that Anderson tool is doing. And so, if you do that, that. That sure, you know, sure enough, that this is um so you get pin plus here. Like, if you plug in their their uh proposal for r squared is one, you get pin plus. And so, this whole column is accounted for by Free Hopkins in 2019, but that leaves these things, which they did not account for. So it's late. So it's late 2019, and I'm still a grad student. My advisor, Dan Fried, says, You know, I know you're interested in these computational things. You know, do you want to write like a short, quick paper where you just test out what me and Mike Hopkins did on like a couple of examples, see that it agrees with what the physicists do? And I said, sure. And, you know, it's like October. And he said, do you think you could get a first draft for me by Thanksgiving? And I said, that sounds reasonable. And then we realized that these things exist. And that's why that paper took like another year and a half and was much longer. So, I'm not sure what the moral of the story is. So, but right now we have that open question, and then we have this thing here. So, before I say, well, how do we do it? I'm going to say a few more physics words for what we would like to happen. So, let's see. So, Ryan Thorngrant. So, Ryan Thorngren and Dominic Elsa produced something called a crystalline equivalence principle. And what this says is that the classification of phases Phases with a spatial geosymmetry. And, you know, here I'm being vague in a sense. Like, they're physicists, they're two very good physicists, and they gave an argument for it that was physically, but not mathematically rigorous. And, you know, I'm not, this is not any kind of slander or something. They both know exactly what, like, they both know how to make things mathematically rigorous. It's just the point of your, you know, you're trying to learn some physics, you know, you want a dream. And so, and so that dream. You want to dream, and so and so that dreaming is what you do. And so they said that this should be the same as the classification of faces with an internal G-symmetry, i.e. not spatial. And remember, this is the thing that we know how to classify with topological field theories. We know how to classify with topological field theories, and this is the one that's the question mark. So, they have, like I said, they have their various heuristics for doing this, and plenty of other work indicates that this seems to be true. But we would like our mathematical models to recover this as a theorem. So, that's the first question. And the second is, And the second is you have to account for minus one to the f somehow. So if you're looking at this, you know, you sort of follow your nose with the crystal equivalence principle. You say, okay, t squared is one should be the same as r squared is one. t squared is minus one to the f should be the same as r squared is minus one to the f, but clearly not true. Instead, the classification switches. And whatever your theorem is, it had better account. whatever your theorem is it had better account for that so that is um that is a um those are the two questions which the work the main theorem that i'm about to tell you about answers and it's um a thing which i should mention is if you don't care about spin if you just care about oriented then um you don't have to worry about mixing with fermions and fried and hopkins is sort of the final story so In the interest of time, I'm not going to say all the technical details, but I will say some stuff. So, formalizing spatial symmetries, mixing with the fermion number. So, you use Use twisted Borel equivariant boardism. This sounds much more, this is not nearly as bad as it sounds. So instead of saying you have the map H to O or the map on classifying spaces, you say, okay, well, I'd like to have a G equivariate map where G acts, okay, so G does not act on BO, but G acts here. Here and gx here. So this data is saying something like: I have a Z2 action on B spin, which is not the trivial action. So Okay, so using this, I mean, you can one-point compactify and say, hooray, I'm looking at And say, hooray, I'm looking at, I now have a compact space. And so this is now some sort of like equivariant local system of tangential structures on SV. And then applying the Tom functor, you then get a You get a local system of boredom spectrum. So, a local system of things of the form mth. And then some, you know, you do this sort of space of sections construction to get out the twisted. Twisted generalized homology groups. Twisted ethnic variant boardism. And so the hypothesis is that this models invertible phases with spatial symmetries, where we do allow this. Where we do allow this mixing. So that's maybe the first big thing: is that these twisted aquifer Borders and groups could model these things. And so I did a bunch of computations, which was a lot of fun. I highly recommend. And this seems to work. In a real sense, this whole project was an excuse for this part. But also, you know, it's okay, like the computations maybe weren't the most interesting part, but it's quite nice, you know, after struggling with this and saying, okay, I think I have the wrong formula, I think I have the right formula, to have the right formula and then just see the correct things come out. Not just these, but other groups. Dihedral groups was really the one that I was trying, that like I was trying to match with a recent physics paper. And so the last thing I'm going to mention is. To mention is well, before I do that, let me say that now we can finally say: so the last column. So as a specialization of this formalism, you get out pin minus boardism again. And so you really do get these groups. So this is sort of one of the simplest. Groups. So, this is sort of one of the simplest examples. So, the last thing is the fermionic crystalline influence principle, which is this paper from a couple years ago. So, given G and then a representation. G and then a representation. We can define two spatial symmetry types. So I call them row zero and row one half. BH, and H is either spin or spin. BH, and H is either spin or spin C and to ordinary symmetry types, which are maps, let's see. I want to say that they are maps from often some other group. Let's see, what did I call these? I called these F0. Oh, I called this F0. Oh, I called this f0, and I'm sorry, this f one half. This is row zero, and this is row one half from something which might be something different. So this is typically a central extension of g by h. Okay, so given this data, the data you need to write down a how does this mix with fermion parity, then we write down the spatial symmetry types, which are. Down the spatial symmetry types, which are supposed to model these groups of phases with spatial symmetries, and these ordinary symmetry types, which are supposed to model internal G-symmetries, so not acting on space. And so, such that the twisted equivariant portism for F0. So, remember, F0 is one of these things. So, we get out of it by this procedure some sort of twisted x. So by this procedure, some sort of twisted equivalent, you know, twisted Borellic variability borders is naturally isomorphic to mt. So the Bordism spectrum for row one half, and then the Sanderson duality that says Bordism variance, and then twisted equivariant Bordism or F one half. Great. So the theorem is an isomorphism of twisted equivariant borders and groups with ordinary borders and groups, where the twist now changes somehow and is encoded in the tangential structure here. Now, just to step, I'm almost done. To step back, these things are modeling spatial symmetry, like invertible phases or spatial symmetries and purely internal symmetries. And we're saying there is a crystal and equivalence for this classification is equivalent to a crystal. Classification is equivalent to a classification with an internal G symmetry. You know, G appears in here, albeit mixed. But just like happened here, you have to flip. The unmixed, row zero and F0 are switched when, you know, unmixed corresponds to mixed, both pin minus, and mixed corresponds to unmixed, both correspond to pin plus. And so an interpretation of, one interpretation of this theorem is that the phenomenon you see here occurs in a lot more situations. So I'm out of time. So, I'm out of time. I'm also out of notes. So, I think now's a good time to stop. Thank you all for your attention. Very nice. Oh, thank you. We'll start with the question on the console. You guys, you guys unmute yourself. Amazing talk, thanks. I can't quite formulate all the questions that are sort of like still brewing, but so is this something general about like equivariant rel Like twisted, like twistings of coefficients with some sort of if you have a spin bundle under like I think the best way to say that is so to be honest, I chose these things, like I chose them so that this theorem is true. And so there's this is not saying some deep, deep fact about Baracklefarimbordism. But on the other hand, you choose them and you look at them and you're like, okay, these are similar. This is what, this is not a completely stupid choice. This is not a completely stupid choice. This really does, you know, there really is an interpretation in terms of like a central extension by plus minus one. So I think it's but but but the G is it can be something else, right? So G is the refracting on space, and then H is the internal symmetries, like spin or spin C or pin plus. But there is like an it's an extension by plus minus one. It's an extension by plus minus one is not just an extension. So if you have it, so just g and h are related, they're not. So, okay, so let me maybe say a quick example. So let's say that g is u1. I think like just usually it's finite, but u1 has an extension by plus minus one, which is u1. And that that you could think of that as like u1 mixing with fermion parity. And then you'd like to say, okay, spin and u1. I'd like them also to mix non-trivial. Well, how about spin C? And so you could say, And so you could say, well, if I have U1 acting somehow non-trivially, then there's the trivial and the non-trivial ways of mixing, spin cross U1 and spin C. And you could also do trivial and non-trivial up here. And so you get a classification, four classifications, and they match diagonally. I don't know if this helped answer your question. And so a big part, like these kinds of ordinary symmetry types are typically either spin cross-chains. Are typically either spin cross G or they're analogs of spin C, where U1 is replaced with your favorite group. So, you also have this like the TQFT being classified by SKK groups, right? Like, that's after putting some. Putting some, I can't remember what the restriction is, but you go from cobordism to SKK groups. Could you like do the same story for that? So, sort of. So, you know how I said I was like reflection positive and like didn't talk about it? That reflection positivity assumption is what says instead of SKK border, you get ordinary boredom. So, could you tell the whole story with SKK borderism? That is a, I've never thought about that question and I really like it. Like, I bet you could. So, that this is so well, the. This is so well the GSKK, like for like these pin groups and stuff. That's something that I'm doing with like Luke Stehauer. You might know with Luke. Oh, great. Okay. And yeah, actually, Luke and I and some other people are working on follow-up work to this project. There has to be a mix of those two things. Yeah. No, that's so cool. Yeah. I would love to know how these things are related to SKK and variants because, like, I only know that story before you throw in. I only know that story before you throw in equivariance. So I'd love to hear more about that. So this Fried Hopkins-Telemon, are they making some assumption about like fully extended or no? They're just working with invertible directly. Great. So Fried Hopkins-Telemon is this paper, Consistent Orientations of Modulized Spaces, and what they did. Spaces and what they did, so Galatius. So, the fact that the homotopy type of the borders and category is some sort of Madsen-Tillman spectrum, the thing where you get SKK invariance out, that is the theorem of Galatians-Mads and Tillman Weiss. And it was Fried Hopkins, but it's an that's a non-extended story. Fried Hopkins-Telamon said, oh, that means we can classify non-extended invertible field theories. Great. And then they do that. The extended story came later, although it's this paper of Chris Schomer Priest called Invertible Field Theories or Invertible Topological Field Theories, where he computes the homotopy type of the. theories where he computes the homotopy type of the bordism like of extended borders like the the k extended border category wait sorry what's that oh but okay uh bookspet and madsen you said i'll have to check that paper out The categorical difficulties do this to me. So this is, I mean, this is good. I'm going to check out that paper and see what I learned. Thank you. Is some sort of like a suspension of the empty spectrum, right? Which spectrum? Like the homotopy type of an extended empty extended border category is like an expansion of an empty spectrum. Yes, this is a okay. This is a defect in the way Madsen-Tilman spectra are defined. Like you take some sort of virtual Like you take some sort of virtual vector bundle and you take the Tom spectrum of that. And so you end up like Madsen-Toman spectra, not these things, but the ones that give you SKK invariance, they are defined, like they are not connected. They start out in dimension minus n and then worm their way up. And so and so if you do these classifications, you get like sigma n m T H N. And that's like, you have to carry around the sigma n everywhere. And if you just define it as a Tom spectrum of a virtual vector bundle, like of rank zero, then you get the current, like, then you don't have to do suspensions. You just say, this is the thing. This is the. This is the thing. This is the homotopy type. No suspensions, just it's connective. Life's good. That is an opinion, not a fact. And then, and then, so, and your definition is that like, what would be my definition, like the suspended end times? Almost. So, like I mentioned, because I said reflection positivity, so this is this big theorem of Fried and Hopkins from their 2016 paper, which is that you don't have to say SKK, you don't have to say like MTHN, you can just work with ordinary borders. Ordinary boardism. Like, no, no vector fields, no nothing. Just like if this was spin, for example, it'd be spin boardism, the z2, z2, 0, z. Not any of the, like, you don't have to worry about like the Euler characteristic or the semi-characteristic. If you care about non-unitary quantum field theory, then you do get the SKK invariance out. And as far as I know, no one has actually looked in and tried to tie the physics and maths together. But that would be a cool thing. Lucas, at least right. Luke is at least writing some part of her paper on that. I don't know enough about it, but I think. Okay, sounds like I should. I've been meaning to ask him some questions about this stuff, and now I've got more questions to ask him. This is great. So, Eric, just to get back to your question, in the original Fried Hopkins, so the literal answer is in Fried Hopkins' Telemon, it's unextended. But, like, the way that Dan likes to think about these things is: okay, we may be able to prove this theorem in this case, but once we have the right form. But once we have the right formalism, the same thing will go through in the general case. So I'm sure he was thinking about extended TFT back in like 2007. It's just that what he had was like, what they had was not that. And then later, people come along, provide classic, like calculations for the boredom end category, and everything's okay. On that note, one thing which I sort of want to mention is why did we get the Anderson duel at all? I completely avoided talking about that. And that is a hypothesis of Fried and Hopkins and their reflection. Of Friedman Hopkins and their reflection positivity paper. And it's only known that the hypothesis can be met in dimensions like zero, one, and two. The impression I get is that people are working on this in all n, like coming up with a target category, which is not vector S VECT, but which has the correct subcategory of invertibles to give you this thing. And I think they're pretty close, but I don't know. So don't quote me on that. Don't quote me on that. So that, you know, it like, again, it seems, it's the same pattern where we may know it in low dimensions or low category number, but then once the definitions are in place, the theoret, the, you know, the theorems will be true. Sure. I also got, but it's not a question. I think it's a comment because I see the talk of Carmen, the other which invertible TKFT. So this is a remind me. So this reminds me the story of some paper by Tilma of 1996 that he studied the classifying space of the use of the coverage category. And in that paper, yeah, very easy, he studied the category of fraction, yeah, of the covered category. So I realized that the category of fractions, yeah, of any covered category, has a structure of left calculus. And with that, And with that, you study the left calculus of the category of fractions of the coverts category. You arrive to a certain relation that was made in this paper about Boxton in Spain, that he arrived to the chimera relation. So that could be a possibility with this, and then arrived this all the classification by maps of spectra, but maybe that could be a possibility to choose certain. To choose certain Burdenish category and then study the category of fraction that we arrive to Karman's classification of the invertible to Q of T. Yeah, then you can do that. I realized that that procedure works for every boarding category. Yeah, yeah. Why I did that is that I realized that some subcategory has the property of left calculus. And then you can do these ropes. And with that ropes, you arrive to the chimera relations and you generate some equivalence relation. And then when I met Carmen, I said it was the same, it's the same relation. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thanks all for your attention. We can stop the recording. Yeah, I have some items that.
