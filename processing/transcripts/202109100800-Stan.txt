In the so-called fast diffusion case, La Cauchy problem, and the results that I will explain, they are called the global AGNA principle and phylosymptotic behavior. This is a joint work with Matteo Bonforte and with Nikita Simonov, who also gave a talk previous days at the bar. The work. The motivation for this work, let's say, comes from the basic classical fit equation in the whole space. Let us consider the Cauchy problem with data, which is integrable and bounded. And then it is known that the solution to the Cauchy problem behaves like the Gaussian Kerala for large times. And this behavior And this behavior is given by LP convergence in the whole space. Okay. And the Gaussian general, well, it's we all know it. What is important to mention here is the exponential decay. Let's keep in mind this aspect. So now we put the following question. Does this imply what is called convergence relative error? is called convergence relative error. That means not only I want to say that u behaves like the Gaussian, that it means u minus the Gaussian goes to zero, I want also to take the quotient u divided by the Gaussian. And the question is, is this quotient converging to one in the whole space uniformly? Well, this question is not always true. The answer to this question is not always true. And the difficulty is the following one. When exposed Is the following one when x goes to infinity, both u and the Gaussian they converge to zero? So, saying that that difference goes to zero, it's trivial. But if you take the quotient of two functions that converge to zero, the quotient not always converges to one. And having a convergence to one, it means that you want to say that both the u and the Gaussian, they have the same type of behavior at infinity. That means Behavior at infinity. That means you can you say that you also decays exponentially fast in time for large, uh, large, I mean, decays exponentially in large exponentially in space for large times. Can you say this one? Can you answer for this question? And the answer is not always true. And there is the following doctor example that I found out in the following in a paper, in a survey paper of farming paste that I will cite in the next slide. Repascal that I will cite in the next slide. And this is the example. It's very easy to construct. Let's take the heat equation and we take initial data, the Gaussian, translate it at a certain time. Let's say time one, for instance. I put a C. And then because the heat equation has a semi-goo property, then this translated Gaussian at time t plus c, this is the solution to the heat equation. Then you take the caution u divided by the Gaussian at time t. By the Daushan at time t, and you know, the computations you simplify and you are right to this expression. And this is that converging to, I mean, point-wise, it will converge to one. But this, you cannot have a uniform convergence for all x in Rn. And this is a picture of the quotient, and you can see that here, the quotient, it's like Here, the quotient, it's like one, but when you go to the border, that means x is large, you don't have any border convergence. I mean, not uniform, it's not with the same velocity. So, the problem is, can you characterize the class of initial data for which convergence relative error is true for the heat equation? And this, so far, it's an open problem. If you know some answer to this question, we are happy to. This question: We are happy to hear more comments about the heat equation. So, you can say what if you take the quotient, you divide it by G, and you want to write the equation of this quotient. So, again the heat equation, and we try to write the equation of the quotient, then we take a good change of variables, so that the equation for the quotient will be more easier to understand. Easier to understand. Okay, so with the change of variables that I mentioned here, we arrive at the Fokker-Planck equation for V. And then when L, which is the new time, goes to infinity, this V converges to the stationary state with this dysfunction G, which has a Gaussian. So now we take the quotient between V and the Gaussian profile, and then And then this function satisfies this Pd, which is related towards the Ulambeck semi-group. And among the solutions of this equation, you will find the hermit polynomials, which decay, which do not decay. I mean, they have increasing functions. They have a polynomial increasing. So these are not bounded, and we cannot say that this portion, this W, will converge to one. W will converge to one because we already found some particular solutions that do not have this property. So for the heat equation, we cannot characterize the class for which convergence relative error is true. But for non-linear analogues, the answer to this question is no. And I will mention here some cases for which the question has an answer. The question has an answer. First, the fast diffusion equation. So it's the porous medium, but in the fast diffusion case, where n is it is in the good fast diffusion range, that means the rate of that has conservation of mass. So convergence relative error has been proved by Manvaskis. And then what is called Grobarano principle that I will explain in the following slides has been proved by Bonfort and Vasquez under some point-wise conditions. Some point-wise conditions on the data. So, not only integrable and unbounded, you also need to impose some DK conditions on the data. And then recently, a complete characterization of the Global Parliament principle and convergence in the RATING has been proved by Bonfordin Simonov in the case of fast diffusion, but also more general, for the fast diffusion with the Cafari-Polynirian birth rates. The next example I want to mention is a fractional heat equation. Fractional shit equation. So if instead of the classical Laplacian, you put an local operator, in this case, the fractional one, then convergence relative error it is true. And this has been proved by Ponforte Segenbus case. And last example that I mentioned here is the Pila-Prashan equation that is the topic of this talk. And let me say that in each of these cases, In each of these cases, the corresponding of the Glaussian terminal is the fundamental solution of each equation. I will detail it in the case of the Pila-Plausian, but in any of these previous cases, there is a fundamental solution. In the first case, it is explicit and it has polynomial decay. And in the second case, it is not explicit, except for S equal to one-half. But in all other ranges of S there is a characterization of the fundamental solution, and it is known that. And it is known that it has polynomial decay. Why is the polynomial decay important? Well, let me explain it in the case of the Pilar Clausion. So the problem that we studied is this one. Ut is equal to the Pila clausion operator chi to u and the pillar clausion is given by this formula here. The results that I will explain are in this paper, which is available on archive. On archive. So, the Pinochla equation has a fundamental solution, which is the equivalent of the Gaussian kernel for this non-linear problem. And it has an explicit formula, which is this one. What is important is that for large X, the fundamental solution, also known as Barenblatt-type solution, that's why we call it P, has a polynomial decay of our light decay. Of our light decay. Other properties are the mass conservation, and here I have in the picture there is a representation of the variable solution for three different times. So this is up here. This is T1 and then T2 and this is T3. So when you please in time, then I think I wrote it okay. Okay, so when time list resolution is going down, but also the tail is going up because you have the preservation of this. Okay. What happens here with the asymptotic behavior? Well, it is known that the solution of the Cauchy problem for data which is integrable and bounded is given by the barium-la-type solution. That means if you take the p. type solution that means if you take the difference between u and the variant of function in some norm let's say l1 norm but you can write it for any uh l2 norm between one and infinity then the difference is going to zero as time goes to infinity and also for l infinity you can write it and here in the picture you have the bottom block solution which is this one and then the solution to the cauchy problem and you can see when time evolves there are You can see when time evolves, they are fairly close to each other. But these pictures are only they are nice for giving the talk, but the proof is not based on the pictures. So all the proofs are theoretical. What happens with the previous Panta example? So we are interested again in convergence in relative error, and now we say, okay, if you do the same Pantar example as before, in case of the heat equation, what happens? So here, if we take the data. So, here, if you take the data, which is the translated bar and black function, and then this is the corresponding solution. Then, we take the quotient. And since each of these functions has a power like the k, we can simplify and we write to this expression. Then x simplifies, and then this converges to one as time goes to infinity uniformly for x in Rn because x completely disappears. So, this is the importance of the polynomial decay. When you write a quotient, K. When you write the quotient, then you lose the x. So you do have convergence-relative error for this example. What we prove here is that for the Pila-Plashian equation, for data, which decays at least as the fundamental solution, convergence relative error is true. And not only we prove this result, but we prove this is optimal. So the question we address is the following. So the question we address is the following. Do non-negative integrable solutions behave like the fundamental solution? And if yes, in which sense? Do they have the same tail behavior? Okay, so next, this is our space for initial data. We said that we will prove an optimal result. So we will take a suitable initial data and the optimal space for considering this class of data is this. This class of theta is this space x x p, which are functions, integrable functions that decay in some integrable sense, like a power function. In the power, it's related to the decay of the fundamental solution. And in order to understand better the space X, we can observe that it includes the space of, say, A, space A, of functions. Space A functions that decay pointwise when x is large, and this power here is exactly the decay of the fundamental solution that I mentioned before. So the space x is not empty. It contains the space A, but it is different. We can construct examples of functions that belong to the space X and not to the space A. Also the fundamental solution. Um, also, the fundamental solution belongs to the space A because it did satisfy this point to SDK, and of course, you it includes the functions which are compact supported. Our B result is the following. So we take P in what is called good fast diffusion range. That means P is less than two. It's exactly the particular case when the Pilar plus it points to the heat equation. It's equal to the heat equation. So, when the D-Laplacian operator is just the Laplacian, so p is less than two and larger than this value here, which is the range where you have convergence of mass. Then we take data, which is integrable, and then we prove that the following three statements are equivalent. So, the first one is that data is in the space X, and of course, we take non-trivial. Course, we take non-trivialities. The following is what is called global Arnold principle. That means that our solution U can be bounded by two fundamental solutions, let's say the Varembla solution, at some time t minus T1, with a certain mass. So it's not exactly the mass of U, it's another one. And then And then you can be also bounded from above with another bar and blood solution. So I can put you between two fundamental solutions, which are explicit functions. We have explicit expressions. So this will give us exactly a quantitative behavior in terms of x and t of the solution from above and from below. And the third one is uniform in convergence, uniform convergence relative. Uniform convergence relative. So, what I this was the question that I put at the beginning of the talk. That means if you take the quotient between u and the fundamental solution of the P-Laplacian problem with m, which is the same mass as the one of u, that means the l1 norm of the data, which is also the l1 norm of u, because our problem has convergence of mass. Okay, so if you take the quotient, this is Okay, so if you take the quotient, this quotient will converge to one uniformly in Rn. So this is our main result: that all these three statements are equivalent. What happens when the data is not in the space X? So this is part of proving that all the three statements are equivalent. Well, when the data is not in the space X, then we can prove that global AGNA principle is not true. And we construct a counter-example. We take a data which Take a data which is decaying less than the fundamental solution. This decay, okay, it says that u0 is on top of the decay given by the fundamental solution. And then we prove that the corresponding solution of the Billa-Plashian equation with this data will satisfy a similar behavior. So, with this, we observe that if using With this, we observe that if u0 is not in the space x, then the corresponding u is not in the space x either. So, also, with this decay here, this one, you can see that u does not satisfy the global arnot principle because this decay does not allow you to put a fundamental solution from above or from below, because you have here exactly a pointwise characterization of it. Okay, so we. So, with this, we proved that if you're not, if you don't start with the data, in the split x, then you cannot have the problem. Some applications of our results. Well, as I said, uniform convergence relative error, then you can prove convergence rates. And here I want to make a reference of the a paper of Away Blanche in Carrillo and also some a paper of the Pinotol book. Paper of the Pinotolbo, where they prove convergence rates for U converging to the Barrembler solution, but they need to assume a type of Lobaratna principle as hypothesis. And what we do here is we characterize the data for which you can have this assumption. Some other consequences were some quantitative stability results in Gaia-Larin and Soulland inequalities. Of inequalities, and also, if you have a if you know a precise characterization of diffusion problems, then you can go, for instance, reaction diffusion problems and say something more there. Maybe you heard, we all heard about the hard lack estimates, but more for PDEs, people know about local hard lack estimates and what is the relation? Well, local hard estimates. Well, look at our estimates for the Pila Placian equation. They have been proved by Fortina and Vasquez. And what they say is that if you take a solution u to the Pila Placian, then you can estimate, you can take the either of U in a ball, and this is bounded by a constant multiplied by the supremum of U in a ball, and this constant is independent of the ball that you take. But if you replace this ball with the false base, With the first base, then this estimate does not say anything because the infinite of u in the whole space is zero because u again is an integrable function, so infinity is the k is decaying. So if you instead of hobble, you want to put here a whole space, then you will say that zero is larger than the postal will be zero, of course. So this estimate does not say anything. So the equivalent results, when instead of the volume, take the false phase, it is to compare U with the fundamental solution. With the fundamental solution because that one is known and it is explicit. Okay. And now some I want to give some comments on the proofs, but I don't have so much time. So my slides are more complete than what I want to mention today, and they will be available online. So if you want to know some details on the proof, they are contained here. These are some properties of the resolution U, which are very Of the solution u, which are very important, this is uh, and they are justifying why they take exactly this range of parameters. Okay, so some properties where you have existence and uniqueness of each solution for L1 data, conservation of math that I mentioned before. You have infinite speed of propagation. This is very important because they say that even compactly supported data they produce every one positive solution. And this is very useful in this range because for p larger than two, this is. Be larger than two, this estimate is this property, it's not true anymore. So we just have compact support, and then it's more difficult to, in fact, I don't know, a kind of global principle. Okay, and then these are some other technical estimates that I will not detail now because I don't have time and some references. Okay, other comments when p is true, this is just the heat equation. This is just the heat equation when p is larger than 2. This is called slow diffusion case, but here you have what I said before, final speed of propagation have different properties. And these are some other ranges of P that I will skip for now as I want to tell you another results that we proved. Okay, I also want to give you some details about the proof. So, this is how we prove the upper bound. And the idea here is And the idea here is if you start with data in the space x, which is not so nice to work because at the end it's a space where functions decay in an integrable sense, then what is very useful is that immediately in time, the solution u to the Pila-Plashian equation will be in the space A. That means we'll have a point twice decay. So we start with data here, then we go in some time. In this case, it's technical, so T0 half. Okay, this has a point-wise decay. Okay, this has a point-wise decay, and then we prove the upper bound for this data. And then we use a prop the semi-group structure of the Philaplacian to go back and have the upper bound for two. This is some picture where I explain the details of the proof. I will skip it for now, but you will see it in the slides. And these are the steps of the proof. What is it? What is a summary? Because the equation is non-linear, you don't have a characterization like in this of the heat equation that u is given by the convolution between the Gaussian and the initial data. In case of non-linear equation, you don't have this anymore. So in order to prove all the bounds, you need to construct barriers. That means you construct suitable functions, which are inspired more or less by the behavior of the fundamental solution and then. And then using comparison principle, you start with certain sub-solutions and super solutions, which will give you a certain bound for the function. Okay, then this is the lower bound. And here you have some ideas. And then finally, convergence and relative error. And what is important here is that if when you That if when you want to prove convergence relative error, which in the end is a convergence for x in all Rn, you need to divide in two cases: when x is small and when x is large. So when x is small, what you use, in fact, is you can use the convergence at u minus b converges to zero when x is small. But when x is large, you cannot use this convergence anymore. It's not enough because when x is large, both u and the fundamental solution they converge to zero. So if you take the code. Converge to zero. So, if you take the quotient, this is not, I mean, it's not obvious, it converges to one. So, when you take the quotient, you need to bound u from below and from above with suitable functions, which are exactly what the functions that I mentioned in the Lobarana principle, so that when you take the quotient, you can prove this quotient converges to one. Okay, and uh, now I think I do have some. Do have five. Do I have five minutes? Oh, you have one. One, okay. Okay, two. Okay, so then I will skip this because it's technical and I will only mention this result that if for the initial data you assume more, you not only assume data is in the space, initial data is in the space X, you assume that it has a radial derivative, which decays like the radial derivative of the fundamental solution. Then you can prove that all. Solution, then we can prove that also the radial derivatives of U and the fundamental solution converge to one and they satisfy convergence and relative error. So what you see here is that if moreover you have a data which is radial and this derivative satisfies this decay estimate, then the convergence of u to Then the convergence of u to the fundamental solution is also true in the C1 topology. So not only u divided by B converges to one, but also the radial derivatives. This is all for radial functions. This result is only true for radial functions. So here we have more. You can go with this convergence in the Silver topology. And these are some details of the proofs. The proof is very, very elegant and very nice. It's based on results of Lager's French. On results of lagers, Frenches, and Basques, and also of some results of Bonford and Simonov very recent. This is all. Thank you very much. And we have the slides if you want to know more details. Thank you, Diana, for the very nice talk. If there are some questions, there is time for that. Just open the microphone and speak. Yes, I would like to ask a question. So any hope to go beyond radial functions for the decay of the gradients in general, and under which assumptions? And could you go to higher order diabetics as well? Well, first, if you don't take the First, if you don't take the radial functions, then there is another result that I skipped, and this one. Okay, so here, if you take a data which is integrable and the gradient of the data satisfy this estimate here, then you can prove that the gradient of u satisfies another point-wise estimate, which is more technical. It is this one here. And this is sharp, also. You can put the bottom block solution. Also, you can put a battery black solution in the chart, yes, and this is based on the result of Sao. And this gives you some relative convergence. The gradient of the Bahan blood or not? No, we only proved this, let's say, pointwise upper estimate. Okay. That is the convergence relative. Well, only for the radioactive. Well, only for the radio case. Yeah, let me just motivate my question. When you want to use flows to prove inequalities, you have to perform plenty of integration by parts, and the trouble comes from the derivatives and the integration by parts at infinity. So you need some decay, not only for the function, but also for various derivatives. So that's a major issue. Thank you. So, yes, Jan, it's very Yes, it's very tough to prove the lower bound for the gradient because it can vanish. It's really tough in general if it is not radio.
