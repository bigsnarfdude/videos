All right, everyone. The last talk of this session will be by Zoran Sunich from Hofstra University, and he'll be talking about iterated monotromic groups of conservative polynomials. Okay, thank you. Okay, I'll start cursing the technology right now. Can you see my mouse? Can you see my mouse when I move around? Yes. Hey, something works. Okay, so I'll be talking about iterated monogramme groups of conservative polynomials. I chose this topic because it's kind of in the spirit of the entire workshop or conference, whatever we call it. There will be totally disconnected, actually compact groups. There will be group actions, permutations. Group actions, permutations, and so on. Even in the write-up for the conference, they mentioned, oh, groups started with this Galois business of permuting roots. Well, I will be permuting roots of polynomials. Okay. Now, most results are due to two groups of people: one involving Grigor Chuk Nikashevich and myself. And another, this summer I had a lot of fun with some large group of people. Some large group of undergrads participating in some kind of online collaboration in the polymed style, but for undergrads. And I have students from all over the world. And I will mention one result with Alejandra Garrido. Okay, so you've seen, I'm sure, these iterations of polynomials or rational functions in the complex. Or rational functions in the complex plane. So it is well known that, for example, for polynomials, if you take a random point and you start to backward iterate this polynomial, so you find I started with this random red point and then I solved the equation f of z equal to the red point. There should be three solutions because this is a cubic polynomial, so I can draw those three points. They are drawn. They are drawn. You can see them roughly here, here, and here. And then you continue iterating. Now there's nine points. I took backwards iterates of my three blue points. Now I have nine blue points, 27 blue points. So I'm just doing backwards iteration of so roughly already at generation nine, you can sort of see very interesting structure. That's the Julia set. So this backwards. Uh, so these backward iterations of pretty much any point, there's very, very few exceptions, finite number of exceptions, and even the exceptions are occurring very rarely. So anyway, don't worry about those. Like if you have a map like z square, z goes to z square, and you start with zero and you start to trying to backward iterate, you will never get anything but zero. Okay, the only solution. Okay, the only solution of this critical zero is zero, so there's nothing to iterate. But apart from those obvious exceptions, this is what happens. So you're accumulating on the actual Julia set of your polynomial, which is interesting. Now, there's a different way you can do this. If backward iteration from any point approximate my Julia set, then pretty much backward iteration of anything will... Iteration of anything will approximate my set. So instead of starting with two with a point, I will start with these two loops called A and B, blue and red. And I can backward iterate those loops. So the first time I took backward iteration of this blue loop, I got this curve, this curve, and this curve. When I took backward, and again, the loop will have three pre-images, of course, because again, this is a cubic polynomial. Again, this is a cubic polynomial. And this red loop also has three pre-images: this curve, this curve, and this one. And I continue doing this. This is the second iteration. And if you do it enough number of times, this is, I think, fifth iteration. So you can sort of see, yes, the fifth iteration of these loops is already pretending to be the Julia set. And it's even pretending to be. And it's even pretending to be the Julia set in a better sense than my previous approximation because it kind of gives me this information. Look, these colors: the blue loop is here and then here, here, here. I can see where the blue loops are and where the red loops are. What does that tell me? Well, for this particular map, when I go forward, there's just four different behaviors.
