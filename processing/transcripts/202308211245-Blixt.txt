Can I start? Yes, please start. Okay, yeah. So I will talk about very similar things, but from a different perspective. And here I will give some introduction. Give some introduction to teleparallel gravity and also by gravity, actually, a bi-tetrad gravity as well. And this is a work based on a recent article in collaboration with Manel Human, Tome Covisto, and Luca Marsola, who are researchers in Estonia. And the outline, so first I will introduce to you because probably Introduce to you because probably not most of you don't know, but you can reformulate classically general relativity completely in terms of torsion. This is called the teleparallel equivalent to general relativity. And then I will talk about how you do modifications from this starting point. So, first, some overview, and then I will talk about some introduction to biometric gravity and then And then the interplay between them. So you have telepair by gravity. And later I will present the main part of article, which comes from the results of perturbation theory in a modified teleparameter theory called new general relativity and then the biometric extension to that. So you basically have two. You basically have two kinetic terms of this teleparallel theory. And then I will the next part is basically outlook and it's very much related to what Michael was talking about. So I will talk a bit more about partial masslessness and motivations here and then some future directions where from Where from my kind of construction, you get things that are very similar to what Michael was talking about. So why are people interested in this torsion formulation of general relativity? So you might, so the theory itself is classic, give the same field equations, but then you might even have Um, even have at that point some advantages. So, one very hypothetical thing is that maybe if you plug it into a computer in numerical relativity, maybe the formulation itself has more well behaved. And then recently, there has been an article that claims that That claims that in teleparallel gravity, you don't need your keyboard on Hawking term. So, the question is that maybe it's more natural to quantize gravity based on the teleparad framework and also discussing energy and entropy. From the teleparad framework, you can obtain the ADM. Obtain the ADM mass, Comar mass, and so on without introducing a boundary term. And another thing that I will utilize in the construction here is that it has something similar to a young mill structure. And then people have mostly considered modified gravities. So also, these are very general statements, but also true for telepathy. But also true for teleparallel theories, that one very easily runs into ghosts or a strong coupling problem when one tries to do modified gravity, so one should always be careful about this. However, there are some cosmological motivation, for example, modified theories can alleviate the H-naut tension and so on. So these are the motivations basically. And I will use this kind of index notation. So I have Greek letters or global coordinates and a capital Latin ones are the Lorentz indices. And for teleparallel gravity, we need it's important to introduce torsion. And that's defined as the anti-symmetric part. As the anti-symmetric part of a metric affine connection. So, if you look at the Levicivita connection, the one that gives you the Einstein-Hilbert action and curvature, you assume that it's symmetric in this indices. So, torsion is assumed to be zero. And this can be written as the derivative of a tetrad. Also, I can mention that some people use spherical. Some people use fearbinds and some people use tetrads. Since Marco was using the word tetrads, I will also use the word tetrads, but in the slides, there are written fearbind at some points. And then plus this pin connection. And also this relates to like some late comment that there's only one, when we extend this to by gravity, there will only be one spin connection. Spin connection. However, this spin connection is purely gauge, so I can choose to only focus on this part. And a fundamental reason for this is also that in my case, I don't couple this spin connection to matter, but I only couple the Levitic Vita part. But one can also consider differently. Differently. And yeah, so this was also proved that this it's completely safe to gauge fix in the beginning of whatever you do, like basically all the time and in an article referenced here. Then there's also called something, yeah, and then what is teleparallel list? So tele means far and Telelar means far and teleparallels means that basically if you have curvature you do and if you do a parallel transport of your vector on your manifold and you do this in a curved manifold then the angle will change but if you assume that curvature is zero That curvature is zero, then they will remain parallel. So, that is the basic assumption of teleparallels. And note that this is the total curvature and not just the Lewits-Bita one. So, actually, the total curvature also depends on torsion and non-electricity. So, it's not the same as like taking away everything from general relativity. I will show you in more details on the next slide. Show you in more details on the next slide. What I will focus on here is: so, in metric-caffine theory, you have curvature, torsion, and non-metricity. And I will focus on the case where you have non-metricity being zero. And more correctly, one then calls it metric teleparallelism. But usually, it's just called teleparallel because of historical reasons. And something that makes like basically expressions and calculations faster is to introduce this contortion, which depends on torsion. And it's the difference of a metric affine connection minus the V beta one. So how is this equivalent realized? So if I write, so I assume that non-metal That non-metricity is zero, then I get that the total curvature of the Riemann tensor can be, and I just look at my metric affine kind of paper textbook and I follow understand that how is curvature when I expand the connection in different parts in the Lebesgue part, the antisymmetric part, and then I put the non-method. And when I put the non-metricity to zero, then I see that the total curvature is the Levitica one plus some quadratic terms in contortion plus total Levitica covariant derivative of contortion. And then now we assume metric teleparallelism. So we put the left-hand side to zero. And then because in the Einstein-Hilbert action, In the Einstein-Fieldback action, we only have a Ricci scalar, let's contract all indices. Then we get this contracted curvature, we put everything else to the other side, and then we get this identity. So the Vicci scalar of a Lewich Vita connection equals a torsion scalar. So later you will see more explicit. Later, you will see more explicitly, but just some torsion scalar and a total derivative, basically. So, if I plug this equation two into Einstein-Hilbert action, I see that, okay, this part here becomes the relevant term, and this part here, because there's a volume element, I move it to the other side of it, I use my I use my mathematical tools about tensor densities, and I see that this is a boundary term. So what is defined as temporal equivalent to generativity is just to consider this term without the boundary term. So classically, they give the same field equations, however, they differ from each other by a boundary term. From each other by a boundary term. So, this is the reason why I can say that you don't need the York-Gibbon-Hawking term and you can get some interesting different quantum gravity stuff and things like that. And also, we are in a different geometry. So when we start to modify this, we can get something different from other modified fears of gravity. Other modified fields of gravity. So, going into that, the most popular one, which will not be the focus of this talk, is F of T gravity. So, if I take, so this T and the Viscalar, they differ by a bounder term. So, if I take a nonlinear function, then this boundary term, which was a total derivative, will not be a total derivative anymore. So, we will get Anymore, so we will get something different. And explicitly, I promised you to show you that this torsion scalar looks like this. And remember that basically the torsion is like a derivative of the tetrad and then anti-symmetrized. And then there's also a spin connection involved there, also anti-symmetrized. Bold were also anti-symmetrized. And these specific coefficients give you the same physics as general relativity. It gives you the same field equations and everything. So one modification is to relax what are these coefficients, and this is called new general relativity. So remember this structure well because this will be the basis of when I Of when I extend to by gravity, I would basically have two copies of this. So now we talk about bimetric gravity. For some moments, we can forget about teleparallel gravity and just look at the motivations and construction of bimetric gravity in itself. So one motivation is if you look at the standard model of particle physics. Standard model of particle physics. A key thing for the normalization was that all the fields come as doublets. They don't come as singlets. And so that's some motivation that instead of having one metric, we should have at least two. We can even have multiple metrics, and I think Hawad will talk more about that. More about that. From a cosmological point of view, when we do modify gravity, one of the easy things one may have a problem with, if I just do some random modification, maybe it will not satisfy solar system test. So the nice thing is that in bimetic gravity, there is something called the Biometric gravity, there is something called Weinstein screening. So if you do perturbation, you see that, okay, it seems that you get some modification. So it's ruled out by solar system test. But then you notice that there are higher, like non-linear terms that come with the same order as. The same order as the linear terms and it cancels out effects. And one can define this is parameter dependent and one can define some Weinstein radius. And within this radius, the fifth force is screened. So we will cover solar system test, but we can get interesting modified modified Newtonian dynamics. A Newtonian dynamics basically, the Newtonian limit, will become interesting in other scales, maybe like intergalactic scales and so on. So this has some potential to maybe explain some of a dark sector of a universe and so on. And one issue, if we talk about bimetric gravity in general, In general. For example, what Mark was talking about is that if I just introduce some random theory with two metrics or two tetrads, one need to be very careful to not introduce ghosts or strongly coupled fields. And or at least like check that, okay, if you have strongly coupled fields, check that everything is good, a good theory. Theory. So probably Fawad will talk very much in detail about this: how bimetric gravity is constructed to avoid ghosts. So the Hassan-Rossen biometric gravity has been carefully constructed to avoid these kinds of issues. And also this Weinstein screening mechanism, which I talked about, it has the disadvantage. It has the disadvantage that you have to do very standard stuff like solar system tests. You need to introduce non-linearities to do that. So it's more difficult to predict basically because your calculations becomes more cumbersome. So these are what I see as the main issues. And And what does it physically describe? That is a massive spin two field and in addition a massless one, the one of GR. And as I see it, so people talked about renormalization. As I see it is that at least around cosmology. Maximally symmetric backgrounds, like cosmological and Minkowski, you can see like what kind of I mean this is where it's clear that it's massless plus massive. And then you, if you do perturbation, you will kind of get the same of the two kinetic terms because we have just two copies. And then you get something here in the interaction. Something here in the interaction, but this is not giving you a diagonal thing. And when you diagonalize it, you will get something here, which becomes like G minus F and here something like G plus F, or if it was the other way around. And this is like the massive and massless case. So basically, this interaction potential gives Potential gives the spectrum, the kind of field spectrum. And how I write it, so in this tetrad formalist, because later I will talk about the teleparallel version. And also, this, it's very nice how this interaction looks like. They are basically, so I'm working. They are basically, so I work in four dimensions, and these are basically the ways you can construct volume forms in this dimension that basically gives you the interaction terms. And so let's look at the interplay. So, what we proposed in our article is basically that you can so So basically, how you can write the temporary equivalent generativity is the first term. So you have two torsion terms, then you have some supermetric that contracts them. Now I can add the same, but with F, and I can even add a mixed term, but this one one should be very careful with because it has the potential. And this is also derivative interactions. Also, derivative interactions. So, this is also you can associate it a bit with what Marco was talking about. But what I considered really to do perturbation about was these two terms. And note here also that also here is the interaction potential, which I just short note that like this. And in principle, we In principle, we can construct, like within this framework, these supermetrics depend on two tetrads. So it doesn't have to be only E here or only F here. We can mix as we want. But of course, many of these theories will be ruled out. So we need to have some theoretical motivation. Theoretical motivation. And as a subclass, if I put this one to zero and this to be teleparallel equivalent to generativity and this one to be the F copy of that, then I get the teleparlier equivalent to Hassan-Rossen bimetic theory. So within this, we have a standard bimetic theory. I made also some map, you can find it in the article, but But if we start with general relativity, we can do bimetric gravity. We can also do other by gravity theories. But this is the Hassan-Rosen one, which is like motivated to be ghost-free and so on. So that is a nice one. And then we can go to this teleparallel framework and we get new theories which we can test or we can start. We can test, or we can start from teleparallel gravity. This was basically how I showed it. We take new gr and then we add a tensor field and the interaction potential and we reach what we get. So coming to the results. So this is kind of warm up this new GR. So we want to do So we want to do a perturbation around Minkowski for this tetrad. So now we only have one tetrad and the Minkowski tetrad is just a chronic delta. In principle, you can also Lorentz rotate it if we not affect what is the metric. So, but we consider this simplest case, the Kronecker delta, and when we add symmetric. Delta, and then we add symmetric and anti-symmetric perturbations. The reason we do this is because we know that has symmetric field equations and temp parallel theories can have anti-symmetric field equations. So, this H is basically related to the standard massless spin 2 field, and this B is related to something extra you can get in teleparallel gravity. And then we can take our luggage. And then we can take our Lagrangian, we do this perturbation, and we notice that there are derivatives on every tetrad, so we always have to go. The lowest we can go is to include this H and B and up to like they come twice because we have two torsion terms, they have derivatives. They have derivatives. So, the derivative of delta is zero. So, we will have a derivative of h, and we will have derivatives of b kind of quadratically. So, we'll get h term, b term, and mixed term. Now, it turns out that this mixed term introduces a ghost. So, and also there's a coefficient coming from here. What you might expect. What you might expect is that if you take the teleparlier equivalent, these two terms drop out and that's related to these very specific coefficients I showed you before. And this combination to be zero kills the ghost. And this is an interesting theory called the one parameter theory of new general relativity. People have looked at PPN. People have looked at PPN limit, and this B field doesn't give any contributions to solar system tests and so on. So, that was why it was called new general relativity historically. However, it has one problem. And the spectrum here is that this is the massless pin 2 field, and this is a massless Calverman field. But if you look at this article, if you go to higher order, If you go to higher order, you will get more fields. So the symmetries are broken at higher orders. So it means you have a strong coupling. So that means that what I said about solar system tests cannot be fully trusted. We need, as a community, like the telepower community, basically, need to investigate. Basically, need to investigate this much more deeply and understand what physical effect the higher order terms will give. So now let's look at two copies because it's the simplest thing we could come up with within our large class of theories. Of theories. So we just take two copies basically of what I told before. So a lot of things goes as usual. And then you have a perturbation of interaction potential. And then you have to diagonalize it. And that is where the new things come. And so that's basically this. So that's basically this. So, of course, you will get what you got before: the massless spin two field plus the mass sieve spin two field. But then the question is what happens to the Calberman field? So, also, this interaction potential will give you a massless Calberman field and a massive Calberman field. But this massive Calberman field. This massive Calvarmon field comes with the opposite sign compared to the massive spin 2 field. So we get ghostly tachyonic behavior. So the main part of the result of the article was first we introduced this new framework and then we have also completely ruled out one special case of A special case of theories introduced very so now towards what to do next and that is motivated from partially masslessness. So if we look at helicity modes at least around maximum malesymmetric backgrounds, the massless spin two field has just the outer ones. Just the outer ones. The massive one have all the five elicited modes. And the partially massless one removes the zero elicit mode or the scalar perturbation. So if you do this tensor vector scalar perturbations, the scalar mode disappears. And that's a very nice thing. And how to go from five to four? Go from five to four, you need a symmetry. So, this is related to so, at least linearly, to diffomorphism and Weil symmetry. So, it's yeah, it's basically related to conformal symmetry. And yeah, and one thing to note is that the concept of partial masslessness doesn't make sense in the Doesn't make sense in the standard model of particle physics, where we have up to spin one. Because if we have a spin one, it's massive is minus one zero one and massless is minus one zero one. So basically, if you remove a zero, you are already at massless. You don't have any in-between thing. And we know that conformant gravity. That conformant gravity, like wild gravity, is renormalizable and the perturbation predicts partial massless fields. The problem there is that, okay, we got renormalization, but we got also that this partial massless field is tachyonic. In this bimetric construction, there is a potential that we Potential that we, or yeah, we can avoid this kind of issue. We don't get the tachyonic field, but it's not sure that it's re-normalizable. This is something to be investigated. Okay, so this was the Hassan-Rossen biometric gravity. So, how to get part of this symmetry? And this is related to And this is related to what Marco had. If you put this beta one and beta three to zero, basically, and when you associate the three remaining terms with some length scale, you get what Marco got, but in a different formulation. So it's exactly what he has. And now we can also merge these three terms together by considering complex tetrads. So I write E plus IF, I call this A, and then I get this term. So maybe this one is familiar. You can remember something like this from Marco. So it's very similar. And also, this complex tetrad, we will do something similar to Marko and put it in the kinetic term. So it's very nice that hopefully you can recognize it even if the formulations are a bit different and basically come from a bit different perspectives. Perspectives. And then some notes about partial masslessness. There's something called the Hikuchi bound in bimetric gravity. And basically, there's a limit, there's a relation with the cosmological constant and the first Pauli mass, which is like the physical mass the massive spin 2 field would have. And exactly at And exactly at border, you realize the partial massless symmetry. So when you have a symmetry, this is an identity. And if you diverge from this in the wrong way, you get the so-called Higuchi ghost. And then regarding the sitter background, so Um, the decider background gives a potential stable background. So, this can be seen in this article, but the details about that. But in Minkowski, the linearized while and diffomorphic symmetries merge. So, you are not realizing the symmetries you want for the partial masslessness, so you should consider to have the sitter background. Background. So that is probably something that one should think about also in Marcos considerations because he's also having this partial masslessness. And what are the older... Okay, so basically why is pimetric better than the conformant gravity? gravity where you have this SO24 group and that inevitably gives you a ghost but if you construct things from an SO15 basically the structure comes with only one negative signature part and that is exactly what you expect for any Lorentzian you can also write Lorentzian. You can also write it like this: SO13, SO2. Or yeah, it's related to this. It's not an equality. And there has been some attempts. Fawad is one offer trying to make sense of this partially masslessness. And I think this is also very similar to what Mark. similar to what Marco was doing. So he had this EE and then he had the F here and this F is very similar to this R but in this part you had you had complex tetrad and you need and you cannot get there's no easy way to contract things so that you get rid of imaginary parts. You get rid of imaginary parts and you want your action to not be imaginary. So, for that, they needed to take this real part of a Richie tensor. And this last part is this interaction potential, which Marco also had. And then, also, they needed to add some vector fields. And what was the result with that? So, what you expected from this was that you get a massless spin 2 field, 2 degrees of freedom, plus a partially massless one, plus a massless vector field coming from the F. And this, they I think this was basically how they constructed the action in a way that you would get that. In a way that you will get that in linear perturbation. But when they looked at higher order orders of perturbation, the symmetries at linear order were not maintained. So then there should be some strongly coupled field. And they believe that the zero mode is most likely strongly coupled, and this is a Strongly coupled, and this is a problem. And they also mention things about complexification of the spin connection. So they have a complex spin connection. And yeah, one thing I can say is that this spin connection appears very naturally in the teleparad framework, as you see. It came from torsion. So, and yeah. And yeah, I will move on a bit because I want to stress about the advantage of the 10-party framework. So I talked about this Young Min like thing. So if you look at quantum electrodynamics, this is the action. You have this F mu nu, F mu nu. This is the mu of a vector field anti-symmetrized. If I look at the temporal equivalent to general activity, I can write it like this. I can write it like this. I have a contortion, and then I can also write it with this supermetric. This was three terms, but I just put it like a supermetric. It looks even more similar because this torsion looks very much like f mu nu. So you have an anti-symmetric indices. So you can think of it like kind of the spin two. kind of the spin two version of this spin one construction. So there's some reminiscence there. So this is something we would like to investigate in the future and that's instead of putting this real part of riches scalar we put this contortion. So this is the structure So, this is the structure of the terra parallel equivalent to general activity. And then we had this interaction potential that is well known to give this symmetry for partial masslessness. And yeah, and then probably we would need to add some vector fields like before. So, this is something for future work. And if you have ideas and opinions or thoughts about it, I would be very happy. Thoughts about it, I would be very happy to discuss this. And here, like every second thing is conjugate and everything is somehow symmetric. Here it looks a bit odd that here you have a conjugate, but here you have this that kind of breaks this, and it's also easier. And it's also easier in this telepathy, it's very natural to add anti-symmetric fields or vector fields, and also the inclusion of a spin connection. So, let me conclude the main messages. And that is that one motivation for bimetric gravity is that it's promising for having a version of like a very normalizable theory of gravity. Normalizable theory of gravity. And we don't need to go to non-local gravity or something. We still have locality. And it's reminiscent of a teleparallel gravity. It's reminiscent of a standard model particle physics. And it also removes the divergences that you have to remove by doing the standard ADM stuff, introducing the Jorki von Hawking term. von Hawking term and the result is that we constructed teleparallel by gravity theories and we could rule out some and we are proposing a path in the framework of teleparallel by gravity where we might get a renormalizable theory and also yeah it's it's very interesting to look at Marcus stuff as well. To look at Marcus's stuff as well. And partial masslessness removes the problematic scalar mode in biogravity. And also, I didn't mention this, but this is very nice for cosmology because when you remove the scalar mode, I told you that there was a problem with that you need to add this non-linear, like higher order terms, the non-linear terms, and they are associated. And they are associated with helicity zero mode or scalar mode. So you don't need the Weissen mechanism, and also you don't have a discontinuity. So you get close to GR still. And I got a bit like some direction also is that you can look also with non-metricity. That would be very interesting. It's very simple. Interesting, it's very simple for me to construct to generalize this basically because Marco was saying that he got some non-electricity also in his construction, if I remember correctly. So one can easily look at that as well. But maybe one should start with this because this is more minimal. So we have tele We have tele, and I would also like to say that we have motivation for teleparallel gravity, we have motivation for bimetric gravity, we have motivation to consider partial masslessness. So any of this, we can look at, so this looks at all of it together, but also individually they would be nice to investigate further in. So anyone interested in that, feel free to discuss with me. To discuss with me, and um, yeah, so telepathic main uh, my message I leave with is teleparl by gravity is promising for renormalization and also cosmology. And here are my references. Thank you for listening. Thank you very much. Any questions? I was confused by your comment that you needed doublets for renormalizability in the standard model. What did you mean by that? Yeah, this is something I Fawad just told me. Because it's not true. Because not all fields have doublets in it, but you know, he. Fields have doublets in it, but you know, you so I'm not sure what it doublets or more you can do with single, you can do a doublet or more. You can do this with the Higgs is a doublet and it has a right-handed or the right-handed fermions are not doublets, they're singlets. The left ones are doublets. There's a mixture in there, yeah, yeah. Okay, so I see it. It was just Okay, I see. It was just a troll away comment. Okay, there is another question. So I just want to make a comment. I was quoted for this doublet stuff. The idea was not just doublets. The argument basically is that you need gauge invariance. In order to have gauge invariance besides U1, you need multiplets on which the gauge transformations act. So it's the existence of gauge invariance. Okay, so it's gauge invariance needed being needed. Gauge invariance needed being needed for your normalization, but for gauge invariance, you need multiplets if you want to have anything beyond U1. That's the argument. Thank you. So one more question, one question for you, Daniel. When you look at the perturbations of the Fieldbind, you write a symmetric and an anti-symmetric part there. Yes. And your perturbation is just linear in both of them. Is just linear in both of them. This was in the very beginning. Yes, yes. But enough because you have this kind of D E D E. So in top, yeah. But you also have the mass term, like the interaction term between the field binds alone. Ah, yes, yes. Yeah. So you may need to go one higher order. Need to go one higher order, one order higher in the metric perturbation. Ah, yes, yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I was a bit sloppy here because I took I copied this from the new DR case where I don't need it and then I didn't show the details of adding two tetras basically. Okay, yeah, that's fine. Okay, yeah, that's fine. Thank you. There is another question. Hi, Evelyn. So I just have a very basic question. I don't know too much about this. So what do you mean with the statement that spin connection is more natural here? What do you mean with natural or why or how or why not? I don't know because it's just it appears here by the definition of torsion. So it just comes because it's not related to the Livic Vita connection, but if you define version, you just get it like that. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Is there any other question? If not, thank you very much. And we move to the next, which is an in-person talk by Martin Bozovald about emergent modified gravity.
