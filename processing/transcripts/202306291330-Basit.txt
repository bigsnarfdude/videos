I'm going to introduce Bush Rapasit. She will speak about geometric extreme problems in space of constant curvature. So, thank you, Usha. It's all yours. Thank you so much. Hi. First, I would like to thank the organizers. Organizers for giving me the opportunity to have this talk. And today's presentation or the work that I'm going to present is a joint work with Yol Langyi, who is my advisor, PhD advisor. So today I'll be talking about geometric extremum problems in space of constant curvature. So when I'm saying geometric extremum problems, what I mean is this isoparametric inequalities. So Equalities. So a quick overview of what they actually are. So imagine we have a certain family of polytopes and I fix one geometric quantity and we find extremal of another quantity. So many results have been achieved until now on these kind of questions. A very famous one in E2 or planar Euclidean space is when you have a family Space is when you have a family of convex end gons, and we fix the area, and we want to find the minimum polygon with minimum parameter. So we know that it's regular ones, right? So there are many such results, but today I will only discuss the results which are Why didn't you do something? Why follows me? Why you are capital? Yeah, probably with her connection with the best. Hello, Bushra. Do you hear? No.  Hello. Hi, we are with you. Do you hear us? We don't hear you. Can you hear me now? Yes. Okay. Cool. Perfect. I'm sorry, it was my technical problem. It was my technical problem. So I'm going back to the presentation now. So let's start from here. So we know for fixed volume. So we are in the family of polytope in D-dimensional Euclidean space, and polytopes have D plus two vertices. So if we fix volume, we know that minimum, what is the result for minimum surface area? For minimum surface area. If we fix diameter, it was invested would be the maximum volume for this family of polytopes. And if we fix circumradius, maximum volume is known. The polytope with maximum volume is known. And so in this family of polytopes, the question of maximum product volume has also been investigated. Has also been investigated. So, when I'm saying product volume, I mean the product of volume of a convex body and volume of the polar of the convex body. And by the way, for this one, not only for D plus 2, the maximum volume, a partial reserve for D plus 3 polytope is also known. And if we fix circumradius, the Circumradius, the maximum polytope force, maximum surface area is also known. This one is only in three dimensions. So, when I'm saying d plus two vertices, I'm talking about five points only. The points for this result for four points, six point, twelve point is also known, but all the others are still open and also in the higher dimension. So, not only this. Not only this, we also know what is the optimal solution for all of these. And it happened to be this, that if we have these, imagine we have two regular simplexes lying in orthogonal spaces. The spaces are orthogonal to each other. And so simplexes have almost half dimension. We take their convex hole and these simple. Take their convex hole, and these simplices also share the center. So, this was the optimal solution for all of the problems in the previous slide. And in three dimension, this is how it looks like. So, if we are in three dimension, let one space be a 2D, the other be one, and the simplest would be a triangle and this line segment. And they share this center point, and then we take their convex hull. Their convex hull. However, very few results we have obtained until now for hyperbolic and spherical space. So for spherical space, we know that if we have simplices inscribed in a unit ball, the regular ones have the maximum volume. It was proved by Roszewski in 1987. And for hyperbolic simplicities inscribed in a given ball, regulars have the maximum volume. And there was another result that if we fix in radius, the minimum total edge length is also for the regular ones. So this result was proved by Perrenhoff, and both of them used the similar geometric technique that I will be discussing. Geometric technique that I will be discussing, which was standard symmetrization in spherical and hyperbolic spaces. So these are some notations. So these are just the usual one. M could be any space of constant curvature. So this is the shortest geodesic connecting two points in our M. And if M is a spherical space, then these two points need to be less than pi. They don't have to be antipodal points. They don't have to be antipodal points, and so this is the length of the geodesic or length of the two points. IR is in radius and in radius is actually the largest ball contained inside the polytope. P is the polytope here. And circumradius is the smallest ball containing the polytope. K-skeleton of a convex polytope is the union of all the k-dimensional faces. All the k-dimensional faces of P, and this is k-dimensional volume of this k-skeleton, which is also called k-total content of p. Now moving to a main geometric tool that we have been using. So, sinusymetrizizion, this one for Euclidean is that if we have any k. Any k which is a convex body in d-dimensional Euclidean space, then basically what we do is that we take a hyperplane in e to the power d and we symmetrize our convex body with respect to this hyperplane. So what we do is that we take lengths which are perpendicular to our hyperplane. For example, these lines, we pass these lines. So we symmetrize such that this line Symmetrized such that this line, when it is symmetrized to H, H should bisect this line. And we will have all such parallel lines. Then the symmetrized one would be Steiner symmetrical of the convex body K. When we are talking about convex polyps with some n vertices, again, what we do is that we take a hyperplane which bisects any of the two. bisects any of the two two edges, any of the one edge. And so we take the hyperplane such that all the other points should have an orthogonal projection on the hyperplane. So it should not lie, I don't know, it should not be such that we cannot have an orthogonal projection on the hyperplane. So the Steiner symmetrical would be actually Would be actually this line segment and the convex hole of this line segment and these orthogonal projections. So we can say that in Euclidean space, Steiner's symmetrical also preserves convexity of the polytope. However, if we have if we talk about K total content. Total content of a convex polytope, we see that the Steiner symmetrical, the k-total content of Steiner symmetrical is less than the k-total content of the original polytope. But Steiner symmetrical does preserve the d-dimensional volume of the polytope in Euclidean space. Now, if I have If I have this is basically, I want to discuss the sinusoimetrol in hyperbolic space. So, again, hypercycles are just parallel lines. I'm saying it with the quotation marks, parallel lines in the hyperbolic space. So we have hypercycles on imagine that we have a line and we have all the hypercycles parallel to that line L. That line L. And these, if these all the hypercycles are contained in a plane, then we call them G lines of the hyperbolic space with X's L. And this is how we define hyperbolic standard symmetrical. This is actually the same thing. Again, we are going to have, if I move towards the diagram, again, we are going to have this. Imagine that we have any hyperbolic model. So in this case, we have projection. Model. So in this case, we have projected this model. So imagine that I have a K and a line passing through K. And then, of course, all the G lines would be here parallel to this L parallel or okay. So somewhere here, depending on the projective disk model, they could be curves arced like that. And what we do is again, we symmetrize these length with this H such that. With this H such that this length bisect, H bisect this length. In this diagram, the lengths do not appear to be the same because this is hyperbolic. I mean, when we move towards the boundary, we are moving towards the ideal point. So the thing appears smaller. And when it comes to convex holitopes, again, it's the same concept. We have a hyperbolic. Hyperbolic, we have a hyperplane passing through one of the edges and it bisects the edge. And then we take for all the other vertices, we take their orthogonal projection on this hyperplane. And then what we do is that we take the convex hull of this line segment and this the project, these projections, orthogonal projections of the other vertices. And what we observe here that the Steiner symbol The Steiner symmetrical was contained in the convex hole of these points. So hyperbolic Steiner symmetrization does not preserve convexity, but it does preserve the dimensional volume, hyperbolic volume of the polytope. And however, when we take the convex hole, this convex hole. Hall, this convex hull, the volume is greater than the Steiner symmetric. And we can get the equality if our original convex polytope was symmetric to H originally. I mean, like, yeah. Now moving towards the spherical Steiner symmetrization, it's again the same concept, just that when we have these, these, how do you say, K, it lies in the It lies in the open semis hemisphere, open semicircle. For example, like it should not be on the great circle. None of the points should be on the great circle. And then again, the concept of Steiner symmetrical is the same, that if it lies in this open semicircle, then we symmetrize it with respect to a hyperplane H. And again, when we have convex. again when we have convex polytopes we have we again take these one of the edge and have a hyperplane and then have these orthogonal projections and then we take the convex wall however in this case as well what we observed was that it so what we have is that the steiner symmetrical is inside the convex hull of these points and the volume is also not preserved in this case Also, not preserved in this case. So, neither convexity nor volume is preserved. So, these were basically the key lemmas that we were using in our future results. And these are not our results. I don't remember exactly. I think, but they were discussed in some papers that we used when we were studying for our results. For our results. Okay, so now moving towards the theorem, imagine, okay, we have a ball in any one of these, and we have a convex polytope with D plus two vertices. Then the convex, the polytope having maximum volume. So when I'm saying that I So, when I'm saying that P is inside B, I mean that I'm fixing circumradius and then I'm maximizing the volume. What we found is that the convex polytope with maximum volume was basically convex hull of regular simplices. And these simplices were also inscribed in the wall. And the dimension for these simplex was k or was k or and d minus so d minus k so they were lying in orthogonal subspaces of m and they were sharing this center of the ball and yeah and and for eucalyption we know that this k is d by 2 however the result for eucalyptian was already known in this paper by langi and akush horvat but we presented another But we presented another proof in our, we found another proof using Steiner's symmetrical geometric tool. And when we have fixed in radius, so in radius is when we have simplices containing the ball. And so the ball with maximum radius is what we have. So when we fix the inner radius, So, we when we fixed the in radius, the one with minimum volume were the one with regular simplices circumscribed about the wall, and it was already known for erased in Euclidean space, d-dimensional Euclidean space, but we again gave this name another proof for this using Steiner's symmetrical and the other theorem. And again, we have this. So, this one was for simplicity, this next theorem. For simplicity, this next theorem is for d plus two vertices. So, again, we have a fixed in radius and we want to minimize the volume. And we found out that our optimal result was again the famous optimal polytope, where we have these regular simplices with dimensions d minus k and k, and they are mutually contained in these mutually orthogonal. Mutually orthogonal subspaces of M and they are sharing the same center. I mean, they have this central point it intersects. And apart from that, we also found out that another we found another option for Euclidean case that when D is equal to 4, we found that we can have K one of the simplex. One of the simplex has dimension one and the other can have three. So there were some calculations involved, but we also found this optimal. And furthermore, we wanted to find this value K, but it was difficult because to find the product. So we already know that for Euclidean, it's almost half, but for hyperbolic. Half, but for hyperbolic, finding the volume was difficult, so that's why we couldn't find the value of this k. However, in spherical space, when we fixed the in radius and we wanted to have the optimal for volume, we could only have a result for three-dimensional. And what we found is that the regular We found is that the regular tetrahedron for the simplices only, not for d plus two vertices, so regular tetrahedron will have the minimum volume. Okay, so for the result when we have this circumradius over in radius in Euclidean space is a In Euclidean space is a well-known result, and it was discussed in this paper. And we know that the minimal, we attain the minimal of this ratio when we have the regular, the simplex is regular. And for our result in hyperbolic and spherical d-dimension, we found out that for if we have a simplex in hyperbolic, we also found out that we take just a variant of. Take just a variant of this ratio. So, for example, the 10 of circumradius over 10 of in radius was greater than d, but it could be equal to d if simplex is regular. And similar result was achieved in spherical space. Of course, without we lose the hyperbolic here. And we get the regular if it's we get the equality if it's equal, if it's regular, if simplex is regular. If it's regular, if simplex is regular. Next result was about total edge length. And what we got here is that we in the family of D plus two vertices and P is a polytope and P contains the ball, we found that the polytope with minimum total edge length in hyperbolic dimension is Dimension is either one of the following. So either it's the famous polytope, the optimal result that we are having. So we have two regular symphysis. Again, their dimension make up the dimension of the space and they lie in the orthogonal spaces, orthogonal subspaces of this hyperbolic D-dimensional hyperbolic space, and they share the Space and they share the center, and P was actually a convex hole of these two simplices. Or we found that we have two line segments, and they're meeting at a point Q and Q1. And we have another D plus two-dimensional simplex. So all D dimension make the original D dimension. And the center of D plus D minus two dimension. D minus 2 dimensional simplex q2. So this line segment contains the center, this center C of the ball, which was contained in P. And so the one with minimum total edge length was the one if we take convex hole of S1, these two line segments and the D minus two-dimensional simplex here. Or the third one is if it's a regular simplex circumscribed about the ball B. About the ball. So, total edge length, however, this we couldn't say the same for spherical D-dimensional space because we had that if we have this total edge length, then regular was not the one with the minimum total edge length. So, there we found. Total edge length. So we found another result in both the cases when R is either sufficiently close to R is radius of the ball in spherical dimension, spherical space. So if R is sufficiently close to pi by 2 or if R is in between 0 and PI by 2, in both cases, there was always another simplex which was less than the regular one. Which was less than the regular one. So the result for spherical was not so much the case that we expected. And now for synthesis in Euclidean with a fixed volume, this is actually not only Euclidean, this is, I think, also hyperbolic. So this among the synthesis in these phases with fixed These phases with fixed volume, we found that the regular one have the minimal total K content. So, to remind you what K content was, so this is basically K dimensional volume of all the K faces, K dimensional K faces of the polytope. So, the regular one has the minimal total K content. And if we fix the in radius, then If we fix the in radius, then again the regular one had the total minimal k content for d plus two vertices and when we fixed volume or when we fixed in radius the polytope having minimum total k content was either one one of the following so either it was regular simple again whose dimension who are whose dimension who are lying in these orthogonal complements orthogonally complement complements and these regular simplices have this center C lying in their intersection and when we take the convex hole we get our P and the or it was either again the regular simplicis S1 and S2 and then another one Q and the Q and in this case, the S1 and S2 were not the line segments, but they could be any S1 dimension, any S simplex in some dimension, K1, and similar for K2. But again, the same situation that we have this basically what we are doing is that we are taking the convex whole of all three and the third one. The third one was that if P is a regular simplex, then we get the minimum total K content. Okay, so the one problem that we discussed, the one that we couldn't basically, if I go back. Sorry. Sorry. So, this result we only have for three-dimensional spherical space. So, any more dimension is still open. So, this is the first problem. So, for any dimension greater than or equal to four, the result for spherical space is still open for simplicity even. And then, again, for maximum surface area for convex polytope, having. This area for convex polytope having n-dimension contained in three-dimensional Euclidean space. It had been solved for four, six, twelve dimension, four, six, and twelve vertices. And also for five vertices, these are the paper which was solved. However, for any more vertices, this is still open. And for any other dimension, Other dimensions, it is, for example, for the dimension, the general result, it's still open. And these are the references for what I used in this presentation. Thank you so much. Very, very good. Any more questions? Sorry, questions for Bushra? No? Okay. Are there questions for Busha online for people online? Seems that there are no more questions. Okay, so let's thank Bushra once again, please. Okay, that's it for this. Okay, that's it for this morning session.
