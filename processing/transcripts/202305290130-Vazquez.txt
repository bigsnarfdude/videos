Complexity, multi-space structure, so it's uh quite broad variety of things, and I'm really happy that so many of you that contributed these so many different things is able to be here with us and contribute to the success of this event. Judging from the dinner of yesterday, I think we are sucking well, and I would like I would like to thank, first of all, the IMAC for hosting us here and the peers for both the logical support and the financial support. And also would like to thank the co-organizers, the Asmitere Motovelli, Matthew Francesco, that it trade, unfortunately, put on the year for personal reasons. Besides thanking again all of you. Thanking again all of you contributing to this event. I would like to say that some words about mathematics in Spain, right? I mean, as you may know, Spain in the last year made an effort for position in mathematics, at least in the fields in which we are actually in this conference, I would say. Last minute conference, I would say non-relinear PDEs, electric carbonic kinetic, and so on and so forth. And some glance at the machine learning and the later topics, which is no topic nowadays, let's see how it evolves in these days. Okay, so I won't be long, I will just say that in Spain there are this, say, These say three big goals in DVEs, four, if you want to count also the Becca, which are Granada, Barcelona, Madrid, and then there is the Beca and many people from the Institution Panier, head of the international guests. And one of the famous speakers, Charlios from Barcelona, cannot make it because yes, he received. Yes, he received the Stampake Prize and rightly these days he's getting it in Sicily, so he couldn't make it. And also, I would like to thank Henrik for opening now the conference. You are for sure a piece of the Spanish mathematical history, both past and present. And again, thank you very much to everybody for being here. Very much to everybody for being here. Let's start this event and let's cross fingers that everything goes as well as expected. And again, if you have something to ask, I think you can ask the organizers, you can ask the director and the visiting director, you're him or Joseph, and the staff that already explained who they are. And I would like. I would like just to thank personally Joachim and Kozef for all the work that they helped us to do because it was not trivial, but it seems that since you are all here and holding the badge, we did our bad. So let's begin the event and it's an honor for me to present Juan Luis Vasquez, the first speaker of the day. And I think And I think he needs no introduction. Everybody knows him very well. For me, he was a mentor since the postdoc until nowadays. So please, follow us. There is the talk to be said. Yeah, so let's give us a couple of minutes to put aside and then we'll be. Thank you very much again. So well, good morning to everybody. I know. Everybody, I know many of you. I say hello to the rest of you. It's a great honor for me to be invited to give the opening lecture because I am more or less in this situation, fluid situation, where you are part of yourself is already another one. In other words, but you are still in the mathematical world, and it is nice, it's pretty lovely. Now, let me just, I have been reading about my future, and there is this poet and writer in Andalusia who died, Tonio Rana, and he said as an epitome, tell people that I am dead because I was alive. Dead because I was alive. So the idea is to be alive. And let me try to write it here for the people who want to know what is being alive. It is from a film by Kawawata that he explained what was being all the Being all them being very active, and he was enjoying life when he realized that. So, once this is an introduction, I am very happy to be given the opportunity of giving this lecture because I have a certain relation with the topic that you chose to put as a title, which includes the word diffusion. Includes the word diffusion, which is what I like. And then it includes also the town Granada. And now in Granada, I had an adventure in 1996. It was a glory day for myself in combination with Granada because we read the thesis of this guy that you have in Oxford now, Josie Antonia. And I was the president of the jury, and I didn't know I was doing so well. And if you look at that 20-something years, 30? Oh my god, lots. We were doing very well because he's doing quite good and he's going to continue the work with wonderful things. So, after that, let's start with the presentation. My talk will. My talk will have five different chapters. Some of them will be very short, and as an introduction, you will know most of it, but I will try to make a claim that we are still alive. So, the part that was we were alive a time ago was that diffusion, as I say, in this transparency that I haven't used in a lot. That I haven't used in a lot is something that doesn't need any explanation from physical grounds. And since we are trying to be mathematicians for the sciences, which is very important in applied math, we have to be useful for the real science that is being really done at this moment. So diffusion has a literature in fluids, chemicals, bacteria, animal populations, Newtonian fluids, and diffusion. Fluids and diffusion in the stock market, and maybe there's lots of evidence in first in physics and then, for instance, now in biology, which is a big field. And the idea is very simple. There is a continuous medium and it can be discrete. I said continuous because it was taken from a book in physics of 100 years ago by Eisen. So the idea is that it's So the idea is that it spreads. How do you explain spreading in mathematical terms? You use random walk and random motion, or you use PDEs. We are doing PDEs, and the main thing in PDEs is the heat equation, and this is the mother equation for people in diffusion. So you say U D equals Laplacian U and the symbol Laplacian is very important. Symbol application is very important. And another symbol that comes with it is your friend. And your friend is the frameless function, the most beautiful function for the beauty flow. Okay, so now that you know what you do, you start to do it, but the field equation is not enough. You need all kinds of relatives, which are what you call family of models. And the models come. And the models come to you as linear and non-linear, and they come to you as local and non-local. This is as far as we have been going. And there is a branch of models. If you begin to go to this imaginary world of mathematicians, when you are up there in the diffusive curve, you begin to see there are different paths, and you can go along the linear path, the functional path, the corresponding path, the obstacle. Path, the obstacle path, and all of them are beautiful and they lead to different rooms. Sometimes you can communicate with the people next door. This is what we are trying to do here. So what is next is that the heat equation is very good to take a look at that because maybe it tells you something. The heat equation has what you call a representative function, which is the Gaussian. And this is the same Gaussian as. Gaussian of the people in probability. And this is the same as the people in statistical mechanics. All of this, all of us, we share this beautiful function, which is C infinity has everything. In fact, it's one of the cases of very strange behavior when you walk very far away because it is a square exponential decay, which is very strange. In life, there's no such There's no such decay. Square exponential is very strange. In fact, if you go to the practical sciences, an Italian mathematician, Lilfredo Pareto, made experiments and discovered the potential law. So he found evidence that the Gaussian was not correct for many of the social sciences. And this is what we call now non-local operators. Okay. But in fact, Okay, but in fact, you have this beautiful function, and this function allows you to do a beautiful theory because you solve any solution by representation. If you have representation, then you have a lot of work already done because you know a tool that is very strong. Now, representation means that the function can be replaced by another function as long as you do the typical operation, which is convolution with the curve. Convolution with the kernel. So the kernel is the mother of everything. Instead of kernel, people in physics will tell you the green function, which is a bit different, but ideal. And then once you go there, you say question of existence. The formula gives you existence. But if you don't have the formula or the formula is very complicated, you don't know what is the existence. And in the case of existence, then you borrow from functionality. You borrow from functional analysis, which is the big invention of the 20th century, the space where you are working. And in the case of this equation, most beautiful space is L1. When I began working with mathematics, people said, oh, the good space is L2. But L2 is the good space in bounded domains. If you go to the unbounded domains, you go to probability and you use L1 or measures. Everybody knows measures. Or measures. Everybody knows measures now. And in fact, Tosi Antonio likes measures, measures everywhere. Okay. So the question of regularity is what Luis Caffarelli did, and he got a Nobel Prize for good regularity. But in the case of the heat equation, it's free. The kernel introduces regularity for free. Not in all cases, you will get this regularity. And finally, what I like is asymptotic behavior. The evolution of this corp in functional space, which is represented by the solution, goes on doing bumps in different histories and eliminating maximum, minimum, mixing, and so on. And when you let it go on, you go what you call asymptotic behavior. And before the asymptotic, because maybe asymptotic is death, but before death, there is a form, which is the Is a form which is the what you call intermediate asymptotics, and this is a Gaussian. And the theorem says very precisely: if you take uxt, which is your solution given by convolution, and you take m times the green function, the Gauss function, and you make the difference, this difference goes to zero in interval. Integral error goes to zero. Now you have to calculate the constant, the asymptotic constant. Constant, the asymptotic constant that the solution is looking for, it is the whole mass. So you have a way of calculating the whole mass of the distribution of the evolution by heat equation by just waiting enough and checking one point. It will be m times Raussian. And this is a way of calculating the mass without having to go to the whole distribution. You let it go for one day, and after one day, there will be... There will be a Raussian next to you with a name that will be the mass of everybody around. Everyone is mixing. The idea is, everybody's mixing. It looks like a big particle and another. Everybody's mixing. Okay, so now you can get also the difference in L infinity. And in that case, you did a pre-normalization. And then let me tell you what is the family. Family of heat equations, I mean, you can. I mean, you can stay your whole life going up there to your universal multiverse and stay in the room that says heat equation and proving things. And you are happy. But if you want to go to the next room, next room says linear parabolic equations. Now, linear parabolic equations come after discussion during most of the first part of the 20th century in two branches. They are different. They are different. Nobody knew that before. 120 years ago, nobody knew about divergence and probabilistic. Now, the first type is this type where the coefficients are there outside. And this is the second derivative, the Haitian. And instead of having the placer, which is the trace of the Haitian, you have a mixture. And there is a matrix. And there is a matrix of coefficients to take values from the fation, the ones that you like to put. And then once you know that this is the second order of operation, the theory says that the lower order one or zero or no u will be not very difficult to take into account. So you get a theory for this kind of second order equation. Or second-order equation. But now people discovered that for many of these things, you were interested in doing integration by dance and introducing something called energies. So you do the heat equation, the typical wonderful thing you do for the rest of humanity. It is dt over u squared dx equals and then u do do do do do do do and then Do do, and then you get me, and this is wonderful because it's a diligent integral, fantastic. But you have to integrate by parts. In order to integrate by parts, everybody knows that you go, di goes on the other side and it's a symmetric operator. Getting a symmetric, there is a form. We call it territory. We are not so stupid. We learned, and then you need. We learned, and then you need the second part, which is divergence equations. So, for the people who do energies, let's call it mechanical people, the second version is stronger. And then you have to do the theory of both versions. It takes two semesters if you do it completely. I went to Italy in 79 and learned in Cortona Palace since I learned Italian first because otherwise the ladies didn't talk to you. I learned 80 sequences. I mean, the book was Gilbert Rudinger. One of the most beautiful things that can happen to you. The first part of the book was incredible. We knew everything, every line. And the part is after these two courses, you get a vocabulary of things you didn't know you could know, but now you know, and you can speak this language. And the new language is hid, but Heat, parabolic, and then your Gaussian function, separation of variables, Fourier analysis, spectral decomposition, equation in divergence form, Dirichlet forms, maximum principle, Brownian motion, generation of semi-groups, functional inequalities, positive operators in bad spaces. I know that our friend Jantor Bohr knows some of these concepts and he likes. These concepts, and he likes two of them. I know which ones. So, some people like enormously some of them. For instance, how many of you like entropy dissipation? I like all kinds of dissipation, but entropy dissipation is beautiful. It's incredible. In Spain, you have dissipation, alcoholic dissipation, but not entropy dissipation. This is a new idea for a party. And once you know that you live in a different world, you are not a You live in a different world. You are not the same person. This is the point. You can do these things normally. It is normal life after you invent all of these things. And then the problem is that it's not enough. Let's go to next room. My next room, this is where I came into the picture. I was happy that it was next room, was or recently opened, was the non-linear parabolic equations from physics. I mean, there is a model, you don't invent the one you like because some Don't invent the one you like because somebody told you do this. No, no, this is because in physics there was this idea that you must split. Everybody's splitting in Spain, but I don't mean that splitting. I just mean that this splitting is this thing, this beautiful form, right? I mean, you. Right? I mean, you need to be happy in this family or this neighborhood to have a love for beautiful formulas. They tell you what you want to know. You look at them and you find inspiration. For instance, people looking at this formula for the Laplacian discovered that the Laplacian has two first order operators in combination. But in the middle, you p can put one what we call in Spanish agua fiestas. Call in Spanish agua fiestas, one bad guy trying to spoil the party, and this is what they did: they say between divergence and gradient, you put a function a which is non-linear. And this is true because in filtration equations, you find that. And the Stefan problem can be written in that form. And then they say, once we know we know that, we can also do more. Instead of you. Of u in the derivative with respect to time, you put enthalpy of u. This is Stefan problem. And enthalpy is a non-linear operator. It has a jump. So you begin working with jumps and maximal model operators. And then the rest of the things, you put this as lower order. Don't throw them away because part of the physics will be in lower order. But the main difficulty when you begin with existence is in the higher order. Existence is in the higher order. Everybody knows that. The higher order operator controls the rest. This goes back to Newton. Newton already knew that. And then the idea is, can you do that? This is the general formulation for the non-linear parabolic problem that was on the table after the Georgia. And when I went to Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the 1980s, I met many people. 80s, I met many people, wonderful people. One of them was Servin. And I talked a lot to him. And he said, Well, we have been working for 20 years now on this program for this equation. And the time equation is terrible. We cannot make a sense of it. It is complicated, difficult to write a book. And the idea is, he said, well, what happened if you waited for 20 years and I ask again? And he said, And I ask again, and he said, We are trying to write the book. And then, after another 20 years, now people ask me, and they say, We are not writing the book anymore because there are too many books. So, there are too many books on that. This is the good news. There are too many books. And then, what I want to tell you is that the part that goes with this thing is what we call non-linear diffusion. And this is where you have reaction. Where you have reaction and aggregation and convection and transport. So there is lots of physics inside. And since the book was impossible to write in general, what the idea is writing on the specific examples of problems that are case problems that are most relevant. You have to find the relevant case problem. If you do a small problem, it's okay. But if you do a small problem, it's okay. There is a big army, you have part of the army. Now, which are in the case where I studied in the 1980s with these big guys, the big problems. They selected the problems, and the problems on the table were at the time, Stefan problem, Hilshaw problem, Porus-Moolean equation, and the evolution field equation. Stefan problem was famous in Austria because of Stefan. Because of Stefan. Okay. And the Hillshaw problem was famous in UK. I remember John Otton working non-stop on heelshawk problem. And then Poros Medium equation was first popular with me. I liked Porst Medium from the very beginning. The first moment I met uh Poros Medium I said, Let me do it. And then P Laboration is famous in Italy. Is famous in Italy. All Italians like pila brazios. I don't know why. I mean, okay, then pizza. Something else. Pizza de mufa. Okay, so what do we do? Try to work on it. What is the main novelty? They get inside a free bubble. And you want to describe it. And then now, after so many years, people After so many years, people are working on the systems, which are very interesting. And one of the systems that is very popular is the aggregation system. But I remember when I was here in 96 that the Petit people, Carrillo, the younger Carrillo, who was there very young, and Soler, they were working on kinetic equations. And they learned a bit of kinetic equations because we wrote the paper. Because we were wrong technically. Because it's another field. You have to go to the next room. So the idea is that some of these problems, you eliminate your T and you get an elliptic equation. Now, elliptic equation is a very, very strong field. I mean, this is where the big action is. So it's very nice to be related to elliptic equations. And if you are able to contribute, you are very happy. To contribute, you are very happy. Now, elliptic equations in that list, Stefan, Hilshaw, Poros, Phila Prelation comes as an ostracon. So this is the picture. Now, in order to continue, let me tell you that I have nobody, but Luis Cabarell is great. And he was given the Nobel for Mathematicians, which is the Abel Prize. And of course, I was there. I had to look for myself. For myself. And they say this beautiful thing about him. And Luisangel, this happy in Texas, was born in Buenos Aires. He did seminar contributions to regularity theory for nonlinear partial differential equations. My God, I like that. And then they say, including free boundary progresses, okay. And Mohn Jamper equation. Monjumpere equation. Okay, so it's big news for this audience. It's big news. I think it's like getting the big lottery. They finally decided to recognize this guy. And I've been following him for 40 years. And it's great. I mean, he had all kinds of ideas. And every room he visited, you Every room he visited, you went with him to see what happened. Wonderful things happened after he came in, and he was like a light in a dark room. This idea. Mathematics is very difficult sometimes. But then there is some people who shine around, right? And then you see things. And then when they go away, you remember that you saw it, but you don't remember what. So it takes a long time to study. Yeah, I took notes from Caffarelli to see what I From Caffarelli to see what I was looking because I was seeing it. Yeah, this is, I would love it. And then I was taking the notes and I said, well, it doesn't make any sense. Okay, so the idea is that we solve or try to solve the problems posed by the previous types of applied nonlinear PDs, and especially free boundaries and degeneracies. Because we are, I mean, it is terrible to say that outside, we are degenerate people. We are degenerate people. But let me make a point. We are very singular. As degenerate, we are singular. But this is life. And then, of course, in the last years, Giaforelli decided to move some of his energy into non-local persons, non-local operators. And let me just finish this part that is like a real introduction I was giving to. Like a real introduction, I was giving today is that this is the brand newspaper. In 2015, he was made a member of the Royal Academy in Spain. And then, oh, this is last week. The nine next to Louis, which The guy next to Louis, which is Tall and Solon, this is the King. Cape Harold and Queen Sophia. And then people on this side are Louis and Safrance. And the block there is a statue of Aben in the Royal Gardens. Usun, I should say. Okay. To say. Okay, so this is it. Now I will tell you something to show that. What does you want to give us? Okay, okay, so what is the local operators? Local operators comes from probability. If you do the typical approximation to the standardized heat equation by jumping probabilities from one side to another side, you use To another side, you use next neighbor approximation or several next neighbors. If you do, you don't need to do this. Next neighbor is okay. And this implies, in the end, if you do it the same method all the time with independent increments, you get Brandon motion, you get random walk and deliver Braunian motion. But it has the problem that this beautiful frame has because. Has because it doesn't fit all the evidence in the applied diffusion processes. And then, if you want to take into account this possibility, you need to invent a new object. Now, you say applied people are sometimes impossible. They say, listen, let's do the numerics and let's put several points and more points and more influence and that's it. And more influence, and that's it. We do numerics. Okay, if you do numerics and nothing else, then you don't do theory, you're not really a mathematician. Mathematician has to do theory, which means after the great masters, Newton and Leibniz and the rest, go into the continuous, because they are in the continuous where the beautiful formula is like. And the continuous in this case is anything that is not prownial motion. Angry that is not Brownian motion, it is what they call in probably the Levy process. The Levy process has a scaling, like the Brownian motion, but it's not the same scaling. The Brownian motion scaling is X squared, behaves like T, right? This is the Brownian scale. And this comes into analysis to P this, whatever. It is there because good God told. Because good God told Brandon Mosso to have this scale. Now, in the case that we want to do, we want this to be T and S has to be between zero and one. And the main point is, can you make it? Are you a real mathematician or not? Most of people say, Well, I am not. Let me hope. Of people say, Well, I have not. Let me hope. But no, because we are a community. Somebody in the community will be able to do it. So, in the 1920s, Veeam and Levy introduced branch motion and levy motion, with levy jumps, and they got this rule for the deviation, standard deviation. And when they wrote And when they wrote it, they found the transition probabilities for the Margovian process, everything else. And we don't care because now that we know that they know, we are next neighbor asking them, give us a count, because we want to do analysis. The analysis, like we, since we are so interested in symbols, I mean, in this magic world of symbology, first that we First, that we met is the symbol. The symbol is called Laplacian to the S because it's La numerology. There is two here, there is two S here, so the difference is the S. You are counting the number of derivatives. Now, but we don't know what it is, but we know already what we want. And the equations you want to solve are elliptic and parabolic. So we have not so far. I mean, this is a a pre coup. I mean, this is aprecour. It's after doing it, very easy to explain. But some of the are very bad at seeing it and even worse in explaining it. Now, since the people in parabolic stochastic process knew how to do, what is the point of doing the analysis? Well, the analysis has a different methodology, different toolbox, and we can solve in the natural way non-linear problems. Things waiting probability artificial like higher show. So Caffari wrote a beautiful paper with Silvestre in 2007. It's one of his claims to glory in this Abel Prize. And then the idea is that if you want to do analysis, the way of analysis is completely different. And it came from a different way of thinking. It's like doing Fourier analysis. It's like doing Fourier analysis and in Fourier analysis, what I call here standard deviation, they call it the symbol that they want to exceed. And this comes from doing Fourier analysis of the distribution. But in probability, they know that both things are related. And then what we want is having a symbol of C to the Pers. Once you know that this is the symbol, you may back. You made back convolution and you get an internal operator that has to be designularized, which is that singular operator derives. And then you discover that for the people who do the numerics that we are beginning to do with probability density, Markov probability densities p i j, what you have to do to get this operator there is getting this decay in the distance like a distance. Like N, which is dimension plus 2s. And you do that. There is a beautiful paper, survey paper written for the team of applied mathematical strategy by Enrico, our friend, Enrico Baldinocci. Okay. And then Cavarli contributed with this beautiful extension. I will not explain, but this is one of the most beautiful things we do. We extend. We extend the problem of finding the Laplacian to one dimension more, sort of state the equation, and take Neumann data. I will not explain that because you know the idea is can you do now with this machinery local local operators, what are they? And there are two answers to that for me. One of them is the roto, because I was invited by my friends in particular, Mateo, to Friends, in particular Matteo, to give a course in Chetraro with some group of friends, Carrillo, Delpino, Filali, Mingione, and myself. And I wrote a whole set of notes about what we knew in 2016. And then the idea is that I will talk about something else to finish my contribution here, but I'll show you these ignors. Okay, the idea that Okay, the idea is that can you start to derive a model and do something with it? And I said, yes, there was something that was to be done in 2015, which was starting the discussion by considering the fractional integral that represents digital fractional intensity. Instead of having derivative, I wrote. If I wrote it here, right? Fundamental energy of heat equation. If you are working with the Laplacian, you get this heat equation. If you work with the S-Laplacian, what you get? You get this integral as energy. And this is studied in functional analysis as fractional Sobolev spaces, Laudietzi spaces, or Gali. Spaces or Gagliardo spaces. This whole Italian had to be Gallardo. Okay, now, once you define this thing, there is, of course, a norm, a semi-norm, and a norm, and then you get the scale of the spaces. And you can do it for every S and for every P. More than one. And then what you do is remember that this is how you write. I put. Right, I put between the parentheses the quotient because we are replacing derivative by holder quotients. So the point is: holder is the idea that replaces Lipsis. In some sense, we are going to from holder to from Lipsis to holder. And well, then you find the Euler Lagrange operator and it is the what it I mean, it must happen. Instead of the P, you get P minus one. Instead of the p, you get p minus one. And since I am getting one of these funny powers with sine z in absolute value to the p minus two times g, which we used to call at the time French powers, sine powers. Then this is what the operator, the standard energy version of the P Laplace operator. And then you say, is this a maximal momentum operator? It comes from a Operator, it comes from a complex functional in a nice functional space. So it's a maximal operator. Evolved LP spaces, incredible. And then you run the evolution. And the evolution works. You get the semi-group, like in the heat equation. You don't get representation, my dear, but it was very well known from the time of my thesis advisor in company that this was a nice non-linear semi- This was a nice nonlinear semi-group with raw estimates. And you can do some kind of Hille-Phillips formula to generate this. So what's the problem? Problem is, I want to prove that it converges to this monster, but in a new version. It will not be the Gaussian. It will be the Pila Plesseng Gaussian with a guess, right? It's a Pila Place and Gaussian. Right, it's a pillar plexigausiang with the gas, so this is another object which will be an attractor of the evolution of a new semi-group if we are able to prove it. So I began trying to make notes and I discovered it was not so easy. I asked her how can you do it? They didn't like it. I don't know why. So I said, let me do it myself. And I did it myself. And this is the result. In fact, the Gaussian is. In fact, the Gaussian is true in the sense that there is a similar function f, which is not the exponential, and the register information in time is zoom scaling. And the scaling parameters, according to my master and commander, Risha Barenblatt, who was the good rusher that was my friend, he said this: before you do the investigation, you have to know the solution. So, in the case of escaping parameters, if you ask anybody in the Soviet Union, they will know. In fact, there was a seriously a repeated school of people in Moscow doing analysis of certain similarities. So, the formulas are already known. The only question is: does the F exist? And how do you calculate the profile? And the profile has to satisfy some. And the profile has to satisfy something. Can you do it? So, this is what I did. And what we did carefully, because we have been building up this laboratoire, the Tanalis Numérique in Madrid, with the help of Félix Delteso, who is not here, sorry. He has work to do in Toronto for us. We did the calculations numerically and we found the profiles. If you look at the profile, If you look at the profile, we did for several S and several P. Upstairs is the actual version, downstairs is the logarithmic plot. We wanted to know in logarithmic plot if the tails are powers. In logarithmic plot, it is linear. And we found numerically perfect agreement with the calculations that I have been doing. And if you see, there is something strange this is. There is something strange. This is that when you go to the black line, which is p equals eight, the formation of a missile instead of a Gaussian. It is not round yet. It begins to be flat, and we don't know why. There was once a guy, I don't know why, probably in Oxford, who explained to me that he could explain why this is flat, but we don't know. Is it if you p text to infinity, will you get a message? We don't know. Okay, in any case, these are the new pictures, and the idea is that there is an asymptotic behavior given by this one. Okay, and you have, curiously enough, the result, if you know that the result is true, it must be this one. Then you have to prove it. And in order to prove it, you need a toolbox. And the toolbox is And the toolbox is curious because I will give you the list of things you use. There are part of the list of things you learn in this new literature that you are mastering. L1 L infinity, it's okay. Conservation of mass, it's okay. Derivative estimates, yeah, energy estimates. Scaling transformations, you don't do anything without scaling transformations in this field. Transformations in this field. Positivity, oh, this is proving that things are positive, which is they have no free boundaries. And then you get the Lyapunov functional, which is the Lyapunov functional is the entropy. You do some entropy that goes to zero. And in fact, it doesn't work because I'll tell the moment you have to prove that things will not go to zero in your evolution or not to infinity. You need a control. You need a control, and the control is given by something that Luis Cafferelli always had as a beautiful argument. There is a barrier. You take the barrier and you put it from below or from above. Then what's there? It touches. The point is, the barrier touches. And then this is what it is. Now, there is something else that you can do, which is going to the proof. For instance, for the last. To the proof, for instance, for the line of scaling line of scaling is that since you know how the solution goes down by the barren blood scaling and how it spreads by the barren blood scaling, there is the alpha and the beta. And then you make u t times the v which will be normalized, and the scale of the x will be y x. X will be y x t to the minus beta and the time will be changed into the logarithmic time. And people in geometry already knew also this thing that is if you scale it properly according to invariance group, you get the same equation more or less. More or less. Now, what is more or less? The new equation for me will be in blue the same equation and in red. Red the confining terms due to the change of variables is what you call relativity. If you go to new variables, you get new terms because of the change of variables. And this in the new variables allow you to do something that you didn't have before, which is compiling. So this is a kind of equation of the Fokker-Planck type. Fokker plan type of the Oster one goal. Once you have confining, what you do is say, listen, if this converges to equilibrium, I have to prove it with my barrier. But if this converges, then derivative in time will disappear and you will be solving an elliptic equation. So this is your Fokker-Plug equation. Okay, so you are doing elliptic equations, and all of a sudden you are you are taping it. Of a sudden, you are happier because you're solving elliptical equations like a plus. So, I was able to solve this elliptical equation, which is a non-linear. It is not an eigenvalue problem because the next term is confining. So, it's an equilibrium equation for a diffusion confinement, which is something that in another equal momentum. And that's it. Let me see if I have some time to go more. To go more probably. Tell me. Okay, let me make the stop here. But no, intermediate stop. Allow you to relax a bit. So we were interested in doing after that something with people in Norway and we did a model of Did a model of tackle work, which is interesting for people now. And the idea is that this is related to infinite Laplacian operators. So we discussed what is the infinite Laplacian. We are changing something. Move only close room, previous room, and open in Europe. And see if there is a connection. Probably no connection. Probably no connection. So, this is a project that we have been working recently, one of the projects that is trying to use the infinity labelation to solve for regularity, free boundaries, evolution. And the idea is that the infinite Laplacian is scarce gradient due to infinity, you cannot write it. But if you split it, if you take the Laplace, Split it, if you take the Laplacian, the standard Laplacian, the formula AT, and make the differentiation of the terms, the factors that may go to infinity, you factor them out. So you divide formula 18 by gradient to the 2 minus p. And then you calculate what is the derivative, the queens, and you find that there is a formula. And you find that there is a formula that doesn't have infinities, it has only coefficients. And when you go to infinity, there is a p minus one over b that goes to zero. So this is what you find as infinitesimal. And it doesn't have an energy theory, it has a viscosity theory. So you have to learn viscosities. And this is something that people have been doing in particular. Have been doing in particular Gunnar Arfun in Sweden was doing that in 1968. I found Gunnar in the Bortona School in 1979, who was visiting there because he wanted, was a good friend of Talenti. And I asked him, Why are you staying here and studying with us? We are younger people, if you are senior and famous. He says, No, I like Italy. Says, no, I like Italy. Reason it does. So the type of war approach was joined by the people in probability because Perez, Schramm and Sheffield and Wilson found in a beautiful paper in 2009 that these pillarplacian equations with renormalization divided by the extra gradients can be found. Gradients can be found in type of war games, and I will not explain that. You go to these references to the famous paper by Peris and Company. And there were two people in my neighborhood in analysis that were very quick at learning it. And they were Grandel and Linquist, our friend Peter Linquist. And so you can learn this. And then of course You can learn this, and then, of course, we try to do the evolution. I did the evolution with the Portuguese guy, Portilieo. And this guy, Portiller, was very good, but then he disappeared. And we did evolution. But the point is, can you do Laplacians? S laplacians. In fact, pure length of relief could do S Laplacians. Now, what is the operator for the infinity S Laplacian? By God. It's one dimension. It's a one-dimensional integration because you integrate along the lines where the players move. The players move because they look for a direction where they do the computation, positive or negative. So it's a one-dimensional line, but you have to do should and if. So it looks like the should if operators of these guys in Florence. What? Pooch. Pooch. This is it. And this was done by Jorla and Caffarelli and Fidale, who didn't stop. Fidale was there and he always did something else. And at the beginning, it was very complicated. He did nothing, but somebody told me, Listen, they did the parabolic, and probably they don't know how to do the, not the lipstick, they don't know how to do the parabolic. And this was enough. I began, okay, let me do it. So what we do is this. So what we do is this paper with Felix Del Tesso, Jorgen Endal, and Espen Jakobsen, who just appeared. We are doing the numerical code, which takes some time because it's difficult. Do all the integration along all the lines in an efficient way. We do viscosity solution for this equation. The operator is the Bjorn-Caffarelli Firali operator. And in this sense, we prove something these other guys. Something, these are the guys. This is Trotman, and okay. And the idea is that in one in radial coordinates, you can calculate the maximums because it's around the radius. And it happens that this operator is the escalation in one dimension. So we know what is the famous Beautiful solution, which is the S Gaussian in one dimension. So, what do the rest of the solutions do? It is difficult because we don't have tunnels. We never prove tunings for this method. So, we are doing solutions that we call the constructive solutions. And we do a theory for them and prove comparison of a constructive with a radial. In that case, we. Already here. In that case, we can compare. This is a good idea of which. If you compare with a good guy, you win. And then I finish now. There is lots of things that you don't need to know, but we do this asymptotic comparison that we call global hard principle because Matthew says global hardware principle. You say, put global hard. Okay. And then this is. This is the pictures. If you see, when you take two blobs at the beginning, they begin spreading. But since we don't know good convergence to this radial blob, maybe if the limit is not radial, we prove only two constants in the global hardnote. So the open problem that we don't know how to solve, and you are invited to join and solve it, is To join and solve it is prove uniqueness first, prove convergence to the radial block second, or even better, prove not convergence to the radial block. In that case, you will have to tell me what is the elongated blob that you find in the beam. And in that case, thank you very much. So, thank you very much, Cuaduis, for the wonderful talk. Now, let's hear if somebody from the audience has some questions, some remarks, some answers to the all the problems. I saw them, has it? Yeah, you have a question. I can read your mind. I can read your mind. You know the question he has? Can you do the type of war in Riemannian manifolds? He doesn't know the question, he knows how to put. It's curious because what do you do if you have lines for this type of work that you are integrating along the line? Along the line, because you choose this line, right? You get probabilities of jumping more or less. If you're in the Romanian fold, you go along geodesics. Can you play a game of tug of war on the earth? So you can or you cannot. You can. Or you cannot. You cannot. So there are many questions that come from trying to imitate what people in geometry or physics will ask, which is a good, I mean, not asking the question that people in PDEs or analysis will ask. Asking also the question what people in geography will ask. And we spent lots of time with Gabriele Grillo and Real and the laboratory thinking about what happens in the geometry human. So this is maybe a historic question more than a content question, but when did people realize that the laby processes and the fractional applashing were related and were like when did the two lines of research come together, do you know? Of research come together, do you know? I think in the beginning they went in parallel because the Laplacian analysis was invented by Marcel Riesz in the 1930s, I think, and then it was written in the books by Stein and Landkoff in the 70s, 60s, 70s, more or less. And at that time, people in Providence already knew very well what was a learning process. So for them, I think that they discovered that the I think that they discovered that the analysis version was there. Okay. Yeah, but they didn't pursue it very much. For them, it's just a representation. And linear thing works very well. So everything we use that implies knowing kernels and boundary behavior and so on, they are normally better than us, right? We talk a lot with these people in Wrocław, in Poland, that are better. In Boland, that have very strong school probability, and they know the answers to the linearities. Problem is that never consider problems with three boundaries or powers. It's not in their method. Well, it has part. So the there is also the analogy the analogies which are the set similar to this. Which are the set similar solutions? Yes, for the similar solution of the infinity replacements. Infinity replacement, if you are radial decreasing, is the one-dimensional S-Raplace. So you are working one dimension and then you have a solution because it's the fundamental solution constructed by probabilistic people in the 60s, Bloom and Tal in the 20s. So it's known. But this is only for radial solutions. Only for radio solutions. And since there is no unique day, we have to open problems. One of them are there spurious solutions, and second, does it converge to this Gaussian scoring Gaussian? Okay, and we don't know. We know approximate convergence, right? And the numerical method is very heavy. It takes too much time. Too much time, and you have to integrate a lot of lines all the time, and this is very unstable. There are other questions? So, I just wanted to say, as a senior person, so forget my mathematics, that it is a wonderful idea that this banfo institution comes to Spain. comes to Spain. Because in order to play our part in the international global community that has been helping us a lot, we need to give something back. And once there is an institution like this in Granada, and the place is beautiful, the best monument in the world, let's say, Al Java. And then I also... And then I also think that it's fair to say that this connection with Italy that I have been keeping since 1979 is a good idea because at least there are to join to force joining, you know, right? So in any case, in the name of the Royal Society, I am a very friend of the president. Tell all of you that we are incredibly happy with your people. Parties of your favourite. It works.
