We have Parsdoc in our lab, and we also have other Parsdoc and an undergraduate student as a co-authors. So we know that the hydrodynamics instabilities are present in several in our daily life and several industry processes. So, and this is instability. So, and these instabilities can cause dramatic mechanical and thermodynamic changes in the flow. And they can be caused by several different effects like buoyancy, elasticity, or surface tension, and viscosity, and whatever. So, and the motivation. So, the motivation in our work is the flow of viscoplast. We are analyzing the flow of viscoplastic liquids through internal passages with abrupt varying cross-sections. This kind of flow can be obtained and found in different industrial processes like extrosion, mold filling, flow through porous. Flow through Poros Media as we saw previously. But we are mainly in this work, we are mainly interested in drilling and cementing operations. So in these situations here, we are dealing actually not only with the cross varying cross sections, but we are dealing with flow displacement. Flow displacement. So we are talking about two fluids, one displacing another one. So for those who are not familiar with the drilling and cementing operations, we are showing here in this movie how this happens. We have a casing, which is this metal gray here, and then the drilling begins, injecting. Begins injecting like the drilling fluid, and then we have to push this drilling fluid out of the well and cement the well. So this process can continue as we go down the reservoir. And so what we want to analyze in We want to analyze in this work is this flow displacement of the drilling fluid by the cement. And sometimes there is some spacer fluid between the drilling fluid and the cement. So in Brazil, especially, we are dealing mostly with offshore wells. So we have deep and this. Deep and these wells are very deep. And especially in our case, the case that we are analyzing, we are looking for the pre-salt zone where we have most of the oil in Brazil right now are in this zone. These are ultra-deep wells. We are talking about 6,000 meters deep. And this zone is And this zone is located below this salt zone here. And in this salt zone, what happens when you drill the well, what can happen is that due to salt variation, composition variation, when you drill this well, you can cause some enlargement of the well. So Of the well. So, when we have to cement the well, we will have to push the drilling fluid through the analog space between the casing and the formation, and we will find some enlargement in this situation. So, in this work, we will focus on the displacement of the drilling fluid in this region here. So, this is. So, this is a scheme of the process that we are talking about. So, these are the gray one is the cement and the brown one is the drilling fluid. We don't want this to happen. If the drilling fluid stays here, what will happen is that the cement operation will not be succeeded, so the well can collapse. The well can collapse, and this is very dramatic in the oil industry. So, our objectives here is to obtain the optimal conditions for the cementing operations in regions where we have these enlargements in the well war. Also, we want to understand the physics of flows of the yield stress materials. So, the drilling fluid is a huge stress. The drilling fluid is a huge stress material, and the cement also is a huge stress material. And also, we want to evaluate what are the governing parameters and how these governing parameters can influence in the flow instability and in the flow displacement process. So, we performed a numerical simulation of this situation here is a scheme of our Here is a scheme of our geometry. We are looking at the annular space between this. This would be the casing and then this would be the formation wall. So we have here the well is on the vertical position, so the flow direction is from down to up here. Here and we are in this work, we are only showing results from a Newtonian fluid pushing a new distress material. This would be the situation of a spacer fluid displacing a drilling fluid. So, we have several parameters here: the geometric parameters, the flow parameters. Parameters, the flow parameters, the flow rate here, and the fluid properties parameters. I'm showing only the results of concentric cases, so we will treat the problem as axis. We use the axis symmetry and we will consider a 2D simulation. So, here is an example of the mesh that we generated using GMASH. Using GMesh. And we use the fluent software, which uses the finite volume method to perform all the simulations. So we consider, as I said, the 2D and axisymmetric problem. All the results are loner. Obviously, it's a transient simulation. We didn't take into account any effect of temperature. Temperature, both fluids are incompressible, and we have the fluid, a Newtonian fluid displacing a non-Newtonian fluid. So we solved the momentum conservation equations. We using for the viscoplastic fluid, we used a Heschel-Berkeley habieralized function and we solved. We solved also obviously the mass conservation equation, and we treated the two-fluid simulation using the volume of fluid method. So we solved the conservation equation for the volume fraction of one of the fluids, and the other one is obtained, the volume fraction of the other one is obtained through this restriction. Obtained through this restriction equation. And all the properties are in the cells where we have both fluids are obtained through a mean of the properties of both fluids. So as I said before, we use a fluent software. So we use the finite volume method. And these are the The parameters that we use it for in our solution. We use the piezo algorithm for the coupling of pressure and velocity. And these are the discretization scheme that we are using and the geo-reconstruct algorithm for the volume fraction for the volume interface, the interface between both fluids. As our initial condition, we Our initial condition, we consider that the whole domain is filled with fluid one, which is the non-Newtonian one, the viscoplastic one. We assume the non-slip and impermeable walls. All walls are considered impermeable and the no-slip condition. And at the inlet cross-section, we enter the fluid. The fluid with an axial, a fully developed axial velocity profile, and at the outlet we consider that the flow is fully developed. So for the time discretization, we maintained this the Kuhan number, the numerical Kuhan number below one always. This in all simulations, our step. simulations our step time was around the time 10 to the minus 3 to 10 to the minus 2 and and and all in all simulations we just pumped one a volume of fluid through the all the simulations so the the the fluid fluid 2 is pumped one total volume during during the During the simulation. So, these are the mesh tests that we performed. This is for a very unstable situation. And what we observed here is that as we increase the number of nodes, we kind of converge to a flow pattern. A flow pattern. So we decided to run our simulations using this as a base mesh. So since we have different geometries, the mesh will change, but we kept all the size of the smallest and biggest volumes constant. We tried to do that in all genre. to to do that in all geometries that we we generated the mesh and and this parameter here is the the the efficience the displacement efficience this is a parameter that is important for the industry they want to know how efficient is the displacement process so this efficiency is defined as the volume of the displaced fluid Fluid by the volume of the cavity. So, as the, if they, I think it's not a displacement fluid, the displacer fluid, the volume of this displacer fluid for the volume of the cavity. So, if the efficiency is 100%, the process would be very successful. Successful, and in the which is not these cases here. So, we also performed some experimental validation. We have experimental apparatus here. Here is the test session. We just fill our test session with fluid one and then we pump fluid two to displace fluid one and we measure the flow rate. we measure the flow rate and the density at the out of the test session. So this is the geometry that we are looking for and these are the parameters that we use in our experiments. So in this movie, which is not play, yeah, we are showing a Showing an experimental simulation here of fluid. We were all with the transparent, all the session were filled with a transparent fluid and then we are pumping this brown fluid. And here we are measuring the density at the outlet. So if this density matches the density of Matches the density of the displacer fluid in the end. So the efficiency will be next to 100%. So we compared some of these experiments with our simulations and we had a very good agreement. So we now will show some of the results that we have. Results that we have. So we obtained some dimensionalized parameters of the problem. The geometrical parameters are dimensionalized with this diameter here of the inlet tube, the inner tube. And we also have a density difference, a dimensionalized density difference. A dimensional density difference, a dimensionless viscosity ratio. This is the characteristic shear rate. And then the viscosity, the dimensionalized viscosity is obtained from the ratio of the viscosity of fluid 2 to a characteristic viscosity of fluid 1. And these are the Reynolds number, the Galilei number, Michelson number, and Weber number. So now I'm showing some results. Most of the simulations are done using real data of the oil industry. So here are the effect of viscosity ratio. So it's important to stress here that we are varying more than one gimmick. More than one dimensionalized parameter here, but here we can see the effect of the viscosity ratio. As we for lower viscosity ratios, the flow is very unstable and the displacement is very poor. And as we increase the viscosity ratio, we can see here that the flow displacements are better, but we still have in this case. Still have in this case where the whole star is negative, we still have an unstable situation. And all these simulations are for low Reynolds number, except this one is for a Reynolds number around 1000, but all of these are for Reynolds number lower than 100. So, this is the same case here, but I'm just Here, but I'm just showing here the velocity field and the strain rate field, where we can see that the yellow fluid is the viscoplastic one. So, we can see that these blue zones are actually unuted zones of the fluids. So, the fluid remains stagnant in these regions here. Here. So, and now we evaluate the effect of the length of the enlargement. And as we can see here, is that the flow pattern... Two minutes, Monica. Okay, the flow pattern remains almost the same, but as we increase more further the enlargement, it seems that the displacement The displacement became a little better, but there are still severe instabilities. And these are the effects of the diometer of the enlargement. We see that for small diometers, the instabilities begin, but only in the end. only in the end of the or in the middle of the enlargement zone. So as we increase the diameter, we see that these disabilities begin just after the enlargement. And these are the effect of the density difference. So for the density difference lower than one, Lower than one are the cases where the fluid one has a larger density than fluid two. So we see that all these cases are very unstable, but as we we have a situation, when we have a situation where fluid two is more dense, is denser than fluid one, we can see that the flow is very. See that the flow is very stable, and here we can see also a nuded zone of RID1, it remains stagnant because probably there is no for, we can't surpass the huge stress in these regions. And here is the effect of surface tension. As we increase the surface tension, it tends surface tension, it tends, the fluid, the instability tends to become less, the flow becomes more stable as we increase the surface tension as we expected. All the results showed previously were for surface tension equal to zero. So these are the final remax. So these are the final remarks. These are an ongoing study. We are still evaluating the effects of all these parameters. And so with that, I would like to finish. These are the authors, and I would like to acknowledge Petro Braz. This is a project in collaboration with Petro Braz and the Brazilian funding. Brazilian funding agencies. Okay, thank you. Thanks, Monica. We've got a few questions. So the first one is going to come from Syed Tagavi. Syed? Thanks for great work and nice talk, Monica. So I have one or two questions. One is that the so you showed that for the low Reynolds numbers, you have fluids at the corner left behind. I was wondering if you look at the effect of the corner. Wondering if you look at the effect of the corners, the shape of the corners basically. And then at high Reynolds number, you see that the fluid penetrates towards the corners. So I was wondering, it would be nice to look at what Reynolds number you start to remove the fluids at the corners. Yeah, I can say because in these situations here, we have for the We have for this lowest It star, we have the higher Hainond's number here is like 1800. But these cases here, like I said, I don't know exactly the values of the Reynolds number, but these are below 100. I don't know. Priscilla is here if she knows exactly the numbers. She knows exactly the numbers she can say, but so we can say, as I said, we run in a lot of cases using real data from the industry. And now that we faced all these results, we realize that we have to run intermediate cases to really address the effects of... Address the effects of each of the parameters. So I don't know exactly. Okay, great, thanks. Ian Frigard is with the next question. Ian, you're there? Hi, Monica. Nice talk. Thank you. Yeah, I was wondering, you know, just the way you're set up, if you've done things where, I mean, you have an eccentric annulus in the uniform section, don't you? In the uniform section, don't you? And so are you able to compare the displacement in the uniform section compared to the displacement in the washout section? You mean in the experimental setup? Both, I suppose. I'm just thinking, you know, in terms of the question we often get asked is, you know, does the washout actually matter? does does the washout actually matter you know is the washout is the displacement actually better in the washout because it's a wider uh cavity and you know you have more time for density to act on the displacement you know yeah actually for them what we we we know is that it really matters i i i what i don't know if because What I don't know if because we just pumped one volume. If we continue to pump more volumes, we did this test for some cases and what we observed is that the flow pattern is almost the same as we increase in time. So for these situations, the efficiency wouldn't The efficiency wouldn't change at all. So I don't know if I understand correctly your question and if I answer it. But in the discussion. Thanks, Monica. I think we should finish there. And thanks for step.
