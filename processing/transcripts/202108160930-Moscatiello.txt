The talk is divided into parts. In the first part, we will talk about base sites. We will give the definition and some examples. We will see some motivation to study base sites and some famous results regarding such an invariant. And finally, we will see an estimation on base sites for primitive permanent. On Bayes sides for primitive permutation groups. In the second part of the talk, we will introduce the concept of E-Bis group. We will see how this group is related with the invariant of the B sites. We will see a characterization of such a group and see some of the primitive permutation libraries groups. Well, we will start with the permutation group, so nothing else than a subgroup of the symmetric group on omega. Symmetric group on omega. A base is a subset of omega with the property that the pointwise stabilizer in G of B is the identity. So the unique element fixing pointwise each other element of the B is the identity. The base size that we denote with the B of G is the minimal size of a base. Every permutation group has a base because, for example, G acts faithfully on omega. acts fitfully on omega, so omega itself is at this. Let's start with an example. We consider the symmetric group acting naturally on omega instead of k points. It is not difficult to observe that if we have a permutation on k point, we fix k minus one point of its natural module, then we have the identity. In the opposite direction, if we have a subset of omega with the size at Omega, with the sides at the most k minus 2, then for sure we have two points i and j outside of v that can be changed by a transposition. So we have a transposition ij inside the group that fix pointwise each element of the base. This means that b cannot be a base, so in particular that the base size of the single k is equal to k minus one, and moreover, every k minus one set is a base for g. Set is a base for G. Instead of considering transposition, we can consider three cycles and having a similar result for the alternating group. So the base of the alternating group is equal to k minus 2, and every k minus 2 subset of omega is a base for the alternating group. In the opposite extreme, we can find, for example, a subgroup of lengths k acting on omega, and when we fix one of the points, we Fix one of the points, we are sure that we are fixing each element of the group. So this group has B sides equal to one. A fundamental problem in 19th century was that of estimate the order of a finite primitive permutation group. And this problem with a simple observation is related to the concept of basis. And we will see why. Let's take two points of the permutation group G of omega and a base for it. And a base for it. If these two elements, x and y, agree on base, then this point should be equal. This simply means that the elements of the group are completely determined by direction on the base. Well, this is good because when the set on which the group acts on is finite, it is possible to bound the order of the group in terms of so the elements of the group are completely determined by the direction of this. Direction of the base, and in particular, this means that we can bound the order of G in terms of the base. In particular, the order of G can be bounded above by the order of omega to be of G. Well, so if we have efficient estimation on a base, on the base sides, we have efficient estimation on the order of a primitive permutation group. This motivated the first observation on bases. Another important application. Application of basis is the computational motivation. Indeed, the key concept for computer occupied permutation group is that of base and strong generating set. Let's introduce it very briefly. We have a permutation group 1 omega and a base. To such a base it is associated the descending chain of stabilizer, so geo omega 1, geo-omega 1, and so on and so on. One and so on and so on. A strong generating set is a subset of the group that both generates the group and provides a generating set for all the subgroup in the chain of stabilizer I showed you before. Well, what is a base strong generating set? It's nothing else than a pair consisting of a base and a strong generating set. With such a pair, it is possible to store, right? To store the element of a permutation group on omega as beta rather than the lambda double. And so, provided that the order of beta is quite small with respect to the order of the set on which the group act on, it is possible to have more efficient algorithms. Okay, it is not moreover difficult to observe that if we have a permutation group, Permutation group on a point that contains a subgroup H and a base for such a permutation group B, then such a base is also base for H. In particular, the base sides for H is bounded above by the base sides of G. So if we want to bound the base of a proper subgroup of CMN, it is sufficient to look to the maximate subgroup. And let's see some of this. We start with an intransitive. We start with an intransitive maximum subgroup, so G is something like the symmetric group, direct product of the symmetric group on n minus k points. So the stabilizer of the partition of n point in two sets, one of the sides k and one of the sides n minus k. Well, to have a basis, what we have to do is to find a base for sim k on k point, for sim n minus k on k minus on n minus k point. So the base minus k point. So the base size is nothing less than n minus 2. Well, if we consider instead the primitive vection, so n can be written as m times k, and g is equal to sim k red product sim n, so the stabilizer of the partition of n point in m subset of sites k each one. To find the base, we have to find the base of sim k on each block, let's say. Each block, let's say. So B of G is equal to K minus 1 times N. What happens for primitive group? Recall that a primitive group is a transitive group that preserves non-trivial partition of omega, and that this is equivalent to the fact that the point stabilizer G of omega, where omega is inside capital Omega, is a maximal subgroup. Finite primitive permutation group are classified by the ONAS-COVID theorem. By the ONAS-COVID theorem, and such a group partitioned the primitive permutation group in 5D classes, according with their structure and the direction of the circle. In particular, there is the class of affine type group, so with the so-called abelian, the almost simple class, well, the so-called non-abelian simple group, but the diagonal type, the product type, and the twisted product type. One of the first results regarding B size. The first result regarding Bayesides of a primitive permutation group is due to Bouchette that showed that a permutation group that is primitive of the GN does not contain the alternative group has B-sides bounded above by NR. Babai improved such a result showing that if the group is not too transitive, then the base sides can be bounded above by four. bounded above by 4 square root of n times log of n. Otherwise, if the group is too transitive, V of G is bounded above by C times square root to the square root of log N for some absolute constant C. And Pieber later improved the result for two transitive group, showing that B of G is smaller than C times the square of log of N for some constant C. It is important to notice that such a result Important to notice that such results are all based on a combinatorical approach and do not involve the classification of a finite simple group. Before to see what happens, if we use the classification of finite simple group, I want to define what are the large base groups. And we will start with an example. We consider the symmetric group SIM7 acting on the set omega of two subsets of its natural. Of two subsets of its natural module. We can consider the pair one, two, the pair two, three, and the pairs four, five, and the pairs five, six. Okay, once we have to fix the pair one, two and the pairs two, three, the point two, which is inside the intersection, is for sure stabilized. Well, we have two stabilized, the pairs one, two fixed, so one and three should be also fixed. The same happens for four, five, six. happens for four five six so we have a permutation with on seven point with with the six points stabilized so we have the identity this simply means that the the the pairs that i gave you are a base and in particular the base size is bounded above by four such kind of action were studied by a lassi which showed that the symmetic group on a point acting acting on On a point acting on k sets of this natural module, provided that L is at least two times k, as base sides bounded below by the ceiling of two L minus one over K plus one. And if L is large enough, this bound is inequality. In our example, this theorem says that B of G is exactly 4. This kind of group are large B. This kind of group are large base group. To be precisely, a primitive group is said to be large base if the set on which the group acts on is the set of all k subset of the natural module of C nel and G is either the Sinel group or the alternating group. Or is a blow-up of this group? So omega is the set of alters, so the K sets of Omega and the Of omega, and the so-called G is the ascernitin group to the power error, so to the direct product of er copies of Artel, and G is embedded inside the VET product with the product action. Notice that the symmetric group and the alternating group in their natural action are large Base group. In 1984, using the classification of finite simple Using the classification of finite simple groups, Liebeck showed that a primitive permutation group that is not large base has B sides bounded above by nine times the logarithm in these two of n. And this result is not far from being best possible. In fact, if we take G, the group, the projective general linear group PGL, DQ, acting on one species of its natural On one species of its natural module, then the degree of this action is at least bigger than q to the d minus one. And if we take v1, v2, vd to be a basis of our vector space v, and we take b to be the set given by the span of the one spaces v1 up to vd, and the one space is given by the sum of 1, v2, d. This is a base because as. This is a base because a matrices that fix pointwise the span of each basis should be a scalar matrices. And if all the entrance, if this should fix the sum of the basis vector, all the entrance of the matrices should be equal. So a scalar matrices that is an identity inside G. Very well. This means that B of G is less or equal than. Of g is less or equal than d plus one, and in particular, this is strictly less than the logarithm these two of n plus one. This was the bound that we at the beginning thought derived. What instead we proved is that a permutation group that is not large base has base sides bounded above by the maximum between seven and the ceiling of local base two of n plus one. Plus one. Moreover, the base size is bounded below by login base two of n plus one if and only if either G is an affine group at G L D two and the base size is exactly the login base two of n plus one, or G is the simplectic group sp D two on the coset of its maximal subgroup, the general orthogonal group d G O minus G two, or it is a massive group. Or it is a massive group with n equal to 12, 23, and 24 in their natural action. Notice that the bound is best possible because the base size of the math group of degree 24 is equal to 7. That is strictly bigger than the ceiling of log index 2 of n plus 1. And this explains why, in the estimation, there is a 7. There is seven, and the base size of spd2 on GO minus d2 is equal to the ceiling of log in this 2 of n plus 1. Okay, to prove such a result, we started with the non-almost simple classes. And in particular, to prove such cases, we use some of We use some of the results necessary to prove the Piever space size conjecture. And it is worth mentioning such a conjecture. This conjecture states that there is an absolute constant C such that the base sides of G is bounded above by C times the log in the S of N of the sides of the group G. This for any primitive permutation group G of degree N. And in particular, we will. And in particular, this conjecture was completely proved by Duhanna Lassi and Marotti in 2018 and was building on early work of lots of mathematicians. In particular, what we used to prove our result was the estimation of phosphate for diagonal type and that of Barnes and Sherass for product type. The almost simple case divided naturally in standard. In standard and non-standard actions. So I recall that a primitive group that is almost simple with the so-called G naught is standard if G naught is the alternating group and omega is an orbit of partition or K sets of the natural modulo G naught or is a class or G naught is a classical group and Omega is an orbit of subspaces of the or pairs of subspaces. We have seen We have seen an example of this section, for example, recall PGLDQ on one species. If none of this condition is satisfied, the group is said to be no standard. There were a famous conjecture due to Cameron Ecantor that states that if there is an absolute constant C such that the base side B of G is bounded above by C, this for every non-standard group G. Standard group gene and Liebeck and Shalef proved the Cameroon counter conjecture. Later, Barnes and other collaborators reached a stronger form of this conjecture, proving that the constant C is equal to 7, M24 is the unique group with B sides equal to 7, and moreover, there are infinite. And moreover, there are infinitely many groups with base sides at most seven, and every almost every sixth double is a base. Thanks to such a result, we have the non-standard case for free. So the bulk of the proof was indeed the standard case. And for standard case, we used the result of Bembenish, Kohen, and Nayaner bounding the base sides of the symmetric group on partition. The symmetric group compartition of its natural module. Moreover, we had to construct an explicit base for the action of the classical group on one and two spaces and for the symplectic group on coset of GO minus dq and show that these basic reconstruct is indeed the base of minimal size. And finally, we used a result of velocity between. Of Valassi Libkimaroti, which bound the base sides of a classical group on an orbit, on a georbit of k-dimensional subspaces with the k at least three. And this was proved to explicitly find the constant of the River Space Size conjecture and to pass from simple group theoret to the almost simple. Simple group to the almost simple case, we use the result of guest SPIGA showing that if G is a primitive permutation group on any point that is not large base, then any point of the group has a regular cycle. And I think that I mentioned everything about the first part of the talk. We will move to the second part of the talk and we again consider promotion. Promotation group on omega. In this case, we consider not set but ordered sequence of points. So, sigma is an ordered sequence of a point, omega 1, omega 2, omega k. This is said to be redundant if the chain of subgroup G, G omega 1, G omega 1, omega 2, and so on is a properly descending C. In particular, such as Such a sequence of points is said to be redundant if this condition star holds, and moreover, the underlying set of sigma is a base. So the point-wise stabilizer of the point omega1, omega2, omega k is the identity. If the dominant sequence has some feature of basis in vector space, in particular, sigma is a base of a vector space, if and only if. Vector space if and only if sigma is an horizontal basis for the general linear group acting on V. We all know that basis of vector space are all of the same size and they are irreducible by preserved by reordering. So it is natural to ask if such properties are true also for rigid basis for permutation group, for permutation group. For permutation group. So it is possible that there are permutation groups having all base sides of the same size or preserved baryordering. In general, the answer is no. And before to see an example, I want to point out that if we have a base of minimal size, then for sure this is a base that is irreducible because if I raise one of the points of the base, One of the points of the base, we cannot have anymore a base. And I recall to you that we have seen an example of a primitive group CMEL acting on two sets with base of minimal size four. We will construct a base of minimal, I mean, an irreducible basis of size five now. And how we do this by taking one, two, two, three, three, four. 2-3, 3-4, and the pairs that we already taken. When we stabilize 1, 2, as I said above, and 2-3, we are sure that 2 is fixed. Consequently, 1 and 3 are fixed. At this point, we cannot stop. We have also to be sure that there is a point that stabilizes the first pair, in this case, 1, 2, that does not stabilize the second pair. Okay, we have 3, 4. Okay, we have three, four, so we have the first step of our descending chain. Three, four is stabilized, three is fixed, so also four is fixed. And four, five stabilized the pairs one, two, and two, three, but that do not stabilize the pair three, four. So we gain again another steps toward our descending chain. If we take the two pairs four, five, six, we Five six, we are sure that we are considering a base, and it is not too difficult to observe that we are really descending, so we really have an iriduntant sequence of going. So, we have an redundant sequence of five points, and this means that our group has two bases that are irreducible with different sides. This concept was firstly studied by Cameron and Fonder. Firstly, studied by Cameron and von der Flas. In particular, they proved that if G is a permutation group on omega, then all irredent bases of G have same size if and only if all irreducible bases are preserved with perioding. And this is equivalent to the fact that all irreducible bases are basis of a combinatorical structure known as matroid that generalize, let's say, the concept of the independence of vector space. Independence of vector space. Well, they define the EBIS group. In particular, they say that a group is EBIS if satisfy one of the previous equivalent conditions. And EBIS group, say indeed for irreducint basis of invariant size group. Since every minimal base is an every base with minimal size is irreducible, then a permutation IBIS group has wholly redundant base. Group has wholly horizontal basis of sites P of G. At the beginning of the talk, I showed that sim K and R K are Rebis group because we saw that SIM K has all K-manus one subset of its natural model to be basis. Moreover, in another direction, if we take RGLB, the olafen group, The olafen group, this has only redundant basis of sides d plus one. So there are infinitely many examples of primitive dbis groups in the class of almost simple type and affine type. We ask at this point one can ask if it is possible to find EBITDA's group in the other classes of primitive groups. Let's start with the diagonal type. We found We found one. We consider H to be PSLDQ, where Q is 2 to the F, at least bigger than 4, and we consider G to be the direct product of the two copies of H and H, and D to be the maximal subgroup given by the diagonal of G, and omega to be the coset of D in G. Let's denote the Let's denote the coset D1X with the class 1x. The group G I described is a primitive group one omega, that is of diagonal type, monolithic of degree, the order of age. This condition on centralizer completely characterizes a set of Bs. To be precise, The abyss. To be precisely, if we have an R element inside the H minus one, the set B given the sequence of elements B given by one one, one S1 up to one SR is an irreducible basis for G if and only if the intersection of centralizer strictly descend and the intersection of odd centralizer of Si in H is the identity. This is not difficult to observe. This is not difficult to observe, and we will see why. If we have a pair X1 and X2 inside B that should fix each point of B, then in particular, such pairs should stabilize the class 1-1. And this means that the two points of the pair should be equal, and we call them X. Well, XX should stabilize. And XX should stabilize one Si. This means simply that X is contained in the centralizer of Si in H. To be redundant B, we have the following property. The stabilizer of the point one one, one Si one up to one Si should properly contain the stabilizer of the point from one one to one Si plus one. To 1 s i plus 1. And this simply means that when I add the elements as i plus 1, the intersection of the centralizer should be properly decreasing. So if and only if the first condition holds. And this is base if and only if there is no element centralizing all DSI. So if and only if the second condition holds. Thanks to such an equivalence. An equivalence and to the fact that for every person of element of H that is not that are not the identity, either the centralizer of H in H of S is equal to the centralizer of H of T in H, sorry, or their centralized intersects really. And moreover, there are none other simple groups with this property. Thanks to such a result, we showed that We showed that the group I mentioned you above is indeed an Ibis group and this base is equal to three. And moreover, there are no other EBIS group of diagonal type. Moreover, we discovered that there are no ABIS groups in the class of product type group, nor in the class of twisted product type group. So if G is a primitive permutation group, then I Permutation group, then either the group G is of a fine type, or the group G is of almost simple type, or the group G belongs to the unique family of diagonal type EBIS group that I showed with you before. And in particular, with this result, we reduced the problem of classified primitive E-Bis group to the affine type and almost simple case. And I want to mention that even there are a lot of results concerning base sides of almost simple case, for me to prove that to classify all the almost simple group that are in EBIs appears not so easy. And I show you an example to motivate my impression. There are some There are some groups that one can call almost simple, almost HB groups. And I recall to you, I recall that the size of the longest possible irreducible irreducible basis of G is denoted with I of G, and that G is an Ebis group if and only if the base size of G is equal to the I is equal to I G. Ig. Nick Gill, the ankle dipole speaker, studied the such invariant Ig for primitive groups. In particular, 1G is sp 2m to the df on the coset of the maximal subgroup GO plus or minus 1, plus or minus 2m to the df. Then they gave an upper bound for Ig, that is Ig less or equal than 2m plus 1. What we notice is that this upper bound is indeed an equality. And since base size of such group is equal to 2 to dm, what we get is that sp to the dm to the df on the coset of its maximal subgroup, geoplaster mass, is near to be this, but it is not. Okay, and I want to finish with an example that An example that is quite easy. Let's consider the projective general linear group PGLDQ on omega, be the set of case spaces of its natural module. Then this group is an homocious group if and only if either G is equal to PGL to Q with the Q at least bigger than 3 or G is a PGL G to with the T at least three and the bot group acts on omega the set of one species and this result can be proved by using the result of Veronica Kese Colberone Dagal very a very recent result that provides a lower and an underestimation of Ig where G is PGLDQ on crease basis in terms of the In terms of the dimension B and the dimension of the case spaces, so A, and using the bound on base sides, which were already known. So the base sides on case spaces is equal to D plus one minus delta Q2. The Bay sides for G acting on two spaces is bounded above by the ceiling of. By the ceiling of d alpha plus two, or is equal to five when the dimension of the group is equal to four. And finally, the result of velocity became Marotti when k is at least three. And I believe that this is a good moment to stop. Thank you for the attention. Thank you very much, Maria Pia. Thank you.
