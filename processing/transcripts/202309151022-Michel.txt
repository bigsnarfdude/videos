Sticking with us all the way to the end. So I'm Jonathan Michael. I'm currently a postdoctoral research associate working in the group of Professor Munio Duss at the Rochester Institute of Technology. And so today I'd like to tell you about the importance of spatial and material heterogeneity and nonlinearity in the mechanics of articular cartilage. But before I get into my remarks, I just want to thank the organizers of this conference. The organizers of this conference, David, Lamita, Paul, Fred, and Liana, and all the participants for Frost in a really lively exchange this week and for Frost in a really welcoming and collegial environment. So I've really, really enjoyed my time here this week. So I did this work with Momito, but in collaboration with a vibrant articulate cartilage research group at Cornell University. Cartilage research group at Cornell University, including E. Tai Cohen, who spoke earlier this week, and Larry Nasser, who has a really encyclopedic knowledge of particular cartilage. And so one of the things that really animates this program of research is, as Yutai mentioned, osteoarthritis. So this is a leading cause of disability that can affect people of all ages. It can either result from decades of wear and tear on the cartilage that cushions your joints or from. Joints or from acute injury. In that case, it's referred to as post-traumatic osteoarthritis. So, this is a leading cause of disability, suffering, and lost productivity. And so, we'd really like to be able to understand how to connect patient etiology to structural changes and then better inform the development of either prosthetics or regenerative medicine. So, just to So, just to reacquaint you with some of the essential players in today's story, cartilage is a very spatially heterogeneous material and it's a complicated composite material. So there's a type 2 collagen scaffold. We're going to know a little bit about type 2 collagen first thing this morning. But then this is embedded in a polyelectrolyte gel made of glycosamine glycans. So the backbone is hyaluronic acid. The backbone is hyaluronic acid, but then there are these bottle brush polymers branching off from that hyaluronic acid backbone. And so I'll be talking today about the shallow zone, the mid-zone, and the deep zone of cartilage. So the shallow zone is right near the surface of the joint, where two cartilage plates come together. And so then you progress from the shallow to the deep zone as you head towards the bone. The bone to which the cartilage is attached. And so it's been found that generally the concentration of these constituents increases with increasing depth in the tissue. So I fit into this group as a modeler. Now, of course, we've had numerous eminent experts talk this week about rigidity percolation, but just to kind of But just to kind of acquaint you with some of the basic features of our model, we suppose our collagen scaffold mesh size is the order of 100 microns. So we can think of this as merely the thermal scaffold where the important thing for the elasticity is going to be the work done to bend and stretch the components of this network. So we're supposing that there's some bending stiffness, kappa. Stiffness kappa, stretching stiffness alpha. So here I'm expanding this energy just to leading order, the displacement of the vertices in this network. But in the later part of this talk, I'll be looking at nonlinear effects where we'll not be using that approximation. So here, because we're supposing that a vertex in our network is where two A vertex in our network is where two strands of collagen are chemically cross-linked. We're using the Kagome lattice, which has a connectivity of 4. So I mentioned that cartilage has a variable concentration of its components. And so our proxy for concentration here is going to be a bond occupation probability. So you can randomly pair away a certain Randomly pair away a certain fraction of the connections in one of these networks to tune the stiffness of this collagen scaffold. And so we can vary this between 0 and 1 to go from an empty lattice to a fully connected lattice with a coordination number of 4. And so if you shear one of these lattices, it's well established. Oh, Frank. Yeah, that's a quick question about. Yeah, that's just a quick question about derpane concentration. So in the experiments I'm familiar with, the connectivity of collagen is observed to vary essentially, not at all, or very weakly with concentration. Another way to get concentration in a model like this is just to to change the mess cells, right? Sure. Effectively they have to be the same model mathematically. So So how much should we think that the actual coordination truly varies? That's an interesting question. One of the things that's been explained to me by my experimental colleagues is that this is a somewhat optically dense tissue, so I'm not sure anybody's gone through and measured what the coordination number is in a Number is in a cartilage explant. So I'm talking about highly simplified systems. People have studied that, as you say, very carefully in vitro reconstituted systems. So people have also looked at things like a Mikado model where you might have a little bit more freedom to tune coordination number and concentration more independently. And concentration more independently of one another. So I think that could be an interesting alternative approach, but I haven't explicitly looked into that for what I'm going to tell you today. But a perfectly fair question. So for the model that I have studied for the present, for the case of a homogeneously diluted pugome lattice, there is a pretty Gome lattice, there is a pretty well-established rigidity percolation transition when you have both stretching and bending, which occurs when the bond occupation probability is 0.6. As you get in simulations, one commonly observes this many decade abrupt increase in the shear modulus of the tissue. So, this is, as we've heard earlier this week, kind of a mechanical phase transition. So, here, rather than strain control, this is just Than strain control. This is just bind occupation probability control. Now, what I've shown you to this point has involved homogeneous dilution of the network, but as we've heard throughout the week, there can be kind of constituent level fluctuations in a tissue. So this is an example of some artificial nature. Artificial nasal cartilage constructs. So these are grown in lab. A virtue here is that you can watch the tissue develop over time. So there's a blue stain, which is showing you collagen as well as cells embedded within the cartilage concern called chondrocytes, which are responsible, as Utai described earlier this week, for helping to construct the extracellular matrix. The extracellular matrix that makes up tissue. And then in red, you're seeing proteoglycans. So, something that you can notice here is that as this tissue grows, it isn't perfectly uniform at the microscale. There's this kind of constituent level fluctuation in the concentrations of the components of this tissue. And so we'd like to now kind of look into whether this local fluctuation. Local fluctuation in concentration has some important implications for the bulk elasticity of one of these tissues. So, actually, to enable this inquiry, we benefited from some work overseen by a couple of the participants at this conference, John McMill and Manuela Delgado. So their movement had a nice model for A model for rigidity percolation in colloidal gels, which Manuel I told you some about last night. So basically, in that model, colloids were laid down on sites in triangular lattice, and the likelihood that a particular lattice site would be filled was contingent on the number of adjacent sites already occupied. So we're using a similar notion here. So, we're using a similar notion here, but we consider two bonds in a network to be neighbors if those two bonds share a vertex in the network. So you can see here a candidate bond indicated in red, and then its neighbor bonds highlighted in blue. And so we include a bond with probability one minus some correlation strength, C, to the power of six, which is the maximum number of nearest neighbor bonds. Maximum number of nearest neighbor bombs you can have in a couple of magnetis minus the currently present number of nearest neighbors. So, what this procedure is going to do is give us essentially a richer effect. Now, I'll also say when we have this correlated construction, then I think it's not quite helpful, as helpful to use the term find occupation probability because. Bond occupation probability because now the likelihood of inclusion of nearby bonds are correlated, and so I'm going to use a slightly heterodox nomenclature and talk about a bond portion. So we're going to vary a bond portion from 0 to 1. And so then we'll talk about the likelihood maybe of keeping a certain ensemble of bobbins. So here I'm kind of showing you a phase space where in the horizontal Space where, in the horizontal direction, you see the result of increasing the overall portion of bonds which are retained. And then on the vertical axis, you see the result of increasing the correlation strength. So for a given number of binds retained, a higher correlation strength gives you patchy clumps interspersed with comparatively sparse regions. So then, of course, we want to actually pull out in simulations what the elastic moduli of these networks are. So, we're going to pin the bottom vertices, apply small shear to the top vertices, we're going to impose periodic boundary conditions across the left and right edges of these networks, and then subject to those constraints, we're going to relax this network to a minimum energy configuration. To do a minimum energy configuration. And so then from that, from the residual strain energy, after we do that, we can infer a shear modulus for these networks. So, of course, this is the result when correlation strength is zero. That's the limiting case, homogeneous dilution. It's already well studied. So now, as I increase the correlation strength, you see this reduction. You see this rigidity percolation starts to occur at a slightly lower portion of bonds. And for a while, this effect continues. So lowering the, rather raising the correlation strength, continues to lower the rigidity percolation threshold until we get to this optimal value of about C equals 0.6. And then what we find is that if we get Jordan. If we is the lower level of the normalization of those, is that just that by your threshold for your relaxation? I would say that's essentially algorithmic and machine error. It's 10 to the minus 21. It's possible if I worked at a slightly higher numerical precision, that threshold would be lower still. But yeah, I think essentially that's where we're running into just machine. Where we're running it just a machine and algorithmic error for this relaxation procedure. But yeah. So then what we see, if you look at this final curve corresponding to a correlation strength of 0.8, is that this effect actually appears to have reversed somewhat. So you can see that clearly with this heat map. So once again, on the horizontal axis. Once again, on the horizontal axis, I'm showing you the portion of bonds retained. On the vertical axis, I'm showing you the correlation strength. And then this color map corresponds to the shear modulus in luminized simulation units. And so you can see that there is this contour of incipient rigidity here, which varies non-monatonically with the correlation strength. Now, Now, of course, find this to be the particularly interesting portion of the phase space. So, first of all, as has been noted in multiple talks this week, you can fit a power law to each of these different cases for each correlation strength. The power law is a little different for each particular correlation strength. For each particular correlation strength, as I'll discuss shortly, but we get a nice multi-decade fit in every case. So here I'm showing you a scaling with respect to the excess bond portion above the minimum required for rigidity percolation. And so a striking feature that we see is that this scaling exponent for this power law varies. Law varies once again non-monotonically with the correlation strength, as does the rigidity percolation threshold. But it exhibits the opposite trend. So the lower the rigidity percolation threshold, the larger the scaling exponent at the transition with respect to the excess portion of bonds retained. So this suggests that not merely does this optimal correlation Does this optimal correlation strength give you perrelation with the least material used? But as you continue to add material, you get more bang for your buck, if you like. Jonathan, does this depend on system size? Ah, so what I'm showing you here are initially data for a network with about 200,000 bombs. We've looked at this up to a network with 2 million bonds, and we've seen substantially similar behavior. I'm going to argue. I'm going to argue later in this talk for a characteristic mechanical length scale in these systems, which is more than an order of magnitude less than the system size. So I feel fairly confident in saying this is a bulk effect, but see in five minutes if I'm really persuaded with that. George. Is there any reason not to use periodic boundary conditions? So I've done so in the left-right direction, but then I have kind of pin boundary conditions. Then I have kind of pin boundary conditions at the top and bottom. You could also have them at the top and bottom. I suppose we could have done that. I don't know. I did a rotation through an experimental lab in grad school, so maybe I'm just still thinking about universal testing machines. But yes, I think that would be another way to help defeat some possible finite size effects. So. Lee's Edward Thunder could be. Yes. Lisa's founder condition. Yes. Yes. Yes. So yes, that's the proper technical nomenclature. I've used Lisa with boundary conditions here. Okay. So so far I've given you, if you like, kind of the in-silico phenomenology of this system, but you'd also like to have some micro-mechanical insight as to why we're seeing these effects. So I'm going to go back to a matter that was discussed earlier this week, namely non-affine rearrangements. Non-affine rearrangements. So I know we have some experts in the audience, but just so everybody's on the same page, you know what I mean. The Lees-Edwards boundary conditions, which I've imposed here, would imply nominally kind of a simple linear transformation that would describe the mapping from the initial to the final location of each vertex in the network. However, as has been well documented, many semi-flexible polymer networks undergo significant non-F. Undergo significant non-affine rearrangements. So I'm showing you kind of an affinely deformed network in blue overlaid with an example of a non-affinely deformed network in red. So we define the local non-affine displacement at each vertex as the actual displacement in the relaxed state minus the affine result. And then one customarily defined a non-affine parameter as the mean square magnitude of this non-affine component. Of this non-affine component of displacement, normalized by the square of the applied strain and the square of the resting length of a bond in this network. And as has been noted previously, we see a peak in the non-affine parameter, which corresponds with the point of rigidity percolation in this network. So you can see this peak shifts with the percolation threshold as we vary. Perturbation threshold as we vary the correlation strength. But interestingly, this peak becomes lower and broader as we decrease the correlation strength. And this trend actually persists monotonically with increasing correlation strength. So it would seem as though there's less overall non-affine rearrangement in the most extreme case, but it takes longer. It takes longer for non-affine displacements to completely decay as you increase the correlation strength used to construct these networks. So to get some further insight into this, we also quantified the two-point correlator between non-Fi displacements at different points in the network. So I'm averaging over orientations and normalizing this by the mean squared magnitude. This is by the mean squared magnitude of non-Fi displacements throughout the entire network. So I'm showing you some examples of what this looks like for a correlation strength of 0.6 with variable bond portion. We see substantially similar behavior for other correlation strengths. And what we consistently find is that these curves beautifully fit the exponential decay model. And they don't decay to zero, they decay to some usually some non-zero quato, which actually Which actually depends upon the proportion of bonds which end. So symbols are data from simulations, lines are fits which go right through those symbols. And so from this exponential fit, we infer from the decay length a characteristic mechanical length scale in these networks. And we see that at first, this correlation length, a non-affine displacement. Length in non-affide displacements is heavily stratified according to the correlation strength used to build the network. And then these curves collapse, and this characteristic decay length diverges towards the system size as the bond portion is increased. So, what I found particularly illuminating was to look at the characteristic mechanical length scale. Mechanical length scale at the point of rigidity percolation. So, what we find is that this quantity exhibits a parallel-like divergence as we increase the correlation strength. So, as I mentioned before, this is actually a monotonic trend. This characteristic mechanical length scale seems to grow the larger that we make the correlation strength. So, you can see for the largest correlation strength we've considered, this mechanical length scale is about 25. Mechanical length scale is about 25. For the smallest networks that we consider, the overall system size is about 330 by 330. And then we made it even three times larger in each direction. So I think there's a suitable separation of scales here to make a case that this is actually a bulk effect that they're seeing. And finally, what I think is a really compelling observation is that the rigidity percolation threshold varies non-monotonically with this critical. With this critical non-affine correlation length, and in a manner reminiscent of the way that the percolation threshold varies with the correlation strength. So I think I would say the intuitive picture that I have is that initially the correlation, increasing the correlation used to construct these networks gives you large clusters that can correlate mechanics over a large length scale and lead to. And lead to a more efficient distribution of forces across the system. But eventually, you saw that there were these sparse regions between the dense clusters. And so I think as these dense clusters become too large, they become too poorly tethered to one another to allow macroscopic force transmission. So then you get these islands of stiff regions interspersed with very soft compliance. With very soft compliant regions. And so you eventually get too much of a good thing. So then I would just make the note, I think we've shown here that it's important, even if you want to understand the bulk properties, to be mindful of the kind of microscopic structural details of your system. And if I piqued your interest here, this work is now out and it was published at the end of last year in Physical Reviews Research. Now, I want to, I know I'm a little pressed for time, so I want to kind of get into the second phase of today's remarks. So, Itai showed you some of this a couple of days ago, but now if we go outside of the linear response regime, one of his former students, Mark Buckley, who's now just the road for me, as a professor at the University of Rochester, found that under large uniaxial compression, he could greatly reduce. He could greatly reduce the shear modulus of articular cartilage. And then, as he increased the applied shear strain, he could see this shear stiffening effect. You see in panel A of this figure. And so, of course, these effects aren't fully captured by what I've told you so far. So now the challenge that ETI posed to me was, can you add some additional bells and whistles to this model to address what happens at a large number? To address what happens under large deformations. So, to begin with, as I mentioned, I initially had kind of a leading-order expansion of that stretching and bending energy with respect to the components of the displacement field. So, here I'm now kind of relaxing that assumption. So I have kind of the full form of these stretching and angle constraints. So, bonds want to be a certain length, and adjacent collinear bonds want to have a certain angle relative to what they're doing. To have a certain angle relative to one another. I've also added some hinges to permit this network to buckle if it's subjected to excessive compression. And so this allows us now to exhibit nonlinear effects in the elastic response of the collagen scaffold in particular. But there's another wrinkle to this story because, as I mentioned, collagen is embedded in glycosaminoglycan. And glycosaminoglycan, polyolectalide gel. So, as Omar has been reminding us throughout the week, you have to take account of the charges. This is the best slide of the whole week. Thank you. My pleasure. My pleasure. So, this matter has been investigated previously in experiments. So, it turns out if you punch out an explant of articular cartilage and you bathe it in a myovalic cell bath with varying content. Alex cell path with varying concentrations, you can gradually lower shear modulus of this tissue, ultimately reducing it by about a half. So you can see there is a reduction in shear modulus of hundreds of kilopascals that results from bathing this tissue in a salt bath. So eventually, threaten. Is it a reversible effect? In other words, or is it degrading something? So my understanding is: the kept flowing. You know, the kept flowing thing, they're neutralizing charges in the polyelectrolyte gel. It might be that if you wash it in another buffer, you could reverse this. I'm not aware of whether they tried that or not. But I don't think, sorry, I'm not sure if anything was destroyed by this process or if you washed out the salt, you could see recovery. Yeah, that'd be very interesting. Was it also be swelled? Yes, I think that's my understanding. I guess it was. Scanning A is possible change. So the polymer mass is going up, but the modules is going down. Yes. Polymer density. Yes, which is an initially slightly counterintuitive result. And so I'll talk about why we think that is momentarily. Yeah, that is a very interesting point. It could also be relieving some pre-stress, but as well. I completely agree with that. And so we're proposing this model. We're proposing this model. I'm aware that actually Paul and Vivek Chaneli are a nice PNS paper from last year that uses a similar model to describe the elasticity of co-savinoglycan hydrogel. But we have one term which gives us kind of an entropic hyperelastic free energy density. So here I'm building up the free energy density in terms of a deformation gradient tensor. Essentially, there's just a Jacobian free energy density. Get the Jacobian for the transformation from initial to the final deformed configuration of the gel. And so then I'm also adding a dilatational term that gives us an osmotic pressure in this gel, describing the impetus to draw solvent into the gel to dilute those uncompensated ions. Ions. And so, indeed, this is going to exert a dilutational pressure on the network, which is going to swell the material and exert post-stress on the collagen. And so we think that's an essential part of understanding why in Mark's experiments he saw initial softening of the gel under EV axial compression. So, this is my one glory-man-slide-give talk, but basically, in what follows, we're going to be minimal. And what follows, we're going to be minimizing this free energy density, which is going to be a combination of the energy of deformation of the glycosaminoglycan polyelectrolytes, and then the energy associated with stretching and bending the collagen scaffold immersed in that polyelectrolyte. So to do this, I'm going to couple a discrete model for the network with a finite element mesh for the Mesh for the glycosaminoglycan elastic dynamics. So the vertices of our discrete network are a proper subset of the vertices of this finite element mesh. So we're going to once again impose these network boundary conditions on this material. So we'll let it first swell such that elastic stresses balance with osmotic stresses and then impose compression and shear. Impose compression and shear. So, this is a method I first learned in a wonderful soft matter short course in March meeting delivered by Robin Stellinger. But basically, for the elastodynamics of the continuum phase, we can, from the initial and final positions of the vertices of a simplistical mesh element, you can define a local, not a global, but rather local FI transformation. The upper 2x2 portion of this is going to give us our definition. Of this is going to give us our deformation radio tensor. And so then, by grueling application of the chain rule, you can pull out the effect of restoring forces on the vertices of each simplicial measure unit. So then, as I described before, we'll swell the network until elastic and osmotic forces balance. We'll then apply uniaxial compression and shear. And by applying multiple shear steps for a fixed compression, we For a fixed compression, we can then numerically estimate the curvature of the free energy with respect to the shear strain to get a differential shear modulus, like Fred talked about earlier this week. And so when we do this, we can at least qualitatively recapitulate some of that phenomenology that I showed you earlier. So the blue curve shows what happens when we apply no pre-compression in a small shear. The orange curve shows what happens when we apply a large. Happens when we apply a large compression followed by a small shear. And then the green curve shows that if we apply a large compression followed by a large shear, we can see a partial recovery of the storage modulus of this tissue. So what I've talked to you about today is all been in two dimensions. We have some future plans to couple this to couple a three-dimensional discrete network to a three-dimensional simplicial element mesh. Element mesh. So that's something I've been working on building, but that story isn't quite ready yet. So I realize that I'm running up against the end of my time. So I just want to thank all the mentors and colleagues who have provided me with intellectual and emotional support during my time as postdoc, Omitis Group, my mentors in the Cartilage Project, Itai and Larry, my mentors on the DemRiff Project, which is currently open. My salary is. Is currently open in my salary. This is also going to be very stimulating experience. And of course, for all of you. So I'll just leave you with my argument that this practical model can recapitulate a lot of the phenomenology observed in nonlinear particular cartilage mechanics. And with that, we'll take any less questions. The suppression of criticality when you put in the correlation. When you put in the correlations, it's kind of interesting. I mean, sort of surprising. But that would also suggest that the system would give an analytic result, which I would distinguish slightly from D field. But your exponents were still looking non-neat field. We're still looking non-defield. So that's a little part that surprised me, though. Which is certainly the first part where we just had a bare collagen network. Now, in this case, that is an interesting matter. I'm not sure if there's a clean way to disentangle those two things once those two phases are integrally interacting with one another. As long as you have enough of a Enough of a background gel to percolate. You can never exactly make this material have a zero shear modulus. So I'm not sure if we could come up with a model that would show sort of a suppressed critical transition. I haven't. Well, your peak was going down, so it certainly looks like it. And actually, just one more question. By the time you get to these larger correlations, 0.7, whatever, what is the net? What does the network look like? Do you have a picture of that? Okay, so the first part of the chat. One of your pictures you showed before. Yes, yes. So I think at the most extreme case, I'm showing you, I think, a correlation strength of 0.8. So that's this column here. Okay. Yeah, thanks. I was wondering about the counter ions in the collagen experiment. So salt concentration. Well, iron salt concentration. So, when you add more salt, what was the terminology? Was it swelling or shrinking? So, I believe it's shrinking and it's Shear modulus is yeah. So, in that paper, I think they modeled that using like a processing Boltzmann equation, kind of did a bi-humble approximation. And so they actually got pretty nice. Electrostatic, the forces are electrostatic. Yes. Yeah, that makes sense. Because how does those molarity? How does those molarity, or how does osmotic pressure come in? I guess my picture is that as those ions are, okay. Sort of a confusing topic. Yes, yes. No, I appreciate your point. I'll grant you, my model at the present is still slightly phenomenological. I'm not doing a detailed electrochemical calculation for my works. Electrochemical calculation for my work. So it might be there's a there's a better way of of trying to I think you're a good company. I've been asking all sorts of theorists and nobody will get into that. So I pressure in the charged gels. Your colleague Rubenstein should be the one to talk to about what does me alone. Okay, well that's what he says to everyone at the end right now. Good question. Yeah. Good question. I'm not satisfied that I fully understand that point. Yeah, my understanding of that point is that there's this, we went through this with some single molecule measurements, so I think it's relevant here is that the number of excess count, you define this excess counter ion number that's salt dependent. And when the total salt concentration is low, it turns out the excess counter ion is high because of condensation effects. So that means there's a relatively high osmotic pressure. But when you go to high-pressure, Osmotic pressure. But when you go to high salt concentration, the screening means the excess counter ion becomes low and there's no osmotic pressure. And just like you said, it deswells and there's not a gradient. And that's sort of the right way to look at it, is more from a condensation point of view. Debye-Huckel alone doesn't give you condensation, and so it doesn't give you anything. In Debye-Huckel, there's no excess counter ion because remember, it's linear, so you get the same number of extra positive ions. Number of extra positive ions as you deplete negative ions, so this osmotic pressure is the same. So you have to go to like second order and talk about kind of manic condensation effects, and that's, I think, the better way to look at it. But Michael doesn't say that, but I don't know, right? I think you're right. This is what I learned from Phil, basically. The osmotic activity of the child dr ions is not 100%. Yeah. So that's to show the balance here. This is also true. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to the three speakers this morning, and thank you for the organizer for this very nice program.
