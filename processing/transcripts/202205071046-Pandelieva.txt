Academic communications. I didn't provide here the references, but if you're interested I can share the references. So high quality students need challenges so that they don't turn their active minds away from mathematics and toward endeavors that find more peak. It's extremely important to start challenging them at early age, well before students reach high school, even middle school, because in this respect Because in this respect the mathematical talent is similar to musical or kind of learning second language, so it has to be targeted early. Although special care is usually assigned to lower ability students, there is almost no attention paid to mathematically talented students in schools. And there is actually this is a very strong statement that is from the US. Segment that is from the US. The student most neglected in terms of realizing full potential is the gifted student of mathematics. I wish you could prove me wrong, but from my observation, that's what it is. With few exceptions, like not claiming that it's everywhere. There are definitely clusters of good schools, there are clusters of enthusiastic teachers which make room for these kinds of students, but that's the obvious. These kinds of students, but that's the overall situation. These students are not requiring additional attention, so why bother? There are other ones that require attention that have to be dragged to kind of keep up with the cohort. And usually these are the ones that absorb all teachers and educational systems resources, which on one side is necessary, but it's not what serves best these students. What serves best these students that potentially are supposed to be the potential of the nation to bring it to the next level in the future years. Just a little bit of education, like structurally and organizationally, in Ontario, the gifted math education, there is no such category. So there is So there is kind of mainstream, there is students with special education needs. So there is special education, which is kind of a domain program. Under the special education, there are all different kinds of students that require individual learning plans. So this includes all people with disabilities, physical, intellectual, all different kinds of disorders like attention deficit disorders or dyslexia. Deficit disorders or dyslexia or something like that. And gifted education is just one aspect of this. When in budgets there is funds for that, there is funds for special education. And these funds are distributed across all of this. Within the only category of gifted education, there are eight different categories of intellectual giftedness, which is including like kingdomic, linguistic, leadership, and there is only one which is kind of And there is only one which is kind of logical giftedness, something like that, where the mathematically promising students potentially belong. And you can recognize how little it is and how deeply into the structure it is, which explains why the sources and why attention is not paid that much in the system. Several minutes. Gifted students need little teacher support. So when I'm saying here gifted students, it's more like mathematically promising students, not all the categories of gifted students. I don't mind sharing this afternoon with everyone if you'd like so. Mathematics competitions alone cater for the needs of mathematically gifted students. Additional exercises or activities for fast finishers cater for the needs of mathematically gifted students. Students. Gifted students do not need opportunities to work with other gifted students. There are insufficient funds and time to dedicate to the education of mathematically gifted students. In fact, gifted students need little support on routine tasks, but to maximize their learning and their kind of development, they need support and guidance on challenging tasks and careful guidance and support. Guidance and support. The other one, while the competitions are very important part of that, the competitions only do not necessarily serve it. It's more important all the process of preparing for competitions and expanding until you get ready for the competition that makes a difference. If there are more tasks of the same type, it's just mindless busy work. It doesn't do the job. It doesn't do the job. And that's what normally happens in the classrooms. Usually, these fast finishers are assigned to help the students that are not fast achievers or just do more of the same workshop. This one is really important. So if the students are kind of the old birds in the of the flock, sometimes they are considered nerds, they are not the most popular. They are not the most popular of their group. So, in order to develop, in order to be not discouraged to kind of develop their talent, they need like-minded students, which they don't necessarily see in their school, in their classroom. So, they need some opportunities to communicate with people of the same mindset in order to be able to kind of push themselves and have their own learning environment. Environment. This one is, yeah. Yes, of course, there are not enough resources, but in terms of investment, one example here in this is, I'm sorry, I hope I don't kind of take too much time of it, but I really feel it's important to know what we are dealing with. When we set our goals and when we kind of decide where we want to go, we have. Decide where we want to go, we have to be realistic that we are facing all these challenges against us. That even the very little steps that we can make are making a big difference because we can't do much more than that. So a couple of years ago, probably in 2007, Ontario changed the Gandhar curriculum and the only really serious math course that used to Math course that used to be in the curriculum to 2007 was basically removed from the curriculum. And what was in grade 11 math was extended to two courses and one of it went to grade 12. That's why there wasn't room for the other one. And it had to go, it was eliminated from the curriculum. And we were in a meeting of professional development meetings. A meeting of professional development meeting called Map Teachers in Ottawa with a representative of the ministry, and there were people kind of strong advocates of this course. And they said, okay, why are you doing this? You are leaving kind of the highly motivated students that are pursuing career in science and mathematics and planning to go to university. They're not going to get this course in high school. They have to pay for a pre-university course to get this knowledge or they won't be prepared for the university. Been prepared for the university. And the ministry's response was: these are only 7% of the students' population that is interested in this course, all kind of on a yearly basis. On the other side, we have 33% dropouts, and they drop out because they can't pass three-math courses, because grade 11 courses are very strong, and they can't go through grade 11, so they can't graduate from high school. From high school, and we made a promise to our political kind of agenda that we have to increase the graduation rate. So, for that, we have to take care of this 32%, expand so that they can graduate from grade 11. Who cares about your 7%? That wasn't exactly like this, but that was it. So, that's explaining why the last bullet is also there. And we can't do much about it because people who make decisions about curriculums are usually politicians, they are not. Curriculums are usually politicians, they are not scientists, they are not even educators, and they don't necessarily consider all the pictures. So, the next slide is something that talks about teachers and talks about when we yesterday we already recognized that there is something to be done about teachers so that they can get more involved, so that they can get more helpful and supporting their students in kind of dealing more and trying. Dealing more trying more math contests. And here is something about challenges that teachers face. So they are basically, in an ideal world, they are expected to have a very big role and particularly they are supposed to select tasks that are appropriately challenging. Do all this proactively and consistently support for students. For students, so that they can basically unfold their cognitive abilities, not being directed, not being taught, but not being left to develop their own kind of admin. Anyway, so that's something that is quite demanding and you really need to know how to guide them to do that. They're supposed to facilitate cognitive apprenticeship through effective collaborative. Through effective collaborative student-teacher interactions, monitoring, responding, thinking, kind of trying to predict what the misconceptions are and trying to carefully fix these misconceptions or kind of explain why they are. And not the least, they have to deal with issues and problems that arise from the specific psychological and intellectual profile of these students. Sometimes these students are yet talented in mathematics, they are not easy to create. They are not easy to communicate with or to guide. And this one is also important. They have to be inspirational and they have to be able to pass their love and admiration of mathematics to their students in order to encourage them. And again, I wish you could prove me wrong, but I don't know many teachers that can do that. And not only Not only they can't do that, they're not interested to improve themselves in this direction because they haven't seen the value of it, most likely. I don't know. Again, I'm not talking about the few exceptions that exist, luckily. So again, I'm going to give you one example which was really shocking for me when I learned about it. So in Ontario, I don't. In Ontario, I don't know maybe that's the case across Canada. Up to grade eight, mathematics is taught by generous teachers. It's not, usually these are not people that have math degree. They have some degree and they have teacher's college, they have some mathematical education training while in the teacher's college. Mathematical education training, yet it focuses on pedagogical and psychological aspect. It doesn't necessarily focus on the strong mathematical Strong mathematical content, subject knowledge. And that's the problem. And usually, these teachers that teach up to grade eight are in this career path because most likely they have terrible experiences, students in mathematics. If they liked mathematics, they probably would have been in a science career. They like interactions with students and that's their strength, which is a very valuable strength for especially for younger students. But Especially for younger students. But in terms of them being tasked to teach mathematics and do all these little things about maths, the only maths talented students in their class, it's too much. They don't get enough support from the teachers' colleges. Even now, the teachers' colleges have some math education courses. I would be interested to know how many university teachers programs offer math competitive math or math enrichment courses for their Or math enrichment courses for their regular cohorts of teachers. There is a professor emeritus from Queen's University. Her name is Linda Kolga. She specialized in teaching future elementary teachers in mathematics. So she was a mathematics elementary teaching professor at the university. And she had several. And she had several publications where she talks about every year when she starts a course, she does a survey to her students to share their students' experience in mathematics. And most of them who were, I barely passed my grade 10 course, I hated mathematics, I didn't understand anything. I still hate mathematics. I get panic attack when I have to do tests, something like that. These are the future math teachers of students. The future maths teachers of students up to grade 8, which explains why we have so many mixing messages when we analyze results or when we try to get the problems and we get different feedback from parents, for example. I have the references if you are interested. It's going to be kind of not very happy about. Going to be kind of not very happy, but really interesting reading if you are interested to go into this. So more examples, but I'll just skip them because it's too much. There's another part of the picture. We have parents, and we know by experience that how the parents are involved and what role they play really depends on several factors, including their Depends on several factors, including their professional educational background. If they are strong in mathematics and they know the value, they probably will push their children to do this. Depends on their own school experience. Depends on how realistic their information is about the achievement of their students. I uh have the impression that it's full, the curriculums and the tests and the reporting is And the reporting is said that until probably grade 9, parents don't know how little their students know in mathematics because they get their perfect scores in tests, they get like brilliant report cards, they get their marks above 50, about 85%, and parents say, well, my child is great. And in grade 10, grade 11, it becomes already not possible to get this course without understanding. This course without understanding what you're doing, and this is where they say, Okay, how come he was like five years exempt in math? Now suddenly he's failing. That's why, because they don't yet realistic, and that's not their fault, it's systems' fault. Overall, socio-economic situation, of course, ability and motivation. So, even if in the ideal circumstances, parents cannot do much for students that get in teenage years. So, they can. Teenage years. So they can push them up to kind of grade four, five, six. They can't do much more because students now have their voice and they really want their own kind of freedom and their own motivation. So they have to be motivated otherwise, not just parents push. And that's basically what we have to have kind of as a model of our activities because put Because it looks like that the only choice, the only option for these mathematically promising students to get a little bit is the extracurricular activities. They're not going to get much from school except few exceptional situations here and there if they're lucky. And for us, it's not possible to fight with what the system is. So we have to do smaller steps extracurricularly and we have to try to reach as many of them as possible. Of them as possible. And another big thing is here that while there are more opportunities for students in high school, there are many universities that offer enrichment courses or some sort of outreach programs. The Mad Kangaroo is still one of the very few, if not the only one, that does these things for younger students for grade one up. Again, excluding these games that are available, that they can basically just randomly pop things or pick answers that they don't necessarily understand what you're doing, which is fun, which is kind of building, but not necessarily what we imagine is needed. And having that, it just basically takes that even if find it difficult, even if we find it hard, we have to continue. Hard, we have to continue doing it because there's not many more, and we have kind of a role to do it. This slide is going to be probably something that we have to discuss probably later in breaks or whatever. It's not one thing that we can do here for one slide. But I see basically two directions that we probably have to brainstorm and see what, if any, we want or we can. Any we want or we can do what is feasible to do at this point. One of them is to try to reach more students and not only for the contest but more for the training, for kind of these preparation things. And yesterday the ideas of having this online video clips shorter which is more kind of aligned with what the younger generation students are is excellent suggestion. We can probably think of how to make We can probably think of how to make it work and how to involve alumni, for example, to help with this. The other one is to try to see how we can reach teachers and how we can offer some professional help for teachers. There is a caveat here though. Teachers are very busy. They are extremely exhausted by doing their regular work. There is a lot of emphasis on the other end of the spectrum. They are forced to work in Forced to work in inclusive classrooms to apply like professional problem-based learnings, etc. So they are dealing with a lot of challenges. So whenever they take professional development, they really need to know what the goal is. If we offer such course and it doesn't count for their professional development credentials, they probably are not going to take this course. So if we want this to be a successful stream or kind of successful Stream or kind of successful strand of our work, we have to brainstorm and see how we can reach some professional, I don't know, like teachers' colleges or like fields institutes or whatever, I don't know, how to make it be a recognized professional development for teachers. Because otherwise, there will be probably a few enthusiasts that are on board anyway, they're going to sign. Anyway, they're going to sign anyway. Okay, so the next is going to be a set of favorite problems that throughout the years I had kind of felt for myself as my favorite problems. But this is one for you, just as a transition. And that's stolen from one of the international conferences. It was probably the German delegation drew it. Delegation through it. That's a question. What is the answer? What is the chart really? It doesn't have a text, it doesn't matter. So the text is we don't know. There is something about the number n. But the answers and the fact that the mad kangaroo is a multiple choice test, which, if no mistakes, means there's only one answer correctly. Answer for it. Yes. Allow us to find the answer. Oh, okay. Okay. So that's the type of problems that we would like to have occasionally. And recognizing that out of 7,000 students, probably three would be laughing and being kind of really enjoying such kind of question. Because they otherwise will say, okay, what is it? It's nonsense. Nonsense. Okay, so I think the answer is A, right? Yeah, because any other answer is not unique. Okay. So, to the point. I'm sorry, but D forty-two is divisible by six. Yes, but uh there is also another answer. So so it can't be forty two 'cause that will be both A. Then it doesn't have to be forty two. But then it doesn't have to be 42. Yeah, it could be. The only correct answer is that it's a multiple of 6, but not 42. Like, it could be any other multiple of 6. And we have no idea what question is this. Okay, well, cool. Sure. Okay, so the problems. We already heard the details about the curriculum and what is considered as appropriate topics in each age category. Overall, these These problems are not requiring advanced knowledge, like accelerated knowledge. So, students in grade 3 should be able to solve them with the knowledge of grade 3 regular curriculum. But nonetheless, the problem, most problems require other things which we would like to to reinforce and would like to develop, like creative way of using the knowledge that they already have. Because what is in regular classrooms What is in regular classrooms? You have the kind of the lesson, you have the example, you have three or four worksheets of the same example, you are counted how fast and how correct to do it, and that's it. So we'd like them to be able to recognize, oh, I know how to do it, and here I can use it in a situation where I haven't seen such a situation in class. We want them to be able to see things outside of the box. We want them to be able to. We want them to be able to go beyond the study procedures. So just a little bit of that. And also we want them to have attention to details. So especially for younger students, we know that the hardest part is to make them read what the question is. Because they are used to see a box empty and to know immediately what to put in this box, put it and forget about it. We want them to read carefully and be able to pay attention to little words that make a difference in the answers. Words that make a difference in the answers. Some problems would require a little bit of context-specific knowledge, that is at the appropriate students' level. And when it's context-specific knowledge, it's usually some topics that are even common sense topics, but students are not exposed in their math classes. So they may not recognize that that's a math problem, and they may not be kind of. Be kind of driven their attention to such kind of problems. Also, it's also the use of mathematically specific language for some questions. Sometimes they just are not used to the phrases that mathematicians use. So, this falls into this category. Here, I tried to do something that is kind of an overview of what we heard in the morning. So, these are favorite topics that you But these are favorite topics that usually could be found in any math calculated paper. And when we talk about arithmetic numbers, math calculations, it could be anything. And as you can see, this is applicable for all categories. One of my favorites is the problems with the current year. So I used to teach in a math specialized math school, and what our job was that on What our job was that on the New Year's Eve, what the teachers of mathematics in our school were doing is to factor the number of the year. So, how many of you know the factorization of 2022? No, I'm not in this, it's just two times 1011, which seems to be a prime number, but it's a useful thing because sometimes this goes into the questions and maybe not in. And maybe not in the Kangura questions per se, but in kind of Olympia questions, usually they try to draw something like this with an operator. Anyway, so I made an error when I did this. So that's another challenge that I have. And probably many of you said, okay, how come you have math degree and you miscalculated this? Okay, well, we're not a Calculated this. Well, we're not accountants, we're mathematicians. Anyway, of course, each of these topics can be expanded or can be watered down as much as the level allows and as much as we decide. And here are some examples. My examples are from prior years, so my examples are. years so my examples are up to grade probably up to 2009 2010 you might see or maybe whoever was involved for more years in the proposals that come from the KSF we can definitely see a difference of the levels of the difficulty of the questions so what used to be a normal paper a normal set of problems in 2000s or even in the 90s is considered extensive Even in the 90s, is considered extremely hard right now. And I think one of the organizations, maybe France, they did an experiment, they plugged for several years, like five years apart, they plugged the same question in the papers deliberately and they assessed to see the success level of the students on this question. So that might be an interesting thing for us to do. Like take a question that was in our papers in 2005 and then in 2010. And then in 2010, in 2015, in 2020, and see how students. No, that's too late. So, something that we can plug for later years, just to see how the generations probably would compare and what makes the difference. So, it's also a factor that we need to know. Here is one example. I don't know what would be preferable. I have the solutions as well. Be preferable. I cover the solutions as well and answers because I kind of recycled these slides from a presentation to teachers a long time ago. But I don't think it's worth for us to solve kind of see solutions. I don't know. What do you guys think? Yeah, I have the solutions as well. So, here essentially, the idea is that that's a logical problem, but that's also. Problem, but that's also an arithmetic problem, and it could be considered kind of middle difficulty for younger students, but it could be kind of a very interesting and unusual problem for grade 9-10 in the first category, for example, if you'd like to just have something there. Here is another example from 2006, and it was grade 78 EC category. Grade seven, eight is C category and grade nine, ten C category. This one comes from the old arithmetic Russian and kind of a Russian task for repeated questions. It's a tricky one. Yeah, this one is the most Yeah, the most uh probable wrong answer is D. Of course, the fact that we are dealing with a different generation of students means that we really have to tweak the language 'cause what used to be a normal language or kind of real life situation ten years ago is not applicable to students nowadays. Applicable to students nowadays. So they live in another world. Okay, so. Yes. Like the word fair. So for me looking at this problem, I would be worried about giving this to a student because the word fair is not well defined. No. I agree with you. Yeah. That's one of the challenges that we faced in early years because. Because we had to edit the questions ourselves, and all of us involved were kind of not done our schooling in English language school. And it was, so this is something that would be a flaw right now. But it's like, consider that, and that's an ideal situation which also sometimes we have to enforce to students. When you're dealing with math questions, you don't ask about things like what color is the floor or things that are not relevant. Things that are not relevant. We're kind of dealing with some sort of ideal situation that we have to learn how to ignore some factors that are not necessarily applicable to the question. So here fair means that we assume that they used all the energy equally. And the thing is that yes, two people brought their woods, but they actually used Woods, but they actually used up their woods. So Alex used five and Ben used five of their own. So what actually needs to be divided evenly, like fairly, is three to two. Here is also one thing that when we talked about the topics, like when I showed you the topics, some of these topics are Are boring mainstream school curriculum topics like proportions, ratios, percents, fractions? All of these, if you read the curriculum expectations, they are there. If you read the table of contents of the textbooks, they are there. So you get the perception, yes, students learned this, and they learned it to the level that is enough to be able to deal with contest problems. To be able to deal with contest problems or even with this kind of problems. When you read the exercises, when you look at the homework, you'll see how artificial this knowledge is and how little on the surface it is. So they barely know how to deal with fractions. Barely. The hardest examples that they get is with denominators that are probably two-digit numbers. And that's like probably three, five, and thirty, something like this. And they somehow can go through this without necessarily knowing the concepts. And what hits after is when they get to algebra, they have to use the same rules, the same concepts, and they realize that it's not that easy to guess the answer. You really have to go to the procedure. This is where this is. And even if the questions are boring for a mad kangaroo question, it's worth plugging such kind of questions and giving them some. Such kind of questions and giving them some more deeper knowledge and more challenges in these typical topics in training sessions in the kind of online whatever circles. It's worth having kind of a strong application of percent topic or enforce some calculations with fractions. You'll be surprised how little students know about the order operations. If they hear they hear for the old order operations for the first time in grade nine, if they are lucky. In grade 9, if they are lucky. Okay, some more examples. This one is attention to detail, nothing more. The arithmetic here is very simple. And this comes from the old time when Czech Republic wasn't part of the European Union, so we had their own currency. The answer is 22. Oh, sorry, I I lost track of time. Do we do I still have some minutes? So we have about 10 minutes. Okay, so this is actually the solution. This one is a question from 2006, grades 9 and 10 group A slightly modified. So here the only trick is that books are supposed to be whole numbers. And if we're talking about a third of the total, we're talking about 30% per quarter, that means that the total must be a multiple, common multiple. Total must be a multiple, common multiple, three, four, and answer from the answer status. But again, the divisibility is like properties of numbers in terms of divisibility. It's also one of the topics that has very little attention in school. They are supposed to have it probably early in grade 7. To have it probably early in grade 7 as an introduction to some addition and subtraction of fractions and finding common denominators. But they are practicing this with numbers where they basically know by experience and by heart they know the common denominators, they know the common multiples. They don't need to master the procedure and they are not exposed to situations where this really is valuable. Here is another example of the same idea. It's kind of remainder. This one I don't have a specific grade affiliation, but it could fit anywhere from grade 7, 8 up, I guess. So we're looking for a number which is seven more uh common multiple of 18, 20, 24. This is the so-called Chinese a main 3x or you can interrupt so you can discard we don't cite this reference because they are going to say, Okay, I'm done with you. I'm done with you. But again, it's something that Okay, here is another example. This is one of my favorites. I'm sorry, this is the type of question that I would have. Without you. Yeah, it's not, it's like it's only like special imagination, something like this. But it's so simple if once you see it and it's so not intuitively approachable, students will never think about it. Well, I probably have it too strong to statements. Maybe some students will. So it's to unpack. So it's to unpack these perimeters and to get it. But once they are seeing a question like that, they already have it seated as a strategy in their mind and they will try to do other questions as shortcuts with that. So here is one similar example that could fit for older grades. It uses the same idea. And here the solution is like when you expand the four ones, you get the outer perimeter, but subtract the middle one because it's kind of only three of the sides appear. Okay, so here is another one. Inclusion of exclusion that this example is good for inclusion exclusion phrasing. Yeah, could be. Yeah, could be. Yeah. Okay, here is another one from 2003. Somebody would argue, well, that's a measurement, 3D measurement. They don't learn cylindrical formulas until grade 9. They don't need to. Okay, so this one is a typical like combinatorics or logic or it could fit in some categories. Practice. It's basically an illustration of the Pitcher Hole principle. And the key word here is to be certain. So if he's lucky, he would pull out a pair of socks immediately. But in the worst case scenario, how many attempts he needs is certain that there is a pair. And here is another one which is the same idea but modified for older students to include. For older students to include divisibility. This is not a question that comes from a real paper, it's something that could be used for training. So again, it's the same idea. The answer is still 9. The idea is that we have 8 choices with respect to remainders when divided by 8. And if there are two numbers with the same remainder, the difference is going to be. Difference is going to be divisible. And I guess that's my last example. Oh, no, there is another one. So I have 25 players, 25 people. What is the probability that at least three? That at least three of these people would celebrate their work days in the same month. Yes. Yeah, because like if there are 12 months, if we assume that at most two people celebrate in the same month, we can have at most twenty four different people. The twenty fifth has to match some point. Fifth has to match some of the groups that already were there. So there's always a group of three that celebrate in one month. But if the question is formulated this way, the probability thing, usually students who think mainstream, they know probability formula is favorable outcomes versus all the outcomes. Anyway, so these are kind of variations that can be considered kind of Considered kind of suitable kind of questions that don't require necessarily extra skills, but require something that we'd like to develop. Okay, that's it. Should I stop before we start? We can continue discussing.
