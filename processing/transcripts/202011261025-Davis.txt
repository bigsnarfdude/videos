The organizers for inviting me to this conference. So, I've only recently joined Charles University, so I'm actually going to be talking about a project for my PhD that's under a bit of a different area of PDE. So, it's going to be a little bit of a different topic. So, I'm going to be looking at spectral stability of the traveling wave solutions in a Keller-Siegel model for bacterial chemotechnology. A Keller-Siegel model for bacterial chemotaxis. And I'm going to try and explain as much as I can using pictures. So that's how I like to explain. So we have our model on the left here. So this model was developed in the 70s to describe E. coli consuming a substrate in a pipette. So we have our substrate population U and our bacterial population W. And this particular model has a This particular model has a logarithmic chemosensitivity function, the derivative of which you see here. And it has been proved that that derivative does need to have a singularity in it in order for traveling waves to exist. So what's been proved in the past about existence for this model is that as long as this parameter beta is greater than 1 minus m and this value m is between 0 and 1 inclusive, traveling waves do exist. Traveling waves do exist. So, the important parameters in this model are this chemotactic parameter beta, which controls the movement of the traveling wave, and this consumption parameter M, which controls how fast the substrate is depleted. And a biological experiment showed that the substrate diffuses quite slowly. So, this value epsilon is a very small diffusion. So, from a more mathematical point of view, From a more mathematical point of view, here is the model in a moving frame. So we make the traveling wave onset z equals x minus ct, and traveling wave solutions become stationary solutions in this form. So there are two main parameter regimes for which traveling waves are known to exist for this model. If zero is less than or equal to m, which is strictly less than one, we get this situation on the left here. We get this situation on the left here where we have the bacterial population is this pulse coupled with a front that represents the substrate. And when m equals one, we get two fronts coupled together. So why did we look at this model? So this model has been variously described in the literature as stable and unstable, and there has been some success in numerically simulating it, which suggests a stability of some kind. And in particular, And in particular, this m equals one scenario has been shown to be non-linearly stable via energy functionals, which is a stronger result than spectral stability. But no such result existed for the M less than one case. So we wanted to clarify, is this stable? Is it unstable? What is meant by unstable? And what is the connection with this m equals one case? So as just a very simplified So, as just a very simplified picture, when I say what is meant by unstable, we have a tendency to say just it's stable or it's unstable. But here is just a very simple reduced picture of some types of instability, and analyzing the spectrum can point us towards what type of stability or instability is happening. So, on the left is a diagram of a perturbation, this dotted line here, and Here and it is growing with time at every spatial point, and so that is what's referred to as an absolute instability. Whereas this center picture shows that the perturbation, this dotted line, is growing in time, in norm, but is also being convected away. So, this is a convective instability. And depending on what your frame of reference is and how this is. References and how this instability is convected, this can be less of a problem. If it doesn't affect your frame of reference and it moves in a way that is not problematic, it is what's known as a transient instability and is in some way not as big of a problem as other instabilities. And the situation on the right here is a convective instability moving in two directions. So, in general, this can't be resolved and is Resolved and is often known as a remnant instability if it remains in your frame of reference. All right, so just a little bit of general setup. The standard approach to analyzing the stability of traveling waves is to linearize about the traveling wave solution. So I have my traveling wave solution u hat and w hat here, and we add a perturbation of the form e to the lambda t p of z or q of z. P of z or q of z. So time growing like e to lambda t and space growing like p of z. So we have our eigenvalue problem with our linearized operator. The thing to notice about this operator is one, it is quasi-linear. And two, even though many of the terms have what look like really nasty singularities, these are all the traveling wave where I've dropped the hat just for convenience. And so all of these terms are actually well. So, all of these terms are actually well behaved as u goes to zero. Now, the natural assumption to make about these perturbations is that they're in H1, the usual Sovolov space, where they're once weakly differentiable and in L2. And while that's the natural assumption to make, what we'll do later is kind of change that assumption in a certain way. All right, so just a little more setup. Alright, so just a little more setup. From here, I'm going to set epsilon to 0. Oh, I forgot to mention the previous slide and this slide are both the m equals 0 case. So I'm going to deal with just mainly m equals 0. The analysis is similar to the m equals 1 case. So we have our eigenvalue problem L minus lambda i. We transform it into a 1D system. We have our equivalent operator to the eigenvalue problem T of lambda. And so this is a 3 by 3 spatial matrix. A three by three spatial matrix that controls, sorry, that makes up the operator. And we're going to look for the spectrum of t of lambda. So the spectrum of the operator is quite straightforward in that it's when the operator t of lambda is not invertible. Either it doesn't exist or it's unbounded. So that's quite straightforward, but there are two main parts to Two main parts to this spectrum. So the essential spectrum comes from analyzing the asymptotic end states of this operator. So it can be thought of somewhat hand-wavingly as the perturbations arriving from the states at spatial infinity. Whereas the point spectrum, which I'm not really going to look at today, are the isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity. And they can be thought of, again, somewhat hand-wavingly as the stability of the waving lay as the stability of the full nonlinear front. All right, so what does our essential spectrum, oh sorry, also the definition of essential spectrum. So as I said, it's from the asymptotic end states of the operator. So we take the limit to plus or minus infinity spatially of the operator T of lambda. And from the matrix A of Z lambda, we get these two matrices A plus minus. So the essential So, the essential spectrum arises from the matrix eigenvalues, so different from this lambda, of these two matrices. So, either A plus and A minus are both hyperbolic, but with a different number of unstable matrix eigenvalues, matrix eigenvalues with positive real part, or if either matrix has a purely imaginary matrix eigenvalue. Eigenvalue. So the second point is actually generally how you find the essential spectrum. So if one of the matrices has a purely imaginary matrix eigenvalue, that is the dispersion relation of the matrix, that is going to bound your essential spectrum. And that is how we find the regions of essential spectrum. So what does that look like for Keller-Siegel? So here we have in blue including the full imaginary axis, the dispersion relations coming from the state at positive. Dispersion relations coming from the state at positive infinity. And in green, we have the state, the dispersion relations coming from the state at negative infinity. And as I said, these bound are essential spectrum. The shaded region is where the matrices are hyperbolic with a different number of unstable matrix eigenvalues. Now, this is where a lot of papers stop with regards to stability. So in Keller-Siegel, you can show that this shape of essential spectrum is similar across. Of a central spectrum is similar across all chemotactic parameter values beta, and all values m, including m equals one, have a similar shape to this, but crucially they all have essential spectrum in the right half plane. So they're unstable. But we don't stop here because many well-known reaction diffusion equations have this property, but are thought of in some way as stable. So for example, the Fischer-Kolmogorov-Petronov-Piskanov, the FKPP equation. The FKPP equation has essential spectrum in the right half plane, but is thought of in some way as stable. And so, why that is, is because this essential spectrum as it is now is in our function space H1. It is from our assumption that our perturbations are H1. But in both numerical and physical experiments, that's not always desirable. Oftentimes, the Oftentimes, the perturbations that are applied in, for example, a numerical experiment might have compact support or be localized in some way. So we're going to now change that assumption on those perturbations, and we do that by weighting the function space. So we take a new perturbation here, these tilde perturbations, and this is for our t of lambda, our three by three operator, and we And we multiply our original perturbation by e to the nu z. And we define our weighted H1 space by forcing e to the new Z P, in some way for Q and S, to be in H1. So what that's doing based on the sign of the new value is forcing that perturbation to decay in one direction while not worrying too much about what happens in the other direction. However, if you However, if it's required and if the signs are compatible for the two weights and you end up with a non-empty function space, you can also have a two-sided weight. And so that's what we're going to do with the Keller Siegel. We're going to take a two-sided weight and see what happens to our essential spectrum. So when we substitute our new perturbation into our operator T of lambda, you see it comes out. Lambda. You see, it comes out very similarly. The only difference here is this plus mu times the identity. So we still have our az of lambda. We're still looking for this operator to be non-invertible. So what does that do to our dispersion relations? So from here, I'm going to focus just on the state at minus infinity because that's the more complicated state. The state at plus infinity can be dealt with quite simply. Can be dealt with quite simply. So I have this image, but I am just going to switch across to because I think this makes it a lot more clear. So we have our dispersion relations in black from minus infinity. And what each frame of this animation is going to be is a different function space. So what you see is that this self-intersection of the dispersion relations is moving along this red line. Is moving along this red line for different values of ν, and then it's moving further into the right half plane. So, the two observations to make from this are that one, there is some ideal weight in which the essential spectrum in the right half plane is in some way minimized. But the other observation to make is that along this red line, it's the only value in this complex plane that is never to the right or outside of these dispersion relations. Side of these dispersion relations. So what is this red line? So what this red line is, is the absolute spectrum. And the absolute spectrum is not proper spectrum in that it doesn't arise from the definition that T of lambda is non-invertible. It's related to the essential spectrum. It's related to the essential spectrum, but it's not true spectrum in its definition. So the way I've chosen to explain the absolute spectrum here is this is a reduced version of the definition. This definition is specific to this case, just to simplify it. So for the Keller-Siegel model, in the resolvent of the essential spectrum, so far off in the right of the complex plane, the two asymptotic matrices. The two asymptotic matrices each have three matrix eigenvalues, and each of them in the resolvent has two unstable and one stable. So, unstable being positive real part. The absolute spectrum is when the second and third matrix eigenvalue have the same real part. So, by varying lambda, if they have the same real part, that's absolute spectrum. So, that's a little bit confusing. So, what So, what this image is essentially that same definition again. So, this is an image that appears in Capitula Promise Lau's book. So, this left image, take lambda to have very large real part in the resolvent of the essential spectrum. The state at minus infinity as the x, plus infinity as the dots. We have two unstable matrix eigenvalues, positive real part, and one with a negative. And one with a negative real part. So this center image shows just the matrix I invest from plus infinity, and it is in the essential spectrum. This value here has zero real parts. So specifically, this is on a dispersion relation. However, if you can take a weight such that you can restore that separation of two unstable, one stable compared to this red line. To this red line representing the weight, then this is not absolute spectrum. So the center value is essential, but not absolute spectrum. Whereas on this far right, the second and third largest real part are the same. So these two matrix eigenvalues, same real part, there is no way to restore that separation of matrix eigenvalues. So here is our special. So, here is our spectrum with our absolute spectrum added in. So, this is the same image shown before. The dotted lines are for the contributions from plus infinity, solid lines are from minus infinity. And what you can see is that if you weight this into what I call the ideally weighted function space, there still remains absolute, sorry, essential spectrum in that right half plane. So this So, this picture, which was actually for beta equals 2, is absolutely unstable. There is no way to resolve that essential spectrum. However, there is a parameter regime by reducing the chemotactic parameter where the absolute spectrum moves into that left half plane. And in the ideally weighted function space, you actually do get spectral gap. So, it's contained fully in the left-half plane. Contained fully in the left-hand plane, and the origin is not included. So, there is a spectral gap there. And so, this was a previously unknown result. And what I've included, just because it's a little bit of fun and I really like it, is we actually can explicitly find that critical chemotactic parameter. So, this is for m equals zero. After some horrible calculations, we found that it's the largest root of this horrible polynomial. This horrible polynomial here. But the crucial thing about this is this has all been for m equals zero. So beta has to be greater than one. So the only values for which the absolute spectrum is obtained in the left half plane are beta between one and 1.6, which is not desirable because the chemotactic parameter in biological experiments tends to be on the order of about 10 or 20. So those Or 20. So those are all absolutely unstable regimes. So that was our question. One question answered. When people say this is stable or unstable, what they should really be saying is it transitions from a transient instability to an absolute instability at very small values of the chemotactic parameter. So, what about the other question? What is the connection between this m equals zero k? This m equals zero case and the m equals one case. So, showing only the ideally weighted spectrum, I'm going to increase the value m, this consumption parameter. And so the contribution from plus infinity, these dotted lines, are largely unaffected. However, this state at minus infinity, as you increase m is closing in around this origin. And just as a side note, we can also explicitly find the Can also explicitly find the critical chemotactic parameter for each value m. So when you finally hit m equals one, the absolute spectrum closes on the origin, contains the origin, does not emerge into the right half plane. And so in the ideally weighted function space, there is no spectral gap. This image is similar for m equals one for all values of beta. And what was really Of beta. And what was really interesting about this one was this is the case that in the literature has been proved to be non-linearly stable. So while those results don't exist when m is less than one, this has in some ways a slightly weaker spectral result. It is marginally spectrally stable in the weighted function space. There is no spectral gap. So just as one final little bit. As one final little bit, as I'm running out of time, what happens when you turn back on epsilon? So, this is all been for epsilon is zero. So, when you turn back on epsilon, the spectrum deforms further into the left-half plane in the order one region. So kind of this circle here. The results are to leading order the same, but we can also prove that in all weighted spaces that satisfy this condition here, the The essential spectrum never emerges back into the right-half plane. And this is a very easily satisfied condition. It is nowhere near the range of weights that we are looking at for our ideally weighted function spaces. And again, this critical parameter beta exists for order epsilon. All right, so I would like to thank you all for bearing with me with my somewhat different topic. And I would And I would just like to finish up with some references. So, the first two are the papers that arose from this project, and the last five are various papers that I have referenced throughout this talk and or adapted images from. So, thank you. And yes. Thank you very much, Paige.
