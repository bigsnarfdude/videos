Um yeah, so I'm gonna um talk about some moduli status which have abelian motifs. So this is just saying that the most of the moduli status lies in some sort of category. So it sounds like not a very strong result, but actually I'm going to explain how you can use this to then produce a lot more interesting results. Okay, so and actually all of the mortalized spaces that I'm going to talk about are going to be mortalized based on bundles or something more. So let me just give the plan. So first I'm going to talk about But first, I'm going to talk about the bubble modelized spaces that I'm interested in. And then after that, I'm going to talk about cohomology of these moduli spaces. So what's known. Then I'm going to spend some time talking about motives. And then I'm going to move on to talk about motives of these modulated spaces. And this last part is mostly joint with Simone, Pepper and Nailla, but also some parts it will be with Lizu. I'll try and explain this to go along. So yeah, let's get started on modernized spaces that we're interested in. And these are all going to be modulated spaces of vector bundles or some sort of bundles on a curve. So let's just fix the notation. So let C be a smooth, projective, geometrically connected curve over a field K. And maybe I should say of genus G. And so if we don't interest in vector bundles of C, then they're just classified topologically by their rank and degree. And these are the discrete invariants. So I'm going to fix these throughout. So the rank, which is going to be a natural number, and then the degree, which is an integer. So let me just draw a quick diagram of the modified space that I'm interested in. So, actually, secretly, I would like to draw a three-dimensional diagram, but we'll just do a 2D one, and I'll tell you, like, about the third dimension. So, first of all, we'll start off with the vector bundle modulate. And then you can sort of look at it on different levels. So, you can first look at the stack of all bundles. All bundles. And I'm going to write this one. And when I say all, I mean all of the fixed rank and degree. Then this is quite a large thing. So inside there, you can look at the ones which are semi-stable. So this is the stack of semi-stables. And this is an open And this is an open insight here. In fact, it's the first stratum in these quadrantarites and specifications. Let me just say what stable is because I know I've all got different backgrounds. Maybe it makes sense to say what stable means here. So here, yeah, maybe I can write it. Yeah, I'll write it on the box and I think that's easiest. So a vector bundle E on C is semi-stable. So it's that'll be stable if for all sub-bundles we have an inequality of slopes and where the slope is just the degree divided by the rank. And then for stability you ask for this to be strict, so let me write it like this. Write it like this. And then this stack actually emits a good moduli space. So now we actually go from stacks for the varieties. It's a good moduli space. And this lesson tried out for all, but strictly speaking, an adequate moduli space. And then we have a moduli space of semi-stables. And I'm going to call this N. I'm going to call this N. Yeah, let me just sometimes drop all of the decoration here. So, this is a projected variety. And you can actually compute this dimension pretty easily because, well, the, yeah, maybe why can I write this down here somewhere? Yeah, but let me write it here. Sorry, I just wanted to. Uh yeah, but let me write it here. Sorry, I just want to save some space here. Um so if you look at the tangent space to n then it's uh x1s of E, but if E is actually stable, then the comps between E and itself are just scalar multiples, and so you know you can basically calculate it from a rock. So it's just going to be then one and it's So 1, sorry, plus n squared minus 1. Oh, I guess this formula only makes sense when g is greater than or equal to 2. But I guess if you did it at the stack level, it would make sense. Okay, then the other sort of interesting moduli space I'm interested in is Pigs Bundle moduli space. bundle of modular space and actually Higgs bundles you you naturally see from this computation that we had on the tangent space which is if you look at the cotangent space then by S duality you get homes from E to E twisted by the canonical and this is precisely what is a Higgs field okay so a Higgs Field. So a Higgs bundle is going to be a vector bundle together with an endomorphism of that vector bundle which is twisted by the particle. So a X bundle is a vector bundle E, the other with what we call the Hicks field, which is just this twisted epimorphism. Demorphism, and this should be an OC linear map. And again, you can ask for it to be semi-stable by asking for all Higgs sub-bundles, which is sort of sub-bundles such that they're preserved by the Higgs field. Okay, so then actually the cotential bundle to this stack is this stack of these components. I write it like this. And again, sitting inside here, you have this open locus, which is semi-stable. And again, it has a good moduli space. And I'm going to call this curly gam. And this is no longer projective anymore, it's only a quasi-projective. And it contains the co-founded bundle, at least with the stable bundle. The co-founder bubble, at least with the stable locus, as a dense open. I'm going to write it like this. And let me just write in red what happens when the rank of the degree of co-prime. So if the rank of the degree of co-prime, I can write it in the middle here somewhere, then these moduli spaces are both smooth. Smooth and because semi-stability is the same as stability, and well actually always, sorry, this step is always smooth. Whereas this one isn't, but under this assumption, this step wouldn't be smooth. And actually, when this is smooth, as I said, the only automorphisms of a stable bundle are scalar multiples, so this is just a gamma in that case. So, this is just a gm jerk in that case. So, passing between the stack and its good moduli space is really easy. I think the red is not very visible either. Oh, yeah, okay. Let me see. It might be better. Orange? That's a little better. Okay, yeah. Or it was yellow as well. I think we should hit. Okay. Alright. Yeah, so let's now we've got the diagram of Now we've got the diagram of moduli spaces that we're interested in. Let me say a few things about their geometry before talking about cohomology. So the vector bunch of moduli space was sort of studied from the 60s and actually a lot is known about vector button modules. So first of all, people were perhaps firstly interested in it because this, oh, sorry, it's Kelly Ann. This was related to a Betty moduli space, which is, you should think of it as like a, as representations of the sound match, but this is going to be twisted representations of Of, I should put in the word unitary of the fundamental group of C. So this word twisted is here because I might not be able to read zero. And this was probably Narasimha Suchargi theorem. And this is, yeah, I guess I should have said it over the complex numbers. And then I. And then, actually, many sort of different invariants of n have been computed, but in general, they basically all go via this picture. So, first, you compute the invariance of the bump, the whole stack, and then you do some sort of hardener single recursion to get the to the semi-stable locus, and then you pass from that to the good moduli space. Well, typically, only when the rank of the degree of co-pact is quite straightforward to do. So, many invariants. And a computer site by firstly doing it on the stack bun and then this hardener seems recursion. Which, sorry, I haven't really said what this hardener seems recursion is. So if your bundle is not stable, or is not semi-stable, then there's some sub-bundle which has got a slope which is bigger. And so you start by building a filtration by taking the largest bundle. And by taking the largest bundle with the largest slope, and when you iterate this and you get a filtration, this stratifies the stack into these pieces, and you can kind of inductively do arguments. And I explain a little bit more when we get to the module part. Then the H-bundle moduli is more mysterious but also more interesting. So, I mean, Hitchens's original motivation was really gauge theoretic, and so over So over again the complex numbers, he actually constructed, and again, assuming that the rank and the degree are co-prime, and is actually a non-compact hypercaleer manifold, so we can construct this as a hypercalor reduction. And okay, this non-compatible is in some sense. And okay, this non-compactness is in some sense controlled also by something that Hitchin used, which is a scaling action on this module space, which scales the Higgs field. So you just take this path and you just scale. You just scale the Higgs field here. And this really controls the non-compactness. Because every point, if you flow down as t goes to zero in this gm, then there's a limit, always. And actually, this limit is obviously in the gm fixed locus, and this gm fixed locus is proper. So in some ways, it's Think so this is proper. So, in some ways, it still behaves like it's the fact that it's not. So, you just should forget that there's a pixel. No, no, no, no, no. No, not quite. No, no, we will come to this later, maybe, but I could say now. Well, the point is that, because this is an isomorphism class, so what we're saying here is that actually your bundle will decompose. So, that you have a GM containing the automorphism group of your bundles that decomposes into eigenspaces. So it decomposes into eigenspaces for this. And then actually, what happens is your Higgs field has to send basically each one to the next one. So the Higgs field looks like, let's say something like this. And then it sends. Does that make sense? So each one is sending to the next one. And then this is what's called a chain. So the fixed points are chains. But if you wanted to. But indeed one of the components is exactly where the Higgs field is zero, and that's why you get a chain of level zero. Those are different connected components? These are the different connected components. The different connected components of the fixed locals are basically indexed by the invariance in these chains, so the tuple of ranks and the tuple of breeds, and well, I guess also the length of the chain as well. They all sit over the origin and the hitcher map? Yeah, exactly. Well, yeah, we're going to come to the hitch and map in a second. Yeah, exactly. Come to the hitching map in a second, but yeah, exactly. Yes, they're all in the middle post we'll come. Okay, let's, yeah, okay, let's also say the hitching maps actually. That was on my list, but let's do that next. So another thing that also controls the non-compateness is the hitching map, which is a proper map from M to an affine space, which is basically given by taking the characteristic polynomial of the Higgs field. Of course, the Higgs field is some twisted. Field. Of course, the Higgs field is some twisted endomorphism, and so the coefficients are going to be sections of powers of C. So let me write it like this. 1 sine n to n. And I take sections of powers of the canonical n. That's the tensor i n. And so this is just given here by sending a Hicks bundle. Higgs bundle to the characteristic conduct of this twisted andomorphism. So if you like, or really the coefficients of the characteristic conduct, that's the best way to say it. And the point is, so this is a proper map. And also, and this is another case where we see some abelian properties appearing. The generic fibers of this are abelian bread. So what's the yellow or the orange better? The yellow, maybe. Better. Yellow, I mean. Oh, really? I think orange. Yellow is indistinguishable from white. Oh, okay. Alright. Okay, so there's a, yeah, the generic fiber are abelian. So what I mean by this, if I take a very general point in here and I look at its pre-image, then it's going to be actually a well. Well, a component of the Picard scheme. And okay, what the degree is, is some computation, which we're not going to do now. So, some curves are what's called the spectral curve. So, actually, let me also say a little bit about the spectral correspondence or the BNR correspondence. Yes. Sorry, Vienna is a both little narrative and a ramana, and this. And this relates Higgs buckles. Let's even further the sheaf statement. So Higgs sheaves on C with actually sheaves on a surface. So actually this really behaves like a true dimensional theory. So sheaves on, well so actually there are all these spectral curves. Well, so actually there are all these spectral files which are contained in the Gochann bundle on C. So you can think about them as you're sort of looking at, well, so actually I should say also these are rank one sheaves which are supported on a curve which turns out to be a finite cover of, in fact, the degree of this cover is the rank, a finite cover of C. But in general, this is. C. But in general, this curve may be so. This curve is not smooth in general. So, in the case when we were looking at the generic fiber, it was smooth. In general, this curve can be quite messy, the general fibers is hit enough to be pretty messy. Okay, and then instead of the Narasik Sashadi theorem, we have like non-dated horse theory of uh Sibson. How about Sibson? For that, Hitchman as well, which says, let me write it in degree zero. So if I look at the moduli space of Rankhan degree zero Higgs bundles, which has Rank-hand degree zero Higgs bundles, which are semi-stable. And this is the same as this corresponding Betsy moduli space or character variety, which is just representations of the fundamental proof of the curves. And now you really forget the complex structure of the curve here. So this guy, well, well, let's see, it's very important. It really depends on the complex structure of the curve. But here, you don't see. Of the curve, but here you don't see that anymore. So, this is again over the complex numbers. And this is what's called the character variety sometimes. So, this is kind of interesting. It's just an affine GIT quotient here. And then this is also related to a Durant modulized space of connections. Oh, yeah, and then I'm going Oh, yeah. And then I wanted to say a few things. So there's also versions for other G. So vector bundles are torses for a GLN, but there are also versions for G, not equal to GLN, but still reductive. And so you have much of the same theory goes through. So you have a Hitchin map. I don't know if I gave him, oh, I didn't pull that down. Hitch. And a Higgs modulized space. Now add a Higgs moduli space, and you have a proper map to some, again, some affine thing. And there's also a lot of interest in this as well from the perspective of the Leinman's program, and also from Merrisymmet. So I will say a little bit about this later on, which is if you take Langman's jewel. Which is, if you take Langland's dual groups, the hitcher nuts have isomorphic that have nuts that are isomorphic bases. And there's some sort of expectation that these should be somehow mirror. I'll come back to this later, so we'll discuss this in a little bit more depth. We'll discuss this in a little bit more depth. This is just the introduction. Okay. So I'm going to talk about cohomology results now. I don't know any questions before I go on to cohomology. So your squiggles here are diffeomorphisms. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. Because like I said, this one, I mean, it really depends on the complex structure of C, whereas this one does not at all. And then this mirror, these are dual vibrations, is the idea? Or what's the point? Well, you know, so it's it couldn't there's different levels, I mean, there's like a sort of geometric statement, there's a homological statement, there's a topological statement. We'll come back to it. In some ways, there's some sort of duality between the fibers of these. So it's like a relative thing as well, relative to the hitching phase. Okay. So, yeah, I wanted to just sort of summarize what's known about the cohomology of these moduli spaces when they're smooth. So, cohomology in the coparat space. So, because it's really like a whole different catch of fish when you're not in the co-prime case. Not in the co-prime case. Yeah, I'll give an answer by that the answer is a lot of tricky action. So, in particular, this means that semi-stability points like the stability and the moduli space is also three. Okay, so let me again split it up into vector bundles and Higgs bundles. Try and draw a table. So, the first thing is So the first thing is what is known about the Betty numbers. And for vector bottom modules, these were known fairly early on. So by essentially this argument that I said before, it involves this first you compute Betty numbers off the stack and then you do a hard parasymal recursion. So, which is that basically, so inside the stack bun, you have this open locus which was semi-stable, and then the rest of it is all unstable. And so you have some sort of hard and arithmetic, sorry, this is not too small. You have this stratification by hardener semant types. By hardener, and types. And so then you know this part, and then you sort of know this inductively, and then you compute this part, and then you can pass from its stack to its good moduli space because the rank of the debris co-parance is just a geometer. And this is work of ideas and Harry Seaman, a Tierra Bott. Yeah, it's actually a trivial geometric. Yeah, yeah, exactly. You can just pull out, it's just a temporal product of the, yeah, you can just pull out the factor of DGM. So, yeah, this was known by Arden Arasima, a T of Od gave a sort of gauge theoretic interpretation of this, and then they got these sort of inductive formulae, and then it was solved by Zagier. And yeah, okay, there's a bunch of different names. Maybe I'm not gonna write all the names on the board. The names on the board. But in the case of Higgs bundles, it wasn't so easy. So it was known early on in ranks 2 and 3. So N equals 2 was Hitchin. N equals 3 was Peter Goffman. But that was sort of like, and I think this was the 80s and 90s. But that was a long pause where not much was known and things were already conjectured. Conjecture. So then there was a conjecture coming from Hamish Hausel and Rodriguez Riegers. And this actually came from, again, similar to Hardiner-Siemen, point counting over finite fields, but actually using the non-aggion Hodge theory, so looking at the best modified states for a sequence minus affects. So, it seems which one is that takes. And then, this was only solved in the last decade. So, this was solved in 2014 by Eddie Shipman at Gatherway and others as well. And so, it took a lot longer to make progress on this, is what I'm trying to say. So, it's harder, is what I'm trying to say. Then this is our non-compact. Since they're non-compact, is it kind of tricky to relate the point counts to the betting numbers? No, because they're pure. I mean, so I mean, the thing is, because of this, because you have this, but you have this scaling action that contracts everything down. So on the level of cohomology, it behaves like this contracts. Okay. Yeah, that's right. So eventually Schiffman, I mean, he did something completely different, which was inspired by Quitman module. So he ended up counting absolutely incomposable vector bundles over finite fields. So this is how he got that. Okay, so let me say something about tautological class or tautological generation as a news that we've talked about. So on your moduli space, so let's just do it in the case of the vect bundle moduli space, you have a unit. The vector bundle modules space, you have a universal family, so it's a fine moduli space, universal family, and then so you can look at the chan classes of this, which lie then in the cohomology of the product. And then, using the coliphona, you can decompose this, you can take the components which really lie in here, and these give you the topological classes. The topological balance. So it was actually very similar to Andruk's talk. He drew this sort of diagram where you're pushing and pulling. It's the same sort of thing. Yeah, it's exactly the same sort of thing. Apart from grabbing this virtual thing, you're using this universal bundle with that final point, so everything's really nice. And a TR and Bot showed. Showed that the which one is up there, the N or the C? The tall one? Oh, they live in their own N. Yeah, yeah, I mean, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, Athira and Botch showed that actually the chromology of bun is freely generated by the topological classes. And then again, using this sort of hardened arrow semi-recursion, you can see that the cohomology of N is then also generated by the tautological classes. Not freely anymore, but the tautological relations are also known. Then what happens? Then, what happens for the Higgs modulator case? So, there's also a universal family there. You can just forget the fact you have a Hicks field and just look at the same thing. And so, you also have two total modules by Mark and showed that the cohort of the Higgs moduli space is also tautologically generated. And this really goes by a sort of a trick for expressing the diagonal in terms of tautological classes, which is back to both earlier. And then in rank two, the tautological relations are known. So how is it the data study collected? So Hausen and Padea studied a lot with homology in rank two. But beyond that, we don't really know any of the, we don't know the topological relations that are unknown otherwise. It's not even a conjecture around Florida Watson, but not even a conjecture around Florida. I don't think so. So this house I also really don't look like O No, I mean it was very specific yeah it was really specific to rank two I mean I yeah I really studied it in depth in rank two and and you know it it's a lot easier the lower the rank is. But other structured groups besides GLN? Structured moves besides GLN. That's coming in my table. There's more tables. The table is continuing over here. Yeah, yeah. So don't worry. It looks like the table should be through the bunch. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's what I was saying. I would like to do that. So, okay, let's just carry it on because I've got to work with the too many people that we have there right now, I guess. Okay, so what else do I want to talk about? I wanted to talk about, yeah, let's, well, there's two things. Let me first, before we go to that, I want to talk about sort of Kyant and Hannah's. Goes to that, I want to talk about sort of kind of penance results. So, how does this depend on D? So, in the vector bundle case, there's sort of two obvious things that you can do to change the degree. You can tensor by a degree one line bundle, and this takes you from degree D to degree D plus M. And this is a nice mortal term. And this is a nice moral. And then the other thing you can do is you can dualize, right? By memory. I'll have to draw this. So you can go from B to then minus D. And this is also an isomorphism. And actually, so then you could ask, well, when are actually when, for example, on the level of cohomology, do we know Do we know that these could be isomorphic for different D and D prime, let's say? And Card and Haraseeman answered this on the level of the Betty numbers. So they showed that the Betty numbers of n and d equal the Betty numbers of n and d prime, if and only if D and D prime are related by these relations. So that's that t is plus or minus d prime mod n. But then using non-gain Hodge theory, so now we switch to Hicks bundles, you can actually see that, so for Betsy cohomology, you always have client dependence on the level of cohomology. So this is So this is for it, so d and d prime are both co-prime to net. So there are various statements, again, it's a whole separate world when you talk about the non-programme, so I just don't want to open that kind of words. But I mean, additionally, this isomorphism actually preserves additional structures. So it preserves actually reverse fluctuations. So this is work of Kinjo and Poseki. But it also preserves cup products as well. And this was Decatur Malek Shane. Okay. And then the last thing that I wanted to comment on was, yeah, different groups. And actually, the only two groups that I'm going to talk about are SLL and PGL. So what should SLN bundles be? Well, they should actually be vector bundles whose determinant is trivial. But I don't want that because that means that I have to have degree 0 and I want to keep my rank of degree covariant. So I'm going to call the SL moduli space. Instead, I'm going to take, so again, it's going to be sitting inside the GL moduli space, but I'm going Modulize space. But I'm going to now take a vector bundle E. So actually, rather than asking that its account is trivial, I'm going to ask that it's some fixed line bundle. So here L I fixed. Yeah, so I mean I you but I mean changing L anyway. Oh I see L L moves apart, yes. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. But I mean, the point is that as well, now this turns out to be smooth as well, because I'm not choosing to be trivial anymore. So this sits inside here. So I'm assuming in this table the rank of the degree of co-prime. I think coprime is enough, or do you need L to be generic itself? If L were a torsion line person, you'd run probably. Oh, it can't be torsion. Sorry. It's non-zero to be sure. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Then what we know on the level of cohomology. What do we know on the level of cohomology? Well, actually, Hydra and Arasim showed, so on the level of elaborate cohomology, that the so this one, which is, well, I guess you should really think it is NGLM, is the product of the SL one, the Jacobian, which is sort of what you would expect somehow, right? You've just got this varying, like you said, you just vary the line bubble, and you get this. And how they do this is they actually look, so there's actually They actually look, so there's actually some natural groups acting on here. So on here, you have this group gamma, which is the n torsion in the titrum acting by tensorization. And they looked at, so actually it's true that this is true when you hit the gamma invariant piece, but then they show that the gamma action on this is trivial. So the whole thing is gamma invariant. It's the vibration of NGLN over the Jacobian. NGLN over the Jacobian trivial vibration, as that suggests? No, no, so it's that you really get the yeah, so all the geometric level of those. So geometrically, you get the n is, yeah. No, but then quotiented by this gamma action. And so then from that you get this formula, but then, well, and then I tell you that the gamma is acting trivially. That's the important point now. This is not going to be the case in the Higgs bug as well. Uh this is not going to be the case in the Higgs bug as well. And I I wrote another with with that idea. So can I I'm just going to delete the what I wrote geometrically, so I found space to write the PGLs thing. Are your cohomologists like all over Q or is that? No, so this one, like this is this is hard to narrow semen, and this was actually a large cohomology. Yeah, it varies. I mean this was all, I guess this was all Betty Cohenology up to. Okay, so this was all Betty Cohnology up to here, and I added, yeah, this is now through. I mean, it's actually, yeah, how they show this is again through point counter the final fields of these numbers. In QL equations. Yeah, it's a QL equation. Now let me just erase that because I just want to write the PGL, otherwise it ruins my table. Okay, so then the PGL one is, although the PGL model light spaces are then PTL moduli space is then just the quotient of the SL moduli space by this gamma action geometrically. And so since this gamma is acting trivially on the cohomology of this one, you just get that it's got the same cohomology as the SL one. Okay, let's now go to the Higgs bundle web where it's a little bit different. So now the SL version, I don't just fix the detap, I also fix the trace of my Higgs bundle. Fix the trace of my Higgs bundle. So X pairs E and Phi, such that the determinant of E is L, and the trace of my Higgs field is zero. And this again sits inside and out. And again, you still have this end torture in the Jacobia thing. And again, you get the same sort of formula. So you get that the But this is, well, sorry, sorry, I'm going to refer this. So this is acting on the core modules of the SL moduli space, but now it's acting non-trivially. So this becomes some trivial parts of it, so a fixed part of it, and then some variant part. And this variant part is non-tautological. And this variant part is not tautologically generated. And then actually, the PGL, the PGL moduli space is just this part. I'm going to just write it like this. Oh, sorry, I wasn't supposed to use bread, but I did. I'm sorry. So the PTL is tortology garage. This part is tortologically given, but this part is not totally. Are we meant to think this last column would generalize to an arbitrary group and its slang with its dual group? No, I'm not sure about that. No, no, no. I think this is specific to SL and TGO. I mean, yeah. Okay, so I think that's the first time. Sorry? The reference for this last one. The reference for this last one. Well, so I guess there's Howzell, Hawley, and then, yeah, there was a bunch of references, and then later, like, Malwood and Shen studied it. I'll just communicate right now because not last face, but you can ask me afterwards. So, then they also describe how you can describe the rest of that homony, the varying part. Okay, so I'm going to speak. Yeah, I want to say something about MOSIS quickly and then talk about the MOTIC results. So let me try and be quick about MOTIS as well. So MOSIS was originally envisaged as a way to package various invariants. So you have on the one hand cohomology theories which are sort of finite dimensional and quite nice, and then thick like algebraic cycles which are a little bit more mysterious. More mysterious. And this was packaged together quite clearly by Vojvodsky into a triangulated category, and this could now be thought of instead in Tensor Affinity category. So let me just say, so there is a cancer two-linear category. How do you put the word triangulated, but you could also change this to a Triangulated, but you could also turn this to infinitely categorical as well. Of motives with Q coefficients, so here we're doing with Q coefficients. I can try and say what is known about other coefficients later. Of, so mixed methodic cheese for varieties over k with q coefficients. With Q coefficients. And this comes together with a functor M, which you can extend it from varieties to schemes, in fact, the stacks, to this PFKQ, which associates to any variety as motive. And this is And this is a covariant function, so it's actually like a homological theory function. I mean, there's also a cartological one, but I'm just going to work with this one because I'm most familiar with it. And satisfying the following properties. So it builds it for the constructions of many properties that we know from cartology. So you have a conic isomorphism. So you take the Cartesian product, and it's just the density product you notice. Then build it to the construction. Um that built into the construction as well as a homotopy invariance. If you've got the vector bundle on some variety, then the motive of E is isomorphic to the motive of X. You also have built in a tau descent. So there's a sign of our Y from the Q coffin, and so you can compute the motive of X from a Tau hypercover. The tau hypercover. And then you have also things like a projective bundle formula, like you do in colomology. So if you've got a, so now if I projectivize my vector bundle, then I gather the motive of the projectivized thing is the motif of the base times the motif of the fiber. And the fiber is a sub-projective space, and most of the projective spaces are, just like oncohomology, they decompose into these very simple pieces. Very simple pieces which are tape. Oh, yeah. Thank you. I'm sorry, this is my notation for pu and tape twists. This involves two types of twists. Don't worry about it too much. The point is that it decomposes. So n is the rank theory of E. It decomposes into these pieces just like the cohomology does. This doesn't seem like the term relation that we would see in cohomology. See chronology? Well, it comes from that. I mean, you use the this comes from using the first churn class of the O1 office. Can I recover the churn classes of the bundle E from the motive of P and E? The multiplication. Well, that's what, yeah, this is an additive. Yeah, I guess most of the things when I'm saying it's the additive class. And D is stands for derived. What does DM stand for? What does DM stand for? Yeah, so it does stand for derived, I guess, but it's not the derived category of sign, it's conjecturally the derived category of sign. So it's constructed from like a derived category of, let's say, sort of sheaves on smooth varieties, and then you sort of invert things to get the properties that you want of them. It's conjecturally the drive category or something. So do we have some hearts in there that we have? Well yeah, so there should be some heart in a T structure which kind of which then gives you the hearts, yeah. Which then gives you the yeah. But this is the sort of part of the picture that's missing, but I mean, o otherwise you could do a lot with this. So let me just say a few more things that you can do. So you also have things like Geyser and localization triangles. And another important thing, what I want to say later, is that you have realization functors. So, for example, let me just say the alphabeti. So, e.g., if If K is a subfield of C, then there is a Betsy realization. Yeah, going from DM KQ to the derived category of Q vector spaces. And then another important one is the relationship to algebraic cycles. So if x is smooth, then we can express its child groups in terms of homomortal groups. Oh, I'm sorry, I should take Q coefficients because I'm taking Q coefficients. I should take Q coefficients because I've taken Q coefficients elsewhere. It tells a homomorphism group in this DM. And the homomorphisms from the motive of X to these tape twists that are here. Okay, so in the remaining comments, I want to really talk about motives of bubble moduli spaces. So sorry that this was very close. Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, I don't want to. Yeah, yeah, it's true, yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. I want to add extra decorations, yeah. Okay. Just to infer from the word Betty, am I supposed to think that the motive of the variety is like Paul Gregory Paul? Yeah, so sorry, this should also be like let me like complete this too. Like you have a map from here, like this map, right, and then you have a map. There's M, right? And then you have like a bety phomology here, and then there's this commute. So there's motive. So if you know the motive, then you know the beta comology. What is beticomology of a variety? Oh, I just mean the singular cohomology. Singular coherence of the art. No, there's no complex approach. Although there are versions for complex approach as well, but yeah. Singular coharmology of the Yeah. Singular hormonality of the algebraic topology. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Not any kind of algebraic draw cohomology. No, no, no. This is just really topological. And this is always Q coefficients. Yeah, that's just because I was choosing Q coefficient. Well, I mean, so yeah, there are other things to say about the coefficients, but I've got like eight minutes, so I'm okay. Okay, so let me let me just. So there's a sort of guiding idea behind like. sort of guiding idea behind like sort of now this part is all joint with Sumo and also Lier part of it. So this guiding principle in our work is that if you know that for bundle modulate spaces, if the cohomology is tautologically generated, then you should perhaps expect that the motif of the moduli space that you're interested in is generated by the motion of the pad. The motion of the pattern. And in fact, the sort of things about this in higher levels are, so even if you replace, if you look at not necessarily curves, you look at like modulated sheaves on a K3 surface, things like this seem to be true as well. But this is sort of critical in our work. And let me just draw this very quick table again. So I have vector bundles and Higgs bundles. And what And what we say about, so remember, we have this GLN, then we have SLN, and then we have PGLN moduli spaces. So this one was called N, and then inside here we have this NSL, and then we had NPGL, which is just, you take the quotient. And actually, I want it to be smooth, so I take the static quotient here, but it's just, this is just a finite group, but it's n torsion. A finite group, but it's n torsion of the Jacobian. And then you have the same thing for Higgs bundles. This is just to recall the notation. And then, yeah, I think I'm going to have to erase it and do it here. Then we have a corresponding table for some sort of qualitative notification results about these modulized fixes. And oh yeah, I should say that in this table, all of them are tautologically generated. All of that homology is tautologically generated with part of one. And if you remember, because anyone remember which one. And if you remember, does anyone remember which one that was? PKL is not. Oh, no, SL. SL, yeah, exactly. So this is not torch logically generated. Everything else was. Okay, so let's now do the motivat results again, back to bundles. vector bundles, base bundles, and uh right uh so GON, SON, and PGON. So for GON, you can prove that the motif of the vector functor modules space is contained in the category generated by the bucket of the telescope. There's actually two ways to prove this. So the first is like this. Is like this diagonal trick, which was used by Bouvelle and I mentioned briefly. And then the second way is that you can also do it by a sort of Kant Narasiman recursion from knowing the motif of the stack. And I'll tell you that we know the motif of the stack, actually. I'm supposed to think of this as a motific version of generation. Yeah, so this is. Sorry, I didn't say what this is because I'm running out of time. This is the category generated by the notable curves. You can do things like, you can also, it's a tensor category as well. So you can do things like take tensor powers. So you can take like you can take powers of C, for example, and then you can also take direct factors. So you could take, for example, then the quotient of the S and you get symmetric powers of C. So this has lots of different things connected to S. Things connected to the C. Maybe I'll write the formula that we get for button, and then you'll see the kind of things that live in this category. Okay. And then the same is true for the SL1. And it's the same arguments. So so the same arguments are here. Sorry, does that statement then imply the generation statements? Um by applying co log functions we use it. Applying co-logic functions in the temperature? Yeah, so you get a corresponding. Yeah, I mean, so it's not quite saying that it's tautologically generated, but well, it's quite, yeah, it doesn't quite apply tautological generation, but you can see that only the cohomology of the curve appears. It applies the same thing, but you yeah, you don't see that it's explicitly given by these horizontal classes. So these isomorphisms are. So these isomorphisms are on the additives in places, right? Like here in my case. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Okay, let me, and then also the same for MPGL. So the PGL1 is the same as the SL1, so this is also contained inside here. And then let's go to Hicks bundles now. Where it's a little bit trickier, but actually, so with C-1, we also proved that in the Hicks case, this is still generated by the motor of the curve. By the motion of the curve. And this actually uses this scaling action that we saw, and then we get this decomposition into chain moduli spaces. And then there's sort of some wall crossing argument for chains. And it's kind of a complicated argument, but at the end of the day, you get what we were sort of expecting from this guiding crystal. But then. So is there a levelization of this arch for these motives? I mean, how many changes start fixed for this? Yeah, so you can you can express so there's like a motivic beaniki buru decomposition, but then like uh so then you don't get a foreword at the end of the well I was hoping I have some time to say about applications Let me jump into the table and now you can see maybe applications But then we also prove that actually the motive of the SL moduli space does not lie inside here in general so this was together with Vu but instead it But instead, it does lie in a slightly larger category. So then this part is just as small. It lies in this category of abedian motives. So the things which are generated by motives are the Bedian varieties. And then actually, I realized when I was preparing this talk, I don't really think that much about PGR modulizations, but I think the most of the PGR modulized space should also be generated by the motion of the curve, just because that's my guiding. Just because that's my guiding philosophy. But in fact, all I really know is I know it's a direct factor of this one. So I know that it's a view. But it probably should be contained side here. So I know that this one is contained side here as well. Because it's the, remember, it's the gamma equivariant piece of this hohomology here. So it's a direct factor of this cohomology. Okay, I guess I have three minutes, and I'm just going to quickly say some applications that we can gain from this. Oh, I was. Oh, I'm also going to write down a formula, but I would like to state some applications because it sounds like these statements are just a little bit vague, but you can actually get some interesting applications for that. And basically the point is that once you know your motive is obedient, you can apply all sorts of conservativity results and upgrade from chronological statements or various other statements to motivic statements. So applications So knowing these noises are abelian, we use conservativity to deduce a bunch of different spells. Firstly, we get a lot of We get a motivated version of the hydronaricema result that we saw before, which is that the motif of the GL vector mundan moduli space is the tensor product of the SL1 and the Jacobian both as an answer. And this really, again, And this really again relies on showing that, so you have this gamma action here, and you want to show that it's trivial on the level of motors. And it's very easy because now you just have this map from the gamma invariant piece to the thing itself, and then you can apply the Betty realization. And you know that this map was actually an isomorphism, and so then you could use conservativity of the Betty realization. Oh, sorry, I was. Oh sorry, actually sorry, the LA devaluation in this case. Because they were doing nothing. Then a second thing that you can do is actually get 4 muti. A priori, you could do this in any rank if you were clever enough, but we just find it rank 2 and 3. So you get 4 mundi for the motor of M and the motor of M in ranks Ranks two and three. And this uses the idea that actually you can lift expressions, so you can actually work in the growth beat group, and you can lift expressions there actually to expressions to voters, provided they're positive. So, and again, this again uses conservativity, they can lift positive expressions. From the growth of the group of K0 to motives, again using conservativity. So this time what you do is you first go and you're using conservativity of again for abelian losses, you're using conservativity of the map growth from numerical losses to child noises. And then And then, no, it's not. Yeah, it's it's K0. Let's say we just, because we can actually, everything is in channel mode, so there's K0 of like channel modes. Yeah, sorry, and then you use, yeah, you use, um yeah, so it's really here, it's conservativity of the map from child motives to the environmental motives. But all when you restrict your gee and things. When you restrict your V and things. And then let me just say two more. I know I'm slightly overtired. Well, I'll say one more. Okay, then the other thing is about to make nerves from three. So these two are with Li Fu, this one is just with Xi Man. Which is that we can prove that the motif Which is that we can prove that the motif of the, so now this is the Higgs bound, but also remember that we have the SL Higgs moduli space factors over the same base as the PGL one. And so you then get that actually both disagree if you look at the orbital motor PGL one twisted by some jerb. Okay, let me. And this also uses conservativity in concept. So we use that the aliens of the voters involved are aliens. So let me stop here. Sorry for running over. So let me stop here. Sorry for running over time. Questions? Why is that relatively neurosymmetry? Well, yeah, yeah. It's like a dual group, you say? Well, yeah, so I said these SL and PGL are dual length as dual groups, so they factor over the same base. So we just call it A or A S L. Or AFL. And there are different levels of neurosymmetry. So one of them is this topological one, which says that the Koch numbers of this should equal the awkward Koch numbers of this. And this is a sort of upgrade of that. And essentially, this is the. It's not quite the awful chromology, so it's actually the all-fold chromology twisted by a gerb. And this comes from the fact that this is actually. And it comes from the fact that this is actually this stack and it comes with an actual mu n job. It just actually comes from the fact that this has a mu n job if you look at the moduli stack over it and then you get a mu n job here. Yeah, it was just I mean it so there's various different relationships between invariance of this and invariance of this. So, for example, on the level of homological variance symmetry, you should expect that the derived category of this relative to the space, so the derived category of coherence used here should be the derived category of twisted theory. Derived category of twisted reference from state where it's twisted by this gel. Oh, it's the or before motor, so I didn't define it. But essentially, it's a direct sum of inertia star. Yeah, you should do. If this wasn't here, it would be the most of the inertial star. It's a twisted button, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I could explain if I have more time, but yeah. Sorry, one more problem. Sorry, one problem. Yeah. It's silver and algebraic close field. You've got our harden motors coming to the side. So sorry, I guess this last one. I mean the whole, the whole. No, no, no, no, no, no, but this one is over an alpha poster, but you can or if not you would have to pass to maybe some finite extension compiler, but I mean so at some point you need the existence of line bundles at some point uh in the argument and the rest of it is the rest of it is yeah sorry I got a bit swappy with second the assumptions towards the end. People say the assumptions towards the end. I just had a quick follow-up. So, like, in basic coherengual neurosymmetry, the hydrodynamics are rotated by 90 degrees. Can you see that on this module statement? Well, the weird thing is, this is a hypercalib neurosymmetry statement. So, yeah, yeah, but it's a non-compact hypercaleb neurosymmetry situation. So, that's why it could really be phrased entirely on the complex structure side. There's no symptomatic stuff going on, which is like it could really express itself. So I think I'm really expressive in terms of just the large numbers of this and some sort of orbit. I mean, okay, the only thing to deal with is that all the vaults and that makes it slightly trickier. But in the other direction, the hypercaleer direction becomes easier. Yeah. I'm a bit confused about so is is there the statement about something being in the mot in the motive of ambivalent varieties? Motive of Haldinian varieties stronger or a weaker statement than it being in M of C. Oh, yeah, so no, no, no, no, no. So yeah, yeah, I should have said, yeah. No, no, no. So the subcategory generated by the note from C is contained inside this. So if you know this, you know that's because of the decompany, yeah, yeah. I mean actually this is just how symmetric product. Symmetric product, I guess. I mean, this is also the same as you take the motives of all curves. Let me call it like C total for any curve. So, because C is my fixed curve. And so, this is also generated by the motives of all curves. And so, then I'm saying I just need my original curve that I started with here. But here I'm saying I need some other curves. And actually, in the SL case, the curves that you need are essentially coming from you need to take rules of my models in some way, so sort of pulling back multiplication maps on the Jacobian. Both location maps are the Jacobian, and these are the C tilders that you get. So they're sort of actually entire covers of C. And you can sort of see which ones we have to identify. You could make it smaller, in other words. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just didn't have much time, yeah. One more question. If you knew the algorithm conjecture for albinum varieties, would that tell you anything before you I guess, I mean, I guess well, I guess if you just think something about, yeah. I don't think so. I'm not sure. Yeah, I must say, I don't think so. My question was if what trajectory is a motivating state, but it's something below it. Something below it for everything with a category. Well, again, I guess these are all sort of additive statements as well, so it's a little insane. Of additive statements as well, so it's a little bit what are the Hodge conjectures for the curve, you don't know what? Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So, that's what I was trying to say. Yeah, exactly. I mean, yeah, so you can't deduce from knowing it here to here as a sign. Can I just ask, do you expect for arbitrary G to be in that and the motives for arbitrary G, arbitrary motive group, should they also? Arbitrary active group, should they also be in these other motives of Indian life? I think so, I would expect so, but I don't think, well, yeah, it's very hard for me to think about things which are not SLM or PGLM or GLM, because I mean, secretly, under all of this, there's actually, I mean, it all comes from like a relationship between the computer sheet, which I didn't talk about at all, but I was trying to say something about the interesting account. And so, yeah, I'm at a loss as to what to do with that. There's really no colours. There's really no current access to whatever. Well, I mean, so for example, like going by 12 or bot, which was really gauge directed, this was any group. And they got a nice, nice, concrete formula. And so you should hope. So they essentially prove that if you look at, so also I said that most of the buttons actually generally clearly this was an explicit formula. And they also proved this for other G. So. So I would expect similar results, but I mean you already see that it depends on the group you take. So SLA is sort of spectral and that it's not generated with most of the curves, but it seems to be related to these topological generations. Any other questions? Yeah. Some other related moduli spaces are those of twisted Higgs bundles or sheaves of what it occurs in that pet so? Yeah, so twisted Higgs bundles, it's okay. Hix bundles, it's okay. The same sort of argument works. You can do twisted fixed bundles. That's there. You've got the same two statements, actually. I mean, we needed that in this multi-pick merisometry. It uses twisted fixed bundles at some point. And so you need that. And sheaves on. So there are some results about sheaves on surfaces, for example. So there's this general expectation that you have multi-space on sheaves. Well, I don't know. Sometimes it happens. Like, you have a multi-space of sheaves on a Of a smooth projective variety, you might hope that the most of that modulate space is generated by the motion of that smooth projective variety. And this is true, for example, for K3 surfaces.
