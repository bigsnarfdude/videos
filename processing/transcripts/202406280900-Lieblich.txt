Seeing as this is the last day of this wonderful conference, I feel like it's a good time to recognize all the people who have made this as great as it is. I'm starting with the organizers of this conference. Thank you so much. It's been lovely to bring these communities together and to get a chance to discover. And to get a chance to discover new ideas and to confuse one another and celebrate that confusion. I also think it's really important for us to thank CMO and the Hacienda and Jose for all the work that they've done to make our stay comfortable and productive. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. And now I'm going to say some things. So, the first day I talked about the what. Second day, I talked a little bit about the how. And today, I'd like to address the why. And it's going to be somewhat indirect. I may not get to the full explanation why I think this is related to the why, but that's kind of what I'm aiming at. And I do want to clarify one other thing again. This keeps coming up every time, okay? I just want to say, I'm going to erase this in a second, because this is not the point of my talk, but I honestly think H2 of spec are. H2 of spec r this is zero. Okay, this is zero. And in general, in general, if you take H2 of, I don't know, let's say spec of K. Yes, yes, I do. This really? I don't? Okay, let me erase this. This is the hellatic tape module of the Brouwer group of K. Okay. And this is zero. Okay. This is actually going to be very important later, what's going on with this group, these kinds of groups. I mean, not the indices will be slightly different, but this phenomenon. And so this is an interesting, it's just something to note, okay? Note. Okay. All right. Okay. With that out of the way. All right. So today I want to talk about universality questions. Universality of projective space for cohomology. In a particular way. Okay. And it's. Okay, and it's things are going to be happening in two different directions at once, but I'll try to explain. All right. So there are some motivating questions, some of which came up in my first lecture arising from various conjectures and just kind of the innate curiosity of human beings. All right. So let's say that X is a default over an algebraically closed field. Over an algebraically closed field. Okay, since we put ourselves in a very geometric situation, and you remember there was this conjecture about cyclicity for Brouwer classes on surfaces. Remember this? Right. And so, you know, the first thing you could ask is, let's see, you could ask this in a couple different forms, I suppose. Here's kind of the most, the one that seems the most analogous, the most relevant for the period. The most analogous, the most relevant for the period index problem, but I think this isn't necessarily the right version of the question. Is every alpha in, well, I will write Brouwer group of K of X, but you should also maybe think alpha in H D of spec of K of X, you know, mu n to the tensor D. You can choose which one of these things you kind of want to think about. The pullback. The pullback of a class by some rational map projective space. Remember, the way in which we've seen this before is a symbol is defined on projective space, is the pullback of a class from projective space. The symbol is really something that's pulled back from projective space. That's pulled back from projective space. So, like, if we have a, one of these symbols, well, this is the pullback of x, y under the map given whose coordinates are a and b. Okay, and remember, if we take d equals two, this would be a result of the simplicity conjecture for Brouwer classes on surfaces. Right? I just have to be easier than the simplicity conjecture. And if you don't, if you believe the simplicity conjecture, this has to be true. Right? Okay. Nevertheless, if you try to prove this, you will fail. I mean, it's just, anyway, I don't know. Try, try. Okay, one prime. So this is one sense in which I mean that projective space. In which I mean that projective space is universal. I mean, the stronger version is that there's some actual class, which is the universal class. But in this weak form, I just mean projective space itself, with all of its rich and confusing cohomology, is universal in the sense that every class might come from projective space, even if we don't know what class on projective space gives rise to. Can I ask you a question about the pullback? Yeah. So you're taking a rational map. Yeah. Yeah. So. Yeah. So when you pull back, you're really pulling back. I mean, it's defined on some open subset. So you pull back and get an element, the open subset. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but you're only asking. Oh, sorry. You're only asking for an element of bar group of the function field. Okay. So, so, yeah, so you need, so it's okay. Yeah. But you're, but you're absolutely right. You have to be careful. X could land at a closed point. X could land anywhere. It's not, I'm not saying this is dominant. And so you have to be careful when you say public of a class, class define. Be careful when you say public of a class, class defined where while on some open subset of PD that contains the image of the generic point of fact, something like that. Yeah, okay, okay. And by the way, is it true that the I know for a bra group, if it's a regular integral scheme, then the bra group of X injects into the Braun. Is that also true for these H D is not true? No, no. And so what we'll see later, I'll bring this up later, at least in passing, is the right framework for asking questions. You know, the right framework for asking questions of the kind you're asking is in the framework of unramified cohomology, which is not the same thing as the regular cohomology. Yeah, good. Thanks for planting that seed. Yes, excellent question. Okay, so another thing you could ask is a sort of limiting form of this question, but you could ask sort of universality of that kind or just HQ of what did I write here? X. I mean, I actually even say specific. I may actually even say spec of A of X Q mod Z twisted by Q. I don't mean this in some weird motivic sense. I mean just the direct limit of the twisted, the power of roots of unity. So you could ask it on the nose for classes with these sort of finite coefficients, or you could ask for classes in here. And really, this question is one that's more analogous to the Brouwer group itself. If you want to track the actual index, I mean, track the period, you'd want to work with finite coefficients. This form, if you just let it be in the Brouwer group, it doesn't really. This form, if you just let it be in the broader group, it doesn't really track the period quite the same way. But there's a sort of bigger group where you might ask for universality or slightly weaker question. Okay. Here's another one that's related, okay, which I think is also just incredibly bizarre. Let's say that capital K over little k has finite transcendence degree in some kind of like a reasonable field. It could be like the function field of x, right? It could be like the function field of x, right? And then we can ask ourselves: given, now there's multiple, I'm going to say it in general, but really the question is in my mind is really about the bra group originally. Given one of these, given some alpha and HQ spec of K mu n for the tensor q, given a class like this, this is idiotic. Is there a proper subfield? K prime inside of K and a beta in the corresponding cohomology of K prime such that alpha is beta extended to K. Sorry, this is funny to me. I mean, if you think about, so example, let's just say K is a purely transcendental extension, you know, whatever. If you think about it, If you think about a class like, if you think about a class, I don't know, let's just take as an example, x1, x2, dot, dot, dot, xq, okay, sub n. So this, this symbol, well, let me see if I can get this right. Okay. And here, if I just do like k adjoin, I don't know. I mean, I can do this extravagantly. x1 to the n plus 1, and so on, x1 to the n plus 1. Is the number of variables the same? Is the number of variables the same as the? No, no, it's not. It's not. No, no, no, it's not. Q is Q. I did that on purpose. But the Q is the Q is the Q. The Q is the Q, but the N is not the N. Yeah, yeah. So now the N is an M, and the Q is a Q, and the N is an N. Now they're okay, yeah? So if you just take the subfield generated by those powers, then this symbol gives rise to that symbol when you extend. Gives rise to that symbol when you extend scalars. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, so we have to be a little careful, right? So you can make counterexamples. Like, for instance, if you do this with QA join I, the answer is no, right? And so maybe we should say, you know, positive. That's positive. Or maybe it has to be at least two. I mean, I don't know what the, what the 17? I don't know what the 17? It's got to be something. For projected space, you can squish it like this by just taking some stupid thing for classes like this. Now, how are these things related? Well, this silly seeming question. By the way, this is like saying that a cohomology class doesn't have a field of definition, right? That would be kind of what this is telling us. This is related because if you could always do this, if you take the function field of a variety, you can always push it down. Of a variety, you can always push it down to smaller, smaller fields, then the Codera dimension goes down. And so you'd automatically get that a class came by pullback from either projective space or something of Codera dimension, like, you know, like an abelian variety type thing. Okay, so you could almost answer question one if you had an answer to question one double prime, which I think is really weird. And now you might think like there's a strategy where you use an expression of symbols to embed, and you do this power map on all the product, all the factors of projective space. All the product, all the factors of projective space, and that turns out not to work if the symbol length is too large. If the symbol length is small, it works. If the symbol length is long, it doesn't work. And that's because there's this geometric fact: if you take a finite morphism, it took me a while to realize this. If you take a point here, it almost certainly maps to a point with the same residue field. Of course, that doesn't work at the generic point, but for points of, you know, But for points of small dimension, they almost certainly map injectively down there. If you just think about it, I mean, geometrically, it's sort of clear why that has to be. Because the fibers of this map don't have to align with, fiber of this map doesn't have to lie on a sub-variety. There's no reason for a sub-variety to have more than one point on a random fiber of this map. Then that sub-variety will map birationally onto its image. Is this too Italian? What I'm saying? I'm saying okay, and now I want to just throw in another question here, which, of course, there's answers to this one, okay? But that is why is this map why is this rejective? In other words, why does the blockado conjecture hold? What? Yeah, that's what that means to me. Okay, M? Am I supposed to put in M? Okay, thank you. I didn't know there was another kind of K-theory. All right. And then I should say there's a limiting, there's a sort of limiting form where you can take KQM. Censor Q mod Z mapping to HQ that K of X Q mod Z of Q. Okay, and that's sort of the, at infinity, why would you have surjectivity, sort of asymptotic surjectivity? Okay? Now maybe it's worth it. Yeah, okay. These are some questions. The second one is not directly related to universality projective space, but it will be in a second. Projective space, but it will be in a second. Oh, because how is this related? Block himself, in a paper from 1970-something, two, eight, six, block showed rather directly, in almost elementary terms, basically using the Fidev sequence. And, you know, like it's not very hard to show that the cohomology of projective space. Projective space a purely transcendental extension. But this is generated by symbols. And it's not hard to imagine, there's an inductive structure to this. It's just A1 cross A1 cross A1. So if you can really just understand A1 over a field, then you can figure out what to do. And A1 is sort of like class field theory again. It's really not that bad. I mean, that's what the PideF tells us. So Block showed this directly. So, so Block showed this directly for projective space in a rather elementary way from our point of view. I mean, it's not, you know, not what my son would be learning in school. But if you then had some kind of universality type statements for projective space, you would then get this, you know, you would get surjectivity. Injectivity is a much more mysterious thing, but you get surjectivity just by pulling it back from projective space, right? That's cool. Okay. So I just want to make a piece of notation just so I don't keep having to write out long things. Long things. Before I write my notation, what's on your mind? What questions, comments, thoughts, feelings are you having right now? Yeah. How is what proved? Reduce the A1 and then just manually check things for A1. Yeah, yeah. Check things for A1. Yeah, yeah. Good question. I can't remember what the paper is called, but yeah. Okay. Was there another thing? Okay. Right. So given a field K, I'm just going to write this. I'm going to write HQ of K comma D. This is going to mean HQ back of K. Okay, I'm a mu d to the tensor q. So I'm staying in this, whatever the hell this is called. The q and the q are the same, okay. At some point, I may give up and just assume there's lots of roots of unity. And I'm going to write h hqk infinity for the limiting form of this. So q mod z. Okay. All right. And maybe it's worth pointing. All right. And maybe it's worth pointing out: if you, you know, there's a sequence. What's up, Sid? Could you play that into the microphone? Is there something we should know? Okay. Of course, we have that HQ. Of course, we have that HQ of K D. What? What do you have to share? We'll talk after this. This rejects onto the d torsion in HQ, K infinity. It's sort of like Kumar theory. If you just take this, it's Kumar theory, right? Okay. Now there's another thing that comes up a lot that an algebra is called unramified cohomology. Who's ever seen unramified cohomology before? Smattering, a moderately large smattering of people. Okay, so let me just let me remind you what it is, because it's going to come up in something I say. When does this end? I have two hours, right? Let's say that U is a scheme. I don't know, an integral scheme. Whatever. Let's just take it to be, don't do something weird to me. All right. So there's a natural map. Natural map of topoi from the atel topos to the Zariski topos. Okay. And so we can use this to compute, you know, compute the atel cohomology with a spectral sequence, you know, on the Zariski, on the Zariski topos. And then there's this crazy thing, all right? You take this, the, the group H0 on Uzar of RQ pi lower star. RQ pi lower star of F is called the unramified non-ramifier tomology. I'm going to use U as a notation to remember what is unramified over, but in the literature, sometimes you just see the function field and it's unramified on the model or whatever. But so for us to remember what scheme we're actually working with, because I'm not assuming this is proper over a field right now, whatever. Okay, this weird thing is called the unramified cohomology. Ramified cohomology. All right. And the virtue it has, because we're talking about the global sections of some bi-direct image, and you can restrict those sections to the generic points. What you see is that, I mean, we're really going to be thinking about like F is something reasonable. Like maybe it's mu n to the tensor, whatever. So I think for reasonable sheaves, so don't do something weird to me right now, okay? This is really the same as. This is really the same as the unramified cohomology is the cohomology of the function field. So this is, you know, reasonable subject to the, and it consists of the alpha such that for all points u and u, there exists an open and a beta. And a beta in the cohomology of W such that beta restricted to the function field is alpha. So it's the classes that locally everywhere extend. Okay, but you can't, this came up yesterday. No, it came up in what Bjorn just said. It's come up several times. Being locally extendable doesn't mean you can glue those local extensions together. And so the way that you rectify that is with this notion of the unramified polynomial. Side note, one thing that would be interesting. One thing that would be interesting is to discuss is to understand what the unramified, the unramified, the relative unramified cohomology of a morphism should be. I claim this is an interesting thing to think about for reasons I can explain to you at a separate time. That are related to the period index type problem. You had a good notion of, and you could imagine what it could be. You pushed down sort of a diagonal and a diagram of a tall total. And a diagram of a tall topoy mapping is risky topoi, but that's not a super well-behaved thing. So it would be really interesting to get a good notion of relative unramified cohomology. See this must say that for a web is the cohort of the yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right, right. Right, good. Okay, let me tell you the main theorem of the day. Main theorem of the day. Does that sound okay? There's sort of two. Here's the first one. Okay, so again, we have this algebraically closed base field. We've got u over k, a variety of dimension v. Variety means separated integral scheme of finite type, okay? Finite type, okay? It doesn't have to be proper, all right? And now, given R, let's say R is prime to the characteristic, every number that appears, I would like it to be prime to the characteristic of K. So let's just kind of assume that. Given R, you know, prime to the characteristic exponent of K, if you like, there's a diagram like this. This is F. So I'm creating a correspondence between U and P D, okay, such that first, Z is integral. Okay. Second, G and F are generically finite. Third, the degree of F is congruent to one modulo R. It depends only on U and R. I don't know. Yeah, okay. In a way that I'll make precise by the end, I think. Okay. And, oh, God. And the image of the map Yeah, generically finite dominant. Yeah, good. That the image of, now let's see, I can pull back and push forward. This goes from H D K of P D infinity bracket R to H D K of U. K of u infinity bracket R contains the unramified cohomology H D N R of U infinity bracket R. Okay, this is the main theorem. So there is a correspondence whose image contains all of the unramified cohomology. Unramified collemology. Now, if you take any collemology class over the function field, it's going to be unramified over some open. So, this is just a way of saying every class comes from a correspondence with projective space. And if you fix any finite collection of classes, there's a single correspondence that will do that for you. Yes, this is just right now the top degree cohomology. Okay? So you build one of these corresponding. So you build one of these correspondences. Yeah, sure. No, you'll see. I'll explain. There's a very explicit way of making this. This is not some mysterious thing. It's a very explicit way to make this. Let's see here. Maybe I should state the. Let me let me uh no, okay, I'll go with the flow of what I've written here. Okay, I know this there's a this is like a like a notation-heavy statement. So please tell me, please tell me if there's something about it that makes you feel funny or if you just want like a second to grok it. So, do you know for sure you cannot build like a actual morphism? No. The method I'm going to show you doesn't build a morphism. You know for sure you cannot. Nope. No, no, no. No, no, no, no. I do not know. And there's things. That's the thought, but what happens to the bad characters? No. Yeah. Sorry. I mean, it's a good thing to think. Sorry. I mean, it's a good thing to think about. Yeah. Yeah, we can talk about that more. Yeah, exactly. I mean, I think I'm trying to emphasize this has nothing to do with any particular cohomology question. Particular cohomology class. Okay, but yeah, this is kind of a stupid thing to say, right? When you see the construction, you'll know what I mean. Okay. And now, of course, if you, you know, you can kind of think of the pair, not to belabor this point, g, f as a sort of, as a sort of generalized kind of map, you know, as sort of kind of map, you know, as sort of a map. Pi from u squiggly arrow P D. And then we see that classes are pulled back from P D in this sense of correspondence. One thing that I think is maybe also worth noting is like this is an integral thing. This is irreducible. That'll come up again in a minute. All right. And so it's like a corollary, you know. The map, it's okay. The map in Milner K-theory of degree D in the limiting form, H D K of U infinity, let's say the characteristic is zero for this statement, or stay away from P, this is surjective. Okay. This is not, this is independent of Vojvatsky and all that stuff. I'm just pointing out you get this kind of surjectivity statement, at least at the top degree, from what I'm telling you, independent of Voebatsky, the norm-residue isomorphism theorem. So norm-residue isomorphism theorem. Can I use that notation for? Isomorphism theorem. Can I use that notation for norm residue isomorphism? What? But NRD stands for reduced norm. I think it's a different thing. Okay. All right. So far, so good. So far, so good. So let me tell you theorem two. Oh, this is too small. Okay, I'm going to, I don't want to. Okay, I'm going to go. No. Started writing it a very long time ago, and then I became the chair of the department. And now I open it. I open the file every day, and then I just start crying. Then I write memos. So the paper will be a series of memos. Okay, theorem two. I'm going to put an asterisk here because this one is less well. Here because this one is less well digested. And so, like, I think it's right, but I haven't written out all the details. Right. So, assume two things. A, the standard conjecture of Lefschetz type and B, and this one is like a more bizarre one for all. More bizarre one for all varieties x over k again, k is this algebraically closed field, right? The torsion in HQ spec of k of x zl of q is zero. Okay, and this is for all q. And this is like saying that the cohomology is topologically trivial. Trivial. And maybe it's worth saying this is this follows from the block cutoff conjecture from NRIT. But let's assume it. And we saw an example already with R, although R is not one of these things. And it wasn't the right index. And oh, actually, yeah, I think if you make the index two, then maybe it's Z mod two. And then maybe it's Z mod 2. I don't want to talk about R anymore. Okay, then. Forget everything I just said. What did you say? This is an assumption if we don't want to use a normal residue isomorphism theorem. Okay. You could also decide you do want to use a norm residue isomorphism theorem, and then it's not an assumption. But I'm trying to isolate what exactly do we need to get certain things to be true, okay? true okay um and and by the way you know in in the proof of there's a there's in the proof of the norm residue isomorphism theorem i think i think i'm remembering this right if you always know surjectivity then you also always know injectivity or yeah okay now the problem is we only the things i'm talking about will give you surjectivity for function fields of varieties over algebraically closed fields and i don't remember when i looked at if if you if you if you say in that class restricted class of fields if that same implication holds Fields, if that same implication holds. Maybe it does, because it uses like the cohomology of some things. Yeah. So, so, okay, good. All right. Then, okay, I still don't have enough room. Then, for any u over k, as in theorem one, in other words, any variety, okay. And any. And any queue, not just the top Q, all right, there exists a correspondence. Now we have PQ like this, all right, so that, let's see, what do we call these maps, G and F? Okay, the first one is such that G is dominant, F is generically finite. All right, we saw this idiotic thing about the degree of F. I just think that's fun. Okay. And if I look at the image of the correspondence, you know, F lower star, G upper star, from HQ now, A of PQ infinity bracket R to HQ A of U infinity Infinity bracket R. This contains the unramified cohomology and degree Q. So if you accept this topological triviality and the standard conjecture of Lefschetz type, then you get corollary two. Corollary two. So, you know, theorem two implies, so assumptions A and B imply that this thing, the K-theory, projects onto the thingy for all thingam evolvers, if you know what I'm saying. So, for all Q. So, the norm residue map is surjective for all Q. Okay. So far, so good. I think that the scary, I mean, yes, yes. I mean, yes, yes, but the scary part is the algebraic closedness of the base field. In the end, as I'll try to explain in a moment, or in a few minutes, this all comes down to you need to understand the cohomological dimension of the field. It's very important. This is basically a like, oh, I'll say this in a second, but this is what I have realized by looking through various sources is like the thing I'm going to explain to you. Looking through various sources, like the thing I'm going to explain to you is, in spirit, very similar to what Block originally did in a special case in his lecture, his old lectures about cycles. And this is sort of the kind of apotheosis of that argument about De Jong's theorem that uses vibrations by curves. That's what I'm going to kind of explain. And so in order to get this to work inductively, in the same way that this business with projective space works inductively, the base case has to make sense. So you need some kind of algebraic closure to start with. Algebraic closure to start with, and sort of the dimension zero part. But maybe you have something smarter. Maybe there's a smarter thing you could do. Oh, it does. Yeah, yeah, it does. Yeah, yeah. I don't know. I'd love to talk to you about it. It's not obvious, as you'll see, not obvious to me. What else you got? What else you got? Yeah. I mean, yeah, go ahead. Full power, yes. Push the button all the way to the top. So, for curves, in that particular case, there's that. This one? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to show you, I'm going to tell you exactly what it is, and you're going to love it. Okay. You are going to love it. I'm going to use things that you are going to love. I promise you. I guarantee you. I promise you. I guarantee you. All right. So maybe it's worth stepping back for a second and just seeing a couple of things that we kind of already know that are weaker given the norm residue isomorphism. I think. Is that worth saying? I think it's worth saying. Okay, so now let's assume the thing that we know is true. Thing that we know is true. Okay. By the way, I assume we do know it's actually true, right? Like all the issues have been resolved. True or false? Okay. So let X be a default. Otherwise, what? There's only one paper I've written. Okay, good. Okay, good. So you've checked it very carefully. All right, so let X be a default. So here's some things that are just silly, but I want to point out: if you actually tried to do this without the normal residue isomorphism theorem, some of what I'm going to say is highly non-obvious and maybe not clear at all. Some of it might be clearer in certain contexts. All right, so A, for any alpha in HQ K of X. HQ K of X R there exists a map F from a rational map to P n for some some n, some crazy n, all right, some crazy n and a beta in HQ U R HQ U R where U is some open in P crazy N such that alpha is F upper star of beta. The statement is longer than the proof, okay? Proof, right? Alpha is some sum of classes. What are we doing, Q? And now each symbol comes from, you know. You know, PQ, and then just take a product, and then you know, PQ, how many of these things we say there are? I goes from one to T. PQ to the T is basically P to the QT. Done. Okay? All right. That's not so, I mean, right? Look. Now, I don't know. Is there some other obvious proof of that? It doesn't, I don't think so. Isn't that weird? Isn't that weird? You could imagine, like, if you take like a if you take uh like a division algebra representing your thing then maybe there's some way of like no yeah even then it's not obvious no i don't think there's any other way to do that that i know of okay but you know that sucks because the n is totally out of control it depends on the symbol length and that could be insane as as as danny was explaining and so you know n is just some extravagant uh it's like a really really thick towel at a resort where like when you get in the towel you don't even know where the person is anymore right okay Right. Okay. And now let's say you want to do it with like a piece of Kleenex instead of a big towel. Okay. So B, this one is a little more interesting. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No. No. Because the unramified one is inside. The unramified one is inside of the cohomology of the function field, and that is very. You see, writing it out as h0 of rq pi lower star shows you how screwy it is. If you think about it in the spectral sequence, there's tons of other things that can generate kernel for that. It's a very strange, strange group. It does not behave well at all. And that's why there's a challenge in trying to make a relative version for a morphism and then try to understand if you have two morphisms, like how would you do any comparisons? There's some very mysterious thing. Some very mysterious thing. Yes. Thank you for asking that. All right. So, number two, B. Number B. All right. For any, go, go. T is a T. No, no, don't be sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, now X is a default, and any default has a rational embedding. It's a D. Embedding into D P D plus one. Okay, as David Selman pointed out to me, this is the primitive element theorem. And I'd come to some conference, I was like, well, you embedded anything, it takes generic projections, and then you don't even see this, blah, blah, blah. And someone's like, it's just the primitive element there. Okay. You know, you do another normalization, and then you have this separable extension, and you just, okay. And any. Just okay. And any. So I fix one single thingy, one single rational embedding. And now I take any alpha in HQ K of X. Now for some reason I wrote an R here. Have I been writing R? Yeah, okay. There exists some open set U containing the image of the generic point of X. So this is open in P D plus one. open in pd plus one a beta in the hq of u r so that alpha is equal to beta restricted to you know eta x or if you like the upper star right okay Why? I knew you were asking. Sid. What? Who's Ada? You look like you're about to say something. You're holding the microphone like you want to talk. Right. Right. But look, take the local ring at P D plus one. Let's just call it, let's just say eta is P of eta X. Okay. Take the local ring at eta. This rejects onto. ring at eta this rejects onto a function field of of x right and now we have again we have our alpha which is the sum from i equals one to t of these ai sub one up to a i sub q where these uh ai j's are in kappa of x um and just choose lists so just choose a i j tilde in o p d plus one eta How ridiculous is that? Now these functions are defined in some neighborhood of that point, so you get the u. Now you can take that same formula with the tulas, that gives you beta. And as you say, this is lifting along as a risky thing instead of a salient thing. And salient thing, you know, and you can do it because you can write things out with a formula. Doesn't this make you mad? I mean, it's ridiculous that you should have to use one of the most complicated theorems of the 20th century to prove something like this. It's absurd. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just improved it. Because I wanted to show there's different ways. I just felt like doing it. Yeah. Felt like doing it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's not about efficiency. Now let me do C. Okay. C. Oh, I mean, I did A first because it's easier to like sort of, it's easier to just be like, yeah, than B. And then you're like, do, and you're like, oh, yeah, that's clear. You can get it from objective space. It's so big. And then you're like, but wait a second, look how tight this is. It's just one more. Second, look how tight this is. It's just one more. And we wanted it to be like this, but there's a huge gulf between P D plus one and P D. It's ridiculous. I mean, that one is just absurd. This one is so tempting. Okay, now here's C. If I take given any alpha in one of these cohomology groups I'm thinking about, all right. All right. Of course, there exists a correspondence realizing alpha if I assume the normalized isomorphism. Okay, and let me tell you what it is. Okay. Such that, it's even stronger, such that alpha is F lower star, G upper star of beta, where beta Is the universal class? You know, that like x1 up to x2, right? For a single class, if you assume normalized isomorphism theorem, there is a correspondence like this. Does anyone know what it is? Try calling someone. This is my youth grad school. This is my youth grad school. Okay, so say alpha is next time I'm going to fill a suitcase with Hagaroma. Okay. Write alpha as a sum of classes of this kind. And now for each of these, we get these maps, x. We get these maps x to pq so that if I take x1 up to xq, it goes to ai1 up to aiq, right? For each one of these classes, I can find a doohickey. And over there, we're like, so take the product, right? But instead, what we could do is we could go like this. We could let z be a disjoint union of t copies of x, okay? Mapping to x by the canonical map and mapping. And mapping to PQ, by the way, let's call this map Pi, or the district union of the Pi's. And now, if you do this formula, you'd add up those classes. Boom! What? Yeah, right. So, this is not, this is much, much weaker than the theorem that I explained to you. This depends on alpha. Yeah. Alpha. Z is not irreducible. We have no control over this degree. There's all sorts of things that are messed up compared to the beautiful theorem that I mentioned to you at the beginning. Okay. Okay. I'm only trying to say there are ways you can express universality of projective space with respect to Brouwer classes using the norm residue isomorphism theorem that come in different forms. An extravagant one. An extravagant one, a more parsimonious one, and this one in the category of correspondences where the dimensions line up on the node, one class at a time. And so in some sense, I'm reversing this flow. And I do think there's something interesting. The theorem I'm trying to explain to you is much stronger than this. And so I don't know yet fully what that means. It means something, but I don't know what. Okay? Okay, take a big one, and I'm going to break it. So, now let me tell you where this all comes from. But where, why? So, remember, we have our X. And in De Jong, in the proof of de Jong's theorem I showed you, we can fiber it by curves over a smaller projective space and sort of think about the problem as a curve over a more complicated field. Now, this is topological dimension d minus one. This is a field that has some, it's not an out-of-control field, it's like a reasonable. Reasonable. But we can turn everything into a question about curves. And now, if you think about, say, the cohomology, the cohomology of C, what do you have to understand to compute it? It all comes from the cohomology of this field plus an understanding of, say, you know, whatever, I forget what the D torsion, the R torsion. The D torsion, the R torsion, and the Jacobian of C. If you think about, there's only two relative cohomology groups: there's R0 and R1. If you go into compute cohomology, if you think about the various things you do, you have to understand the cohomology of R0 and the cohomology of R1. So now R1 is something about the Jacobian of C. So instead of building a correspondence that treats the cohomology directly, I'm going to demonstrate how to build a correspondence. Directly, I'm going to demonstrate how to build a correspondence that recovers the torsion in the Jacobi. And then by taking cohomology of everything, we get the statements about the global cohomology. So let me tell you what that is. Here's the key proposition. Did I hear something? And I do want to kind of, I want to tell you what this says, and then I want to show you just an easy wince of how it works. Show you just an easy wince of how it works because it is just classical algebraic jump. So, proposition: let's see be a smooth proper VM spec of dimension one over, I don't know, over a perfect field or stay away from P or whatever, right? Or whatever, right? Given an integer r, and this is an integer prime to whatever it has to be, there exists a diagram that goes like this. Early D, early C, early P1. Right? So this is G, this is F. So, this is G, this is F, this is pi, where pi is a root stack along a divisor. G and F are finite. The degree of F is congruent to one mod R and the induced map. F lower star, G upper star from the R torsion in the Picard scheme of curly P surjects onto the R torsion in the Picard scheme of curly C. This is a surjection of K group schemes. Say what? Oh, this is a C. C for curve and C for curly. All right. Yeah. Ah, finite dominant, finite switch. Yeah. Okay. Now, um Now, I want to tell you where this comes from. So, let me just sort of mention: like, this is surjective, right? This is surjective. And I was telling you in the theorems, you want surjections on cohomology. Well, the only way that's going to happen is if you're working over, if you're at the top of a sequence where you're at the boundary of the cohomological dimension of the base field, that a surjection of sheaves induces a surjection of homology groups. That is where. Homology groups. That is where, in the original theorem, you need to be at the top degree. Okay, if you could do this in a more refined way, and you can, if you know that in the vibration that the torsion is completely split, if you did this for an isomorphism, you'd get it for all degrees right away. In general, you can only make this a surjection, so you only get it in the top degree. And the reason you use the Lefschetz theorem is you kind of reduce to something of the appropriate dimension, and you have to invert that restriction map through a correspondence, which is what the Lefschetz conjecture, standard conjecture. Conjecture, standard conjecture tells you. So, this is kind of the key thing, plus some cohomological dimension crap. Okay. And let me tell you where this comes from, because I think this is really, I think it's worth saying, and then I will be done. Okay. Please ask me questions while I'm erasing something. Tell me something. Talk to me, people. If this looks like gibberish to you, then I have failed. What? But what? Okay, it's fine. Okay, idea of the proof. Okay, ready? Let's just assume that we're not working with the stack. Let's just say that curly C is actually just a curve. All right. And now fix D and C, a reduced divisor, maybe a neital divisor. Maybe in a tale divisor, let's just assume the base field is perfect so we don't freak out. Of degree greater than G, all right for any L in this torsion in pick, the R torsion, by Riemann Rock, H0 of L twisted by D is going to be at least two. Okay, maybe I got some numbers wrong. Make this number be the right number. So, So, this line bundle, you can write it as O of some divisor, not uniquely, some divisor E L minus D. Okay, some reduced E L. Okay, I really hope you will try to follow this because I think this is really quite amusing. Okay, and now consider these points in this particular linear system. So we've got R times D, we've got R times E. Times D, and we've got R times E sub L, where L ranges through the torsion of the Picard group of C. Okay, so since this is R torsion, if I multiply this by R and this by R, they're linearly equivalent. And so I can make this bunch of points that's sitting inside this linear system of Rd. This is just some projective space. Let's just pretend we're over an algebraically closed field and not worry too much about the difference between arithmetic and geometry. And now here's the stupid thing you do. Is the stupid thing you do? Okay, I have a finite set of points in space. Choose some map from P1 to the linear system, okay, of degree congruent to one modulo R, so that S is contained inside of the image of gamma. In other words, just thread a rational curve through those points in space. You can certainly do that. Okay? Okay, and now this is my favorite part. Okay. This is like what, 1887, 1892, 1910? Okay. Now take this as a universal divisor. I can pull it back by gamma. Okay, what do I get? Well, now here's the magic. All right, I get this D, I get C, I get curly P, and P1. Now this has roots along the R D and the R E L, Rth roots. Because by definition, the divisor is an Rth power over those points. So I can, the universal divisor factors through. The universal divisor factors through the root stack because it has multiplicity r over each of those points. Yeah, this is the root stack over this set of points. And now if I take, if C L is equal to the residual gerb over, say, R times E L, then if I do F lower star G upper star of C L, this is. Of CL, this is EL, not R times EL. Because I've divided by R by using the stacky structure. And therefore, if I take the R torsion in the Picard group here, which is given by differences of these residual gerbs, it's rejects onto the R torsion in the Picard group there. Boom. So, I think what I'm trying to say to you is that at the heart of theorem one is this very simple calculation in classical algebraic geometry plus a submission of theory from the mid to late 20th century about root stacks, early 21st century. And that gives us this surjectivity result, sort of falls out of all, which I think is cool. Sort of falls out of all, which I think is cool. Now, the part I haven't gotten to explain to you is why this is related to the why of the period index problem, but that's, I'll just not. The point is by reducing to projective space, there's a gestalt for understanding why classes on projective space should have a certain structure that you can't see on other variety. But I don't think that's worth saying, right? So I very much appreciate your attention. I'm happy to talk about anything for this. Thank you very much. That back part came up in your maybe your first talk or something. Yeah. Yes. Yes. There are no coincidences in mathematics. I think you could think about it like this. If you take the broad group, you know, the broad group of a genus one curve and the Vayschafteli group of its Jacobian. Of its Jacobian are intimately related. And you can sort of pass back and forth between them, but just by the spectral sequence. And I think what you're seeing there is that the sort of universality of that calculation of the automorphism group is telling you that forms of moduli spaces are intimately tied to broader classes on curves. There's a fundamental relation that in all genera holds, but it's no longer like two one-dimensional things. Geometry gets more complicated, but it's still kind of baked into the system. But it's still kind of baked into the system. Any other questions? Thomas, thanks to you for giving such a wonderful series of thoughts.
