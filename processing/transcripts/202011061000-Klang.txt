All right, welcome back everyone. So it's my pleasure to introduce Inbar Klang from Colombia who's going to talk about hawkshal homology for sea and equivarian things. Thank you. Thank you for the invitation. It's good to be here. And thank you all for coming. I know for a lot of us it's been a struggle. For a lot of us, it's been a stressful and tiring week, and it's hard to pull away from refreshing the news all the time. So, yeah, so let's maybe talk about cochletmology a bit. Right, so this is about cochletmology for CN equivariant things. And by Cn, I mean the cyclic group of border N. Okay, so this is joint work with This is joint work with Catherine Adamek, Tina Gerhardt, Catherine Hess, and Hannah Kong. And because that's a lot of names, when I talk about our results, I'll abbreviate that as A-G-H-K-K. So that's what that acronym is. Yeah, so, you know, ask questions at any time. You can unmute yourselves. And I'll also be trying to keep an eye on the chat so you can ask questions there as well. All right, so here's the goal of Here's the goal of our project. So, the goal is to study CN equivalent conversions of Hochschule homology. So, just ordinary Hochschild homology for algebras or DGAs. Or DGAs. So that I'll refer to as HH and topological oxygen topology, which O denote THH. So if you went to Matt's talk yesterday, this is kind of the homology version of what he was talking about. Homology version of what he was talking about. So, yeah, so yesterday there was a talk about topological Hochschield cohomology. I'll be focusing more on topological Hochschield homology today. All right, so we'll have these equivariant versions. So THH sub CN is sort of is a topological one. One. So that's like an analog of THH, but for CN spectrum. And we'll have HHCN. So that's the algebraic version. So maybe I'll also say about the topological version. One thing that's interesting about it. One thing that's interesting about it is that it could provide an approximation for equivariant algebraic K-theory. All right. So then there's HHCN, which is the algebraic version. Algebraic version. So this is for what's called Cn grain functors. So that's a sort of souped up version of Cn rings. So this algebraic version, one advantage is that it could be easier to compute than the topological version. And maybe another interesting thing about it is that it's related to vect vectors. So this is something that you can apply. That you can apply to ordinary rings. So maybe I'll just write down: so if A is an ordinary ring, then you can sort of norm it up to be one of those CN green functors and then apply the Cn oxygen homology to it. Evaluate that at the orbit Cn on Cn. I'll talk about what all this means later on. And this is isomorphic to some version of the bit vectors spray. All right, so um sorry, what is the the Sorry, what does the subscript on the bit vector say? Oh, sorry. So that's like angle brackets n. So this is the truncation set of natural numbers that divide n. Okay, thanks. So this is like a finite bit vectors thing. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and then there's also kind of a topological restriction homology version of this that could be more related to what happens as you take the inverse limit of those. Okay. Yeah, so soon I'll do a little overview of Hochschield homology for algebras and topological Hochschield homology for ring spectra, and then explain how we take those. How we take those CN equivariant generalizations. But first, I want to just give you an idea of the flavor of the results that we have here. So, okay, so this is kind of a tool to compute the topological version. So, this is for our So, this is for RA CN ring spectrum. There is a spectral sequence that goes from the algebraic version to the topological version. So, this goes from the equivariant homology. The equivariant homology. Ah, all right. I'm gonna be less particular about those stars in a bit, but uh, okay. All right, so from the equivalent homology, yeah, so okay, sorry. So it goes from From the CN equivariant topology or just a partial tomology of green functors, so of the equivariant homology of R and it converges to the equivariant homology of this. This topological version. So here by H fancy star CN, I mean equivariate. So you can think about this as a spectral sequence. Think about this as a spectral sequence that goes from the algebraic version to the topological version. Yeah, so sometimes, as also happens in the non-equivariant case, it's easier to compute the Hochschild homology, the algebraic one for rings or graded rings or DG rings, than it is to compute. Than it is to compute the topological version. And so then you have the spectral sequence relating the two. All right, and then this is something that we used to compute the CM topological Hotchill homology of some interesting C2 ring spectra. And then there's also some more kind of structural things. Things going on here. So one thing that's really nice to know about cochlear homology theories is that they are merida invariant. So then this is true for these ones. Yeah, so inappropriate. Yeah, so an appropriate equivalence of the module categories also gives you an isomorphism on these homology theories. And another thing that's nice in terms of the relation to equivariant algebraic K-theory is that there is Is that there is a trace map? So this trace map goes from equivariant algebraic K-theory of a ring spectrum, at least one of the definitions that we have for it to THH CN of that ring spectrum. So that's kind of where the point about we can use this to approximate equivariance. Use this to approximate equivariant algebraic K-theory comes in. And this, so if R is a CN ring spectrum with a trivial action, then this is the same as the trace map from non-equivariant algebraic K-theory to ordinary topological Hoch-Hill topology. Okay, so that's kind of just an overview of the kinds of things that I want to talk about. But yeah, but now I would just want to go back a little bit and talk about Hochschield homology, topological Hochschild homology, at least the ways that I like thinking about them and the ways that end up generally nicely to this equivariant case. All right, so let's start with haxtual homology. All right, so we have A, which is an algebra over something, or a DGA, and we're going to use tensor to denote tensor product over k, just for ease of notation. So one way to construct Hochschull homology then is to build a simplicial abelian group. Build a simplicial abelian group. So you can build a simplicial abelian group, the cyclic bar construction of A. And the way that this works is that at some Bush level Q, you have A tensor with itself Q plus 1 times. So let me just say. So let me just say what the phase maps are because it'll be important to modify those appropriately when we do the equivalent equations. So here are the face maps. So if we're taking BI of A0 times 0, times 0 times 0 times 0 AQ, then most of the face maps are just multiplying two. Of the face maps are just multiplying two consecutive elements together. So A0, and then in the ith place, you multiply AI and AI plus 1, and then keep going with the rest of them. So this is for i less than q. And then the last face map is a bit different. So for the last face map, you bring the last element to the front. So AQ times A0. And then we continue as usual with the rest of the elements. All right, so that's the cyclic bar construction. That's kind of the social aspect of it. And then from this, you can get a chain complex. So cockshield chains on A. This is this. Like with bar construction, and then the differential is the alternating sum of these space maps. Another thing that you could do instead is if you have a simplicial abelian group, then you can take its geometric realization, that's a space, and then take the homotopy groups of that space. So that will give you Hochschield homology as well. But yeah, so one way to get Hochschield homology. So one way to get Hochschield homology is to take the homology of this chain complex. That's the Hawkshield homology of A. So yeah, so either the homology of this chain complex or the homotopy groups of the geometric realization of this infectional abelian group. Okay, so if we're talking about So, if we're talking about K-theory, then one thing that's been known for a while is that there is a Dennis trace map from the algebraic K-theory of A to the Hochschohomology of A. But then But then the problem is that this is not a very good approximation. So for example, if you take A to equal the integers, then Hawkschill homology of the integers is just concentrated in degree zero, whereas the higher algebraic K theory of the integers has a lot. K theory of the integers has a lot of interesting stuff in it, and not all of it is known. But in particular, if you take the algebraic K theory in a group that's degree 1 mod 4, then there's a whole copy of Z there plus some torsent. So yeah, so it's not a very good approximation for algebraic K theory. It just gets rid of too much stuff. Stuff. So one way to get better approximations is from stable homotopy theory. So, yeah, so topological Hochschule homology, and then things that you can build from the rich structure. That you can build from the rich structure that topological hoxchal homology has. Okay, so next I want to talk about rank spectra and topological hoxchild homology, but I'll just pause for a few seconds in case there are any questions and people know. So let's talk about ring spectra. So, ring spectra, those are going to be our versions of rings that we'll apply topological hoxchild homology to. So, here's an approximate brief definition for what a spectrum is. So, spectrum E is a sequence. Sequence of pointed spaces. And then you have structure maps, so sequence of pointed spaces, Vn, and then you have structure maps from the reduced suspension of Vn to En plus 1. All right, maybe instead of N, I use M. All right, so that's in some ways it's not a very illuminating definition, and also for our purposes, it's not really a precise definition because in order for the kind of homological algebra that we want to do with ring spectra, you often want more structure on your spectra than that. But it's kind of But it's that's it's kind of uh we're not going to need more details in that. So so maybe a fundamental example is the sphere spectrum. So that's, we'll denote that with Blackboard bold S and the sequence is the sequence of pointed spaces and that's Sequence of pointed spaces, and that spectrum is just all the spheres. And so then the suspension structure maps are certain homeomorphisms that we choose from the reduced suspension of Sn to Sn plus 1. Okay, so there's kind of two ways that I like to think about spectra, and one of them is going to be Is going to be particularly relevant for the purposes of this talk. So, one of them is that spectra are like topological spaces, but stabilized. So they're like topological spaces, but they're stable under the suspension. So instead of caring about homotopy groups, for example, we care about homotopy groups. Groups, for example, we care about public groups eventually after a lot of suspensions. And then a perspective that really allows us to take algebraic invariance of spectra is that spectra are like chain complexes, but they're over the sphere spectrum. Instead of over the integers. So, right, so our base ring instead of being Z, it's now the sphere spectrum. And this is part of what allows for seeing some more algebraic structure when you're taking topological hoxchild homology versus just ordinary Hoxhalt homology. So, spectra have a smash product. A smash product. So we'll denote that. Let's say you have two spectra. You can take the smash F. So this is sort of a tensor product of spectrum. So SMASH product is like a tensor product over the sphere spectrum. Like a tensor product over the sphere spectrum. And there's a lot of complicated stuff that goes in here, right? Like there's, it really took a while to define an appropriately symmetric monoidal smash product on spectra. But let's gloss over this for now. So a rank spectrum. Is a monoid for this smash product. So you have a map R smash R to R and you have a unit S to R and then you have associativity and unitality and those things. So here's some examples of the Here are some examples of ring spectrum. So, one of them is the sphere spectrum. That's our initial ring spectrum here. Can I ask something? Yeah, of course. Excuse me. Social activity and unitality and in general, are they up to homotopy in this category or strict equalities? So strict. So I guess, at least in the models that we're implicitly working with in Spectra. Working with in Spectra, you have a SMASH product that's actually symmetric monoidal, and then we're asking for a ring spectrum to be an honest ring spectrum, so actual associativity and unitality, not homotopy. So it does make sense to ask for a map, two maps of spectra to be equal, not just homotopic, honestly equal. Yeah, so an example is the sphere spectrum. That's kind of the initial ring spectrum that we're working over. And then another important thing to know is that if A is an ordinary ring, then you can take its Eilenberg-McLean spectrum. Term. So this consists of all of the various Eilenberg-McLean spaces for A, and it's a ring spectrum. So, in this way, we can embed ordinary rings into ring spectra. So, for example, that allows us to take the topological Huxley tomology of an ordinary ring and off. Of an ordinary ring, and oftentimes that can give more information than just the Hotcholtomology. Okay, so next I want to talk about topological Hochschield homology. So, this is going to look a lot like the definition for Hochschild homology, except with ring spectra instead of rings. set of rings. So here if we're taking R to be a ring spectrum then we can form a simplicial spectrum which is the cyclic bar construction on R so At level q, this is our smash with itself q plus 1 times. So that's just the analog of what we did in Hotschill homology. And I'll write some kind of impression of the face maps here. So this is going to be necessarily imprecise because you can't really talk about spectra with elements. With elements, but I'm going to pretend that we have elements and write the phase map. So the phase maps, if you're most of them, so i less than q, are just multiply two elements together using the link spectrum structure. Okay, and um and then And then for the last one, you bring the last element to the front, multiply it by R0, and then proceed with the rest of them as usual. So that's the same phase maps as for Hochschield homology, except now we're just doing everything in spectrum. So then you take geometricalization. Can you explain the meaning of the word of the cyclic part of this? Yeah, so like what do we mean by cyclic here? Why is this cyclic? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So I'll draw a picture for that soon. Yeah. How is this different from Hochschild Homo? Normally when we Normally, when we say cyclic homology or homology, you add one more differential, the con degree depth differential. This has not appeared here at all. Yeah, no, so this is not. So when I say cyclic bar construction, I don't mean cyclic homology. I just mean like, okay, like, so you can take the ordinary like two-sided bar construction, right, where you have like bimodules on both sides. Like bimodules on both sides, or something. And here, the kind of circle-ish thing that's going on here-the fact that you're actually rotating something to the front-that's just what I think that's what the cyclic is referring to here. So there's no cyclic differential here or anything. All right, fair enough. Thank you. Yeah, so if you take geometric realization of this, then that's the topological Hochschull homology of R. Homology of R. So this is a spectrum. And then if R is a commutative ring spectrum, this is even a ring spectrum. It's even a commutative ring spectrum in that case. And so then you can study its homotopy groups and stuff like that. So if A is an ordinary ring. We might say topological Hochschield homology of A when we mean topological Hochschield homology of the Eilander-McLean spectrum of A. Okay, so one thing is that there is also a trace map from The algebraic k-theory of a ring to the homotopy groups of its topological Hochschule tomology. And in fact, this factors through topological cyclic homology of A. So this is some invariant built out of the circle action on topological Hochschield homology of A. On topological Hochschield homology of A. And so, yeah, so C C is built out of pH of A in a somewhat complicated way and in good cases. So, for I guess connective ring spectra. Ring spectra, something about importance. The peak completion of topological cyclic homology is the peak completion of algebraic kick theory. Okay, so here are some more facts about these Hochschild invariants. So, Hochschild homology. So, Hochschill tomology and topological Hochschull tomology are merida invariant. So, just like you can talk about categories of modules over rings, you can talk about categories of modules over ring spectrum and topological Hochschield tomology and respects buried equivalences of those. And another really useful thing, that's how we built this topological cyclic homology. Topological cyclic homology is the topological Hochschull homology has an S1 action. So it has an action of the circle. Right, so here's like how I think of the picture of Hochschule homology and topological Hochschule homology is that you have a bunch of points. Points on the circle and they're labeled by elements of your ring or ring spectrum. And then when two points collide, you multiply their labels. So that's kind of that corresponds to the to the face maps of Do the face maps of the simplicial object. So you can think of the S1 action as corresponding to rotating the circle. Okay. So now I want to talk about the equivariant versions. But before that, are there any other questions about this THH stuff? So THH stuff. Oh, so maybe I want to say before the equivariant. Yeah, sorry, go ahead. Is there a natural spectral sequence going from, or is there some way to understand HH in terms of pH? Ah, yeah, so that's a good question. And I was, yeah, so that's what I was, in fact, going to say next. So, there's the Bachstadt spectral sequence, and this goes from the Hochschild homology of the homology of your ring spectrum and converges to the homology of THH of R. So, this is an algebraic version to the topological version. So that was the spectral sequence that we set out to generalize or to make a covariant in our work. Yeah, so a lot of the really useful complications for topological Haxial homology come using this spectral sequence. And when R is HA for a regular ring, the homology of HA is just A? H A is just A? Yeah, it's just A in degree zero. Yeah, exactly. Okay. So, all right, so let's talk about the CN equivariant story. So, this is so THHCN is going to be defined for spectra with CN actions. So let R be a CN ring spectrum. So, by this, I mean So, by this I mean that it has an action of Cn and that the multiplication and the unit are equivariant. So, for an example if you If you have a CN ring A, then you can build out of it a spectrum HA underly. So that's a C and ring spectrum. Okay, so given a thing like this, then we want to define its topological haxual homology. So So this is this THH CN, so twisted THH of CN ring spectrum. And this was defined in 2014 by Engelbeit, Blumberg, Gerhart. Your heart will blossom your bell. So a lot of names. So if I refer to this again, I'll refer to it as ABGH L M right so this is via a twisted cyclic market. Twisted cyclic bioconstruction. So what you do is you choose a generator, G, of the cyclic group of order N. And that's the same as choosing an embedding of the cyclic group of order N into the circle group. So that's kind of if we're, if we have in our minds this whole kind of circle story about topological Hochial homology, then this fits in really nicely. So the CN twisted cyclic bar construction on R. So this is just each individual. Just each individual level is going to be the same, R smash with itself, q plus one times. But the last face map is now going to be different. It's going to be twisted by the action of Cn. So if we're writing some kind of impression of this with any varietal elements, then the first Q face maps are Q face maps are the same as they were before. And the last face map, well, it brings RQ to the front, but it also acts on it by G, and then multiplies that by R0 and then proceeds with the rest of the lens. So this is with I is equal to Q. Yeah, so this is the twisted cyclic bar construction, and then THH CN of R is defined to be the geometricalization of this twisted cyclic wire construction. And this has an S1. has an S1 action, so just like THH, this one has an action of the circle, and in fact, that circle action extends the cyclic group action on R in a way. So if I'm doing a picture, the cartoon here is that you can think of an and fold covering of the circle. Of the circle. And you have some points there labeled by different things. So R0, R1, R2. And the idea is that if you move on to a different sheet of Move on to a different sheet of the covering. So, yeah, so if you go all the way around over to here, the next sheet means act on the label by this generator. Yeah, so this is kind of twisting together the CN action. The Cn action on your ring spectrum and on the circle. So the circle has a Cn action by rotation, and you're kind of intertwining this with the Cn action on R. Okay. So then there's also an algebraic version of this. So, this is Hochschill homology of grain functions and this is due to Blumberg Gerhardt. Gerhardt Hill and Lawson. So if I quote something from that paper, it'll be abbreviated B G H L. And so I guess what I want to say is that a green functor is some kind of Of equivariant version of a ring. So this is coming from the fact that we have Machiefunctors. So those are equivariant versions of abelian groups. And the way these go is that to each subgroup age in G, they assign an abelian group denoted M of G mod H, and then there are some transfer and restriction maps between M and G mod H. Between M and G mod H and M and G mod K. So this is restriction and this is transfer for K as a subgroup of H. So, for example, if you're taking a Z G module M M, then you can find a machu functor that corresponds to it. G has to be finite, right? Yes, yes, thank you. Yes. So this is all finite groups. Yeah, and we'll in fact only focus on the cyclic group case because cyclic groups are subgroups of. Pilot, subgroups of the circle, but that makes them much nicer for this purpose. So, yeah, so, right, so Machu functor, so if you have a Z G module, you can assign to it a Machu functor whose values on G mod H is the H fixed points of M. And so then the restriction maps is just the strict fixed points, the transfer maps, that's the, maybe you call it norm. Maybe you call it norm of an element in mh. Okay, we can dig that to mh. Yeah, so ZG modules are a particular kind of machine functor, at least this embedding of them. But then there's other things like homotopy groups of the ring of spectra. Like the variant spectra give you machifunctors, and machine functors are the right way to study those. So Machiafunctors have a box product, and you can consider this as the tensor product of Machi functors and then green functors. And then green functors are monods for this box product. Okay. So once you have some kind of nice symmetric monodal product on the category you're interested in, then you can again define cyclic with the. Define cyclith bar construction, so like a Hochschobe homology thing. So this is what this is what we do, or so this is what BGHL do in their paper, and then yeah, so then you can just do the cyclopar construction. So if R is a grain functor, then Then the talkshold homology is obtained via a twisted cyclic bar construction. So its description is going to be. Description is going to be a lot like the one for THHCN, so for the topological version. So at the Qth level, we box R with itself Q plus 1 times. And then we have some face maps and degeneracy maps. And we take the geometricalization or. Or take a chain complex. So here we're in algebraic context, so we can take a chain complex corresponding to this and compute its homology. Okay, so then our project was about computational tools and And structural properties of this THHCN and HHCN. So we had that equivariant boxed at Bockstadt spectral sequence, which said that under good conditions, you have a spectral sequence from the algebraic thing to the topological thing. So if we take some generalized Generalized equivariant homology of R and apply the algebraic version to it, then there's a spectral sequence that converges to this generalized equivariant homology of THH TN bar. So here this is the E star is Star is E homology here, and E is some commutative CN ring spectrum. And one thing that's really useful about this spectral sequence, just like the boxjet spectral sequence, is that if R is commutative, this is a spectral sequence of algebras. Algebras. So, in particular, if we're dealing with trying to find the topological, the CN topological Hochschull tomology of a commutative bring spectrum, then we have this nice spectral sequence of algebras, and then it's much easier to show that it collapses or to know what the differentials are based on other differentials. So, that's really just necessary for the kinds of computations that we did. And so, then we used. And so then we used this and other methods to compute things like THHC2 of MUR. So MUR is some version of an equivariant complex cobordism spectrum and THHC2 of HF2 and THC2 of H Z localized F2. Step two. Yeah, and so that's kind of the computational stuff. And then there's also the structural aspects. So we had merida invariants and we have And we have a trace map to so from this version of equivariant algebraic K-theory to THH CNFR. So maybe in the last negative one minutes that I'll have, I'll just say, so the Merida invariance comes really easily. Comes really easily when we show that Hochschild homology and topological Hochschild homology and their CN equivariant versions are all what's called bicategorical shadows. And then Merida invariance is just some notion of an equivalence in a bicategory between objects in a bicategory. So this aspect of bicategory theory just makes the Merida invariance come out really easily. And yeah. And yeah, and then this trace map from algebraic K-theory is definitely something that we plan to study more. So it appears to be the fixed points, the CN fixed points of something, and we want to see what happens there and how that goes. Okay, so I think I'll stop here. Thank you. Great. Let's thank Inbar for a very nice talk. Questions? Could you maybe loosely say how you actually define this equivariant case theory? Yeah, sure. So I guess this KCN that I'm using, so at least the reference that I know for it is from Lona Merlin's thesis. And the way it roughly And the way it roughly goes is you're taking the category of perfect R modules in CN spectra. So yeah, so perfect modules over R in Cn spectra. And then once you have this category, so K Cn of R. So K Cn of R, that's the algebraic K-theory of this category of perfect R modules in Cm spectrum. Other questions? Yeah, I have a question, but it might be a bit far-fetched. Is there a national? Is there a natural notion of A infinity ring spectrum? Or is there an analog of A infinity algebras in this topological world? Yeah, for sure. And I think. But so, sorry. So, definitely. And I think for a very long time, people talked about AI. For a very long time, people talked about A infinity ring spectrum instead of talking about ring spectra, just because before there were all these good strict models for the SMASH product, it was easier to talk about algebras over operads and work with those than to work with strictly associative ring spectra. But there is an equivalence between A infinity ring spectra and associative ring spectra. And so oftentimes you can just assume that your ring spectrum is associative and go on from there. Now, the reason I was asking, for me, the most important reason Hawkhill homology is interesting is because if you have something called a cyclic infinity algebra in a distant rings over a field of characteristic zeros, the simplest possible model, it gives you an extended one-plus one-dimensional topological field theory. My question is: if there is a way to put the target to be topological of shield homology, of a cyclic A infinity algebra. Can you construct in a cleaner way, maybe a... And the construction is very complicated of this topological field theory. My question is: if there's a more conceptual reason when you use topological host field theorem. When you use topological hoffel topology, yeah, so what do you mean by cyclic A infinity algebra? It's an A infinity algebra that has an inner product with respect to which the higher multiplication you take mk and you multiply the k elements and then you pair with one more element. This tensor is cyclically invariant. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so there is a notion of, I guess, so a similar notion of, I would call them Calabiao ring spectra. So these would be, yeah, so these would be ring spectra that satisfy this kind of self-duality or self-duality in the bimodule category up to some twists. And then that can also give you, well, you know. Well, you know, if certain things about the Kabordism hypothesis, you believe them, and you believe a bunch of like equivalences between definitions of what a Calabiao object is in an infinity to category, then they give you a topological field theory as well. Okay. But yeah, but I think the technical details there are pretty hard. They give you a topological field theory with target THH? Yeah, so. Yeah, so right. So, if you have R, which is Calabiao ring spectrum in whichever sense I'm not really going to say right now, then you have a field theory whose value on the circle is the topological Hochial tomology of R. Okay. Yeah. Great. Thank you. Was this written by someone? Is there a reference? By someone? Is there a reference? So, I guess the place that I know of it is a paper by Ralph Cohen and me. And this is if you search Calabiao ring spectra. So, this is there's something about twisted Calabiao ring spectra and a bunch of string topology stuff. Okay. Great, thank you. So, can you take some limit of the CNs to get S1? Yeah, yeah. So, I guess one of the things is that, so if you can think of THHCN as sort of norming from CN to S1. And so this is already kind of already giving you the S1 thing. You the S1 thing, and a lot of what this algebraic version is doing is it's we don't really have a good notion for an S1 machifunctor. Machiefunctors are not as nicely behaved for groups that are not finite. But you can take higher and higher cyclic groups to sort of see all of the behavior of the S1 spectrum via this more algebraic version. Okay. Okay. I have maybe a follow-up question to that. So, can you use these algebraic exposures to sort of more easily compute TR or TC or things like this? Yeah, a little, well, sometimes. We don't really know how accurate that ends up being. But there's also a sort of an algebraic TR. So this. So, this is something that's defined for an ordinary ring, and you can take a certain inverse limit of Hoch-Schild homologies of the ordinary ring evaluated at Cn mod Cn. So, this is algebraic TR of a ring. And in the case where your ring is FP, then this seems to be an extremely good. Be an extremely good, like it's just it just ends up being basically the same as TR, the topological TR. But in other cases, like when your ring is Z, it doesn't seem to behave as nicely. And so we don't know much about it yet, but it's certainly an invariant that Blumber, Gerhardt, Hill, Lawson defined and studied a bit. And it's also one of those bicategorical shadows. And so we're hoping to also study that via. We're hoping to also study that via that framework. Okay, if there are no further questions, let's thank Enbar again for a really nice talk. Thank you. And we'll see you all in an hour and a half. Thanks. Thank you.
