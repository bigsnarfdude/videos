Good evening, everyone. First of all, I would like to thank the organizers for this wonderful workshop and giving me this opportunity to talk here. So, I will talk about C-star envelopes and nuclearity-related properties of operator systems. So, I'll keep things simple. So, we'll start with limit spaces, spaces of bounded operators on limit spaces. Bounded operators on limited spaces. So the idea is very simple that we have to continue here. We consider subspaces of BH and along with subspaces we consider space of all n cross n matrices over BH and we look for the structure induced on this matrix level by MNBH. So MNBH we all know can be identified by BHN. It has matrix norm and matrix order structure. So C star algebras are self-adjusted. So, C star algebras are self-adjoint sub-algebras of VH. So, they have this matrix norm and matrix order structure on them. Now, if we relax the conditions of product here and then we get unital self-adjoint subspaces of VH which are operator systems. Still, the order and norm is there at each matrix level. If we further relax the condition and we drop the self-adjointness also, so we get rid of the involution also, then we get subspaces of BH which are nothing but operator spaces. Are nothing but operator spaces. So they only have this matrix norm structure. So after this Galvan-Narmer characterization of C star algebras independent of Hilbert spaces, Ruan in his PhD thesis, he actually characterized operator spaces abstractly with independent of the Hilbert spaces. So an abstract operator space is defined using a norm space and a sequence of matrix norms which satisfy the Matrix norms which satisfy these two properties: the property with respect to the direct sum and the property with respect to the multiplication. So, in this case, the morphisms, the good maps here are completely bounded maps which preserve the norm at each matrix level. So, Ruan proved that every abstract operator space which is defined in this way can be completely isometrically isomorphic identified with the linear subspace of VH. With the linear subspace of VH. Similarly, one can talk about abstract operator systems. Now, abstract operator systems they are defined using ordered structure at each matrix level. So, here the definition is it is a triple basically. V is a complex star vector space. We have a sequence of matrix ordering at each matrix level and an Archimedean ordering at each matrix level. So, this is how the things behave. Cn is a The things behave. Cn is a cone, it is a propagor, it satisfies this compatibility condition. And by R Time order unit, we mean this: Ren minus X, it is a positive element for at least one R. And whenever we have this condition that Ten plus X is positive for all T positive, then X should also be positive. So here the amorphisms are completely positive mass, which preserves the positivity at each. The positivity at each matrix level. So, Choi and F. Rose in 1977 gave analogous characterization to Rouhan's and Galpa Nyma, where he proved that abstract operator systems can be identified with concrete operator systems. So, in 1969, Ardison realized that C-star algebra, depending upon the Hilbert space, it acts upon, actually. So, depending upon the Hilbert space it acts upon can generate non-star isomorphic C star algebras. So, among those C star algebras the minimal one is called C star envelope. So, minimal in the sense that whenever we consider any other C star algebra with respect to any other representation then that C star envelope is actually isomorphic to the quotient of. Isomorphic to the quotient of that C-sarvella also. So we have such kind of setting. So existence of C-si-Mula was proved by Arbison in 1969 for certain classes of operator algebras and in full generality by Hamana in 1979. And there have been proofs after that. So we can talk about the maximal C-star cover also which is called universal C star cover. Maximal again in the sense that every other C star algebra generated by other C-SAR algebra generated by C-star power generated by operator system is isomorphic to the quotient of the maximum or universal. So like 10 years back, Paulson and the group they started this systematic study of tensor product in operator system in the abstract sense. So they define this tensor product as a family of cones which satisfy these three properties. Like the abstract, the abstract The abstract, the algebraic tensor product of SNT with respect to this family and this Artimedian auto unit is in our operator system. They have this compatibility condition and they have this condition that whenever phi is a map from S to Mn and Psi is a map from T to Mn, then Phi tensor Psi is also UCP if they both are UCPs. So they actually define these six tensor products over there. Tensor products over there, they were all defined using some embedding inside some C star as debrite tensor product. So, minimal one is defined like this, max comes from C star max of this, maximal enveloping, left enveloping, right enveloping. Can I ask what A and B are in the max? They are coming from any embedding S into any other C star value. Okay. Would it suffice to take? Would it would it would it suffice to take the maximal C star a little bit for S and T right? Yes, sure so later on they introduced just another tensor product that is called S, which comes from this max tensor product of the C star and us basically. So we were able to show that this S is actually coincident with S is actually coincident with this C maximal computing and max for the C star algebras. And we were able to show that this is although it is symmetric, but it is non-functorial. So all the other tensor product that they defined were functorial, but this was the only one that came out to be non-functorial. So we were able to realize that actually it is a different one from all the six. So because of this notion of tensor product, it is natural to ask what are the nuclearity things here. To ask what are the nuclearity things here because now we have more than two tensor products. In C-star algebra category, we only consider two min and max. Now we have so many. So there are several notion of nuclearities here. And all of these notion of nuclearities are actually equivalent to some of the structural property of the C-SARD of the operator system. All these properties, exactness, operator system, local lifting property, double commutant expectation property, weak expectation property. weak expectation property, C star nuclearity, CPFP, the completely positive factorization property, they are generalization of these properties from the C star category. All the same, so therefore it there's no re there's no intensive product. There's no re there's no minimum tensor product there, so there's no statement about nuclearity. Nuclearity is equivalent to the nuclearity is when the max and minimum tensor products coincide. So what does it mean for the A S? Those are exotic tensor norms. It's just saying the maximum coincides with those exotic tensor norms. So when one of them is nuclear, this doesn't say anything about the nuclear then is. I don't understand what she's asking. Is it better if we direct the questions to the speaker, please? It is a question from the speaker. I apologise. What? What's the question? Do I? What am I supporting? Oh, sorry. I guess I just didn't understand whether the proposition said something about you. This proposition? This proposition? Or if A and B and A or B or A. It is simply saying that, sorry. This proposition is simply saying that whenever we take, because C star algebras are operator systems, this tensor product S is a tensor product in the category of operator systems. So whenever we restrict this tensor product for the C star algebras, it actually coincide. These three coincide. Essential, C and max, they coincide. This is all it is. Max, they coincide. This is all it is saying. There is no minimal one here. And nuclearity actually requires that this should be true for every operator system. So these properties are equivalent to nuclearity, different nuclearities that we see here. Can I ask real quick, just as a reminder, this OS LLP, is this the same thing as those always lambda LLPs or lambda equal one or is this something different? line equal one or is this something different? It is actually the same. Okay. So all these properties can actually be defined on these three categories different. All of these are extendable but this nuclearity is the only one that is not there for operator spaces but it is there for C star algebras and operator systems. Because finite dimensional matrix algebras are not, they do not have this projective and injective norm same. See, so there are several interesting examples of operator systems and operator systems because they are closely related to C-star algebra. The examples, they generally come from the famous examples in C star algebra categories. So, first one is this group operator system. Group operator system is coming from this group from group C star algebra. So, it was proved earlier. So it was proved earlier by Cabroup, Paulson and Dodorov that this when we consider the free group then this is actually independent of the generators and it is not nuclear. When we go to this theorem by Lance, we know that C star D is nuclear whenever G is enabled. So it was a natural question that came to us that what happens to the group operator system when the group is enabled. So, this was the question because, and we observed that this C star envelope of the group operator system is nothing but the full group C star algebra. So, generally, if we ask after this, the question was like, what happens if the C star envelope in general, not only the full group C star algebra, if in general a C star envelope is nuclear, what happens to the nuclearity? What can we say about nuclearity of the operator system itself? So, we came across. So, we came across a few examples here, like Kitchenberg and Wasseman in 1998. They had already given this example where the operator system was min-max nuclear, but its C-star envelope was not nuclear. And the other direction was equally mysterious. So, what we found out that it is a one-way result that whenever C-star envelope is nuclear, we can say that the operator system is nuclear. But in some special cases, we call those cases where the operator system has enough unitaries for the C-star. has enough unitaries for the C star envelope. In that case we get this result that C star envelope is nuclear if and only if the operator system is min S nuclear. So in this case of group operator system we get that group operator system is min S nuclear if and only if the group is amelioral. We were able to find the list of all min-max group operator system if we consider the minimal generating set here. We could show that Set here. We could show that whenever U is a minimal generating set of a finitely generated group G, and then the group operator system is min-max. The maximal nuclearity it can attain is only in the case when the order of the group is less than or equal to 3. So likewise like group operator system one can talk about graph operator systems also. So again here we were able to show that the graph operator systems are min-max nuclear. Systems are min-max nuclear if and only if each component of the graph is complete. So then we moved on to this classification theory. There we saw that we know that unital separable C star algebra is exact if and only if it admits a unital embedding into the Kohn's algebra of order 2. So again the question was are separable exact operator system embeddable in this console operator algebra? So the answer came in negation. So we have Came in negation. So we have examples by Pinsberg and Rossiman and Lupini. They have considered examples which were operator systems were exact but which could not be embedded into O2. The next question was if this is not the condition that an operator system can be embedded into O2 then what was the condition in that case. So we were looking for this answer that under what condition operator system are actually amenable in OTU. So we got the answer in In this way, that the operator system is embeddable in O2 if and only if its C star envelope is exact, not the operator system itself. But if the C star envelope is exact, then the operator system can be embedded into O2. So we got some results about calculation of C-SARD envelopes also. It is very difficult to calculate C-SARD envelopes of operator system in general, but few of the results were actually. But few of the results were actually they gave us certain calculation for C star ml ups of certain operator systems. Then we moved on to exploring the inductive limit of operator system. We were able to show that whenever we have this increasing collection of operator system such that the complete order embedding extends to a star homomorphism onto the C-star envelopes, then the C-star envelope and inductive limit they come here. They come. And in special cases, when we have enough unit trees here, the limit, inductive limit, can be embedded into the whole cell depth. Can I ask? Because I think knowing when you've got sort of an embedding that's going to extend to a C star algebra, there's a fair number of results about when that's possible. Can you say anything about that? Like when that assumption is going to be satisfied, that you know that the complete order embeddings extend to star homomorphisms? We do have certain examples. Uh we do have certain examples uh but I've not included those examples in this slide. I can provide those examples. Later on we actually moved on to generalizing this Hagar up tensor product and maximum projective tensor product of operator spaces to this category of operator systems where we were able to define this, we were able to consider these three conditions with. were these three conditions which allowed us that this cone is actually forming this tense product, S tensor T and operator system. So we could use the archipelagoization property that is another thing that we can say here. So S tensor lambda T was a tensor product that we defined for operator system category that was a new one. So this came out to be a functorial operator system tensor product and we were able Tensor product, and we were able to show in this case that the inductive limit has this relation whenever we consider the operator system tensor product. After this inductor limit, we moved on to working on projective limits also. Projective limits are in general not close under this category of operator system and even C-star algebras. So, we were able to define some operator system structure on the projective limits of the operator systems. Also, there also we were able to define. Also, there also we were able to define certain density products and we got some good results over there. Also, what's our differences? Yes, one question was, so is there possibly a replacement for O2 for operators? For O2 for operator systems, so that you can find sort of a universal object that they will embed into operators. This is actually something called Cohn's operator system also. And you can define this using the isometries generating the Cohn's operator system. But it does not behave in the way that we want it. Like we wanted the exact operator system to be sitting inside S2, we could not prove it. We could talk about that too. I asked one more because you said something that surprised me. You said that the young C-star algebra per group actually coincides with the full C-star algebra of your group. So that order. So that was a bit surprising to me. So is there. Yeah, but I mean, no, I just think it's a surprising fact. So the, so, also, because, you know, this is. Also, because you know this is going to sort of surject onto the reduced C-star algebra itself, is there like a problem? Yes, we have results over there a lot. For the reduced group C-star algebra, we'd actually define reduced group operator system and we have certain results. I can't remember which slide it was, maybe like a third or the fourth slide. Slide. Oh, yeah. This one? Yeah, I'm not going to sit. Wait, so what what is S on this So this is something like the second one of space, so maybe this is stupid. But like, in the first box on this slide, like, is the idea that you're just sort of closing the thing up by, you know, doing the C star operations? Like, you know, multiplying it. Like, so you've got this S and then you just kind of multiply it star all the things so that you get C through alpha. That you get C-screen out, right? Close it all up. Yes, yes, yes. But then I don't understand how there could be any bigger way of doing this on a C-screen. How is there a maximal one? How isn't there just the one? That's it. See, there are several representations. An operator system, it acts upon several. There is a possibility that there are more than one input space that it acts on. So depending upon the representation we are considering, we can consider. representation we are considering we can consider this C star cover that will be different so we are saying that for whatever representation we take this possibility is there to come here And let's kind of review. And as a reminder, tomorrow the presentation will start at 8.45, so that we have a bit at time. So that will have a little bit of time to wrap up your clip. So I have to keep the bread and the massive ones to make it. I don't know if I'm not sure that the fact that they created the back part of the picture. So the answer. So we are actually starting to send the stars to the right thing. You have to do that tomorrow. Yeah, once you work in the plan, I think that should be worse than that.  So you guess your feet are pictured on the front. Thank you. Our division was not for the show. Yeah, this is this is more. So I'm going to see the microphone for the test of So you can even for example. There is also like S L. This is a length function. This is why I think it This is why I think it might be interesting to see these linked functions that you were talking about. So that's one reason. I think we are going to ask, you know, based on what we've talked about, what things to talk about. Yeah, because so there is this thing, right? So he's going to prove that. Act on a space, metric space, with the conditions that we were listening. And then the overleaf, I just have to go through my advisor, and he will most likely be okay with it, even though it's quite one of the things that I want. One of the things that I want to deal with. I have seven days to figure it out. No, the problem is that we have to go to the strategy with our website. Now you have to find... So if one NK theory has already used, then it's fine. But this is very difficult to understand the weight for viral face and one. So post conjecture is a little bit more general than the post conjecture. He proved that if you have a completion about conditional completion meaning that I have the norm here. Completion for a norm. Obligation for a norm. Right. And is it unconditional? I don't understand why that name is. Unconditional completion if this norm only depends on the absolute value of the function. Meaning that if you if you have there are there are For two functions if you have this inequality for every g then you have the same for the norm. And then you can build the ch that I was talking about. So this is incompetent conditions, right? Examples. And one is an incompational condition. And one is just a very hard. No, no, no, but it's but then we need to then. What?
