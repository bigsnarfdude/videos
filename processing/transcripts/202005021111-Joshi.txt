Topic of this conference, but it's great being here anyway. Thanks for having me. So, the title of my talk is Heke Operators on Vector-Valued Modular Forms, and this is joint work with my supervisors, Vincent Bouchard and Thomas Kreisik. So, let's get started. So, the objects we are studying are called vector value modulo forms. I'll motivate them a bit later, but these are basically modulo forms. Bit later, but these are basically moulophones that transform with a representation rho of the metablactic group. So the metablactic group is nothing but the double cover of SL2Z. So it's made up of these pairs where you have a matrix in SL2Z and a holomorphic function phi on being squared gives you C tau plus D. And in addition, you also have a choice of a vector space W. So in the definition that So, in the definition that we use, the modular forms have three arguments. So, there's the standard argument in the upper half plane tau, and then there's two vector-valued arguments. So, under this action of the metaplectic group, which is just the modular transformation for tau, and then some kind of linear transformation on the two vector-valued arguments, the modular form transforms with the representation rho up to these form up to. Up to these form, up to these automorphic factors. So, in my talk, we don't assume holomorphicity. So, there's usually when you talk about modular forms, you want them to want to have some kind of growth condition, but we don't impose it anything here. So, the certain definition that you might be used to are when you set alpha and beta to zero, so you just have a vector value. zero so you just have a vector valued function in tau and those are called vector valued modulo forms so i'll i'll i'll do be abusing notation a little bit when i call these modular forms when when they are not holomorphic uh right so what is the motivation to consider such objects so there so the good thing is that they come very naturally uh in a lot of areas of math so in particular Of areas of math. So, in particular, they come up as characters of rational vertex operators, rational vertex operator algebras, and generating functions of enumerative geometry invariants. In particular, what are called Donaldson-Thomas invariants, and that is what motivated the topic of this paper. And however, they are also interesting to number theorists. They are modular forms, so one would expect them to be useful. expect them to be useful to to doing to proving theorems in number theory so in particular they were they were introduced by selberg to study classical modular forms and there's a lot of work done by borscht who use these to uh in the theory of automorphic forms in particular to find infinite product formulas uh so our goal is to construct hecke operators on vector valued modular forms hecke operators always nice they can be used to prove interesting properties Interesting properties. So, the idea is to study this as HEC operators on these objects. So, we will be starting with a lattice, a non-degenerate even lattice of some type. So, it's an indefinite lattice of some signature. And you can construct what is called a discriminant form associated to it. So, it's just a Belian group L prime over quotiented by L, where L prime is a dual ladder. By L, where L prime is a dual lattice with the extended linear extension of the quadratic form q and every discriminant form gives rise to what is called the whale representation, which I'll be defining shortly. So, in addition to this lattice, we also have what is called the rescale lattice. So, it's the same lattice, but with the quadratic form rescaled by a factor r. And you can compute the rescale discriminant form, which is just these. scale discriminant form which is just these this abelian group L prime over R modulo L and so a discrete form naturally gives rise to a unitary representation of the metaplectic group and this acts on the group algebra of the discrete form so this representation is it's sufficient to define this through its action on the generators of the metaplectic group TNS so the T matrix Group T and S. So the T matrix acts on a basis element E lambda by some exponent. So it just multiplies the basis element and the S matrix acts as a sum of basis elements weighted by these phases. So this is a representation which comes up naturally in different areas of number theory and physics. So one place is through the Siegel theory. Is through the Siegel theta function. And this is another object that will be very fundamental in this talk. So if you consider this vector space L tensor R, which is an indefinite vector space, but you can project it into its positive and negative subspace, some choice of positive and negative subspaces. And through this, you can construct what are called Siegel theta functions. So they were introduced by Borschart. By Bauchards to study automorphic forms. And so, for every coset of your discriminant L prime or modulo L, you have this single theta function, which is the sum of exponentials. So, it's just the positive definite part of the quadratic form multiplied by tau, and then tau bar multiplied by the negative definite part. And then you have this linear. linear this linear linear bracket here and you can put all of these together in a vector valued function theta and an interesting property here is that this is a vector valued modular of a weight b plus over 2 b minus over 2 so that this was the type of the lattice so the uh the difference it gives the signature over 2 so the is So, Bocha has proved that this is a vector-valued form that transforms with the whale representation rule L. So, I'll briefly introduce two lemmas which are important in our construction. And the first one is what is called the pairing lemma. So, you can, there is this natural pairing between two vector-valued modular forms, which is just this sum. So, you take the component modulo. So, you take the component, multiply the components, and which is linear in the first argument and anti-linear in the second argument. So, you can see that if you take two vector-valued modular forms and pair them together, then the answer is obviously a scalar-valued modular forms because this transforms in the dual representation. So, the product transforms in the trivial representation, but it is also the converse is also true. So, if this pairing gives you a scale. So, if this pairing gives you a scalar-valued modular forms, the first argument which you pair with the single-theta functions should actually be a vector-valued modular form. And the second is what can be called as a rescaling lemma. So, what this does is basically it rewrites siegel theta functions related by a modular transformation or by the Transformation or by the transaction of the metaplectic group as a sum over secal theta functions of the rescale lattice. So on the left hand side, you just have you start with some chosen theta function and you act on by the metaplectic group. But what's interesting is that you can rewrite this as a sum over theta functions of the rescale lattice weighted by some exponentials. And this delta r is just a number. Delta R is just a non-vanishing condition. So this just restricts the sum to a subset, which is where these theta functions appear. So using these two lemmas, you can define a Hecke operator on vector-valued modular forms. So this is a definition where you start with a vector-valued modulo form in this space of some weights and Space of some weights and transferring with the wheel representation. And this is a long formula, but it will be clear in the next slide why it is defined this way. But an easy way to understand this is as the composition of two operators. So if you look at this term, so this is just the modular transformation acting on the components of your psi. And what this does is the components are multiplied. The components are multiplied by a number. So, this is basically a composition of the modular transformation and a permutation of the components weighted by this sum. So, this definition gives you a kind of a lift from a scalar-valued modular form, and that is the crux of the idea here. So, what this operator call it does is it lifts the Is it lifts the scalar-valued Hecke operator? So on the left-hand side, you have a scalar-valued form and the ordinary scalar-valued operator acting on it. And this theorem states that doing this is same as acting on by the vector-valued operator quality and pairing it with the now rescaled theta functions instead of the original theta function. So it's just a lift of what this pairing operator does. What this pairing operator does, how this Hecke operator behaves with the pairing of the SQL theta functions. So, from this lemma, it immediately follows that this indeed does what you want, that it maps modular forms of a lattice L to those of a rescale lattice L bracket R. And now it is a good question to ask if it satisfies any algebraic properties, which might be useful to. Which might be useful to prove theorems. And the answer is yes. So you can define the scaling operator, which just scales the two variables alpha and beta. So it does nothing to the modular variable tau. So you can lift this guy to an operator in the vector value setting through what was done in the last slide. So through this kind of pairing. And once you have this, then you can have similar theorems as to Similar theorems as to in the scalar value setting. So, if you composition of two operators with co-prime n and m is just gives the product, and for primes, you have some sort of recursion relations between these vector-valued operators. So, that's kind of nice, but so we have a map which maps, we have an operator which maps forms of a lattice to the rescale lattice, but it might be. Lattice to the rescale lattice, but it might be nice to have an operator that maps it to the same lattice. So that is possible for when this number r is a square number. So in this case, there is a sub-representation of the original lattice in the rescale lattice. So if you look at this subsphere span by these elements f lambda, so this is basically just averaging elements of the rescale lattice such that when multiplied by n. Multiply it by n, they give a particular element of the original lattice. And it turns out that when you restrict the wheel representation of the rescale lattice to this subspace, you get something which is isomorphic to the wheel representation of the original lattice. So this allows you to define a projection operator. So you can sort of just project down into this smaller space of from. Of from the modular forms of the rescale lattice to those of the non-rescale. And if you compose this with the quality that I defined before, you get an operator that maps modulo forms of the same type. So there's no rescaling. And so you might ask, this is a very weird construction. It's not very standard in number theory, but it turns out. Number theory, but it turns out that this can be mapped to other constructions in literature. So, Brudy and Stein did a construction for square numbers, R equal to N square. And what they did was through a double coset construction, which is a typical way to construct Heke operators. So they extend the wheel representation to a double coset of the metabolic group and define a double coset operator. And it turns out that our operators are the same. So if you compare, then So, if you compare, then they are exactly the same for square numbers. Now, we also have new operators which are therefore not square numbers and which rescale the lattice. So, that's completely new. So, to conclude, we found these two kinds of operators: one which rescale the lattice and one which don't. And so, there are some natural. And so there are some natural further questions, which is if this can be generalized to other representations. So this was done just for the wheel representation. And it would be nice to do it for other representations, especially, say, congruence representation. And it might be possible to do it using a similar kind of pairing argument, but pairing it with something which are not theta functions, but something else that is well known in another representation. Representation. And some other directions that we are exploring is to apply this to enumerative geometry and vertex operate algebra. So these come up very naturally as components of the rating functions of Donaldson-Thomas invariance. And it turns out that these operators have also a physical meaning in conformal field theory, where what they are doing is some kind of Galois conjugation of Conjugation of characters of a VOA. So it's quite interesting that these such elementary construction gives very important applications. So I'll just stop here. Thanks for your attention. Thanks, Anikat. Are there any questions? Felix, thank you for speaking again. Thank you.
