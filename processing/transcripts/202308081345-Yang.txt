Thank you. Thank you. So, first of all, I would like to thank the organizers, Yachun, Min Wei, Yonghua, and Wei for organizing this workshop. And then it's my pleasure to give a talk here. So, today, in the next half hour, I will try to summarize what I have been doing about the Pendo. About the pando or pando type operators, about the well-posedness, and see how the cancellation can be found to have some mathematical theory. So before that, I would like to thank my collaborators for all these years, the Shanghai Jiao Tong team. I'm sure Ya Guang is there. Okay, Sanjia, Chen Jie, and Seifeng also. Sanja, Chenjie, and Seifeng also. And then my student, Yongpinuhuang, and also there's a team in Wuhan Yu, Weisi, Chaojiang, and Shuyue, who is a student of Weisi, and Nadei Mashimoti, and Dohua, and also my current colleague Chu Zhang in Podiyu. Okay, so what we have been doing is to So what we have been doing is to try to study the Pendle equations or related equations or then see how to establish some mathematical theories for this equation. So as we know that the Prendo equation was derived by studying the Levi-Stokes equation near a solid boundary with the low-slip boundary condition. The lowest lift boundary condition. So it was introduced by Prendo more than 100 years ago. This is indeed a revolution result on the fluid dynamics. So now intuitively, this means near the solid boundary, if we impose the no-slip boundary condition, then there's a very thin regime. Okay. Resume, okay, in the width of the square root of epsilon. Epsilon is the viscosity coefficient that in this layer, the fluid is basically governed by an equation, which is called Pendle equation. And then this means in this layer, the conversion somehow balance the viscosity. Okay, so in terms of mathematics, if we terms of mathematics if we plot the Prandtl answers okay so because the width is one over square epsilon so we can introduce the fast variable z over square epsilon here we assume the layer the boundary is at z equals to zero so part this prandton answers into the incompressible ns then if you compare the leading order term then you can divide the famous pen Can derive the famous Pendle equation. Okay, so the Pando equation is just a time evolution equation for two parallel tangential velocity components pass the divergence field condition on the velocity field. So of course, when epsilon goes to zero or in the far field, and then the fluid match the outer flow, which is governed by order. Okay, so this is the setting. This is the setting. So the problem is, for example, how to show that this equation is well posed in some suitable function space. And this is extremely difficult in 3D. And another third question is whether this expansion is correct. That is whether the NS equation is the solution to the NS equation is the superposition of the Pendle equation. Of the Pandora equation and also the solution to order, okay, up to the leading order. And this is even more challenging. Okay, and for all these problems, there are some results, but there's still many unsolved problems. So here I just mentioned a few results about the observation of some intrinsic property of this equation. Property of this equation to have well-posed this. Of course, the most famous work in this direction was obtained by Olendik in the 60s, when she introduced the, we call it Olendik monotonticity condition for well process in 2D. And then without any condition, the first result was proved by Samartino Kelfis. Proof by Samartino Kelfish in 1980 80 1998, which is the somehow the analytic setting, okay, the dentist Kanya theory for this model. Okay, so if we also include the so-called favorable pressure condition, then adopting and litigant. And Lijun okay in 2004, FOVD obtained the global with solution okay to this system. And then later on, there was a two group of work on the somehow we proved the O-Linux modontistic condition by cancellation using cancellation. And this, I will mention it a little bit later. Okay, one group is at the center, one she and Wang, Xi, and me, and another one is much more. Okay, so all these are basically 2D theory. Okay, now without any structural condition on the background flow, and then so far now we know that the optimum function space is the rate 2 with index 2. And in 2D, this was proved by Dirt John Array, and then we. And then with VCD and Machbooty, we prove this in 3D. Okay, so of course, there are many other famous work, important work, but I don't have time to mention them here. And I don't think I have time to mention this also. And there are a lot of good works in this direction. Okay. Now, let me point out the difficulty. Okay. So the difficulty. Oops. Okay. Oops, okay, 10 minutes only. The difficulty is if we load the penal operator by p. Okay, so this is a degenerate operator because the w, the low-mo velocity field can be solved from the divergence 3 and pi into p. Then the Prandtl equation in 3D is only one, only two equations. So in 2D, only one equation. So the difficulty comes from the coefficient for the tangential component u and v. Component U and V depends on the tangential derivative. Okay, so this is called the loss of derivative property. Okay, so as you can see that this property can be overcome if we work in the analytic space, because the integration in time can somehow absorb one order of derivative in if we consider the analytic space because. Analytic space because this standard or basic inequality holds for any m. Okay, so we can swing the radius of the energy distinct to absorb one order of derivative. But this doesn't work if the space is not so good, not as good as analytic. For example, in Jeray function space, then one order derivative corresponding to m Corresponding to m to some power, the power is greater than one, then this doesn't work. You need to do a little bit more. Okay, now organic classical work based on coordinate transformation. For steady flow, the one-way transformation can be used to reduce the equation into a degenerative parabolic. Degenerate parabolic. And also for the anesthetic case, the famous Coco transformation will do the same. Okay. Under the monotone density condition. Means if in 2D, the tangential component is monotone in the low-mode direction, then you can replace the low-mode coordinate by U. And then you consider omega, which is the vorticity in the. Which is the vorticity in the layer as the unknown function, then you have a degenerate parabolic equation where the maximum principle can be applied. Now, this kind of, if we don't use coordinate transformation, this can also be done as we know. Okay, so we can use the cancellation either by observing the conversion term u and ohm w or by using. W or by using the equation for the vorticity. Okay, so this is the idea in these two papers by using introducing some good unknown functions so that if you consider the time evolution or the Prandtl operator adding on this new unknown function, then there's no loss of tangential derivative. So, as you can see, the denominator in this In this unknown functions depends on the u sub y. Okay, so that's why the monotonticity condition is essential. Okay, and also these two good unknowns basically are equivalent because the factor, there's only one factor difference, which is because omega is a positive or monotone, even though it will converge to zero. It will converge to zero when y goes to infinity. So it's up to a weight. So they are basically the same. So this kind of cancellation, we can understand them now as directional derivative. So what this means is the following. Okay, so let's simply forget about this lemma, but look at the comment first. So the tech loss of So the loss of tangential derivative means if we look at the derivative in X, okay, which means is the vector field one zero dot gradient F. So in this direction, we have loss of derivative, okay, because if you differentiate nth order, then the source term involves m plus one order, okay. However, for this physical For this physical system, if you can find a direction, of course, it depends on the solution in a good way. Then along that direction, if you take derivative, then you don't have the loss of derivative difficulty. So this is what I call the vector field cancellation. So it turned out that for the 2D Pandel equation, the direction is the The direction is just a velocity field differentiate in the normal variable y or z twice. Okay, that's the direction. Okay, so let's come back to this lemma. This lemma just tells us that very simple lemma. So if you find a vetted function, theta, okay, if you use the pando operator acting on this theta, it has this property, theta. Theta dot gradient acting on the velocity field. Then for any function f, okay, if you take derivative along the direction of theta, then you can, yeah, this quantity, this quantity, this we call it another unknown function. If you lose, use plan operator acting on it, then the source term, the right-hand side, will have the We will have the same order of derivative, tangential derivative, as the unknown function for the f. Okay, so this means the theta in principle will give you the good direction. Of course, this good direction depends on the solution. Along this direction, you have estimate whether you can compare to the tangential direction. Tangential direction, then for that, we need to use the structural condition, like the oring monotonic condition, and so on and so forth. Okay, so so this is another way to understand this. Okay, so for this, we can have two examples. At least one is for the 2D pental operator, and the other one is for the MHD. And then for MHD, you can also find. And then for MCD, you can also find a good diversion in the fully non-linear regime to see how it works. Now, here I would like to mention another direction is if there's low structural condition, then by the very interesting work by Johan and Tomi, and then more than 10 years ago, it shows that the The best function space we can inspect is the Java2, okay. JOA function space with index 2 because they construct some going bolt in that function space if the shear flow has some non-degenerate critical point. Okay, so of course, how to justify How to justify the this is the firm is for stability, okay. So, to prove uh stability, well-post list, then we need to do go along another direction, okay, to to to find some good unknown functions. So, as I just mentioned before, if you use only one order, one print operator acting on the unknown function, if the source term If the source term lost one order of derivative, then the best you can get is the analytic function theory, okay, theory in analytic space. So in order to have generate two, that means you have to q m square other than m. Okay, so for that reason, you can intuitively, you can think, you can understand that you have to find some. To find some way to show that p squared, that means you operate the pento operator twice, then you only lose one order of derivative. Okay, so if you can achieve this, then you can show the durator well-proof this. Okay, so how to do this, in fact, is now is known, but in the analytic way. Okay, there's a low so far, I don't know any intuitive or physical. Know any intuitive or physical explanation on this. So the problem, so let's look at these equations. So here I put the pin view. Pin view is just a pandal operator with the fixed viscosity mu. Okay. This mu can be choose to be one because this is the factor in front of the epsilon for the viscosity. Okay. And then now if Now, if you consider this operator acting on u sub x, okay, then the source term is not good because the source term involves the normal velocity component differentiate in x because omega comes from the divergence free condition. It involves also tangential derivative. So, here you have a second order derivative. Okay, so the order derivative okay so the source term is second order derivative but the uh the uh unknown function u sub x is first order okay so there's no balance here so for this as more motivated by a dead johava array we introduce the oxidative functions that is we don't know how to estimate omega or w sub x so we just define a Just define a function, this script u, okay, so that if you use the Prandtl operator acting on this integral equals to this negative of this very big function, okay. Of course, this time evolution equation can be showed that it is well posed, okay, and then you can do the subtraction, okay? So you can, because what you don't like is Because what you don't like is this back term. Okay, so you can multiply it by use of z and then take difference and define this as omega. And similarly, for other tangential derivative or tangential component, then you can introduce lambda lambda tilde delta delta tilde. So for this another unknown function, you can check that if you use panda operator etting or for example lambda, then the right lambda, then the right-hand side is first just first order derivative. Okay, first order derivative in x, okay, in the tangential component x or y. So now that means for the lambda, because lambda somehow is first order, the source term is first order. So for lambda is very good. There's no loss of tangential derivative. But in from lambda to u sub x, we still need to estimate. u sub x we still need to estimate this capital u okay so for this capital u if you look at its equation that is the pandal operator acting on u then you do some calculation you can check that it involves only lambda sub x or delta sub x this new uh defined newly defined function uh with first order derivative so combine all this together So, combine all this together, then you can see that if you apply this pandemic operator twice, because here we use panda operator twice, then you only lose one order of derivative. Okay, so this is why in Jerry 2, we can have the well-postness. Okay, so this idea, in fact, can be applied to other Pendle type equation as we did for MHD or. MHD or hyperbolic hydrodynamic equations, as I mentioned later. Okay, oops, let me check my time. Okay, we still have eight minutes. Okay, so here I would like to mention some pental type equation. So there are many of them. Okay, so I just highlight the parameters eta and view. Okay, so if eta is zero. So if eta is zero, beta is infinity, beta is the range for y, okay, then this is the classical planto. Okay, so for hydrostatic NS, then you consider the problem in a bounded in my domain, okay, in the channel. And then you also don't have the hyperbolic turn, so eta is zero and so on. Okay, so if the So on okay, so if low viscosity is Euler, and then you also have hyperbolic pando. Hyperbolic pando, in some sense, is even more complicated than the pando itself, that this you have this hyperbolic trend. And also, if it is in the channel, then you have the hyperbolic hydrostatic NS. Okay, so for these systems, we also have a lot of literatures. Okay, here I Literatures okay. Here, I list some of them, okay. Some uh very interesting work in this direction, and recently, okay, uh, R Hodge and Pico Pinzang, okay, and also by Johara Ray, Ia, I, and Maikawa, and Wong Wong, again, and for the hydrostatic NS and so on. And we, and also for the hydrostatic Euler. isostatic Euler, then there's a convex condition, again, so on by much more and so on. So all this I can summarize in this table to be precise. So as you can see for this hyperbolic type equation, Pando type equation, there's still some question marks, even in 2D. So for the hyperbolic pandemic Uh uh uh resonate uh with uh we see and and pin we did some result but still in the JRA function space or an analytic space in Y and did something but SOPOLF then don't know whether it's true or not okay and isostatic Euler also not known and hyperbolic isostatic NS not known okay so there's still a lot of uh interesting problems Interesting problems, even in 2D for this type of equations. Okay, so now in the last five minutes, I would like to talk about a little bit further from the mere flow. Okay, this is related to the Tomb-shooting instability. Okay, because we know that after the candle, the Lamir flow, then there's a Lamir flow, then there's some kind of transition layer or period, and then after that, and then you have turbulence. Okay, so along this diversion, there's also a lot of interesting work. So, one of the phenomena is called the Tomi-shading by Prento's two famous students. That means if a little bit far from the mere flow, if there's a If there's a small perturbation, for example, induced by invisible acoustic sound wave, even closer to the boundary, because the Prandtl layer is square of epsilon and here is closer, okay, is epsilon to the 5 over A. Then here, very small perturbation will lead to amplification, even linearly. Even linearly to have a growing, and then before the long linear key. Okay, so that means even in the linear level, there's some kind of instability. Okay, the unstable eigenvalue, you can say that. Okay, so this is well known in physics. Okay. So if we use in compressible model, then this means there's a frequency or Frequency or wave number in some regimes, epsilon to the 1 over a to epsilon to 1 over 12, and then there is unstable eigenvalue with this scaling. Of course, unstable means the wheel part is positive. The wheel part is epsilon to the one over fourth, okay. When the wave number in this wavelength in this uh in in this interval if we linearize a profile uh a shear uh flow profile with boundary layer of uh pando boundary layer okay so basically this corresponds to the uh jerwei uh 302 function space okay so mathematically this has been vigorously proved by uh the instability by uh yango By Yen Guo, Guan Ye, and Yen. And then also the validity of the Pendle expansion was by Maikawa Mashimodi. And then now, one of the analytic tools is the Oxmerfeld equation. So Oxmerfell equation, if you look at the 2D incompressible Levy stokes. with stocks, this can be devised very fast or straightforwardly. Because if you linearize the INS around a shear full profile and look for solution in this form, then you have the validity of the NS also mentioned also Jihara Ray, Maikawa and Mashimuti. Okay, three of them. And much more D, okay, three of them because now I have to be quick. So, this is the equation for the swim function, okay? Because 2D divergence 3 means the weighted field means a stream function. Now, without the stream function, for example, if we consider the compressible levy stocks, okay, even isentropic, then there's low stream function representation. So, for this, with my colleague Zhu Zhang, recently, we recently we derive the OS equation for the compressible NS, okay, so which is in this form. Okay, so here you can see there's the function A involve the Mach number and also the background. So you can see that if for this subsonic, the Mach number less than one, A is a very good function. Okay. So if Mach number zero corresponds to What number is zero correspond to the incompressible case, then the OS compressible NS is just simply the Casco OS. Okay, so with this and also the Lil approach, we call it quasi-compressible stokes approximation or iteration, then we can show that the TS equation, TS instability or TS wave for the compressible in the compressible setting. Okay, so this is the film, okay, for the compressible. I don't think. The compressible. I don't think I have time. So, last minute. Okay. Last minute, I would like to say that for the MHD, some of this idea can be borrowed. But for MHD, there are many cases, depends on the physical perimeter valence number, magnetic variance number, and Hamann numbers. So, for this, we also can do something. But 3D is very extremely difficult. It extremely difficult. For 3D, the difficulty comes from the secondary flow. So, many years ago, with Ya Guang and Chen Jie, we did something somehow to avoid the secondary flow to obtain some well-posedness or some theory. But one of the conclusion from those analysis is that for any general shear flow profile in 3D, there are while in 3D, they are unstable. Okay, so recently with my two collaborators, Sun Wei Min and Wang Yue, we try to somehow do something to the 3D. So we have some idea, but still go through the whole process. Also, for the validity in the compatible setting, there's Setting, there's some work recently by Li Sun Sin and Zhang Chu. Okay, so I think I don't have any more time. So, thank you.
