Victor, I'm a PhD student at the University of Bern and I work with Lagrangian modeling. In this presentation, I'll be presenting how we did size-dependent three-dimensional microplastic transport in the Mediterranean. And this is work I've been doing with Mikel and Eric, which are both also in this call, and then Charlotte Laufkutter in Switzerland. So I think everyone, after the last few days, knows in general what the current gene modelling is and has seen. Is and has seen that Lagrangian modeling is quite commonly used in our field. The advantage, of course, is that because you are really representing microplastic particles as these virtual particles, you can really see how different physical processes affect the particle transport on really the individual particle level. And this has been used widely in the field and also in my own earlier work to study large-scale phenomena such as why do particles accumulate in the ocean. Why do particles accumulate in the ocean gyres? And how can you look at, for example, global beaching patterns? However, what is generally a simplifying assumption in many of these models is that it's limited to two-dimensional transport. And here you then assume that the particles you are modeling are floating microplastic and that these remain at the surface and will float forever, or at least as long as your simulation is going. But if we But if we then want to look at the full picture of what happens to microplastic when it enters the ocean, we need to look at the full three-dimensional transport. And one example that I often find interesting of why this three-dimensional picture is important is that if you just look at the buoyancy, you would expect that any particle that is buoyant will be found at the surface. And yet, many studies throughout the literature have reported finding these neck positive... Finding these neck positively buoyant particles down at the sea floor, thousands of meters below the surface. And of course, there's many possible reasons why it could be, but at least it's a very clear indication a two-dimensional transport model is not a complete model. And one variable that we were particularly interested in looking at is looking at what is the influence of the microplastic size. And that is because generally the smaller particles tend to have smaller rise velocities. Tend to have smaller rise velocities, and this allows them to be mixed to deeper below the ocean surface. And this is important because, as we've already seen in talks in the last few days, it matters how far you are below the surface in terms of the horizontal transport as well. And so it could be that these different size of particles accumulate in different parts of the ocean. So what I'll be presenting in this study is we looked at size to particles. Is we looked at size-dependent transport in the Mediterranean. And where I will first be presenting a new parameterization, we developed a vertical turbulent mixing and then show how we can apply this mixing parameterization together with other processes to get a three-dimensional model set up that has size-dependent transport and resuspension built in. So, the first question is: why do we need a parameterization of vertical turbulent twin mixing? Vertical turbulent twin mixing. And the issue is that I generally work with re-analysis data. I don't run the ocean, these large ocean models myself. And so I'm limited by what output they provide. And unfortunately, for large products such as HICOM or CMEMS, they don't provide the turbulence output fields. And I think generally this is just an issue of storage. It already takes terabytes to store a single year of model output. If you add more fields, this adds up even more. But what this But what this means is that if I want to look at then the vertical transport, I need to know what this wind mixing is. And earlier this week, we already heard mention of the famous Kukuka study that shows you what your vertical diffusion coefficient is near the surface. And you can use this to parametrize wind mixing. However, the issue with this, though, is that this parametrization in the paper itself already states that is only valid for the first few meters of the surface. So if you go any deeper than the... Meters of the surface. So, if you go any deeper than that, you cannot really assume this constant mixing term. And what we then did is that we developed a new sort of Lagrangian parameterization kernel, which we based on the KPP turbulence model. So, KPP, which stands for K-profile parametrization, is a turbulence parameterization which is very commonly used in large-scale ocean. Used in large-scale ocean models. For example, Hycom uses this. And it's given by this lovely equation over here. But what this means intuitively is that if we start at the surface, we have a small but non-zero vertical diffusion coefficient. And as we then start going deeper and deeper below the surface, what you find is that the turbulent eddies can grow larger and larger because they're not limited by the sort of lid of the ocean surface. By the sort of lid of the ocean surface. And this generates more mixing, and then we get a higher vertical diffusion coefficient. However, as we then go even deeper, at some point you get further and further too far away from the ocean surface. And this mixing due to the shears, the wind shear at the surface becomes less and less pronounced. And then as you eventually get below the mixed layer depth, the pure KPP theory assumes there's no more mixing to occur. Assumes there's no more mixing to occur. In reality, though, of course, there are vertical mixing processes that happen throughout the water column, so we include this small, but again, non-zero bulk mixing term. So even below the mixed layer depth, you can have some mixing. And what you essentially need in order to calculate the diffusion in this way is you need to know how much wind is there at the surface. Wind is there at the surface, and from that, you can then calculate this frictional velocity of water. You need to know the mixed layer depth. This sets you the transition from when loaded step you no longer feel the effect of the wind and you get a lot less mixing. And what there also is in this equation is this term theta, which is a Langmuir terminus amplification factor. So if you set this equal to one, you assume there's no Langmuir terminus. To one, you assume there's no language terminals, but if you get more and more language terminals as present, it's going to increase the amount of victim you see. And I will get back to the effect of this parameter specifically later. So if I then combine this diffusion approach together with the rise velocity of the particle, you can then calculate the vertical transport as a simple Markov zero random walk process. Markov zero random walk process. So, what does this look like? The general trend is smaller, heavier particles they get mixed deeper and deeper below the surface. And we can see that in the plot over here. So, we consider three different particle cases where the largest particles with device velocity of 0.03 meters per second is approximately 2.2 millimeters in size. Millimeters in size, if you assume sort of unbiophiled polyophony. The orange line is the intermediate size particle of roughly half a millimeter in size, and the green line indicates particles that are roughly 0.2 millimeters in size. And so if we parenthesize the rise velocity based on the Enders 2015 paper, you get smaller particles, they have lower rise velocities, and that means they get mixed deep. And that means they get mixed deeper and deeper below the surface. And as you get to very small rise velocities, so almost neutrally buoyant, you skip to see an almost uniform distribution of particles throughout the surface next time. This is then for a wind speed of 2.4 meters per second. If we then go to higher wind speeds, say 6.65, you start to see deeper mixing. That's because with higher winds, you expect to see. Because with higher winds, you expect to see bigger waves at the surface, more wind shear at the surface, creating more turbulence, and therefore particles get mixed deeper and deeper. In order to validate this, we then compared with vertical profile data that we could collect mycoplastics, and these are all measurements collected with mantrols at different depths. And in general, we think the agreement is reasonable. Agreement is reasonable. If we look at the smallest particles, the fit doesn't look great, but that's because these very small particles tend not to be captured by these mantra nets, and therefore we can't really validate how these vertical concentration profiles look. But if we look at, for example, intermediates, the agreement, intermediate-sized particles agreement is reasonably good. There are, of course, some caveats we could. Caveats we need to consider is that, for example, if we look at the larger particles, these don't get mixed at all. And this would, with this parameterization, we seem to underestimate how deep these particles get mixed. And one way that this could be improved is by accounting for Language turbulence. So, Languier turbulence can increase the amount of mixing near the surface quite significantly, and this would mean that these And this would mean that these particles that all particles could mix deeper and deeper below the surface. However, the difficulty we ran into is that to calculate this Langmuir turbulence amplification factor using data that's easily available from real analysis products is not trivial to put it lightly. And then this is a limitation that we have currently not yet resolved. So if you include this failed term, you can correct for this, but what Term you can correct for this, but what data term to use in what circumstances is in sort of open. But in general, we're quite happy with this parameterization, particularly in that it's numerically stable with an integration time set of 30 seconds, which means that it's computationally fast enough that you can implement it in a larger scale three-dimensional model setup. So all this work is described in a paper that's recently accepted in geoscientific model development. Geoscientific model development. So, I recommend anyone interested to take a look there. In the meantime, I would say we move on to our main event, and that is how can we then use this to create a full three-dimensional picture of microplastic transport in the ocean. So, basically, what do we need? The first thing we need, if you want to do three-dimensional modeling, is the vertical transport. So, the wind mixing we can already account for with this KPP parameterization approach. Approach. This then can show you how much mixing you expect within the mixed surface mixed layer. Throughout the rest of the water column, there are of course other processes that can cause vertical mixing, one of these being internal tides. And then we use the climatology from Delaware and et al. from 2020. And this tells you roughly how much vertical mixing you would expect from internal tides. And then the rise velocity, you can also then calculate. Rise velocity: you can also then calculate if you know the particle density, then you can calculate and size, you can calculate its rise velocity using the Anders et al. 2015 paper. That takes care most of the vertical. What we then also next need to look at is the horizontal transport. And the horizontal transport in Lagrangian setting can be calculated using a two-dimensional vection equation. So, for that, we basically need the ocean currents. Ocean currents in the horizontal direction, and then we have a diffusion term. So, the components of this horizontal transfer, then, first we have the large-scale currents. So, this is your Ekman-induced traffic currents, which Tom talked about earlier in the week. And we can get this from C-memory analysis data. But this is not in the complete picture again because these currents don't occur. These currents don't account for waves, and that's in the form of Stokes drift. And Stokes drift: I mean, you can see with particles here, you can see a gradual transport in the direction of the particle of the wave, gradual transport of particles in the wave direction. But important here is that as you go deeper and deeper below the surface, you see a sort of exponential drop-off in how much transport occurs. So, if we want to include. So, if we want to include Stokeshift in a three-dimensional picture, we need to account for this. And this we can do with a depth dependence of Stokeshift from Brevik et al. 2016. And there are again a couple of important terms in this, but the main one that we need to see to understand what wave you expect is that there's this exponential drop-off from a Stokes shift as we go with depth. And if you have particles with higher wave numbers, so generally longer periods. So, generally, longer periods, then you could see that these penetrate deeper in the water column, so you get more stokeshift at deeper depths. And then, finally, we also have, of course, horizontal transfer processes that we don't account for in our analysis products. And for that, to represent these sub-grid processes, we include a horizontal diffusion term. And then, what we so this takes care. So, this takes care of most of the transport that we look at. But then, another important component that we consider is beaching and suspension. And this is something we looked at extensively in a paper that was published last year, looking at global beaching patterns. And the main issue we have with this global ocean circulation models is that they don't represent coastal dynamics very well. And we can see that. And we can see that here we see two cosines with the same time, same region, but different resolutions of the data. So on the right, you see, for example, the HICAM global reanalysis with quite a coarse resolution. If we look at how it compares with the actual coastline, you see it's quite a rough approximation. And then if we compare the actual currents with that from a more high-resolution model, for example, here, the one-kilometer model, you can see that. The one kilometer model, you can see quite big differences in the strength of the currents and you can also the direction. And even then, we need to consider that one kilometer if you will each coastal process is still quite a coarse resolution. And because of that, we developed a new parameterization for beaching and suspension where we represent these processes stochastically. So what we have here is the gray cells here indicate our model land cells. Indicate our model land cells. And then these highlighted cells here, these are our coastal cells, so the ocean cells adjacent to land. And we said in these cells, we know for sure that the currents are in repeat and we don't have all the processes development to transport in this area. And so any beaching we do will happen in this area and we will do that with a probability approach. So any particle that is within this coastal zone. Particle that is within this closure zone has a certain probability of reaching in every integration time step, where this is then set by this integration time scale lambda b. And this is, we define this as the number of days the particle is within the coastal zone in order to have a 63% chance of beaching. So, if we look here in the figure, the red particles, at first, it starts out for the least at the star and is within this coastal zone. So, it has a probability of beaching, but doesn't. Then it Doesn't then it goes out and eventually re-enters the beaching zone, and then it eventually does beach. In contrast, these blue particles never enter the coastal zone, ergo they never have any beaching chance and they are transported with the dominant currents. Once these particles are then stuck, they can also of course be resuspended. A plastic object on the beach can be washed off again. And for this, we take a similar approach with a resuspension probability. Approach with a resuspension probability so for every integration time step that a particle is beached this has a certain chance of being suspended again set by this resuspension time scale lambda r then the question which we looked at a lot in our global paper is okay so what is the correct time scale this is hard to define because we simply do not have the data to very accurately define what time scales this is and this probably also depends on your This probably also depends on your coastal morphology, your particle size, wind direction, et cetera, et cetera. So, this is an uncertain parameter, but we took the best estimates that are available for the Mediterranean. Specifically for the beaching time scale, we took the inverse modeling study that Eric described yesterday from UKL Candor, and that had a beaching time scale of 26 days. Scale 26 days. Then we assume this is the same beaching time scale of all particle sizes simply because we do not have enough knowledge to parameterize this more accurately. For the resuspension time scale, we have a bit more data. Specifically, we have the Hinata paper from 2017. And this was a field experiment with different sizes of drifters on the beach in Japan. And then by looking at how quickly these particles, these These particles, you know, these drifters get washed off the beach. Hinata found a relationship that links the resuspension time scale of these drifters to the virus velocity of the particles. So smaller particles with lower virus velocities get washed off the beach more quickly. This parameter was done with larger drifters, not microplastic. And so if we apply this to microplastic, it is an extrapolation, but at least it allows us to include some. But at least it allows us to include some sort of size-dependent resuspension in our model. And to see the sensitivity of how much this parameterization affects our larger model setup, we also include fixed resuspension time scales for all particle sizes. Okay, so that's all the model components. What does this actually look like? So we looked at four different range of different particle sizes from five millimeters to two. To two thousandths of a millimeter. And then we release these particles on Mediterranean coastlines. The input was scaled according to river inputs from the Laboton paper in 2017. And then we do one big release at the beginning of 86,000 particles in size class, and then a vector forwards for three years. And as we can see, these larger particles don't get mixed down very much below the surface and they're. Very much below the surface, and they tend to accumulate a lot along these coastlines. If we look at smaller particles, though, we see much deeper mixing, and these particles have really spread throughout the entire Mediterranean. So, when we looked at how the size then affects the large-scale transport, the first thing we did was look at how How is the particles distributed between being beached, between being adrift, but in the coastal area, so within five kilometers of the coastline, and in the open water, so farther than five kilometers from the model coastline. And we can generally see that as we decrease the particle size, we at first see that less particles are beached. So this blue line tells you within each size. Line tells you within each size class what fraction of all the particles we released are on average reached, and this decreases in part because smaller particles have smaller rise velocities, which following the Hinata parameterized are resuspended more quickly. If we then look at how many particles reach open waters, we see that for the larger particles, the fraction of particles that reach open waters is very small, not quite zero. Is very small, not quite zero, but close. And it's only if we look at particles smaller than roughly a tenth of a millimeter that we really start to see more particles reach open water. And if we look at how many particles in this coastal zone, it's a balance between these two effects. So at first, we see more particles in the coastal zone. That's because they are pre-suspended off beaches, but don't manage to reach open water yet. But there's more particles in reach open water, less particles in the coastal zone. Open water, less particles, and crosses on. And these trends turn out to be quite robust. So, one thing we looked at is if we look at size-independent resuspension time scales, so all particles independent of size have a resuspension time scale of seven days. And we see the same general trend. So, gradually, as we go to smaller particles, less particles are reached, less particles in the coastal zone, and we see Less particles in the coastal zone, and we see from again a bit larger than one-tenth of a millimeter particle size, we see more particles start to reach the open ocean. Then again, all these particles assumed a density of 920 kilograms per meter cubed, so that's probably ethylene. If we look at different densities, we looked at polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, and a close to neutrally buoyant particle. Truly buoyant particle. And again, the general trends are quite similar. It depends a bit on the density when you start to see, for example, what particles start to reach the open ocean. But again, the same general trends are the same that smaller particles are more likely to reach the ocean than larger ones. This is the global, not global, but the full Mediterranean view. This trapping of micro of the This trapping of micro of the different particle sizes is does show some spatial variation. And we can see that in this plot. So, what we did is we look at all the release sites. And then for each release site, we look for each particle along its entire trajectory. What's the maximum distance it's removed from shore? And then we take the medium of all these maximum distances for each release site, and that is what we plot in this figure here. So let's. So, dark colours, for example, here along the Spanish coastline, indicate that these particles are very likely to get farther away from land. Whereas very yellow areas, for example, here in Turkey, this indicates that almost all these particles remain close to the coastline throughout a three-year period. And if we look at what we see in differences between the large particles and the small, we see that. Small, we see that the small particles are more likely to get farther away from land. And we can see this, for example, here in Turkey, that we see much darker colors for the smaller particles than the larger ones. However, like I said, this is spatially dependent, and we do see areas where we see the opposite trend. For example, along the southern Italian Adriatic coastline, we see actually that it's the larger particles that are able to get away from land more easily than the land. Away from land more easily than the smaller ones. Once it has reached, so it has escaped the coast, then we can look at where do these particles actually tend to accumulate. And that is why we looked at the horizontal concentrations of these particles. And we are looking at three-dimensional pictures. So there's again two ways of looking at this. What we show here is the column integrated concentrations. And as you would expect, with smaller particles, you Expect with smaller particles, you get much higher column integrated concentrations, and that is because the smaller particles are less likely to beach and they are more likely to escape to open ocean. However, if we look, if we of course go to sample mycoplastic concentrations in the ocean surface, we generally use mantra trolls which only sample the top layer of the ocean. So if we look at Ocean. So, if we look at that, we actually see an opposite trend that you're much more likely actually to encounter these larger particles. And that is simply because these small particles are mixed far below the ocean surface. And this is perhaps then a possible explanation of why in mantratrols we tend to find less small particles than you would expect, because you would expect that smaller particles are numerically more common than the larger ones. That's simply because with mantra trolls, we cannot measure the entire water column and Measure the entire water column, and therefore we miss most of these small particles. Looking at the exact vertical profiles, as you would very much expect, then smaller particle sizes lead to deeper mixing. And so we normalize what we show in this figure here is normalized concentrations for each particle size, where we normalize the concentration by the total number of particles within each size class. And you can see as we go to darker lines indicating As we go to darker lines indicating smaller particles, you're mixed much deeper throughout the water column with these near uniform distributions throughout the mixed layer and then the drop-off as you go even deeper. Even though you see less parts as you go deeper, you still see particles though. So even thousands of meters below the surface, you still see what are in theory positively buoyant particles. And that is then a possible. Is then a possible explanation of like a proof example of why we find these possible bullion particles in sediment cores, even though you would expect them to have risen to the surface. And this is before we even consider possibly such a biofiling, which can decrease the density of particles even further as it is in the ocean for a certain period of time. In these vertical profiles, we can also see quite clear seasonal effects. Seasonal effects. In the Mediterranean, if you look in the summer, you tend to have much shallower mixing because you get stronger stratification as your top part of the ocean gets heated more. And we can see that here in that we see much less particles at higher depth. And it's really within the mixed layer that we see the majority of these particles. What you can see here as well is a lovely spike here at Lovely spike here at roughly the mixed layer depth, and this is still an open question exactly why that is. I think it is a numerical artifact just because 10 meters is roughly the shallowest the mixed layer can get because how the mixed layer is defined in the model output. And that's why we tend to see this accumulation of particles at this depth. But I have to say again, this is something I'm still looking at. Say again, this is something I'm still looking into exactly why this occurs. So, in conclusion, we can use this turbulent vertical mixing of microplastics that we can just apply this to model the full three-dimensional transport of microplastic particles. In the case of wound mixing, we can either do that with this KPP mixing parameterization, or if it is available, of course, just use the model output turbined field. Just use the model output turbulent fields. If we look at the large-scale transport of different size of particles, we find that the particle size seems to have quite a strong influence on large-scale particle transport, where smaller particles are more likely to escape from coastal areas into more open water and are much more likely to be mixed deep below the ocean surface. And how we are applying this: so, working with Michael and Eric and Charlotte, we are using. And Charlotte, we are using this size-dependent transfer model as a foundation then to study mycoplastic fragmentation. So, Mikel has his fragmentation box model, and we are working on applying this in a Lagrangian setting, where we for at least for three years, it is still numerically possible to model all these particles that are generated. And with that, I'd like to thank you all for your attention. Yeah, thanks for a really great talk, Victor. As before, raise your hand if you've got questions. Bruce? Here, I'll ask a question again. I don't have anyone to scoop this time, though. I was really surprised about one of the last. About one of the last things you said that tidal mixing could result in vertical transport going down a thousand meters. Is it like a specific location you're thinking about, like the Strait of Gibraltar? Or that just seems to have got an incredible depth for tidal mixing, especially just in the Mediterranean? Yeah, so the internal tides in the Mediterranean are not strong, and it's really only for the very smallest particles that we actually. Very smallest particles that we actually see that these particles can mix this deep. And it's like the turbulent mixing is small, but the rise velocity of these particles is essentially zero. So they act as neutrally buoyant, sort of neutrally buoyant particles. And therefore, eventually we do see particles at this depth. Okay, so more of a turbulent effusivity than an active tide carrying things down to great depth? Yes. Yes. And there might, of course, be other processes that can affect this, but we don't have that included in this model, just because we don't have the data for it necessarily. Okay. Thanks a lot, Victor. Enjoyed your talk. Thank you. I think Jeff has his hand up next. Thanks. Thank you, Victor. That was very interesting. So I was just wondering, given the complexity of the geometries and the bathymetries that you Geometries and the bathymetries that you're using. What you think of perhaps trying to create a set of toy problems that are sort of idealize some of the geometries that you observe in the Mediterranean so that you could better understand the actual, you can isolate physical phenomena and understand the impact better. You know, this is impressive work, but the problem. This is impressive work, but the problem I have is that it's hard for me to see what I can learn from it because there's so much complexity. So, I sort of reminded of the papers by folks like Dronkers and Zimmerman or Rich Signel over the years where they've just looked at very specific geometries, like just looking at tidal trapping or tidal dispersion around a point, and then, you know. And then, you know, setting up those simpler flows, and then varying some of these parameters, like particle size or particle density, and then seeing how the particles interact in those flows. So there's still complexity in the flow, but it's simpler and it's more isolated. And perhaps you can learn more from something like that. So I was just wondering how you feel about that. About that, yeah, that is definitely a good way of isolating this. We looked at the entire bait. Initially, we thought we can do this globally, where we very quickly came to the conclusion global is just a bit too much. Let's look at a more smaller basin, where the Mediterranean was then picked as a region that has a lot of microplastic pollution. So, it's a relevant area to consider. So, it's a relevant area to consider. And then, also to, because we wanted to use this to then look at this microplastic fragmentation, that Mikel's work had, like his model was doing specifically for this area with his parameters. That's the reason why we have came to the Mediterranean and we had the data and we could do it. But you make a good point that, in terms of isolating really these effects, then maybe looking at simpler is a good approach. Is a good approach. And like we've looked at the effect of the wind mixing, that like just a simple one-dimensional model where we looked at just how the different size of particles, how far do they get mixed, how quickly do they get mixed. So there we have played around with a simpler, just one-dimensional geometry to see how fast does this actually occur. But yeah, in terms of then similarly doing this in like a three-dimensional Similarly, doing this in like a three-dimensional setup, that's not something we've done yet, but that's something we can definitely consider in the future. Thank you. Okay, it looks like Siren is next. Yeah, that's me. I have a question. I just joined Eric's Guiew, so I have a lot of thoughts on this. And I really enjoyed your talk, Victor. And I was wondering a little bit, like two things. One, you touched already on the mixed layer. Be on the mixed layer. Like, this can be very differently diagnosed and has quite some uncertainty associated with. So, maybe it would be good to say how you diagnose a mic there. Is it the turbocline depths or do you use some criteria? And on the other hand, I'm also like wondering about this complexity. What is your feeling about how important now the vertical dimension that Vertical dimension, that adding vertical turbulence is, for example, to horizontal turbulence that's not resolved. You say, I think if I get it right, your horizontal diffusivity is set constant and had one value. Does it vary with a model or with space? And yeah, you have all this complexity. Like, what is your feeling? Like, how important that is? Okay, so let's start with the next layer dev. The next layer depth, what we use in this case is the CMEM3 analysis. Case is the CMEM3 analysis output, and what they define as the mixed depth is they use a sigma cutoff point, so they look at the density at 10 meters, and then the mixed layer depth is when your difference relative to this density at 10 meters is, I think, on the top of my head, like 0.1 kilograms per meter cubed. So, yeah, I don't know what to the exact value, but that's basically how it's done. And yeah, that's very quickly what I ran into. That's very quickly what I ran into like now, and that's what we saw with this lovely peak here. Is that yeah, in summer when you have shallow mixing, it now has that the mixed layer depth in the entire basin is 10 meters, which I don't know exactly how accurate that is because that seems beautifully homogeneous for such a large basin, which I don't quite buy. But that's just the definition that is. The definition that is available. So, yeah, that is something that needs to be considered. Yeah, can I add something to this? Because maybe it would be also good to consider the turbocline depth, which is like often the Eurian models have a scale which they employ the Eulerian mixing parametrization, and then they sometimes output that. So I think that would be really helpful because this density criteria really can vary from Vary from on the table client, but yeah, we can talk about this later, maybe. Um, and I still want to share, yeah. And then your second, if is, do you have a short summary exactly what you your question was? Because there were a lot of components to your question. I don't want to take too much time. It was just a question, how important, for example, the vertical turbulence is compared to horizontal turbulence, which is now spatially uniform in your Now spatially uniform in your case. So as a more general comment on the importance of the vertical point, what we have found, at least for the larger particles, this vertical mixing doesn't seem incredibly important because, at least in how we now define the rise velocities, the five millimeter particles, for example, have such a high rise velocity that the wind mixing is rarely, if ever, strong enough to mix. If ever, strong enough to mix it downwards. So, in that case, you are actually pretty safe in assuming this two-dimensional system. Of course, this can change if you start to look at processes such as biofiling, because then your particles, even these larger ones, can get more dense over time and can start to get mixed. But as a first order, at least for these larger particles, you can probably not look, you're reasonably safe for not looking at the vertical transports. Vertical transport. In terms of the relative to the horizontal, I have to say, horizontal diffusion is not exactly my area of expertise. And given the many different parameterizations and to my understanding, also some sort of uncertainty in what sort of the correct approach is, that's why we took a small constant term throughout the basin. This kind of, there are, of course, different technique, like approaches you can take, for example, varying. Approaches you can take, for example, varying it with like upstream parameters, linking the diffusion to the cell size, and etc. etc. But we've sort of just assumed that this doesn't play as big a part role and just set it to this one constant value, which of course is a simplifying assumption, but it's one we've made at the moment at least. Thanks for clarifying. Looking forward to further. Thanks for clarifying. Looking forward to further discussing. Yeah, you and me both. So I think with that, let's take, let's call.
