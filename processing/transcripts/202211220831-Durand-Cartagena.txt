And I'm not so happy with the 8.30 AM, but I will not complain because I'm super sleepy. So that's why the organizers told me to talk about basics of bitch analysis, and I was not sure what I am supposed to say. But I'm happy with basics at this hour, so hopefully it's not too basic for Hope is not too basic for everyone. So, my plan is to talk about retip functions and especially what width functions can tell us about the geometry of a metric space. And also with its connections, obviously, in terms of differentiability things. So, let me begin since it's early, okay? I can begin. It's early, okay? I can begin with XD. Well, maybe it's not that very useful test. So for the moment, XD is a metric space, right? And I have F, which is a little function. I will just focus on real-valued little functions. And all you know, right, that F is Write that F is ellipsic if you have a constant C such that for every pair of points X and Y, we have such an integral. So the integral over all possible values of C I denoted it by input F. This is my user point. Okay, this is my user first time. And could C be less than one? Say it again. Could C be less than one? Well, then you have probably constant functions, right? No? Ah, no, no, no, right, right. I was miss I mean I was thinking on the alpha, of the power alpha. No, no, no. C can be for for sure uh sorry, sorry. Of course C is regarded. Sorry. Feed is regular answer. So, I was confused. So, this will be my little thought. And probably the theorem you all know about multiple functions is Vladimir's theorem, right? Which states that if you have a function, Marn, which is hip tip, then is differentiable almost everywhere, almost everywhere is with respect to the Lebesgue function. If one wants to put this theorem in an onesome setting and you want to state it for maybe State it for maybe any metric space with another measure, you have to ask yourself: well, I have to change lituate is fine because we have the metric space condition, right? We need to know what is differentiable and we need to put a measure to put almost everywhere here. By a quite recent result of the Philippis and Grinder, we know that actually if we change the menu. If we change the measure here in RM, well, you can know if instead of mu being delivered measure, we put a big act measure, then this is not longer true because you can here have functions which are, of course, non-differentiable almost everywhere. But by this result of the Philippines and Rinder, if Hademacher's theorem holds for Rn, then the measure must be absolutely. The measure must be absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. That are quite recently solved. And so after Relev Machers, there is another extension, which is the Stepano theorem, which says that a function is precisely, and here in our end but But so he's differentiable almost everywhere in the set where this lip that already appeared yesterday is finite, right? Where the lip is well, I put this so you to see the difference between the little lip and the lip and the big lip, but the big lip can be shrinking. Iglit can be shrink into just in soup over f of x minus f of y divided by distance between x and y. Okay? So this is a generalization of Redmacher's theorem. So there are functions which are non-limited and are differentiable almost everywhere. And I will, I mean, in a moment. And I will I mean in a moment we'll we'll say some examples, but I wanted to put all these constants here which are related to leap chip functions because we I see usually quite a lot in different papers the use of different constants and to me it's important to know which is exactly the difference of using one or the other. So this is the metric slope which I have seen more in the gradient flows. More in the reading flow setting. So, this is, you can see that this is going to be zero if you are at minimum. So, for example, if you have the absolute value, so this leap is going to be one at zero, whereas that thing, since you have a minimum, is going to be zero. So, that quantity catches minimum. So that quantity catches minimum, for example. So when you want to go into minimum instructional things, you prefer to take that quantity. And so this, well, I denoted it here with minus because the class would be if interchanging x and y. So this at a point x is less or equal than this group of x, which is less or equal than. Of x, which is less or equal than the asymptotic and which is less or equal than the constant, the litchit constant itself. So, and the difference between this leap and the asymptotic one is that in this case, you are infinitesimal in the sense that you fix here x and then you compare only like radially with all the. Like radially with all the other points of the space. Whereas in this case, you have x here, but then you take every y and z that are going to the point x. Which actually is in some sense quite different. So as I told you, all these things can be of course different. And for example, you want to distinguish this with these others, you can. With these others, you can think on a casp. So you can take a casp, like something like that. So your set is in R2, right? This is a set in the plane. And here you can define a function which is going to be, say, e for positive minus. minus i or negative and this is not going to be ellipsoid function but this is going to be finite everywhere and the point is exactly this thing that when you look at this point and you compute this quantity you only want to compare it with this point with the others when This point with the others, whereas in the Lichit constant, you are looking also to these points. So they are looking at the non-quasi-convexity of your space. Okay. And just one thing that it's known that if here is the best thing you can do in the Stepano field. So if you change this by the little. This by the little one, the Stepanov theorem is no longer true. So, this is the best thing you can do in terms of differentiability. And actually, at a point of differentiability, the little leap and the big lip have to coincide. And in some sense, that is what is behind all these differentiability spaces and limb condition, and so on. That is precisely related with the fact that you asked that. With the fact that you ask that for all each functions, you want that at almost every point you can compare in some sense these two quantities. Okay. And something, well, when I was just trying to prepare this, I browsing the internet, let's see what has been done in the last two years that I have been a little bit out. And then you find like archive full of Archive full of preprints, so I'm sorry because I didn't have time to read all your preprints. But I know that there are many new things going around. But something that it was quite, I mean, I found funny, it was that there is now like a stream of instead of using metric spaces, you put asymmetric spaces, meaning that you don't need to have the symmetric. To have the symmetric property, you don't assume distance between x and y being equal to distance between y and x. And I saw a recent preprint by Ota and Zao, where they work on gradient flows, but which are not reversible. So it's funny because then when you want to compute, well, I mean, we are here writing these graphs, it's not the same going up than going down, so it's not that you Up than going down, so it's meant that you can compute differently the curve, the length when you are going up or when you're going down. So that is a nice point to try to see what kind of thing we can say in our theory in asymmetric spaces. And actually, that is why I also wrote these things. There are some objects that are more likely to be asymmetric because when you are comparing every two points, you have Every two points, you have y and z, and you have z and y in your formula. But when you are a lip, it's not the same. So here you cannot interchange. In here, you cannot interchange x and y and y and x. So that must be much more difficult. So in an asymmetric case, probably it's easier to work with things that are symmetric in some sense because they don't see things. And that was, I think, Carl Strun said yesterday about this Finsler manifold, so that is precisely what they are using it. So in a Finsler manifold with an asymmetric norm at each standard space, and they recover this gradient flow theory for non-reversible flows. Okay, so all these quantities, right, we all Quantities, right? We all know that, well, except this one work as upper gradients for a Lipschitz function. So if now we move to the non-less move setting, if we have a function which is lipship, all these things can work as operators. So, well, let me put here, just in case, three definitions. So I say that a function So, I say that a function d is upper gradient of f if we have kind of the fundamental theorem of calculus, right, for any rectifiable curve. Rectifiable curve that connects the two points x and y. So x is gamma alpha and epsilon is gamma alpha. You also defined yesterday, which is the phi weak upper gradient, which means that I have this inequality, but I allow to throw some curves. So in terms of, so if it's a p-weak upper gradient, so I am allowed to throw So I am allowed to throw a set of curves with respect to the p-modulus is zero. And then I think no one has could get the proof of funky inequality. I think Pabrice yesterday went to some other types, but I mean the one that I was using is that your space XD mu. So from now on, I also introduce a method because all of this was just purely. Was just purely metric, so now when we move to another setting, we need to say which is the measure of our metric space. Parasum or L regular. So this has inquiry inequality if you have constant C and lambda such that for every F G, where G is an upper gradient of F, we have that. We have that the integral of f minus f p d mu less or equal than c times the radius g to the power v 1 over p and here we allow a bigger constant. The constant we are not worrying about. So this is in some sense. So in RN when you pass from this to this you really From these to this, you really use the what you use is the Fobini theorem. You combine this with the Fobini theorem and you combine this inequality, where you can measure oscillations of the function in terms of an infinitesimal quantity. So this is what our Ponka inequality is key. And to finish, I'm not going to go into the Sobolev type spaces because Type spaces because I will get Simone after to make us the review. But I will just put the Newtonian space of functions in L P for which there exists a indicent in L P. Okay. Well Okay. Well, let me skip to put the norm because then I need to properly define this. I have to make the equivalent class. I have to define the norm, like LP norm, plus infimum over all possible gradients, and then I make the equivalent class. So this would be my sole type space I just need in this talk. Because actually, since I'm going to talk about leap-to-functions, you can imagine. To talk about Liptic functions, you can imagine that the exponent that I am going to need is infinity, which is the one related actually to lift functions. So if we assume measure of balls are positive, then actually the space of Lixtid functions is not equal to peak to n1. It's not equal to peak to n1 infinity, but it's equal to the highwash sobol space. So I don't want to define now the high-wash of space, but just have in mind that the space of literal functions that I will define it like this. And I put here infinity just to because we we want to compare it with like L infinity, so these are bounded functions. Okay, so these are bounded rigid functions. Bounded rate functions. So this is equal to the highway n1 infinity, but this is strictly contained in this space of n1 infinity. Here also, this is a poincare. If I defined for infinity point, I could change this part, all this part by the L infinity norm of the grid. Okay, so. Okay, so actually let me put since I have defined all these things actually we have here something in the middle so here we have d infinity and here I have n1 infinity so these are band detected functions, these are functions for These are functions for which uh the supremum of the leap is finite. So these are functions for which the supremum of the leap is finite. So are more like the stepanov functions. The only thing is that if I want to get a norm on that space, I need to put the supremum. So it's not really the stepanov, but it's a little bit restrict mode. The panel, but it's a little bit restrict, more restrictive. But if I want to put a norm in this space and do some function analysis, then I am going to put the supremum bound. Do you mean that you can't you don't get a balance with essential supremum? No, what I mean is that I live just lip finite. So the Stepano theorem are functions with lip finite. So I put So I put here with super finance. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that is so. Yeah, I will make a comment after about when the soup is the essential soup, actually. So these are public metric spaces, and this comes with a measure. So And this comes with a measure. So um okay so to me these are like differentiable functions in my head and these are C1 or C1 or uniformly differentiable functions, these Liptic functions. Okay, so now what can we say? So which geometric properties we can infer in the space using this type of spaces. So So, for example, if X is quasi-convex, then they're easy to see that these two things have to coincide. The Lichit functions with the other functions, because you have something, a quasi-convexity is a global corroperity. So, quasi-convexity is that you have a constant on the space such that every two points can be connected by a corroperity. Every two points can be connected by a curve whose length is bounded by c times the distance between the points. So you are able to, so the Lipsy condition is something global, the other one is something infinitesimal, but if you can connect every two points, then you can go through the curve and you can get the equality of these two spaces. So if the space is quasi-convex, then these two things coincide. What we What we call with comparable energy seminars. So, in general, this is less than this, but you can compare this also with a constant times the soup. So, I put infinity for soup and L infinity for essential soup. Okay? So, and actually, in some cases, In some cases, so for example, if the space is proper and connected, this is an if and only if. So this is a connection between the ellipsoid spaces and the geometry of the space. If we put the measure into play, so if we add now the measure, well, you all know that. Well, you all know that this has been mentioned already yesterday. If you have any puncture inequality, any kind of peaker inequality from one to infinity, your space must be quasi-comics. Must be connected, must have some connectivity properties. However, the other way around, you know, it's not true. Like the Serpinski carpet that appeared yesterday, right, that has no concrete inequalities at all, but is a quasi convex space. But it's a quasi-convex space. So, what we can do in the case of, well, actually, it's not the same, but there are some connections between, of course, Punker inequalities and quasi-complexity. Actually, I saw some nice works, recent works by Sylvester regarding Punker inequalities and connectivity properties, also in the tangent spaces. The tangent spaces. So you can ask him. I sent him the word. But I will concentrate now in the case, what happened in the case p equal infinity if we add a measure. So what happened if we put here a measure? So if we are now in a metric measure space. These two spaces coincide, so lip infinity of x equal n1 infinity of x with comparable energy seminars, meaning that you can also compare the leap chip functions with the infimum of over all possible upper radians here. So this is equivalent to say To say that first the space has a Poincaré inequality, so I put here comparable energy assumptions. This is equivalent to say that your space x d mu has an infinity concerning equality. And this is equivalent to say that you are a little bit more than quasi-convex, a little bit more than quasi-convex, which means that there exists a constant. A constant in the space such that for any two points in the space and for any mule set in your space, you can have a quasi-convex curve, a curve which is quasi-convex, but this curve This curve has to be, I can denote it by this, but which means that, okay, I will not denote it by this because then you will get confused. So, is H1 of lamma minus 1n, which means that if I give you any measure, zero measure set, your curve is going to be able to Curve is going to be able to not see the zero measure set. So it can pass a little bit through the set, but it cannot go for a positive time inside the curve. So this is a little bit stronger than quasi-convexity and give us the equality of these spaces and the infinity Pokemon equalities. Actually, for example, we know that the Sierpinski carpet does not have this property. And in the particular case of the Sierpinski carpet, we can Case of the Serpinski carpet, we can even construct a set, a universal set, a zero measure set with respect to the household measure, such that any pair of points in your carpet must pass through that zero measure set. And which is actually, I think, is nice. And so now, another property which is connected to this and is a little bit different, and I think it was also mentioned yesterday, but I don't remember who, which is this infinity-weak Foubini property. So the infinity-weak Foubini property is something like this property here. Like this property here, but more in connection with something more geodesic, not quasi-convexity, but I will go and connect with geodesic. So let me define for you this infinity weak Fubini property. So Xdmu has the infinite weak Fubini property. If for any pair of points for any epsilon, epsilon, for any subset with zero mission, there exists a curve such that this curve is transversent. This curve is transversal to n, transversal in this sense, transversal to n and such that the length of the curve is almost the distance. Okay, so this is my infinity weak Fubini project, which is something well, quite strong as a project. But if your space has this infinity weak Fubini property, something that you can prove is that a supremum is an essential supremum. So in that case, so if you have an infinite with Pugini property, I need I'm I'm sorry, I need to put here, I forgot about the measure of dubbing. Also here. So if my space has an infinite width cobin property and it is dubbing, then for any lipstick function, then well actually even the lichen function. Well, actually, even the negative function coincides with the supremum of all. So, if for a negative function I have that the supremum of the leap is equal the essential supremum of the leaf. So, in some sense it seems that there the measure is not playing quite a role because Sure, it's not playing quite a role because supremums are essential supremus. And so these characterizations of infinite quantum inequalities and infinite width for winning property was doing work with Nages. This has worked with Nages and Precious Caramillo. And in this infinite weak Fubini property, it was in connection with AMLES and infinite harmonic functions. So in the case you have an infinite weak Fubini property at Golly, what we got is that AMLES are same thing as infinite harmonic functions. And so this is a talk of yesterday, it came to my mind, someone defined the intrinsic. Someone defined an intrinsic metric. So, with this thing, you can also define an intrinsic metric, actually. So, you can define first for any zero measure set, you can define the infimum Fimu over the length of curves gamma in transversal to n and then you can define a metric which is a te supremo Te supremum over all possible n's of this thing, so n be nu. And of course, this might be, for example, in the Serpinsky carpet, since you have this ugly set, that metric is going to be infinite. That metric is going to be infinity because any two points must pass through that. But if you have an infinity Punker inequality, that metric has to be compatible with your original metric. If you have an infinite weak Fulbini property, they are the same. So that two metrics are actually the same. And they're infinite weak Fubini property. Coding program and also when I was checking some new results, I came across another one which I would like to mention related also to I don't know if you have met locally flat functions, uh that we were used it a lot, this locally flat functions. A lot, these locally flat functions. So the space of locally flat functions are functions for which this asymptotic thing is zero. So of course it's nice if you have something which is not a constant function there. So it's literally functions for which this object is zero everywhere. Everywhere. Everywhere. And that are locally flat functions. So let me put here. So F from a metric space into R is locally flat if this asymptotic thing is zero everywhere. Okay, so there is a recent result by Ramon Aliara, Chris Garland, Colleen Petit Jan, and Tony Proczaka, which actually I find it nice because I know three of the people from functional analysis, and I know Chris Garland is more on the metric side. So they went together. They went together and they proved that space is one and rectifiable, which basically is that you don't contain any curve fragment, so one unrectifiable, if and only if the space of locally flat functions separate points. Separate points uniformly on your space. So, what is that? So, the space of this is locally flat, okay, this zero if separate points uniform. So, let me put you the definition here. So, this So these separate points, if there exists a constant such that for any two points in the space, you have a function which is in locally, I mean which is locally flat. You have, well, the constant is here. So you have a C-linted locally flat function. This is the constant, okay? Such that f of x minus f of y is equal to the distance between x and y. Which means if you don't have, I mean, if the, you can think like function which has zero, kind of zero derivative, no? So if you don't have enough. So, if you don't have enough rich structure on such space, the only functions that are going to be locally flat are the constant functions. But if you are constant, then you cannot separate the points, because f of x minus f of y is going to be zero always. So, in some sense, in the only spaces where you have something rich here are the one unrectifiable spaces, which I think is Which I think is as a result is I think is quite cool. So let's take a touch but the content C comments C is C lifted. So sorry so your space your function has to be lifted and locally sealed and locally flat so So, lip zero would be functions which are liptid. Liptid. I don't know even to write liptid at this time. Liptid and the asymptotic liptid constant is zero everywhere. And I think, well, I have. Well, I I have my only my last slide was this, but I will not write it down because I'm nine ten. But this I was relating all of you here, okay? But it was more or less just to finish the story that to me I I arrived to this metric measure space setting through Lipschitz functions and the first thing I encountered was the differentiable structures. The differentiable structures and so on. But I am not going to go into differentiable structures because I know there are here two people that will go on Friday. But basically, that was my beginning, clearing metric measure spaces. And I want to say that I say I'm not going to post an open program session because I don't have open problems for half an hour. But of course, if anyone But of course if anyone is interested in knowing something or any proof or whatever, feel free to attack me anywhere before after 9 p.m. or after your attention. I've been questions at the time. I'm not fine. Fine. Um the metric d hat that you define there, does that satisf so suppose you start with a space that satisfies in any conquering quality? And then you said that you can find this metric d hat, it's by log shits to the original metric. With some hypotheses, like I think I was doubling and I'm not remembering doubling and very complete, perception. But then um But then does the new metric space x d hat mu, is it that infinity weak, does that satisfy the infinity weak property? By a value t change. But the original metric doesn't so does but the new metric doesn't satisfy this. Yeah. But you begin with an infinite function. With an infinite function of the condition is not sensitive to biology. No, but the infinity weak for Vini is sensitive to the bioinformatics change because you have the geodesics. Yeah, but one thing you first show is that if you measure dense with respect to D and measure length with respect to D hat, you get the same length. No, you can't use not for every curve though. Because if your distances are multiplied by a factor of C, then life can change. B hat and D are bile sheets equal to each other, but it is not just any bile sheets. It's D hat is this special constructor from D. It's a kind of an inner metric construction, right? If you take a metric like an inner metric. But there could be some exceptional curves where it's not observed, right? Let's just miss. We can attack here after PM when I have. Are you sure about PM? There is another question. So, what's the like, so this last result you mentioned, but the pure one R. Mentioned about the pure one unrectifiability, which is very nice, I agree. What's the conjectured analog for two unrectifiability, say? I think they don't. I mean, I'll hear the data. I think I have the impression they don't mention. But is it even conceivable that you could use these flat flat functions, or local flat functions, to somehow characterize Somehow characterize this 1 rectifiability higher divergence? I think, I mean, if you see the proof, they go through three Banach spaces. And basically, they embed the one unrectifiable space in its three Banach space. They construct their curves and they come back to the other space. So I'm not sure. I'm not sure, and they are using like they are inside a convex subset of the Free Banach space or whatever. So, I'm not sure. I mean, I'm fine with curves in the Free Banach space, but I'm not sure what can be the analog for higher dimensions. Maybe it's in the I mean, the paper is very long, so I I didn't have time to go through all of it, but I have in mind that they don't mention it. Actually, this was conjectured in the elliptic algebra book of Weaver. Algebra book of Weaver. He was using these locally flat functions and he was saying that he wanted to get this geometric characterization. So I will check. I will check after 9. You mentioned that there is a single set that could abstract all types of points for the sequence interpret. How does that set look like? Well, actually, could I say it? Or you want to go? Hold on. I think I just need one minute. So basically, in the Zempinski carpet, just let me see, because I interchange where the measure is absolutely continuous with respect to what. So there is this result to prove that Serpiski carpets do not have Poincare inequalities, any Poincaré, which says that if you have a ellipsoid surjection and a Poincare inequality and you respace them, the Lebesgue measure, L1, has to be absolutely continuous with respect to the push-forward measure of Measure of the function where f is the projection. So to prove that the Sierpinski carpet does not have this, you prove that there exists a set which has positive measure with respect to L1, but has zero measure with respect to the other one. So basically, if you have that set, call it N, or which L1 is actually you can Actually you can it can be one and this push forward measure has to be zero. You take a set which is a union of these two sets where one is a projection on one side and the other is a projection of the other side. So then so your end would be like the union of a So if you take here two points, X and Y, this one and this is X22. What you basically prove is that your set M is a P1 minus one. P one minus one of and union P two minus one of n bar and then what you say is okay let's try to to see if that this has to be actually positive right so that must be equal bigger or equal than the maximum between Or equal than the maximum between the House of measure either of this projection or of that projection. But since you know that this set has full measure, that must be positive. So the construction. I always get confused between who is absolutely continuous with respect to who. Because the Rademacher's theorem is the other way around. I think that we are going to move any other questions. Thank you, Speaker, again, and I would say we give ourselves five minutes' break so we shouldn't fight anything. I think I'm thinking about it.
