Louisville type results and their applications. Thanks a lot. Thanks. So it's good to be here, although it would be even better if I were in bench, but okay, that's the way it goes. So of course, it's okay, my talk is not mainly focused on singularity formation, but of course, as everybody knows, lubricant theorems are very useful tools when one wants to. Useful tools when one wants to study singularities, and I will mention some applications about singularity formation for some of the results that I will mention. So I will at least cover the first two items, Lane-Emden equation and diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi. And if I have enough time, maybe I will say something about the mixed elliptic equation. But maybe the first two topics are already enough in some sense. Topics are already enough in some sense. So let me start with the Lehman equation. Of course, I will recall something that everybody knows: the Giddas-Proc Louville theorem, which is the model for most results of this type. So if you just take minus or plus equals to the power of P in the whole space, P bigger than one, the equation does not admit any positive classical solution in the whole space if and only if P is subcritical in the sublf sense. Subcritical nostalgia F sense. And so this is very famous, a very famous result. And there is also a very useful, simplified proof by de Viron and Viron about 10 years later. Now, our main concern is about the half-space, because for the whole space, this is a perfect result, and there is nothing to add about that. But for the half-space, the situation is different. So for the half-space with zero boundary conditions, Space with zero boundary condition. In another paper about the same time, Gilas Prak proved that the problem does not admit any positive classical solution if P is either subcritical or critical. So already at this point, one can see some small difference, and this difference is actually a sign of something much, much different, which is going on for the half-space case. Case. At the time, Gidas and Sprague developed already strong applications for the Leuviel result by developing a rescaling technique. And so by rescaling arguments and topological degree arguments, these the combination of the two results allows you to show existence for Dirichlet boundary value problems in the Boundary value problems in the bounded domains in the sub-critical case. So, for applications, basically, that's for this kind of applications, that's already good enough because you do not expect existence in general for if P is not so critical. But if you are interested in the understanding of what happens in the half space, it's not It's natural to ask what happens for supercritical P. So, this was studied by several people in the subsequent years. So, first for bounded solutions, for bounded solutions, the critical number was improved by Norman Denser, who showed that absolute is enough for P to be less than the subelf exponent. Less than the sub of exponent in n minus one dimensions. So you gain something. And the technique is based on moving planes, but the boundedness of the solution is crucial. Then Alberto Farina much later in 2007 showed that it's actually true up to the Joseph Longland exponent, which is this more complicated number, which is related to intersection properties of. Intersection properties of radial steady states, and his proof uses the concept of stability. We will also deal with stability issues later. And then a radically stronger result was discovered by Chen, Li, and Zhao more recently in 2014. They were able to show that for bounded, as far as bounded solutions are concerned, you don't need any. Are concerned, you don't need any restriction on P. For any p larger than one, you have non-existence in the half space. So that's already a very nice result. And the question, natural, next natural question is, of course, is it important to assume boundedness or can you go beyond that? And that's what we could do in a recent paper with Wu-Dupeny and Boyancy-Rakov, we showed that for any P like. For any p larger than one, you still have non-existence for solutions which are not necessarily bounded but only bounded at finite distance from the boundary, which is of course much weaker. You can allow any growth in the normal direction at infinity, but you don't want to allow blow-up at finite distance of the boundary and when x prime n goes to infinity. Prime n goes to infinity. This is not allowed in our results. And the consequence of that is that there are no, actually it's actually more general because I will explain the connection. This also, by the same time, we can show non-existence of classical solutions which are monotone in the normal direction. So, what are the connections? Actually, any solution which is bounded on Actually, any solution which is bounded on finite strips is monotone in the normal direction. This is a moving plane argument. And actually, this is embedded in an even larger set of solutions, which is a set of stable solutions. So stable solutions are in the even larger class of classical solutions. Now, we don't want to allow solutions with singularities because, in that case, social with singularities because in that case you don't have maybe you probably don't have non-existence non-existence anymore so the the the ultimate dream will be to would be to to show non-existence for classical solutions without any additional restriction uh slightly weaker but already um it would be already also very good would be to show an extra stable solutions and but at this point we are stopped with solutions which are bounded Stopped with solutions which are bounded in finite strips or monotone solutions. Actually, our proof works for any convex f such that f is zero at zero and positive for positive u. And so the open question, I already mentioned that. Of course, there are still the possibility that solutions, classical solutions could exist. Classical solution could exist which are bounded in finite strips but blow up at finite distance from the boundary in the other infinity direction. This may seem unlikely because such solutions would be very widely wide in some sense and they would be very very non-monotone. Okay, but still we cannot do that for the moment. So let me mention the main idea. Me mention the main ideas of the proof. So, the basic strategy of the proof is first of all, an idea which comes from the paper by Chen Li and Zhao, is to show convexity of the solution in the normal direction. So, if we can show that the solution is convex, u x n x n non-negative, this quite easily leads to a contradiction with some basic local bounds that are there. Basic local bounds that are very well known, basic L1 local bounds. If it's convex, it will violate any reasonable a priori bound. So the main thing is to show convexity in the normal direction. And also by moving planes, if u is bound on finite strips, it's already mentioned, then it is increasing in the normal direction. So we will use that. Normal direction. So we will use that. So one of the ideas of Chen Li and Zhao was to introduce this key auxiliary function, xi, which is u double prime in normal direction divided by one plus x n u prime in normal direction. Okay, so this is a very nice function. It looks a little weird at first sight, but maybe it's reminiscent of some tricks that are used in ODE theory. And of course, this is well defined as. And of course, this is well defined as as soon as we know that UXN is positive. So, this is the main starting point, I'll change Lizao, but at this point, we started to use another point of view, which is to consider the elliptic operator, a weighted elliptic operator with the weight Z is one plus Xn UXn, positive weight. So, we use this divergence. weight so we use this divergence form operator z minus two divergence of z square gradient and by some computation you can show that this auxiliary function is a super solution of a simple elliptic inequality just L Ïˆ larger than twice X X square and moreover psi is zero on the boundary because zero on the boundary because um because of the of the boundary conditions the plastic and the fact that f of zero is zero so you usually get xi zero on the boundary so now the question is does this imply psi is non-negative uh if if we can do that then we are done because it means that u is convex in the normal direction and as i said we can use easy a priori estimate to get the contradiction uh so the the question looks Uh so the the question looks innocent, but actually it's uh far from obvious because you you can act I mean it really depends on the assumptions that you put on the weight Z. Under some assumptions on Z, you can construct, you can, we are able to show non-existence of super solutions of this, but for some Z very close to our assumption, this is this is not only true. There is that do exist some solutions. So let's Exist some solutions. So let's explain. This is a key key lemma in our proof. The key lemma is the following. So we consider this diffusion operator now with more general rate, vocally bounded positive weight. And we assume the following growth assumption on the weight. We assume that the integral of the weight on the upper half ball of radius r doesn't grow slower than Grow slower than Gaussian, Gaussian, positive Gaussian, e to R square. So we require e to small O of R square. And then if psi is a super solution of this actually more general equation, square is not important. Any power q bigger than one makes a job. And if psi is zero on the non-negative. Zero on the non-negative on the boundary, then it is non-negative everywhere. Okay, so in that case, what we will need to do is to show that the weight that we are dealing with does satisfy this growth assumption, and then we can conclude. How do we does one prove this lemma? So, the basic idea is MOSOR alteration, but you have to be a little careful because Be a little careful because, okay, maybe first of all, let me mention the counterexample because this lemma is in some sense sharp because the growth assumption, you cannot go beyond that. There is a very simple counterexample. xi is minus xn, so it's clearly negative. And the weight is e to the xn to the power k, where k is any power bigger than 2, so it's slightly. Two, so it's slightly faster than Gaussian, and Q is in that case k minus one, uh, so bigger than one. So you just compute and you see that this is a super solution, a negative super solution, and the weight just fails to satisfy the growth assumption. Okay, so that's that's something. So now, uh, going back to the proof, you we use Going back to the proof, we use Molesotripe iteration. We test with powers of Ïˆ minus to some power m multiply by a suitable scale cutoff function phi of xi over r where phi is a standard cutoff, but there is a very delicate relationship between m and r. This is something strange which we hadn't seen anywhere before. You must Anywhere before, you must really relate the power of the power in the test function, the MOSR type test function, with the size of the rescaling parameter. So the relation is that m is a small multiple of r square. It really has to be like this, otherwise you cannot conclude. Okay, so now we will. Okay, so now with that lemma at hand, let me show you how we conclude. Now we need to satisfy the assumption on the weight, right? So our weight, let me recall the weight is 1 plus x n u x n squared. Okay, let me go back to the first slide, the first slide of the proof. We have this inequality. Of the proof, we have this inequality with z is this weight. So, actually, the weight is z square. So, our a is z square. Okay, and now we have another piece of information is that u is monoton in the normal direction, and it is well known that this implies stability. U is a stable solution. Okay, so this is very, very well known, just almost immediately. Just almost immediate consequence of the definition of stability. And then we have very classical estimates for stable solutions. So take any stable solution of the Giddas-Perk equation in, let's say, unit ball, then on the half ball, the Dirichlet energy is universally controlled. Okay, so this is a typical stability estimate, and actually you can do the same in made and actually you can do the same in half balls intersecting intersecting the boundary and you need both because you want to you want to estimate the weight up to the boundary okay so um this lemma uh and it's a half ball version gives you it gives you the following just by by cutting the half space into Into small pieces, into a periodic net of cells, you immediately get that the integral of the weight capital A on the half ball of radius R is controlled by some polynomial, has some polynomial growth precisely n plus 2. So it's far below exponential growth, far below Gaussian growth. So we are safe. It's a bit, it's a little bit disappointing because we would like. We would like to be closer to the optimal strength of the lemma, but maybe the lemma is good for something else in another problem. At least we don't know yet. So anyway, we are safe. So we can apply the lemma. And so the conclusion of the lemma, let me recall you. Here we apply it with q equal to. And the conclusion is that psi is non-negative, which again means that. Which again means that U is convex in the normal direction, and this is enough to get a contradiction. Okay, so that's how the proof goes. And let me remark that for general, I mentioned before that the theorem is still true for general convex F, convex plus some small some weak assumptions, convex positive and zero at zero. And zero at zero. So it's quite a general class of functions. And in that case, the stability estimate is far from easy. In the U to the power p case, it's quite easy. You just do the usual thing to test with suitable test functions related to the energy. Now, if you want to do the same for general F without any assumption rather than Have any assumption other than convex, you need to use a very deep recent result of Cabre, Figali, Rossoton, and Serra, which just appeared two years ago, which gives you stability estimate for stability estimate for very general F. Okay, so with this very strong tool, we can extend our proof to general F. Okay, so that's all for the lane end then. So that's all for the lane end then. So, probably I have something like 10 minutes, right? Or more? I don't know. Maybe we started a little late. I think 15. 15 minutes. Okay, so probably I will not touch the item number three. So I will just be happy with the diffusion of Harmon-Jacobi equation. So it's quite a different topic. So it is this equation, the Dirichlet problem for this. So the non-linearity is graduate to the power p, and we are interested in the super quadratic case. interested in the super quadratic case. Let me recall that this is related to stochastic control. Actually, u is the value function, the unique viscosity solution of this problem is global and it is a value function of a very precise stochastic control problem with where the Hamiltonian, but the cost and the stochastic problem is the conjugate is right, it has the conjugate exponent. Has the conjugate exponent of P. Okay. So anyway, the key features from the PDE point of view are a finite time gradient blow-up, which means that U stays bounded, but graduate can blow up and it does so only on the boundary, on some part of the boundary. As I said, it can be continued as a global viscosity solution, but the solution may lose boundary in the classical sense, and it will still satisfy u equals zero only in some precise viscosity sense. So it's a little So it's a little strange because u is still continuous up to the boundary. So it is non-zero pointwise on the boundary, but still it is zero in the viscosity sense. And this is made possible by the fact that U has infinite normal derivative on the boundary. Okay. And singularities appear at the capital T only on some subset of the boundary. And actually, solution can be regularized many times and blow up again. Blow up again. We have proved such things, and we can study singularities at every time where solution blows up and loses boundary conditions. Okay, the related elliptic problem is, of course, that. And if we think about the rescaling method of like in Guidas Pruck, it's very natural to look at the half-space problem, especially since we know that the solutions of the evolution equation are located exclusively. Are located exclusively on the boundary. So, this problem is quite relevant. And so, the whole space case was very well known, the result of Pierre Williams in the 80s. He proved that for any P actually larger than one, this equation on the whole space, the entire solutions are only the constants. Okay, and now the half space, as I said in Half space, as I said, important for the study of gradient blow-up. And so, what we prove in a recent paper with Roberta Felipucci and Patricia Pucci is that in the super quadratic case, take any classical solution continuous up to the boundary of the elliptic problem on the half space, then V depends only on the normal variable. So it's a classification result of one dimensionality type. So, of course, you can solve the audit. So, of course, you can solve the ODE. So, this means that they just solve the ODE minus V double prime equals absolute value of V prime to the P for S positive and zero. And you can, of course, very easily solve that. And you can give all sorts of given by that formula. Actually, all sorts are translations or are constructed from a single one, which is actually on top of all of them. Which is actually on top of all of them. There is a foliation of solutions, they are ordered. The maximum solution is singular, it has a typical one minus beta holder exponent. And all of those are regular and you obtain just by shifting like this, by shifting the singular one, and they are layered or ordered. Okay. So first, how we prove that? First, how we prove that? Oh, so I will just get the proof. Maybe the proof is not so exciting. Maybe the applications are more interesting. Okay, I'll just say some words. So the idea to show that solutions are independent, we want to show that they depend only on xn. In other words, we want to show that they are translation invariant for any translation vector which is parallel to the boundary of the half space. So we consider quotients. Finite differences with increase parallel to the boundary. Okay, so Z is like this. And the goal is to show that Z is identically zero. So by contradiction, assume, for instance, that the supreme of Z is positive. The negative case of the symmetrically done. So assume, for instance, for contradiction, supreme of Z is positive in the half. Supreme of Z is Z is positive in the Hall space. First of all, you have the local Bernstein estimates, which go back to Pierre Louillon, which are valid for any solution, local solution, and they give you some bounds, which gives you at the same time the possible singularities on the boundary and the decay at infinity. So, what we are interested in in that case is a decay. So, it means that any gradient of V decays like y to the minus. is like y to the minus beta, where y is the normal coordinate. So this means that this supremum, which we assume to be positive, has to be localized in a finite strip. Maybe not at a finite point, but it cannot occur very far away because solution decays far away from the boundary. So the first step is to localize in some strip. And then we do translations parallel to the boundary and the compactness. Parallel to the boundary and the compactness argument. And this produces a new function, let's call it Z infinity, which is still has the same supremum, of course, but the supremum is now localized at a finite point because we have done all the shifts. It's like in the compacity compactness method, except that it's only a simple case of translation. So, by suitable sequence of translation, we'll put a solution which has to. Duplic solution, which has to assume its supreme at the finite point. But on the other hand, this limiting function satisfies a linear equation with a locally bounded drift and zero on the boundary. So it's impossible because the strong maximum principle tells you that for such an equation, there cannot be any local interior maximum. So this is a contradiction. And this proves that Z is actually identically zero and the assumption is one dimension. So it's a kind of Is one dimension. So it's a kind of moving plane argument plus compactness. It's not very difficult. So, what can we do with such a result available? Then we can say a lot of things on the singularity, blow-up singularities, gradient blow-up singularities. Okay, it is known. Okay, first of all, yeah, it was known in some cases that the okay, it's known that some of the solutions have. It's known that some of the solutions have single-point blow-up on the boundary. So I tried to, we made a picture. So this solution, so y equals zero is the boundary. We are considering a flat boundary for simplicity. The solution is bounded, but the gradient of solution is infinity only at the boundary point corresponding to the origin. And away from the origin on the boundaries, the gradient is bounded as the Bounded as the lines of the curve plotted on the surface show. Okay. And so first of all, by an application of this UV theorem, we can show the exact, the sharp blower profile for the gradient in the normal direction. It is exactly this precise constant, one over my p minus one to the power one. Over my p minus one to the power of one of one or p minus one times the distance of the boundary to the one or p minus one. So this magic number one or p minus one is everywhere. And so this is true in the normal direction. Okay, this is the sharp behavior in the normal direction. Now, of course, it would be interesting to know what is the behavior in the tangential direction because Direction, because in case we have single-point blow-up, which we know that happens for some examples, the gradient has to become finite for any x different from zero on the boundary. So it's natural to ask what is the rate of regularization of the gradient when you move away from the point. And so, as a consequence of our Yuville theorem, we can show that. Our UV theorem, we can show that the solution the behavior has to be more singular in the tangential direction. In other words, the decay cannot be to the power, it cannot be minus beta, it has to be more singular. So this limit, let's say, for instance, of the normal derivative at the final time, sorry, if you move x along the tangential direction, the rate of singularity is d. The rate of singularity is bigger. A natural question is: how bigger can it be? And the answer is that probably there is a spectrum of exponents. And at least we were able with Alessio Poreta in the previous paper to compute the exponent in some special cases. And for instance, 2 over p minus 2 is one of these exponents of which describes singularity in the tangential direction. So it means that it's quite anisotropic because you have one over p minus one. Isotropic because you have one over p minus one, which is the exponent in the normal direction, and two over p minus two, which is bigger, which is the exponent, one of the possible exponents in the tangential direction. Okay, another application is the asymptotic simplification of the equation in the singular region, which means near the boundary part where the gradient is infinity. Actually, two terms in the equation are relevant. These terms are That these terms are boxed in the scheme which I wrote here. So assume the equation is 2D just for simplicity. And of course, we know that we can define a normal and tangential vector field near the boundary, at least in some small tubular neighborhood of the boundary. So it makes sense to talk about normal. Uh, talk about normal and tangential simple or double derivative near the boundary. And if you look at the equation in this way, you see that the only meaningful terms in the large, in the singular region are the normal derivative terms and the tangential derivatives actually are of smaller order, which doesn't mean that they are easy to compute. Actually, they are much more difficult to compute because they are of smaller order. So, it's a kind of higher. So, it's a kind of higher order perturbation method that you need if you want to capture the tangential behaviors. But in first approximation, the leading ODE is minus u sub nu nu behaves like u sub nu to the power p. This is the analog of the famous Verlsag result for the Fujita equation. In that case, the relevant mechanism is the time, is the ODE, the time nice time derivative. The time, nice time derived like u to the p. In our case, it is more geometric. It's not the very, it's not the time. The time direction is not a main contribution, it is the double normal derivative which makes the key, the leading order mechanism. So, this is proved by also by some new type theorem, and the proof is quite complicated. Actually, we use a similar kind of argument, and the proof of this mechanism is much more complicated. Of this mechanism is much more complicated than the proof of the Louvre theorem itself. And let me mention, just to conclude, the last application: if you are more interested in viscosity solutions with some exotic behavior, so after gradient blow-up, some of the solutions, actually generically solutions, lose boundary conditions in the classical sense and still satisfy them only in the viscosity sense. And still, there are some exceptional solutions which blow up. Which blow up, gradient blow up, without losing boundary conditions, and they are immediately regularized. And it turns out that they can be constructed by a shooting argument. You just take something which is a threshold between global classical solutions and blow-up solutions, taking a critical value of the multiple of a given initial data, for instance. And a consequence of our ULI theorem is that such solutions are completely unstable from both from above and below. Stable from both from above and from below. It means that on each ray, there is only one value of the multiple of the initial data for which gradient blow-up without loss of boundary conditions occurs. Otherwise, all the others are either global classical or they blow up with loss of boundary conditions. So they are fresh ones. So, okay, I will stop there and I thank you for your attention. Thank you for the very interesting talk. Are there any questions? Please feel free to unmute yourself and ask. Can I ask a question, Robert? Please. Thank you so much for your talk. Just a very naive question. I mean, can you use these singular solutions to show non-uniqueness of solutions? I mean, if you know for semi-linear heat equations. Linear heat equation, for instance, near and sex, they use this notion of singular solution to show the non-uniqueness for the reaction diffusion equations. So can. Yeah, I see. That would be a very nice idea. And it's surprising that it does not work. And the reason why it doesn't work is that there is a result proved by the people from viscosity theory, namely Barl and his collaborators. Paul and his collaborators, several papers, they showed that if you take any continuous initial data, continuous zero on the boundary, then there is a unique global viscosity solution. So you don't need to have a derivative, you don't need C1 initial data. So those singular solutions, let me go back to the slide, they are not. They are not lip sheets, they are not C1, they are just so it's the one on top of the others here. They are just holder, but still they are perfectly nice as continuous functions, and they satisfy the boundary condition. So a solution with this kind of behavior on initial data with this kind of behavior on the boundary will give rise to a very to to to the unique uh very will be a unique viscosity solution arising from such initial data. Solution arising from such initial data. So it seems that non-uniqueness for Hamilton-Jacobi is quite difficult to obtain. And you must, in some sense, you would have to go beyond the usual viscosity theory. And I don't know if it's doable, maybe. So these are not stationary solutions for the Hamilton Jacobian equation? Excuse me, they are? These are not stationary solutions? Yeah, yeah, they are stationary solutions. So, for instance, For instance, so non-uniqueness, right? The unique viscosity solution for this for the initial value problem is just that one. So there is no other one. Okay. So it does not produce any uniqueness as far as I know. And so maybe none you think is possible, but you know, since viscosity theory is very, of course, if you look at other classes of all the definitions of solutions, like weak solutions, Like weak solutions, they are counterexamples of uniqueness proved by Cass Dan, Warner, and these people. But in some sense, weak solutions are not very natural for Hamilton-Jacobi because we all know that the viscosity theory is the good framework for that equation. So in some sense, you're right, because there are some formal non-unicast results, but they are in the non-natural class of solutions. Yeah, thank you so much. You're welcome. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Okay, let's see. In the interest of keeping to the schedule, let's thank Philippe again for a very nice talk. And then I apologize, but I have
