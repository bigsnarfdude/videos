From Dalahousi University, and he's going to talk to us about some species of L2 in variant and histatographic sets. Please. Thank you very much. Yeah, I'd like to say first thank you to the organizers for putting this together and for giving me an opportunity to talk about my research. So, this is work for my PhD project under the supervision of Keith Taylor. So, I'm going to talk. So, I'm going to talk about subspaces of L2 of Rn and variant under crystal graphic shifts. So, just an outline. First, I'm going to go over some known and related results, give some definitions on what crystal groups are, some more definitions. Then I'll go through the unitary equivalence that I found with the direct integral of multiples of irreducible representations. Representations. And then a little bit about what I'm trying to do without to characterize invariant subspaces as in the title. So, first, just a broad definition. So, a closed subspace of a vector space, sorry, of the Lebesgue space L2 is called translation invariant if it's invariant under translation by elements of Rn. In other words, if F is in this subspace, then the translation of F should be there as well. Of that should be there as well, where we look at all translations by real numbers or elements of Euclidean space. So if instead we restrict to translations by lattice, then we use the term shift invariant. So some early work, Wiener's theorem, says that if you have a measurable subset of Euclidean space, you define this subset, this subspace ME. The subspace ME. So here F hat is the Fourier transform. Then what Wiener's theorem says is that the closed translation invariant subspaces are precisely these spaces M sub E. So they're all of this form. And moreover, that's the description of those M sub A or M sub E sets. So basically, that's unique up to sets whose symmetric. Sets whose symmetric difference is of measure zero. So, much of the existing work on shift invariant closed subspaces of L2 of Rn uses fibrization maps. So, these are essentially maps of this form here. So, you take some function in L2 of Rn, and then it ends up in a function of L2 of Tn taking values in little L2 of Zn. Values in little L2 of Zn. So just given like so. So these appear in Helson's book, Lectures on Invariant Subspaces, where he gives a characterization in terms of range functions. So what's a range function? So in the context of shift invariant closed subspaces, a range function is a function that takes elements in the torus, the n-torus, to closed subspaces of L2 of Zn. So, Helsen's theorem from that book, slightly modified in Bonek's 2000 paper, is that a closed subspace of L2 of Rn is shift invariant if and only if it can be described as a set of functions, which are for almost every point in the torus, you have the fibrization mapping is in the range function evaluated point-wise. So, there exists some measurable range. So, there exists some measurable range function for which v is of this form. And this is a there's a one-to-one correspondence between these invariant subspaces and these measurable range functions. Oh, and there's also one-to-one correspondence between shift-invariant closed subspaces of L2 of Rn and subspaces of L2 of the torus that land in little L2 of Zn that are closed under multiplication by exponentials. So, that's that's Helsinki. Credentials. So that's Helson's characterization. So Bonek also in 2000 published a paper that expands on some of these ideas. So he gives a characterization in terms of frames and Ries families, and he gives a decomposition of shift-invariant subspaces as an orthogonal sum, which allows him to prove characterization of operators that commute with shifts. In 2015, In 2015, Bonek later revisited some of these ideas with Kenneth Ross. And so they have a sort of paper survey of early results, but then expand those results to the setting of locally compact abelian groups. So there they consider shifts by closed co-compact subgroups of an LCA group. So if you look at the case where G is just Rn, you actually recover both Wiener's and Helson's theorems. And Helson's theorems, but you also get these sort of in-between cases where your group of shifts could be something of the form like Zk cross r to the n minus k. And he gives a more, he also gives more description of the orthogonal decomposition in terms of dimension and spectral functions. So now just some. So, now just some definitions. So, like Raja, I'm going to talk a bit about affine groups. So, if you have, and I'm going to use similar notation here. So, if you have an element in Rn and some invertible matrix, then we use this X bracket L to denote this transformation. So, this acts on Rn like so. And we define And we define the affine group just to be the set of all these elements. So, this is a group. You can check that these are the operations, the inverse and identity. And we also, if we let ON be the group of orthogonal transformations, we can define the isometries just to be the elements XL bracket in the affine group where L is in the orthogonal group. Is in the orthogonal group, and so this is a closed subgroup of the apine group. So, a subgroup of the isometries is called the crystal group if it's discrete and co-compact. So, that means that the collection of orbits here is sorry, that's the, sorry, Rn mod gamma is just the collection of orbits, the quotient space. So the Z here is the gamma orbit. The Z here is the gamma orbit of Z and Rn. So, in two dimensions, these are called wallpaper groups, and you can find nice illustrations of that on Wikipedia. I'm not going to kind of get too descriptive about that. So, wavelet, I'm going to talk a little bit about wavelets now. So, that's a vast subject expressed in varying degrees of abstraction. So, a sort of more concrete definition would be that. Uh, definition would be that if you have a dilation matrix, so an integer matrix with some properties, then a set of wavelets, a set of functions is called a wavelet set. It's a set of functions for which dilations of Zn shifts of these functions gives an orthonormal basis for L2 of Rn. Also, if you have a collection of nested close-up spaces where the j-th space Where the jth space is dilation by a to the j of the zeroth space, like the base space, and v0 is invariant under zn shifts, and it has some other properties satisfied. We call that a generalized multi-resolution analysis. These are probably familiar definitions to you all. And if, in addition, that base space is, if it has a function that such that translations of that function give an orthonormal basis for it, then we say it's just a multi-vector. For it, then we say it's just a multi-resolution analysis or MRA for short. And a theme in wavelet theory is that if you have an MRA, you can explicitly construct wavelets. So moving on to some more recent results. So this is work that Josh MacArthur and Keith Taylor did. So that was a student of Keith's. And so you can generalize to a collection of dilation matrices. So instead of just one matrix, you have a collection of invertible matrices. You have a collection of invertible matrices and shifts of this form where here this collographic B is a subset of this special linear group. So the invertible matrices whose determinant has modulus one. So this is known as a theory of wavelet systems of composite dilations. So MacArthur and Taylor generalized using shifts from discrete subgroups of this semi-direct product here. Direct product here, including subgroups which don't necessarily split as a semi-direct product. So this applies directly to the case of crystallographic groups, including the ones that don't split. So those that don't split as a semi-direct product are called nonsomorphic. So they give an appropriate definition of a multi-resolution analysis and prove the existence of a wavelet set from an MRA. Another Another bit of work that's been done on this is Benjamin Manning in his PhD thesis. So that's 10 years ago. So he shows that these crystallographic invariant subspaces, so subspaces that are invariant under crystallographic shifts, which I'll define more precisely later. So they also have orthogonal decomposition with certain properties. So Manning uses that to show construction of a wavelet from a multi-resolution analysis. Multi-resolution analysis. So for that, he defines a vector-valued Fourier transform inspired by what Keith Taylor did in 1989. So he gives examples of crystallographic Dobishes type wavelets. That's sort of like the second half of the thesis is giving some constructive examples, but it only deals with the symorphic crystal groups and it doesn't give a description of gamma-invariant subspaces. So there's still some work that's to be done here. So now I'm going to define these crystallographic shifts. So we have a natural representation of a crystallographic group on L2 of Rn. So that's just given by doing a translation by, so basically by this definition here. So you take an element, so you take a function in L2 of Rn, and then you just evaluate at this affine, this element of the affine groups. So basically, left translation. So basically, left translation by that thing. So if you conjugate by the Fourier transform, you can express this in the following form. So now given a crystal group, so I'm just going to do some more definitions. Now it has a subgroup, an abelian subgroup, a full rank, sorry, of a finite index. And that's. And that's just the translation. So, elements x identity in the brackets, which are in the group. And you can choose a basis for Rn such that that subgroup is equal to Zn. So we also define a point group to be these elements, basically the elements X, L for which Uh, for which uh uh sorry the L such that the x, l is in isn't in gamma. Um, so that's that's the point group, so that's isomorphic to the quotient group of gamma with the translations. And then we have the dual group, so this is just going to be the characters like so over the torus. Um, so in what follows, we're going to fix a cross-section. Um, so that's uh, an L a map from So that's a map from the point group to gamma, which meets each coset of n exactly once. So there exists via this cross-section an action of D of the point group on the dual group of N. And there's also a measurable subset of the dual group of N, which intersects each d orbit in. Each d orbit in the dual group in a singleton. So we're going to call that a measurable cross-section for the action of d on the dual group of n, or simply a fundamental domain. So that's that omega will come up later in our decomposition. So given a character here in the dual group, we can define an induced representation. So we can induce representations on n up to representations on gamma. We're not going to define that here. We're not going to define that here. There's some Hilbert space you can define to do that. It's a well-known construction. But up to unitary equivalence, you can say that that's just U super chi omega is what we'll call it. It's this representation given here. That's a representation of gamma on little L2 of the point group. And so it follows from a result in Conyth and Taylor's book on induced representations. uninduced representations that each representation sorry each irreducible representation of gamma must be equivalent to some one of these zu super chi omegas given a measurable space um if you so i'm now going to give more definitions uh this might be well-known definition to to some of you um but just for completeness i felt i should include it um so if you have uh a collection of hilbert spaces indexed uh by x uh where this X, where this Xm is some measurable space, and these are separable non-zero Hilbert spaces, then we call this a field of Hilbert spaces over X. And an element of the Cartesian product of those Hilbert spaces is called the vector field on X. So now we define a measurable field of Hilbert spaces. So that's a field of Hilbert spaces together with a countable collection of vector fields with these properties. So this Properties. So this under inner products of pairs of these EJs, those have to be. And also the span of these has to be pointwise dense in the respective Hilbert space for each of those x's. So vector fields measurable. If the function is measurable for all x, so if you take a vector field and integrate, sorry, interproduct it. Sorry, interproduct it with any of these EJs that has to be countable, sorry, measurable. And if you have a measure on X, we define the direct integral of these Hilbert spaces with respect to that measure to be the set of measurable vector fields which have a finite two-norm. So this is the two-norm here. And we denote this. And we denote this collection, sorry, sorry, we denote the collection of such measurable vector fields as like so. So that's called the direct integral of the Hilbert spaces. So there are definitions of direct integrals of collections of operators on these Hilbert spaces and for collections of von Neumann algebras over these Hilbert spaces and for collections of unitary representations. I'm not going to give I'm not going to give those definitions because all the definitions with direct intervals are a little bit long. So, but of importance are the operators of this form where you just multiply the identity by some L infinity function, some essentially bounded function. So, these operators are called diagonalizable, and the collection of such operators is the diagonal algebra. So now I'm going to kind of get into what I've been working on. So, recall that there was this natural representation of gamma on L2 of Rn. And under the Fourier transform, that was unitary equivalent to this thing I called pi hat on the dual space. So, in my project, I find a sequence of intertwining operators for this pi hat. So, there's a bunch of maps here. So, I basically go from L2 of Rn hat all the way down to this L2 from omega into the tensor product of L2 of the point group, tensor L2 of Zn. So, that last space can actually be realized as a direct integral of a field of a constant field of Hilbert spaces. So, all the Hilbert spaces. Spaces. So all the Hilbert spaces are the same. In that case, that's just equal to L2, this sort of vector value L2. And these maps here, like most, a lot of these are canonical maps. There were only three that I really, you know, we needed to think about. So those are the maps rho, theta, and D. So that the first map there, and then down later, I have this. This theta tensor i, and then the last one, the v. So those are the only non-trivial ones. So the row is given like so. So here, I use this parenthesis notation. So if I have an integer m and an element of the point group m, I can hit omega with that like so. So that's my role map. So that's my role map. And then there's this map here I'm going to define from gamma to the affine group. It just takes an element in the affine group, xm, to this x bracket identity. And so here the operator theta is defined by taking this character at p. And this gamma is a cross-section I talked about earlier. So that's how I define data. And then the last operator, v. So this is defined on these elements. This is a shorthand notation. So that's, I should, no, I won't get into that detail. But yeah, that's a shorthand notation where really I mean things of the form gamma maps to alpha of omega. alpha of omega delta n tensor delta k so so functions of that form um i can you define it on those functions or the images of those functions under under one of those maps and so that's kind of details but you extend by linearity and continuity so those are my my key maps so so what i what i get from all these intertwining operators um is is the main theorem that i have so um if you have a crystal graphic group and If you have a crystal graphic group and n is the translation subgroup and d is the point group, if you have a measurable cross-section omega for the action of d on the dual group of n, and pi is the natural representation defined earlier, and then that's decomposable as a direct integral of multiples of irreducible representations given like in these equations here. So L2 of Rn is a Isomorphic to this direct integral of these h sub omegas, and pi becomes just a direct integral of these induced representations tensor with the identity operator on L2 of Zn. So it's still a little bit of work in progress. I need to work out the details to verify that all the sub-representations of this direct integral have this form and And we're here sigma sub omega is a subrep of the identity. And I also want to use this characterization to look at invariant subspaces. So in my abstract, I was a little ambitious and said that we would characterize these subspaces. I thought I would have it done by now, but it turned out to be a little trickier. So that's still work in progress. I have done it for simple functions of the form that I talked about. form that I talked about back here, carry those back, but we need to look at a general subspace and see how that carries back. And for the first point here, I use direct integral theory. So as mentioned, there's a well-developed theory of direct integrals for von Neumann algebras. So I apply these results in the group C star algebra setting and then carry it back to the group setting. So I have representation. Setting. So I have representations of groups here. So it's a well-known result that if you have a C-star algebra and a representation pi on it, then you can characterize the invariant subspaces of H in terms of the projection being in the commutant. So, and we also know that these operators, pi of Pi of XL are decomposable, from which it follows that they commute with that diagonal algebra I talked about earlier. So that allows me to use some results in standard direct integral theory to verify that my sub-representations have the form that I want them to. And so lastly, if I can successfully characterize these subspaces, that would allow me to build. Um, uh, build a multi-resolution analysis because I have invariant subspace, um, and I could build on the work of MacArthur and Taylor to do that and hopefully develop a theory of crystallographic wavelets. So, oh, I'm almost out of time. So, these are some sources. And thanks again for having me give this talk. Any questions? Any questions? Questions? Notes? Either online or in person? Okay, there are known. Let's thank the speaker again. Thank you. There's something I have to remind you. We should not be here for the group pitch. So this is the end, the morning session is over.  Actually, by essentially by murder, you see the internet whether it's working.
