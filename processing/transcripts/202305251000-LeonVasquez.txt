So it's my pleasure. It's my pleasure to introduce Borkeleon from Sinestad IPENE. And he will talk about for integration. So please, all yours. Thank you. First of all, I would like to thank organizers for invitation. To send organizers for invitation. I will talk about a joint work with Joanna Garcon from Universidad de Nacional de Colombia and Soledad Torres from Universidad de Valparaiso. The plan is the following. In section one, we introduce the forward integration in the Russo and Baloa sense and consider some properties of this integral which made the forward integration. Which made the forward integral an important tool of the stochastic calculus. Also, in this session, we introduced the main result, namely an integration by paths formula for the forward integral with bounded variation integrals. The proof of this result is given in session two. In session three, we apply our integration by parts formula to study two stochastic. To study two stochastic differential equations. And finally, in session four, we study the relation between the local time of the fractional Brownian motion and a forward integration using our main result. So now we deal with the forward integral. Suppose that X is a process with integrable path and Y is a continuous process. So in this case, this integrable So, in this case, this integral is well defined for any epsilon bigger than zero. We say that x is forward integrable with respect to y if this integral converges in probability as epsilon goes to zero. The limit is denoted by this integral with this minus here and is called the forward integral of x with respect to y. In order to give an idea of this result, of this definition, Result of this definition: suppose that u is a square integrable process and w is a Brownian motion. Remember that we want to see that this integral converges in probability because by definition the limit is the forward integral of u with respect to w. In this case, this difference is equal to this eta. Difference is equal to this eto integral. Now, suppose that U is also adapted to the filtration generated by W. So in this case, we can introduce this random variable in this integral and apply the Fouvini theorem to see that this integral is equal to this Ito integral. Now we can apply properties of the Ito integral to see that this stochastic integral goes to the integral goes to the eto integral of u with respect to w in l2 as epsilon goes to zero that is the forward integral with respect to the brownian motion is an extension of the eto integral that allows us to integrate processes that are not adapted to the underlying filtration the forward integral have has the following properties Properties. The first one is: suppose that Y is an alpha-Helder continuous process and X is a beta-Helder continuous process, such that alpha plus beta is bigger than 1. Then this forward integral is well defined, and it is equal to the John integral of y with respect to X. This integral is defined omega by omega, and it is well defined because alpha plus beta is bigger than 1. Also, the forward integral has the following property. Suppose that we have a filtration G bigger than the one generated by the Brownian motion, such that the Brownian motion is a G semi-martingale. Then, for any bounded and G-adapted process U, we have that this forward integral is well defined and it is equal to the Ito integral of U with respect to the G-semi. With respect to the GSME martingale W. This property is important for application. For instance, suppose that we have a classical financial market with one bond and one stock. So the wealth equation of an investor is this one. Everything in this equation is adapted to the filtration generated by W. So in this case, this forward integration. So, in this case, this forward integral is an ITO integral as we know. For instance, R is the rate of the bond, B is the rate of the stock, sigma is the volatility of the market, pi is a portfolio. Now, suppose that this investor is an insider. So, this insider can choose portafolios adapted to a bigger filtration than the one generated by the Brandon. Brown motion. So, in this case, this insider has to use this forward integral in this equation. Also, suppose that this investor is not an insider. So we have this wealth equation again, where everything is adapted to the filtration generated by W. But in this case, we can choose volatilities of this form, where y is given by this forward integral. Given by this forward integral with respect to the fractional Brownian motion. So, in order to state the main result of this talk, I need to introduce the following definition. Remember that y is a continuous process. We say that the quadratic variation of y is well defined if this integral converges in probability as epsilon goes to zero. The limit is denoted by this process and is called the quadratic variable. And it's called the quadratic variation of y. If y is an alpha-Helder continuous process with alpha bigger than one-half, then it is very easy to see that this quadratic variation is equal to C because of its definition is the limit of this integral as epsilon goes to zero, the limiting probability. Also, Also, Rousseau and Baloa have proved that the forward integral satisfies this etotype formula. Here, the quadratic variation of y is well defined and f is a C2 function. Okay, we are ready to state our main result. Suppose that F is an absolute. Suppose that f is an absolutely continuous function with a derivative of local of finite variation, and y is an H Helder continuous process with H bigger than one half. Actually, we suppose that H is a Helder continuous process with exponent for any exponent less than H. Also, suppose that YT has a probability PT satisfying that this supreme is less or equal than Pt hat, where the t hat where the function p hat is integrable in this interval. Then we have that this integration by part formula holds. Remember that in this case the quadratic variation is equal to zero so this quantity disappears in our case. Also note that this integration by parts formula does Doesn't follows follow from this one because, in this case, f is a C2 function, and in this case, F prank could be discontinuous. Sorry, can you give an example of some app which is flip shifts, but the derivative is not of local quite a bit? I will show some will study to stochasticity. Study two stochastic differential equations using this result. Also, we'll use it to study the local kind of the fractional Rouge motion. So, I will give an idea of the proof of our integration by part formula. In order to do so, I need to introduce the following definition, the following notations. The following notations. P epsilon is the density of a normal distribution. F capital F epsilon is equal to this integral where this function is equal to this integral. Here, remember that this is a density of a normal distribution, and this function is bounded by hypothesis. And we denote this integral by y epsilon t. And also observe that this. And also observe that this, the derivative with respect to t of this function is equal to this difference, which appears in the definition of the forward integral. Okay. The idea of the proof of the integration by parse formula for this forward integral is the following. First of all, Is the following. First of all, I prove that this difference convergence in L P to this difference of these integrals as epsilon goes to zero in L P for any P bigger than one. This equality from here to here is due to the fundamental theorem of calculus. And finally, we prove that this integral goes to the forward integral to this forward integral. So this forward, we prove that this forward integral. This forward, we prove that this forward integral is well defined. So now we see that this equality holds. Okay. By definition of the function capital F, this difference is equal to this integral, as you can see here. Okay. Okay. From here to here, I apply the triangular inequality. For instance, we can cancel this random variable with this one. Now we analyze this difference. In this case, it's very simple because this difference is less or equal than this integral with these absolute values here. The function f is bounded by a hypothesis. Bounded by hypothesis. So this integral is equal to C times this absolute value. Now we use that Y is a Helder continuous process for any exponent less than H and the definition of Y epsilon. So we can see that this difference is less or equal than a random variable times epsilon to the power h minus rho, where rho is small enough. Probe is small enough. So now it's easy to see that I2 goes to zero in LP. Now we analyze the quantity I1. I1 is this difference. So this quantity is less or equal than this integral with this absolute value. We can prove that this difference Can prove that this difference is less or equal than this integral. The proof is quite technical, so I will skip the proof of this inequality. I write one as this square root over the same square root, and we know that this integral is bounded. This integral is bounded by definition because this is the total variation of the function f. So this goes to zero in L P for any p. zero in L P for any P bigger than zero. For I3 and I4, we only need to proceed similarly. Now we prove that this integral goes to this forward integral in L P as epsilon goes to zero, but for p close enough to one. Okay, not for all p. We had already known that this integral converges in probability due to this equality. We had already proven that this limit in probability is equal to this difference of this integral. So, this limit in probability is well defined. So, in order to prove our result, it is enough to see that. All it is enough to see that this integral converges to zero. Because remember, the integral of f y s times this difference, the limit in probability is equal to the forward integral. So we only need to see that this integral goes to zero in L P now. This difference is equal to this one plus this difference because this random variable cancel this one. So now we analyze I one. Now we analyze I1. Here I use again that y is a Helder continuous function in this difference to get that this I1 is less or equal than this quantity. Here appears again this difference, which is less or equal than this integral. This quantity now Quantity now, I write this quantity now as this epsilon to this power times this quantity. Now, here I use properties of the exponential function to see that this quantity is less or equal than one over this exponent times this exponent, which is here. From here to here, I use the Helder inequality. So now I can prove that this expectation is. That this expectation is finite for p close enough to one due to this property. Here, I use this property that this yt has a probability satisfying that this supreme is less or equal than this p hat t, where p hat is an integrable function. So now we can see that this quantity goes to zero in L P, but for P close enough to one because I need this property in this expectation. Now let me study two stochastic differential equations using our integration by parse formula. So here is the example that you ask. Suppose that Suppose that we have this equation where sigma is equal to this continuous function at zero. Here, sigma plus and sigma minus are two positive numbers, which are different. So, this function has a discontinuous continuous at zero. In order to In order to give the solution to this equation, I introduce the Lamperty transformation of sigma, which is equal to 1 over the integral of 1 over sigma. In this case, due to sigma is, sigma plus and sigma minus are positive. This integral is an increasing function, and in this case, it's easy to calculate it, which is this function. This function is Lipchis. So this function. So, this function has an inverse which is equal to this function. These two functions are lip g's. Now, sorry, I do something wrong. I do something wrong. So, I'm going to go ahead and get a little bit of a little bit of a good idea. Okay. Let me see here. This composition. This composition sigma composed with lambda minus one has bounded variation because lambda minus one is increasing and using also the definition of sigma. So this equality is our main result. From here to here, we only need to apply the fundamental theorem of calculus. So we have proven that this function is a solution to this equation. To this equation. Okay, now let me deal with the uniqueness of the solution to this equation. So suppose that we have a solution having this form, where g is an increasing function. Remember that the function, the solution that we gave has this form. Is this a solution? Okay. Okay, so this equality holds due to x is a solution to this equation. From here to here is our main result. Now suppose that for some t and all m bigger than zero, these two probabilities are positive. So we have proven that this function satisfies this equation. Now we can apply. Now we can apply the fundamental theorem of calculus because remember lambda is Lipschitz. So this function is equal to this integral, but this quantity is equal to one. So this function is equal to this one. Now apply the inverse of this function to see that this equation has a unique solution. Okay, the second equation that we consider is this one, where this function is the sine function, which is equal to one. Which is equal to 1 if y is bigger than 0, minus 1 if y is less than 0, and is equal to 0 otherwise. In order to give the form of all the solutions to this equation, we introduce the following notations. Sigma t is the first zero after t of the solution, of this solution to this equation. So we can prove. Proof the following result. Suppose that we have a continuous solution to this equation. Then the absolute value of this solution has the following form. Where remember, sigma t is the first zero after t of this solution. Let me give you two examples of this proposition. Suppose that sig one is equal to zero. That sig one is equal to zero, is the process zero. So, this process is a solution to this equation because remember, this function is equal to zero at zero. In this case, sigma t is equal to t for all t and the last zero of the solution is equal to capital T. Now, suppose that C2 is this process, YT times y t times this indicator function, where y is the integrator of this integral. So by definition, this function is equal to this one. Using the definition of the sign function, we can see that this function is equal to this indicator function. So from here to here is our main result. So but this process is equal to wait t times The process is equal to yt times this indicator function, which is equal to c2. So c2 is also another solution to this equation. So this equation does not have the uniqueness for the solution. In this case, sigma t is equal to t if y t is less than zero, and sigma t is equal to the first time that y t is less than zero. That is bigger than zero, sorry. And lambda is the last zero of the integrator. Finally, we consider the local time of the fractional Brownian motion. Suppose that y is a fractional Brownian motion. In this section, it's a fractional Brownian motion. Under suitable conditions of U, it is well known that this It is well known that this forward integral is equal to the divergence operator of u with respect to y plus a random variable. This random variable is called the trace of du. Here the operator d is the derivative in the Malayavan calculus sense. And this random variable is the limiting probability of this integral. I don't want to give details of this Gilbert space. Okay. Okay, now suppose that small f is equal to this indicator function. So this equality from here to here is our main result. It's part of the proof of our main result. Now, this difference is equal to the divergence operator of this indicator function. So I can introduce this random variable in this divergence operator. So we get an extra term, which is Add an extra term, which is this one, due to the properties of the divergence operator. Now we know that this difference converges to this process. This is our main result. Also, by Coutain, Noilar, and Tudor, we have that this integral converges to one half times the local time of the fractional branch. Of the fractional Brandon motion at zero in Lp. So, using properties of the forward integral, we have the following equalities. This yt plus is equal to this integral. This is our main result. Using the last two convergence, we have that this integral is equal to this divergence operator times this quantity. So, the local time could be interpreted as the Interpreted as the trace of this forward integral. Thank you for listening. Okay, thank you, Jose, for this talk. Are there any questions? Yes, I'm I'm gonna give your um formula or integration bypass. This is uh Integration by buttons, this is the only value that is in one. Yes, not extensive. Maybe it's true in general, in all dimensions, but I need to write to see if it's true. Other questions? I have a question. Maybe it's not related, but is there any relationship between the forward integral and the anticipating integral of Malaysian calculus? This result proves that this forward integral is also equal to the extension of the John integral given by Martina Serle. As early. So, as you see, related with the appearance operator appears an extra term. Also, it is equal to the Stratonobis integral also given by Russewan Balois for H bigger than one half. For H less than one half, forward integral is not useful. You need to use the Stratonobish integral. Anyone working? Okay, let's thank again for
