Thank you, Jim, and thanks to the organizers for giving me a chance to speak here. And thanks for all the wonderful conferences you guys have organized over the years. We're all superstar team. So yeah, I'm going to talk about promotion webs and public graphs. So we've already seen some of these words in previous talks. In fact, this talk will have a lot of assonance with the talks of Bernard. Um, talks of Brendan Rhodes and Oliver Pachenek from on Tuesday. Um, and yeah, I should say this is uh based on joint work with Martin Ruby. So there's the archive ID for the paper we wrote. But I say that it's kind of only sort of based on this joint work because if you look up this paper and compare it to my talk, you'll see that, well, there we work in a slightly different and more exotic context. Context, what I want to do here is present a kind of more familiar setting. And because it's still interesting, the kind of new observations that we make. And yeah, this, in the spirit of Burrs, this is sort of less of a talk about a report on work we've done or a paper we wrote, and more of an invitation to explore a possibly new connection together. So that's what I hope to get out of this, and maybe to learn something from you all as well. Learn something from you all as well. Okay, so without further ado, so the main action I am interested in in this talk is promotion of standard young tableau. So we've seen promotion in a couple of talks already. I think, well, the end of Greta's talk just now and Sergei also mentioned it. But let me just review the definition. I think I'm using the opposite convention to what Sergei did. Opposite convention to what Sergey did. So maybe it's important to stress that. So, how does promotion work? So, we take a standard Young Tableau of a fixed shape lambda, and then we delete the entry of one. And that leaves a hole where the one was. So we use Jeux de Tacin to slide our entries into that hole, maintaining the standardness, of course. Then we decrement all of the values. Then we decrement all of the values so that we have a new value of one. And finally, we fill the hole that we get there with the maximum values, in this case, seven. So n in general is the maximum. And doing all of those steps is one application of promotion to our standard Yum Tableau. So, promotion was introduced originally by Shuchen Berget together with Berger, together with another closely related operation, which is called evacuation. So, evacuation is not the focus of my talk, but let me review that definition quickly as well. So, the way evacuation works is that, well, we first apply the whole promotion operator to our initial Tableau T and that produces some new standard young tableau. Standard young tableau. And then we freeze and place the maximum value n, in this case 7. And then we apply promotion to the other values, so the n minus 1 remaining values. After doing that, we freeze and place the next maximum value, 6, and then apply promotion to the five remaining values again. Then we freeze and place five and so on. And in this way, freezing a new maximum element at Freezing a new maximum element at every step, sort of several applications of promotion, the result is evacuation. So again, these are actions that are kind of at the heart of dynamic algebraic combinatorics. And I'm going to assume that you find them interesting already and worthy of study and not try to motivate them otherwise. So, Schuchenberg was interested in. Struchen Berget was interested in the connection between evacuation and the RSK algorithm. I think I kind of mentioned that in the open problem. And one thing that's true is that evacuation is always an involution, right? So if I apply evacuation twice, I get back where I started for any Tableau. But on the other hand, promotion, while it is an invertible operation, and hence there's some number of times I can apply promotion to get back where I started. Can apply promotion to get back where I started. It is not so easy in general to understand the behavior of promotion, but for some special shapes, we can say something about promotion. So a result commonly attributed to Schutzen-Berger is that if lambda is an A by B rectangle shape, then promotion to the AB of T equals T for all T. So in other words, the order of promotion is A times B for the A by B. Is A times B for the A by B rectangle, which is you know a nice kind of predictable order. And so that's a nice theorem, but if we want to understand promotion and evacuation more, is it correctly attributed to Schutzenberg? Yeah, I don't know. So I just thought your wording was interesting. You said it was attributed to him. Yes, I don't think there's anywhere he wrote down this result per se, but. Result per se, but it follows from the basics of Juda Takan that he developed, for example. Let's just say, I think I'm saying more or less word for word what it appears in Richard Stanley's paper on promotion evacuation. Anyways, has anyone written that paper? Okay, a lot of interesting questions in the chat. So, anyways, if we want to understand promotion evacuation more, we could ask for models, in other words, sort of other equivalent ways of understanding the actual. Equivalent ways of understanding the action that maybe are more elucidating, more that reveal something about it. And so let me mention first some algebraic models for promotion and evacuation. So there's a beautiful theorem of Rhodes, which says that for the A by B rectangle shape, the action of the long cycle, in other words, a standard Coxeter element, on the symmetric group representation indexed by this rectangle shape, corresponds. Shape corresponds to promotion in the Kaushannoustic cellular basis. So the theory of Kaushi-Angloustic polynomials and Kaushanloustic cells affords every irreducible representation of the symmetric group a kind of canonical basis. And the elements of that basis, of course, are indexed by standard young temple. And at least up to a sign, the action of the long cycle is permutation, permutes the KL basis. Permutes the KL basis according to promotion. And Rhodes's result was kind of inspired by and building on a prior result of Stembridge, which says that in fact, for any partition shape at all, the action of the longest word W naught on the corresponding symmetric group representation is evacuation in the cognitive cellular basis. The cognitive cellular basis. So, again, of course, the order of W naught is two, it's an involution. The order of the long cycle is N. So, that explains kind of, you know, why promotion to the A times B is the identity. And so, these are very beautiful algebraic models. But on the other hand, they involve some deep algebra and some things that are a little bit hard to get one's hands on. That are a little bit hard to get one's hands on concretely, Kajan-lucid polynomials, et cetera. And so we might prefer to have more concrete combinatorial models for these kinds of actions. And so here's a proposition which is attributed, I think, so it's really an observation of Dennis White's. And that observation is that promotion of 2 by n standard Young Tableau corresponds to rotation of non-crossing matchings of n via the. Of n via the standard bijection between these Catalan objects. So here's what the standard bijection between two-row rectangular standard young tableau and non-crossing matchings of n is. So let's say that all of the numbers in the first row correspond to a's. All the numbers in the second row correspond to b's. I write down the corresponding word in a's and b's that has, you know, a's in those positions. And then there's a unique And then there's a unique non-crossing matching which has openers at A and closers at B. So there's a unique way to match every A to a B, like a, like in a valid parenthesis. And so that gives me a non-crossing matching. And the observation of white is that, well, under this bijection, promotion of the 2 by n rectangular SYT corresponds to rotation of the non-crossing matching. Non-crossing matching as seen in this kind of commutative diagram. So, this is a really nice model, rotation of non-crossing matching. It makes it clear that, you know, the orders 2n. I think I said something wrong. Non-crossing matching is of 2n, not n, right? Okay, so part of my screen is blocked off, so I'm not reading my own notes. And I think the notes are correct, but what I'm saying is wrong. Okay, so. Wrong. Okay, so yeah, this is a beautiful, you know, representation of promotion. And in general, it fits in with the philosophy that promotion is a kind of rotation, just like the long cycle is a kind of rotation, right? So what about other rectangular shapes, like for more than two rows? Okay, so then we need a little bit kind of fancier combinatorial objects. So here's a definition due to Kuberberg of a web. Of a web. So the definition is a little bit involved, but let me show you a picture while I'm saying the definition. So an SL3 web, and all of my webs will be SL3 webs in this talk, so I won't use that adjective any further. So a web is a planar graph drawn in a disk, which has a certain number of boundary vertices, one, two, dot, dot, dot, m, which I write in that order counterclockwise, and it has some number of internal. And it has some number of internal vertices, and it satisfies the following conditions. Well, first of all, the boundary vertices have degree one, so there's exactly one edge leaving the boundary vertices. Meanwhile, the internal vertices are all trivalent. Hopefully, what I drew here actually is a web. I didn't check too carefully, but I think that every single internal vertex here is trivalent. And the other property is that it's bipartite, in other words, properly two-colored. Properly two-colored with white and black vertices. So, you know, that's also depicted here. Okay, all the boundary vertices as well as the internal vertices are colored white and black, and we only have adjacencies between opposite colored vertices. So that's what a web is. So Cooperberg introduced this notion in his study of the invariant theory of Lie algebras. In particular, there's a sense in which this is. There's a sense in which this is associated with the Lie algebra SL3, rank 2. But maybe I'll mention that at the end. I'm not going to explain right now why it's the algebraic significance of these. But let me mention one other thing, which is a certain subclass of these webs are called irreducible or also non-elliptic. And we say that a web is irreducible if it has no. irreducible if it has no internal two faces or four faces. So this is an example of an internal two face, in other words, like a pair of parallel edges, or an internal four face looks like this. So we can sort of have four faces that are like on the boundary. This part here is okay, but the problem is the four face with four internal vertices. So, this is an example of a not irreducible, in other words, reducible web. And there's an algorithm that Cooperberg gave to write every possibly reducible web as a sum of irreducible ones and so on that has to do with the sort of algebraic structure here, but I'm not going to explain that. I just want to focus on the irreducible webs because they are in bijection with Tableau, which is the important thing here. So, here's a theorem that goes. A theorem that goes, um, well, yeah, so a number of people contributed to this: Kavanov, Kuberberg, Peter Sinkuliovsky-Rhodes, and also Chmachko. So what does this theorem say? Oh, by the way, please stop me at any moment if you have questions, or I can also read the chat. So yeah, you can type them in there. But I'm assuming that some of this is familiar because it's very similar to what was discussed on Tuesday. Okay. Okay, so what is this theorem of Kavanaugh, Cooperberg, Peterson, Filiofsky, Rhodes, Tamachko, etc.? It says that there's a bijection between 3xN standard Young tableaus and irreducible webs, which have 3n white boundary vertices and no black boundary vertices. So all the boundary vertices are white. And moreover, under this bijection, the promotion of the tableau corresponds to the rotation of the web, W. So again, it's showing that promotion is a kind of rotation. So let me explain this bijection in a little bit of detail. How does this bijection work? So I'm going to, yeah, so here I'm going to follow Tomachko's description of the bijection, I think. So it uses M diagrams. So let's take our tableau 3 by n standard young tableau t, and let's kind of do the same thing I was doing before with the a's and b's, but now let me have w's, x's, and y's be the letters for the three rows of the tableau. So I write out the kind of corresponding word in w, x, and y. Now, every initial prefix has to have at least as many w's as x's. So I get a dick. Uh, I get a dick word in the w's and x's, and I can create the corresponding non-crossing matching for the w's and x's if I just forget about the y's. But then I can also forget about the w's and look at just the x's and y's. And again, every initial, every prefix must have at least as many x's as y's. So again, I get a dick word in the x's and y's, and I can do the non-crossing matching of x. Non-crossing matching of X's and Y's that corresponds to that Dick word. So I have sort of two non-crossing matchings of 2n, and I just superimpose them to get what Tamachu calls the M diagram. So I think the M diagram, the name comes from the fact that we sort of get all of these M's, right? Like every arc belongs to. Arc belongs to an M shape because at the X's, they have one arc coming in and one arc going out. Oh, and by the way, Chris Frazier let me know that these M diagrams are really like sort of a special case of Napasha Puliovsky's notion of non-crossing tableau. So I think that this maybe was also sort of known to Puliovsky. Puliovsky. Okay, but so in spite of the name of non-crossing tableau, these M diagrams, in fact, do have crossings, right? So, because there's no crossings between the WX arcs and there's no crossing between the XY arcs, but between those two kinds of arcs, there can be crossings in general. And so, to get a web out of this, which is a planar graph, we need to resolve the crossings. So, the main claim behind So, the main claim behind the existence of this bijection between Tableau and Webbs is that there is a unique way to resolve the crossings according to these kind of local rules. So, first of all, all of the those little X vertices, we should make them into these kind of shapes, which have degree one, right, at the boundary. And then, whenever we have a crossing, we kind of resolve it. We have a crossing, we kind of resolve it into one of these two local, um, local pictures. Yeah, and so the claim is that starting from an M diagram like this, there's a unique way to resolve it, its crossings, um, so that the resulting graph is properly two-colored, bipartite, right? So that black vertices are adjacent to white ones and not to other black ones. Not to other black ones. Okay, and so I'm not going to prove that, but that's the claim of the bijection. And then the further claim is that, okay, so yeah, that's the kind of output web of this algorithm of this bijection. Of course, to really make it look like a web, I should put its boundary vertices along a disk, but I can do that like I've done here. So this is the Do that, like I've done here. So, this is the tableau we started with. This is the web that we produce. There's another claim, I guess, which is that the web is irreducible. So, there's various things to check about this bijection. But anyways, I'm going to claim, yeah, that that's known. And then the sort of most important fact from the perspective of studying promotion is that under this bijection, the promotion of the tableau corresponds to rotation of the web, just like with the Web, just like with the non-crossing matchings, except that the right-hand side here is more complicated set of combinatorial objects, right? But still, a very beautiful picture where this action of promotion, which is maybe not so transparent, becomes just a rotation of a diagram. Okay, so that I'm going to say is kind of the background for what I want to talk about, the setup. And now, can there And now, can there be internal hexagons? Gene, very good question. Yes, there can be. And I probably should have chosen an example that had internal hexagons or some faces. So this particular example has like no internal faces at all, but I just chose a three by three tableau at random and didn't get any internal hexagons, but certainly there can be, but there cannot be internal two or four gons. That's an important fact. So a kind of a nice like A nice, like, purely graph theory problem to do for yourself is to prove that there's only finitely many irreducible webs with three n boundary vertices. It's not true if you don't say irreducible. If you allow internal four faces or two faces, then they're infinitely many. But with the condition that the faces internally have size at least six, there can only be finitely many. And we know how many they correspond to Tableau. Correspond to Tableau. But yeah, I think you can use like Euler's formula or something to prove that, maybe. Okay, so now let me kind of introduce the third and the newest player in this picture, in this game, I guess, player in a game, actor in a play. I don't know. Which, okay, the third object that I'm going to be interested in is Plavit graphs. So this definition is due to Posnikov. So, this definition is due to Posnikov in his study of the totally positive Rasmanian. So, what is a Plobic graph or Plabic? Yeah, I don't know the right way to say that, but so it stands for planar and bipartite. Plabic is usually what's people. Okay. I thought it was bicolored, not bipartite. Yes, that's right. It is not bipartite, bicolored. Okay, so let me go through the definition and also let me try to say plate. So, let me try to say plate from now on. Okay. So, it's a planar graph and it's drawn in a disk, and it has, again, M boundary vertices labeled one to M on the outside. Yeah, I know that's what, yeah, I know that's what Alex says, but I, okay, so playback. And it has degree equals, I should know, I should, uh, I should know this because it's like the main thing my advisor did, but anyways, not the main thing. Not the main thing, one of many great things, but uh okay, so it has degree equals one boundary vertices, and uh, again, it has some internal vertices, and the internal vertices again are colored black and white, so they're bicolored, but the point is that it doesn't have to be properly bicolored. They can have adjacencies between the same colored vertices. So, really, it's a quite general thing. There's no condition about like trivalency, there's no condition about. About bipartiteness, but it's just a planar graph embedded in a disk whose internal vertices are colored black and white. But the observation that I want to make, and it's not like a very deep one, it's literally just like a look at the thing observation is, well, a web is a special case of a public graph, right? So I say basically here because there's a slight technical. Because there's a slight technical. Well, so Playbit graphs usually don't have their boundary vertices colored. So, and webs do, but that's not a big deal. So, a web is basically a Plobic graph, Playbit graph. But, okay, but what does this observation buy us? Is it useful at all, especially if we want to study promotion of Tableau and rotation of webs? So, to answer. So, to answer this question of why it might be useful to view a web as a playbit graph, to answer this question, I should tell you a little bit about the theory of playbit graphs. So, you know, playbit graph is just the definition of some kind of graph, but like, what's what's the what's interesting about playbit graphs? Um, so let me do a little bit of that. So, here's here's a So, here's some of the combinatorics of plebic graphs. So, associated to any plebic graph is something called its trip permutation. And it's a permutation of m, where m is the number of boundary vertices. I'll call it pi. How do I compute pi of i? So, what I do is I take a trip starting at the vertex, the boundary vertex labeled i, I walk out along the Eye. I walk out along the unique edge, leaving it, and then I follow Posnikov's Rules of the Road. That sounds like a self-help book, right? Posnikov's Rules of the Road. I don't know, but okay, so what are the rules of the roads? The rules of the road tell you to turn right at black vertices. In other words, take the kind of, oh gosh, is it clockwise or counterclockwise? I guess it's the clockwise, most nearest. Nearest edge out compared to the one you came into, and conversely turn left at a white vertex. And the claim is that if you do that, you'll eventually terminate, you'll leave at some other boundary vertex, and the label of that place where you terminate is the value pi of i. So let's do an example. So this is a playback graph. Is a playbit graph. And if I want to compute its trip permutation, like what is pi of one? So I start at one and I walk out along this edge and I get to this vertex here and I'm told to turn right, which means to take this edge. Then I get to this white internal vertex and I turn again. Vertex, and I turn again, it's a little bit hard to see left versus right. It really looks straight, but it's the counterclockwise, most adjacent, the counterclockwise nearest leaving edge of this white internal vertex. And I keep walking and I keep following the rules of the road, and eventually I leave at this boundary vertex four. So that means that pi of one is equal to four. Another example, if I leave. Another example: if I leave seven, I turn right and then left and then right, and I terminate at one. So pi of seven is one. And if you compute all of the, you know, if you if you do all of the trips, you'll see that pi of two is three, because I do this. It's a short trip, pi of three, I think it goes like this to be equal to eight, and so on. So you could compute all of the pi of i's. So, you could compute all of the pi of i's in this way. It's not too hard to see that what you get is a permutation because the rules of the road sort of locally permute the incoming and outgoing edges at every, I mean, you know, so they're sort of local permutations. Black is New England, white is Old England. That is a good way of describing it, Tom. Yeah. Um, okay. Um. So, okay, so given a Plavic graph, we can associate a certain permutation. And by the way, I have a star here because there's something about fixed points that's a little annoying, but don't worry about that. There won't be any fixed points for the ones that we consider. And so let me then mention the main combinatorial theorem in the theory of Playboy graphs. So moves and reductions. Moves and reductions are certain local transformations of playback graphs, which I've shown here. So, there's three moves we can do, which like sort of changes one local picture in a playbook graph to another one. And it's not so important that you know what all of these are. Don't focus too much on it, but just know that there are certain local transformations. And reductions are again certain local transformations which somehow simplify the graph. And let's write g is equivalent to g prime for two playbook graphs, g and g prime, if g prime can be obtained from g via a series of moves. So we say that g and g prime are move equivalent. And furthermore, we say that g is reduced if it has no g prime move equivalent to it, to which some reduction could be applied. So there's no way we can do a series of moves and then a reduction if we have a reduced playback. Reduction if we have a reduced Plavic graph. And so here's the kind of most important theorem in the combinatorics of Playbit graphs. Says that if G and G prime are two reduced Playbit graphs, then they have the same trip permutation if and only if they are move equivalent. So this theorem is due to Posnikov, of course. It's a pretty, I mean, so one direction is not hard. So if they are move equivalent, then they have the same trip permutation. That just you need. Have the same trip permutation. That just you need to just check that these kind of moves preserve the permutation. The other direction is quite involved, though. Posnikov's original proof is a long and complicated induction. There are subsequently some other proofs. I think in the textbook on cluster algebras by Fomin and Williams that's being written, they have a chapter on plybook graphs that gives a proof of this theorem. But, anyways, it's a pretty deep result. And you should think of it as sort of like equivalent. Of it as sort of like equivalent to an analog of the Matsumo Chits lemma, which says that you know, two reduced words give you the same permutation if and only if one can be obtained from the other via a series of the coxeter moves. So it's a kind of you know minimal set of moves to get reduced expressions from one to the other. Do you permutations have special structure? Are they basically like generic permutations of n? Well, any permutation could be a trick permutation. I guess is one way to say it, right? But maybe ask that question again at the end because I'll have something else to say about that. But let's focus now on what does this say about webs. So a corollary of the fundamental theorem of Playbit graphs is that, well, again, if we can view a web as a Playbook graph, then two irreducible webs, W and W prime, they have the same trip permutation. Well, if and only if W equals W. Well, if and only if W equals W prime. And why is this? Why do webs have the same trip permutation only when they're equal? Well, it's because from the point of view of moves and reductions, webs are, irreducible webs are rigid. So we're never going to be able to apply any of these moves, which are called square moves usually. Also, the same as basically urban renewal, which is, I think, a term due to Jim maybe. But anyway, so. To Jim, maybe. But, anyways, so we'll never be able to apply these kinds of moves because, by definition, our irreducible webs don't have internal four faces. We won't be able to apply this reduction because we don't have internal two faces. We will never be able to do something like this because we are simultaneously trivalent and bipartite, you know, properly two-colored. So, there's never a situation where we'll be able to do this. So, the only thing we can do is this kind of trivial operation here, which just sort of inserts a Just sort of inserts a medial vertex, but that you know doesn't get us anywhere. We're never going to get a different web that way. And these reductions don't even apply at all because we don't have leaves and we don't have disconnected internal components. So anyways, webs are rigid from the perspective of Playbit graphs, so they're determined by, I mean, irreducible webs are determined by their trip permutation. And that's a nice, you know, observation, which says that maybe there's something to this idea of viewing. There's something to this idea of viewing webs as playback apps. Does that make sense? Any questions about that? Okay, so that's the first observation that webs are determined by true, Mike. If you do, okay, if you do a move where you add a new vertex, it wouldn't be trivalent, right? So, but that means that we're never going to get another web by just doing this medial vertex thing. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It's basically an irrelevant move. Okay. So now let's think about what we've done so far. So we've said that associated to every web is a certain permutation which determines the web. Of course, we can also view the web as a 3xn standard Young Tableau under the bijection. And so what we can say is that every 3xN standard Young Tableau has an associated permutation. Let's call it pi-trip. High trip, which is the trip permutation of the associated web W under the bijection, and the tableau is determined by the trip permutation. And so here's a question we can ask. Besides using the bijection and using Pasnikov's rules of the road, is there some other way that we could find this trip permutation, pi trip, associated to our tableau t? And the answer is yes, using promotion. Promotion. Okay, so I'm going to write here another way to compute. Well, okay, let me just define two other permutations: pi of x and pi of y associated to the Tableau T. So pi x of I is the number that moves up from the second row when you apply promotion to promotion to the I minus 1 of T plus I minus 1 mod 3n so that we have a number between 1 and 3n. n so that we have a number between one and three n. And pi y is similar but where we track the number that moves up during the third row. Okay, so this definition is kind of a mouthful when you write it this way, but it's much easier to understand if we look at an orbit of promotion. So let me let me do that. So here is our Tableau example Tableau T. Here's its associated web. Here's its trip permutation. And now let me look at the full promotion orbit of my Tableau. Of my Tableau T. So this is the original Tableau T. And when I apply promotion to T, the chain of promotions is this. So the number that moves up from the second row is four. It moves to the first row. And so I write, so for pi of x, the first letter of this permutation is four. And then we look at the next kind of thing over. The next kind of thing over in the promotion orbit, and look at what happens to its, you know, when we apply promotion to the next thing, it has this chain of promotion, and the number that moves up is two. And so we write two plus one equals three, and so three is the second letter of my permutation pi of x. Similarly, you know, the next number that moves up is six when I apply promotion one more time. When I apply promotion one more time, so six plus two is eight, and so on. Two plus three is five. Okay, and so this thing of like adding two and then three and you know, adding i minus one, it seems a little weird. But another way to think about it is if I did not decrement values at the end of when applying promotion, it would be the value that this number had. So this two, it really started life in T as a three. It became a In T as a three. It became a two later, but it started life as a three. And so that's kind of why I want to count it as a three. Does that make sense? Similarly, the six really started life as an eight, and so on. So anyways, that gives you some sequence of numbers. And it's not obvious at all that you get a permutation that way. But anyways, you do. And in fact, if you check, you that's right, they're keeping their intrinsic identity, Tom. Okay, so you get a permutation which. A permutation which happens to be the same as the trip permutation. And if I do the same thing, but I keep track of the numbers that move up from the third row, I get a different permutation, pi of y, but it happens to be the inverse of the trip permutation. So almost the same thing as the trip permutation. And so that's true in general. So here's the theorem. For any 3 by n standard young tableau t, this pi of x permutation is the same thing as the pi. permutation is the same thing as the pi trip permutation and pi y is just pi trip inverse um and how do you prove this fact that um well okay so for for this part for part a first notice that they both rotate the same way when applying promotion to t in other words we conjugate them by the long cycle when we apply promotion to t so that means to check that they're the same we only need to check that they're the same at one value and They're the same at one value, and it's easiest to check that they're the same at the value one. In fact, they're both equal to whatever one is matched with in the associated M diagram. So whatever M is matched with will be the thing that moves up from the second row, and it's also the end point of the trip starting at one. And then for part B here, which has to do with the inverse, it follows just by considering the sort of 180 degree rotated tableau. Degree rotated tableau. So it's not a deep observation either. But okay, so that is the main kind of new result about promotion webs and plebit graphs that I want to advertise as potentially interesting. So let me mention without going into details as well that there's another nice way of viewing this permutation using the theory of growth diagrams. So growth diagrams were, I think, originally defined by Fau-Mean. There's a nice Originally defined by Fomine. There's a nice account in Tom Roby's PhD thesis. Also, Stanley's paper on promotion and evacuations explains growth diagrams in general for arbitrary posets. And there's some kind of local rules for computing things like promotion and evacuation. So without getting into too much detail, if you draw out the full growth diagram of the whole promotion orbit of your Tableau T, there's a way. There's a way using the local rules to mark certain boxes as x's and y's. And then these two permutations, pi of x and pi of y, are just telling you the columns that the x's appear in. So the x appears in the fourth column, the third column, the eighth column, the fifth column, and so on. So that gives you this permutation. Again, another way to see it. It's equivalent to what I said about which number moves up from the second row, but it's kind of. From the second row, but it's kind of a nice graphical representation using the growth diagram. Okay, but so what? What is interesting about the fact that we have these permutations associated to our Tableau? Well, first of all, kind of my motivation for giving this talk was to ask you all what you think might be interesting about this and is there anything we can get from it. But here, let me give you one example of applying this result in an interesting way. So here's Way. So here's a corollary. It says that, okay, under the bijection between Tableau and webs, what does evacuation correspond to? Well, it's the same thing as flipping the web across a diameter of the web. So just a reflection. And by the way, this was proved in a recent preprint of Petrieus and Protchenic. But let me explain how. But let me explain how this trip permutation can get you this in a nice and easy way. So, first of all, the basic theory of growth diagrams tells you that if my tableau T is the one whose associated sequence is like sort of this part of the growth diagram, then the evacuation is the one which has this vertical strip as its associated sequence. And what that means is for this pi of x permutation, it's obtained. It's obtained when I apply evacuation. What happens to it? I reflect it not across the main diagonal, but across the anti-main diagonal, which is the same thing as inverse-reverse complement. But also, if you think about what happens when you apply a flip to a web, it does exactly this. It does inverse-reverse complement of the trip permutation. And because there's only one possible trip web which has a given trip permutation, that flip has a triple triplet. Permutation, that flip has to be the one which evacuation of T is mapped to under the bijection. So, this is using the kind of deep result of Posnikov saying that, you know, webs are determined by their permutations, but it's a nice, in my mind, conceptual way of proving this. Okay, so this is sort of one application. And by the way, I'm sort of selling this paper short, Petrius and Pachenik, because they actually work at the level of semi-standard Young Tableau. Yeah, I'll wrap up soon. I'm at the I'll wrap up soon. I'm at the final questions part. So, thanks, Jim. Yeah, so in terms of what else can we do with this kind of connection, let me just mention a few things. So, it would be nice to extend this to other similar contexts. As I was just mentioning, Patrias and Pachenis really work with semi-standard Tableau, and they use an extension of Tamachko's bijection due to Russell, which explains how to take a semi-standard 3xm Tableau and map it to a web which has possibly white and black boundaries. Possibly white and black boundary vertices, but I think it should go most of this trip permutation business should go through the same way. In the paper that, yeah, Gene, that's a good question. I haven't really checked too much, but it would be a good thing to look at, like as a group project. Okay, so we work with a different post-set, which I called V cross N in our actual paper, and we do all of this for that post-set instead. We cared more about that because Because it was a new example of an interesting postet with interesting promotion behavior. And of course, another big question in this area is for rectangular tableau of larger shape than three rows. Is there anything that we can say in terms of webs? There's no real known, nice kind of description of a web for those tableau. A purely combinatorial question is: can we classify permutations, which are trip permutations of 3 by n SYTs? So this gets back to what. So, this gets back to what Jim asked. So, every permutation is a trip permutation of some web, but we have a special class of webs here, so we can ask about which trip permutations arise for those. And that would be very interesting, I think, because we know they're counted by the book length formula. And finally, let me just mention one other thing, which is the algebra and geometry behind this. So, both Playbick graphs and webs are related to the Grassmannian. So, Playbick graphs are related to sort of cell parameters. To sort of a cell parameterization of cell decomposition of the totally negative, non-negative Grassmannian, and webs can be viewed as elements of the coordinate ring of the Grassmannian. Is there any like direct connection here which explains what's going on with promotion? So there's a really interesting paper of Fraser, Lamb, and Lee, which connects kind of webs and playbook graphs, but I've never understood it, even though I've asked Chris many times what's going on there. And I don't know if that's related. But, oh, okay. Related, but oh, okay. I'm definitely out of time, so thank you all very much. Well, let's thank our speaker. Thank you very much, Sam. We have time for a few questions. So, with regards to trying to do more than 3 by n, where do you run into problems if you try and use an analog of m to? Use an analog of M diagrams. So now you're going to have, right, the first and second row, the second, third row, the third, and the fourth row. This gives you then a diagram where you've got paths of length four, and then you want to resolve the crossings somewhere, some way. Yeah, that's a good question, Bruce. And I'm not really an expert on this. I know it's something that like people in the chat have looked at more than me. So I don't know exactly where it goes wrong, but I do know that things, everything. Goes wrong, but I do know that things, everything, pretty much everything goes wrong. I think I don't know exactly, but the one thing is that webs for SLK webs for k greater than three have like weights on their edges, and that's not exactly as combinatorial. At least that's one thing I think, but I don't know. Yeah. But yeah, it's definitely a good question. I mean, it's a big, big open problem, so it would be very interesting to understand better. Maybe this, maybe this trip permit. Maybe this trip permutation could be helpful. I don't know. So, there are all these other objects that correspond to trip permutations and these pository things like lay diagrams, for example. So, do you think those could be interesting in this story as well? Good question. I haven't thought at all about low diagrams or Grassmod necklaces or all those other things, but it could be worth looking at them to see if they have a nice description in terms of the input type. Have a nice description in terms of the input tableau. Yeah. Do you have code that could be used to generate all the trip permutations for the 3xN Tableau? Good question. I had some code at some point. We did this work about a year and a half ago now, so I'd have to dig it up and I'm not sure. Yeah, I'd have to, but I could try to scrounge up something. People might want to look for patterns or avoiding patterns. Look for patterns or avoiding that or something. Yeah, for sure. I understand that. So, Sam? Yes, go ahead. Yeah, the so I mean, as I understand it, the semi-standard tableau, the situation considered by Patrias and. Yes, and Russell really is the one who figured out the right thing to do with the bijection, yeah. Okay. As I understand it, correct me if I'm wrong, those are all. I'm wrong, those are objects or what are corresponding to the cluster variables somehow in G3n. They're somehow parameterizing. Yes. Well, certain, I don't think all of them are, no, even in G3N, all cluster variables are not necessarily products of plugger coordinates, right? But some of them are. They're more complicated than just plugging coordinates. Yeah, clicker coordinates. But I mean, should those be sort of indexing all of those cluster variables? Is that the idea? And if that's true, what do the semi-standard ones cut out? I mean, are they somehow distinguished in some nice way? I mean. No, sorry, I'm confused. The semi-standard 3xN Tableau are in bijection with webs, just images of the webs. And the website. And the webs, Paul Winder's story of Fulman and Pyblovsky are basically giving you the cluster variables. Okay, I'm not an expert about this, but I thought they only give you a subset of the cluster variables. So maybe that's what I'm confused about. But because I think that you should only really be able to get a handle on part of things from this story. All right, because I wish Chris were here. He would know this for sure. I don't know, sure, because you're only getting five hit the mini daily and you obviously need. Yeah, and you obviously need infinite okay, so I see. No, I just guess my question was going to be in your among the standard Tableau, if somehow they were special, if you could identify. They are special. I think it's called the multilinear component, and that somehow understanding the standard one is usually enough to understand all of them. But that's maybe via a user, like standardization means that usually understanding the standard one is enough to understand the semi-standard one as well. Again, I'm talking about things I don't. Again, I'm talking about things that I don't really know about, so but I think that, yeah.
