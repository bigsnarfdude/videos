Okay, so the last speaker this afternoon is Jakob Glaz, who will talk about rational points on Del Petsu surfaces. Thanks for the introduction. Yeah, actually, the title is Rational Points on Del Petsu Surfaces of Low Degree. That's a bit long. Okay, so the general setting we're interested in is the following. We take K to be a global field. Can you read that in the back? Yes, okay. We take K to be a global field and X Fano variety of K. And we are interested in the set of K-rational points on that variety. And since it's Fano, we expect that That set is actually infinite as soon as it is non-empty. And so we can try to find a finer measure to measure the density of rational points. So we can count them. And maybe I also remind you what I mean here by Fano. So I will always assume that it's smooth. Geometrically integral, projective, and the key properties that the anti-canonical divisor is ample. And that's precisely the context of Manny's conjecture. So what it predicts is the following: we take h to be an anti-canonical height function, which Which roughly speaking measures the complexity of the Russian points. Okay, and then for u and substitute x, we introduced the counting function n u of p which just counts already. Which just counts all rational points on U up to height B. Okay, and for this quantity, Manin and his collaborators put forward a precise asymptotic. And as Dan already mentioned today, Emmanuel Pierre gave a prediction for Gave a prediction for the leading constant. And what it says is the following: there should exist a thin set contained in the rational points, such that if we take u to be the complement of z, then the counting function The counting function should grow like b times log b for with an exponent. So that should be a        Um just to remove a bit of a One in general has to remove a bit more, and in particular, there's an example by Gao, where we get the Zariski dense exceptional set for Telpezo surfaces of degree one, in the sense that they contribute more already than which is conjectured. Okay, and such exceptions. And such exceptional curves are usually called them lines because again if x is embedded anti-canonically at least when degrees between 3 and 9 again then an exceptional curve is just a line. Okay. Any questions so far? Yeah, I also wrote down uh height function there, so I'm gonna give you actually just I'm just uh gonna define the naive height uh on projective space. On projective space. And for simplicity, I'm just going to assume that K is Q. That's everything you have to keep in mind. And then if we take a point here in projective space, then we can. Space, then we can always write it in such a way that it has integer coordinates and which are co-prime by just dividing through by the G C D and then we just define the height of X to be the maximum of the absolute value. To be the maximum of the absolute values. And in fact, again, with the standard example that I take, if you embed it anti-canonically, if the degree is between 3 and 9, then an anti-canonical height function is just given by the naive height on projective space. Okay, so here X is again the pitzer surface of degree D. Okay, so I think now we give some examples. So I think now we gave some examples and defined all the relevant notions that we need. I'm going to give you a quick overview of what is known in the context of Mani's conjecture. So, when the degree is between six and nine, then the pets of surfaces are toric varieties, and for them we know Manning's conjecture, in fact, in any dimension. And that's due to Potiriff and Jinkle for number fields and due to Burkui in positive curves. In positive characteristic. When the degree is five, then we have some examples for which we know Manning's conjecture. They are all worked out over Q, and that's due to Telepret√©. Who proved it for split telepeto surfaces of degree five and due to teleportage and fouvry? Who proved it for dp5s, which are the blow-up of special configuration of points. And if the degree is four, oh, yeah, that's over Q, then we know. Then we know it for one example over Q. And that's again Tush and Browning. And that's basically all we know. And what you might guess already from this list is that the general principle is the smaller the degree, the harder the arithmetic is to understand for the Al Petsu surfaces. Petsu surfaces. In particular, for degree one, two, and three, we have no example for which we know Manning's conjecture. And if we look at different ground fields than Q, then not even for degree four or five. Okay, so it seems that getting an asymptotic is a quite hard problem. So I'm going to move to the easier problem of just obtaining upper bounds now so. So yeah, I'm also gonna quickly tell you what's known in that case. Okay, so the best general upper bound that we have is due to Sahlberger. And what he proved is that if you remove the exceptional curves, then you always get an upper bound of b to the 3 over square root of d. Okay. Okay, and here I'm just going to restrict to the case where the degrees at most five, since for the other cases, you know, Manning's conjecture, and that's again working over Q due to Salberger. When the degree is one, that's not the best general bound, but in this case, we have an upper bound of the form B to the two point eight seven. That's again working over Q. That's again working over queue. And that follows from work of Bargava, Schenker, Tanigucci, Thorne, Zimmermann, and Zhao on point-wise bounds for the rank of elliptic curves in terms of the discriminant, together with work of Eldenberg and Venkatesch on integral points on elliptic curves. And as you see, And as you see, these bounds are actually quite far away from what we expect from Marne's conjecture, in particular when the degree is one. We do not even know whether the exceptional curves dominate the total point count. When the degrees three, sorry, I should write it down. That's D is one. When the degrees three. Then again, working over Q, we have a better bound due to Heath-Brown, which is P to the 4/3. However, this bound is conditional on a certain conjecture that relates the rank of an elliptic curve to its conductor, which I call the rank growth hypothesis. Processes. I'm gonna say more about this later. So now I'm gonna abbreviate it by RGH. Okay, so not to be confused with GRH. Okay, so and in some cases, there are better bounds available, but these are really the best. But these are really the best ones which apply to any Del Petsu surface. And together with Leonhard Ruchwilze, we tried to get something better by using a similar strategy as Hichbraun. Okay, so I write 24, and actually, the paper should be in the archive on the next day. We'll probably upload it tomorrow. And what we proved is the following. So we assume that the characteristic of k is not 2 or 3 and the degree is between 1 and 5. And then we get an upper bound of the form. And U of B is bounded by B to the 1 plus 1 over D plus epsilon. And that's unconditional when the character. That's unconditional when the characteristic is positive. And conditional on the rank growth hypothesis when we are in characteristic zero. Okay, so in particular, if you look at the special case D3, then recover the recover Heathbrounds bound. And yeah, it has the annoying effect that even for D is one, like you see the bound becomes worse the smaller the degree is. Yeah, for example, D is one, we get P squared, which still does not show that the exceptional curves. Exceptional curves dominate the point count. Okay, as I said, in some cases, one can get better control on the number of rational points. And that's a particular case is when X has a conic bundle structure. And what I mean by that is just that it's equipped with a dominant morphism to P1, but the fibers. Fibers are all isomorphic to plain conics. And in that case, the extrastructure has been used in quite many cases to improve upon the existing bounds. Okay, so I actually just want to mention one particular bound because in all the other cases it's worth what we get with our theorem. So for example, that's a result by By drowning in Sophos, that if the degree is 4 and x has a conic bundle structure, then we actually get upper bounds of the correct order of magnitude, so even with the right log powers. Okay, and that's again working That's again working over Q. And in fact, they also get lower bounds if you assume that you have a rational point. Yes, and in that case, if you have a conic bundle structure, you almost get linear growth up to a factor of epsilon. Okay, so this time we only have to assume that the characteristic is not two, because otherwise conics are quite nice. And we assume that the degrees four are five, then if X has a conic bundle structure. Then we get an upper bound of the form b to the one plus epsilon. If the characteristic is zero, that was already known before. That was proved by Browning and Swapik Trones. Yes, so that's the result. I only talked about upper bounds, but of course. Talked about upper bounds, but of course, one can also try to prove lower bounds. And there's in some cases, in particular, again, if you have a conic bundle structure, and that's a bit easier. And I just want to mention a result due to Fry, Lactran, and Sophos. If the rank of the Picard group Rank of the Picard group is sufficiently large with respect to the degree, then you actually get a lower bound of the right order of magnitude. Okay, and that's again in characteristic zero. Okay, and that's again in characteristic zero. Okay. So for the rest of the talk, I'm probably not going to have time to talk about conic bundles. So I will focus on explaining the main ingredients for that theorem. And actually, the basic idea is quite simple. What we do is we take hyperplane sections, and then generically, that's a smooth genus 1 curve. And then we smooth genus one curve and then we use the rank growth hypothesis to get uniform upper bounds for rational points on elliptic curves so we're going to say a few words about elliptic curves now so for simplicity we assume that e is an elliptic curve which is embedded in projective space and for a simple um And then we define NE of P has to be the number of rational points of bounded height on the elliptic curve. And here, height really just means the naive height which comes from the embedding into the projective space. Then it follows from the theory of Nehru dateites that this counting function. That this counting function should grow like some constant depending on E times log b to the r half. Here r is the rank of the elliptic curve. So in particular, you see that generally rational points are quite sparse on elliptic curves. But for our applications, we really need uniform bounds. And that's where the rank growth hypothesis comes into play. So, and what it says is that the rank of the elliptic curve should grow much slower than the logarithm of the conductor. And n here is usually just the usual ideal norm on number fields. On number fields. And if it's a function field, then the conductor is a divisor, and then you should just think of this as the degree of the divisor. Okay. And for comparison, why one should think this is true? Via two descent, one can always show that the rank is a big O of the logarithm of the conductor. And Maestre has shown that the rank growth hypothesis is a consequence of the Birch and Swin and Dyer conjecture. I guess that's enough reasons to at least conjecture it might be true. And the reason. And the reason why we can work unconditionally over function fields is the following result due to Brumer, who proved the rank growth hypothesis over function fields of characteristic bigger than three. Okay, the techniques he used was the fact that the algebraic rank is always bounded by the analytic rank. And then he used Bayes' explicit formula for the zeros of the associated Hasevei L-function. And the importance of that upper bound is that we can deduce. Of that upper bound is that we can deduce very uniform upper bounds for the counting function associated to the elliptic curve. And what we get is that it really grows only like b to the epsilon. And most importantly, here the implied constant only depends on epsilon, the dimension of the ambient space, the ground field, and the degree of the embedding. So here we subset. B subset Pn is of degree E, and in particular, otherwise, it has no dependence on the elliptic curve at all. Okay. Okay, yeah, and here that's in characteristic zero, of course, we have to assume that the rank row of the passes is holds. Holds and here I'm actually sweeping quite a lot under the rug because there are some other ingredients, but that's probably the most important one. Okay, how much more time do I have? Sorry? Okay. Okay, then I will quickly talk about how we prove the theorem. Maybe I. Maybe I start with the case these one, or maybe no, let's just do cubic surfaces and let's just assume that the ground field is q okay so in that case we take x to be X to be a cubic surface inside P3. So in particular, F is just an integer homogeneous form of degree 3. Okay. And as I said, the main idea is to use hyperplane sections and then use uniform upper bounds for rational points on curves. Curves. The reason why that has any chance of success is provided by Siegel's lemma, which essentially tells us that we can cover rational points with hyperplanes of low height. So what it says is that if we take an integer vector of height at most b, so now I'm just switching to absolute value. So now I'm just switching to absolute values since anyway the naive height is just that on primitive vectors over q. So if the vector is bounded by b then we can always find a non-zero vector of height at most b to the one over n And X lies on the hyperplane defined by C. Okay, so that's really the starting point. So, I'm gonna introduce a bit more notation. So, I'm gonna write HC. HC for the hyperplane defined by C and X C to be the intersect, the hyperplane section. Then I'm going to define Nc of B just to be the counting function which counts rational points on the hyperplane section. And remember that we have to remove the points on lines. Okay, and then what we get from Siegel's lemma is that we can bound our counting function from above by just taking all the hyperplane sections. All hyperplane sections up to size P to the one-third because we are in P3. Okay, and basically what we do next is we will stratify the dual vector C into small varieties depending on the geometry of the hyperplane section, and then that will determine how good the bounds we Good, the bounds we get for the individual hyperplane sections are. So, in particular, if you take a generic hyperplane section of an elliptic curve, it's going to be a genus one curve and it's going to be smooth. So, in particular, either it has a rational point, then it's an elliptic curve, or if not, then the counting function is just zero. So, in particular, for generic C, For generic C, X C will either be an elliptic curve or a smooth genus 1 curve. So what this implies from the corollary written down over there, we get that the counting function is just bounded by b to the epsilon. Okay, so we only have to count. So, we only have to count the number of available C's, and that's precisely B to the four-thirds. So, we get the contribution, which is precisely the one that we were aiming for in Ethereum. Okay, so that's the generic case. The next case, or the let's say the next best case, in the sense that the hyperplane section is the least degenerate. The hyperplane section is the least degenerate. Is that if we at least assume that it's irreducible but singular, then we have to do two things. First of all, we again need upper bounds for the number of rational points, and that's provided by Bombier repealer type pounds, which were generally. Which were generalized by Parides and Sasig to global fields and first worked out by Keith Brown in the projective setting. Okay, so we take C and Pn to be an irreducible curve. Of a ground field K of degree E, and then what it says is that the number of rational points on that curve, okay, and that yeah, irreducible of height at most b is bounded by b to the 2 over d. And what's again really important here, since we are dealing with a family of curves, is that the implied constant only Curves is that the implied constant only depends on the ambient space, the degree, and the ground field k. Okay, so in particular, what that says in this case, then the counting function, okay, it's singular but irreducible. We're taking a hyperplane section of a cubic surface, so that's just a cubic curve. We get that that's bounded by b to the two-thirds. Um, and what we have to do next. And what we have to do next is get some additional saving of the dual vector C. And that's where the stratification comes into play that I mentioned. Because the hyperplanes which have singular intersection with the cubic surface are actually parametrized by another variety, which is called the dual variety, which is something that Simon already mentioned today in his talk. Okay, so we're gonna denote that by X star, and it again lives in a projective space of the same dimension. And basically, by definition, we have that vector lies in a dual variety if and only if the hyperplane section is singular. Okay, and what's actually known? And what's actually known is that if X is embedded anti-canonically in PD, that's a del Petzo of degree D, then the dual variety will always be a hypersurface of degree 12. Hypersurface Okay, so it has quite large degree so you wouldn't expect too many rational points on it And that's where we use another result crucially which is basically the resolution of the dimension growth conjecture and that was proved And that was proved the first relevant cases by Browning, Heath Brown, and Sahlberger with the determinant method over Q. And then using Sahlberger's generalization of the global determinant method, Parides and Sasig also proved this for any global field. And what it says is that And what it says is that if y is again an irreducible variety in Pn of degree E, then the number of rational points on that variety where we again just use the naive height, then that will bound. Then that will be bounded by the b to the dimension of y. And in our application, that's now not so crucial, but again, from the determinant, you get very uniform bounds. In particular, the implied constant here, again, only depends on the ambient dimension, the degree, and the ground field K. So, in particular, in our setting, now we are interested in the case where the hyperplane. In the case where the hyperplane section is singular, okay, sorry, and I here forgot something important. You need to assume that the degree is at least five. If it's four or three, you get for four, you get an extra epsilon. And for three, you get an additional factor. Yes, but we want to count the dual vectors which have singular. The dual vectors which have singular intersections, and particularly those which lie on the dual variety. And we said the height goes up to b to the one-third. And in particular, I said that's a hypersurface of degree 12. So in our case, a surface, because it's in P3. And so we get an upper bound of the form P2 to 2 thirds. And that implies that we again get a total contribution. Get a total contribution of p to the four-thirds. Ah, now I erased what I just wanted to use. Okay. Anyway, I hope you remember that. So I said for an individual curve, you get b to the four-third, so the total contribution is again the same order of magnitude. Okay, and since it's a long day, I think I just say a few words on how you deal with the other cases and then I will stop. But yes, basically, that's like the whole procedure. You start with the generic case, then for example, here the next generic case forces it to lie on the dual variety. But of course, not like the hyperplane sections, even here, can also be reducible. They can contain. Here can also be reducible, they can contain a line. Then you need to bound the number of rational points on conics, and for them, even the uniform bounds that you get from the determinant method are not good enough. So, in particular, you need to get some extra saving. And that actually becomes more and more difficult the higher the degree of the Tipeto surfaces because the geometry of the hyperplane sections can be more complicated. Yes, but I think I will stop here. Yeah. In principle, yes, but I guess if you take a quartic surface, the generic hyperblin section will have genus 2. So you would need very uniform upper bounds for instance genus 2 curves, which I think is not so sorry genus. Sorry? Genus 3? Right. Yeah. Yes. Yes, but I think that's a very different question in general. But yeah, if you would have that, then you would get uniform bounds, but they wouldn't be any stronger than in the cubic case, even though you would expect fewer because the bottleneck is still a single-sammer. Yeah, I guess then you would get B to the OSH button instead of the epsilon log log.
