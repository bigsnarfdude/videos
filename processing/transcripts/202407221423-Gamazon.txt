To follow these conversations, so these are my disclosures, my sources of funding and support. All right, so I was thinking about what to present to you today, and I decided on a couple of, a small number of research themes here that have been sort of a great interest in my group. So, I'm going to talk about integrated methodologies. I'm going to talk a little bit about. Methodologies. I'm going to talk a little bit about causal incense and change infant closure. And because, you know, a short amount of time, I'm obviously by definition going to just have some examples. Okay, so, you know, in my group, we've been very, very interested in really understanding this relationship between genetic variation and collective choice. We think that this is fundamental, and we think that this can have emotional This can have enormous translational issues. So, we have been building models of gene expression. Now, of course, molecular affinity types span the full range, right? And we think that gene expression is the very advantage example. There are others, alternative polyethylation, protein expression, and type of abundance. And we've been working on those. And some of the movies I'll cover shortly. But the really interesting But the really interesting question for us is: to what extent can we reconstruct gene expression of genetic variations? But we think that this is a methodological and translational choice. And now, you know, a lot of findings from Junior Mars Association studies and biobank studies obviously provide support for the importance of regulation. And so that's what we've been sort of focused on. So that's what we've been sort of focused on. So we've been working on this kind of framework for strict-minded association study. And the way people sometimes think about it is they think of it as providing over the list of genes for associated listings. We're, of course, thinking about it in two different ways, i.e., we're just interested in modeling a molecular feed. And then, separately, we're then asking, okay, to what extent can we use this information to extend our understanding? Information to extend our understanding of ages. And of course, the thing about transcription-wide association studies that makes it very different from differential expression analysis is that we're very focused on the genetically determining control of gene expression. You can think of it as providing a phenotype that is not usually studied. It's basically the genetically Genetically determined expression, and that's what then gets used for association with traits. And a lot of these developments really have been made possible by, for example, the GTEx consortium. So we've been very lucky to participate in that. And also, some of the things that I'm going to be talking about today have a lot, have been really a lot of inspiration. Have been really a lot of these turbulence have been accelerated by presence of small brands. Now, you know, we're very, very obsessed with this question of predicting gene expression from genetic variation. So we developed a kind of platform, an integrated multi-tissue platform, which we call joint tissue prediction, that is sort of a kind of extension of the predict scan that reduces the predict scan in the case of highlight tissue specific. Can in the case of highly tissue-specific gene expression. And that really exploits the power of a multi-tissue reference gamma. And I think how we're thinking about this is really integrating epigenetic data into VG chromatine data to improve addiction performance for gene spectrum. Okay, now we also think that in addition to modeling gene expression, this sort of approach, this sort of integrated methodology, can feel automatic application. So we've explored the different ways that TWAS can be used for risk prediction, for disease subtyping, for drug target discovery, and so on. And one of the things that we've been able to do, one of the exciting things that we've been able to do. One of the exciting things that we've been able to be involved in is our work within the global biodiversity meta-analysis, which Jeff mentioned. And the exciting thing about this is that through its diversity provides us with an unparalleled opportunity to study population-like ancestry-free-specific associations. Now, of course, we're dealing with different types of biovans here, and as we found, when you start doing When you start doing this type of transcription investigation study, there are challenges, new challenges that you see that you don't necessarily see in GWAS, right? So for example, there are challenges at multiple levels. So you still have the challenges from GWAS, so genetic ancestry, population structure, complex patterns, and interesting things. But now you're looking at the genetic component of gene expression, so you have to worry about tissue specificity. Specific cell type and cell state specificity. It turns out that even within the same cell type, there can be a lot of variation. And then, of course, the dynamic trajectory is right because gene expression is quite dynamic. And then, of course, some of the things that have already been mentioned today, there are some challenges with the view type, right? Venotype acquisition, case control resolution, ascertainment files, and so on. Okay. Of course, you know. Of course, you know, there's all kinds of things, you know, the ways that you can integrate or harmonize different EHR systems. Those are some of the things that we've had to kind of face as we apply the TLOS to low-ify that carbon losses emissions. Now, does it actually work? Well, so here's one example where these authors, the Severe COVID-19 Consortium, looked at the genetic mechanisms of critical. You know, the genetic mechanisms of critical illness in flooded MT, and they built these models for gene compression and lungs and monocytes. And what they found is AH, TYA, A2K2, that is one of the four genes that are targeted by JAC invaders, which is basically the reason why this drug, Varysiton, was involved in a couple of phase three randomized controlled trials that went on. Else that went on to be supported after the approval of it. So Vericidina is first approved of COVID-19 immunologically supported future. Now, I mentioned that a lot of the things that we've done have been enabled by things like GTAG. So we've been involved in looking at this using other OMIX data sets. So we participated in the study of proteogenomics, looking for, for example, BQTLs and trying to understand the nature of the regulation of protein expression in human populations. We've also done some studies as part of a group on the plasma metabolome, which is this complete set of circulated metabolites, providing us with a Providing us with a snapshot of human physiology and a person's chemical individuality. Of course, the human metabolism is influenced by a variety of endogenous and exogenous factors, including genetic variation, but also drug and disease-related influences. And we're interested in these molecular phenotypes as a way of really understanding mechanisms of disease, but also as a way of enabling prediction of disease or disease. Okay, now some of you in the audience have gone beyond all of what I'm talking about and I've extended this to other omic layers. So there's a study, there's a proteome-wide association study that's been done, multi-ancestry PWAS. Basically, this is just, this is an extension of the TWAS approach that basically integrates proteomics with GWAS table. And there's been a study. And there's been a study that built models of isoform mobile expression. Okay, so I'm going to stop there, and I'm going to now switch to a related topic, which is causality. So one of the main findings from genome-wide association studies is that for a lot of phenotypes, associated genetic variation is just scattered throughout, just distributed well. And so, you know, Jonathan Fritcher. You know, Jonathan Fritcher kind of framed this in a really intriguing kind of way, collective kind of way. And so he and his group partitioned the genome into two sets of genes, the core genes and the peripheral genes. Now, what distinguishes the core genes from the peripheral genes is their proximity to the phenotype. They directly affect the phenotype. Okay? And so, and then this particular perspective by Ian Matheson sort of extended this, even though the original model did not propose core environmental effects and peripheral environmental effects, it makes sense to include these. And you can see that over here that core genes really are explained. Really are explaining not very much of the heritability. But because of this network of genes, you can have these genes that are a small number of steps away from these four genes, and they're also contributing substantial amounts to her. But of course, we asked the question: okay, well, is there another way of looking at this? So we were interested in perhaps looking at some. At it, looking at some of the more upstream genes, not the core genes, they're directly different. And here's the reason. So you can imagine this causal diagram here. So you have fecal impaction X1 causing bacterial inflammation of the appendix X2, which in turn causes lower abdominal pain more often. It's great because when you have a biobank, you can do all kinds of analyses like this. And now, of course, you can imagine treating the patient with opaloids. The patient with opalooids or pain medications that directly act on life. These medications, of course, ignore the entire pathogenesis of impaction, inflammation, leading to the lower abdominal pain. So what we need are definitive treatments, right, that remove the inflammation, such as hemparophase, or both the impacts of inflammation, such as apricots. So we thought that maybe what we really need to be doing is to be looking at. What we really need to be doing is to be looking at the root causal genes rather than the more downstream causal genes. What are some of the challenges? Root causal genes are the initial changes to gene expression that induce a pathogenic gas kitty, ultimately resulting in a downstream diagnosis. We think that treating root causal genes can modify disease pathogenesis in its entirety, whereas targeting other causes may only provide central pathogen. But of course, and And again, I want to emphasize that the root causal genes differ from the chlor genes because chlor genes lie at the end rather than at the beginning of orthogenesis. So what are some of the challenges of identifying root causal genes? Complex diseases often have an overwhelming number of causal genes. Patient specificity. A patient may have multiple root causal genes that are different from other patients within the same diagnosis. And root causal omnigenicity. The root causal genes may be as The root causal genes may be a small subset of the causal genes. And there's been no existing method to identify root causal genes from observation available. Existing methods seek to identify associational or even causal relations. We need a measure of root causal strength to identify root causal relations, weak perturbations, as for example. So we developed an algorithm called root causal strength using perturbations. Consider here a latent causal graph over the true counts in A, so the XI tool is. True counts in A. So the XI tool that's here are the true transpression counts. And you can imagine augmenting this graph with these BIs. And these are causal inference return error terms, but in fact they are the conglomeration of unobserved root causal effects, maybe genetic, maybe environmental. And then we define a root causal strength. Strength, denote by phi, in this case the root causal strength of x2 tilde, quantifying the strength of the root causal effect from e to y, conditional on the parent of x2 tilde. Of course, we cannot observe, you know, in practice, but instead only observe the noisy surrogates xi, right, corrupted by Poisson measurement there. Something that There. So, this is something that we have worked on extensively, and others as well, with experimental support for saying this. Now, imagine perturbing now in E, a gene XE tilde. That can have downstream consequences on the marginal distribution of these variables in green, right? And so, how do we then develop this algorithm? Well, we use perturbation. To identify the surrogate ancestral ancestors of a given gene. And we find that this approach using RMS, you know, read means per error relative to other approaches does fare very well. And in terms of computational time and so on as well. So, in summary, we have a framework for identifying weak. We have a framework for identifying root-causal genes using error terms of structural equation models, each error term representing a conglomeration of unobserved root causes. We do not, of course, have access to error terms in the packet, so we introduce root causes score that detects root causal genes without recovering error term values as an intervenes. We build a couple of theorems and so on. So I invite you to read our prevent for details. We think of this algorithm, our CSP algorithm. Our CSP algorithm computes the root causal strength given knowledge of the causal ancestors of each variable. So we obtained by controversy-seek. So it's another integrative methodology. And here's the key takeaway. We detect an omnigenic root causal model, an apologenic relational model. We find that this approach can be used to deal in the information studies. Okay. You know, we've been thinking about kind of You know, we've been thinking about kind of causality in terms of also a related concept, which is helping us to understand the function of genes, the mechanisms by which genes influence phenotype. And so we decided to actually focus on a subset of these genes that are quite important for maintaining the intracellular chemical escape. And these are the transporters, ion channels, enzymes, from which the exact molecular substrates are remaining loose. We think that okay, if we can somehow help. We think that, okay, if we can somehow help in this process of identifying the molecular substrates, we might be able to identify the function of these genes. Now, of course, the challenge is large. There's enormous special orders in here, functional redundancy, and so on. But these genes are quite important and are involved in a wide range of these orders. We have a paper that just came out this last week where we actually developed this particular approach, where our goal is to identify molecular substrates. Identify molecular substrates for these metabolic genes, these transporters and enzymes, for which there is no very little understanding of molecular action. And we hope that that can contribute to your understanding of mechanisms and so on, including mechanisms and physics. Okay, we conducted a lot of functional studies, which I won't have time to get into. I won't have time to get into. I'd love to talk to you about it. Phenotype imputation, we were influenced by some studies out there. In biobank data, we have a lot of missing data, highly weak data. It's going to be very expensive, very costly, logistically challenging to generate these types of data by measurements, given all of these challenges. A lot of the tissues involve invasive procedures as well. Very complex patterns of missingness. Very complex patterns of missingness. But as Anne et al. showed, in fact, you can model the non-linear relationships among these phenotypes that may need to be modeled for improve accurate deputation. And they developed this approach called Autocomplete, a deforming-based auto-encoder architecture designed for highly complete bio-bank scale phenotype data. And so this, they trained using a They trained using a copy mask procedure that simulates realistic missingness value. So, what effect this does, what autocomplete does is it minimizes false function that is defined on the observed data, but also on the missing data. We have, of course, our own for developed for imputation, a transcriptional imputation. And what strikes me about these methods is that About these methods is that it's a hypergraph factorization, a neural network approach, where you represent multi-tissue gene expression as a hypergraph of tissues, individuals, and their genes. And uses a message passing kind of approach to obtain factorized representations and then transfer back into the resulting expression space. And so, what strikes me about that? And so, and what strikes me about this is that there's a lot of structures out there that maybe mathematicians are very familiar with. They're interested in classifying groups, range, fields, double electrons, manifolds, and so on. But we have these in genomics data, phenomic data even, that I think we should be paying attention to, because a lot of methods that we're developing may well apply in these various contexts. Okay, so points for discussion, unite variation-based multi-ominous modeling. Discussion of genetic variation-based multi-ambrias modeling is a rich area of research with all sorts of interesting methodological applications for the biological analysis. Root causal gene entrance is a promising approach for gene discovery and drug target discovery, which I didn't get a chance to get into. We'll have some examples. Lots of similar structures, plus Onix data, which should be documented and perhaps just all right. Take questions. Questions? Okay, questions on questions critique by the mention of these hypergraph structures. So, what we did in the auto-feet work was we didn't use any structure. The copy mask was hyperlabs and feedback. And I guess the hypergraphs are And I guess the hypergraphs are, I guess, prior knowledge of relationships with phenotypes of genes. Right, so basically, inductive bias, right, is what you call it, that basically leverages the shared regulatory of gene losses. We observe that in Eugene Tech Consortium. So we use that particular thing. But what's really interesting is that you can use this kind of hydrograph actualization in genomic data and then perhaps be able to Be able to do subtype individuals. So we found, for example, with the computation that in a kind of transfer learning, we can use the same kind of model for cell type convolution. So a task that actually was trained for one thing and then used a really good task. And we think that these types of And we think that these types of structures and perhaps transfer learning have a lot of possibilities in genomics. Okay. So I'm really fascinated by the phenotype imputation. Have you seen work that actually also utilized to incorporate foundational model as an input, as a dual layer input into the messing pa message passing principle? Foundational models, and there's a lot of papers still going out there. So it's a very exciting area, right? I didn't get a chance to talk to you about some of the kind of deep learning methods that we're exploring for generic variation-based images. The idea is that you have all these complex patterns, right? Maybe nonlinear effects that you might be able to get at. You couldn't get at with our original technical classical model. Technically, glass longer. But I think there are others who are pursuing a lot of these same questions. So yeah, it's an exciting time. But all of these, you know, I see this as improving our understanding, our biological understanding, but then transferring behavior to translational operations in the context of biodiversity. Okay. Let's have a look at it. We're going to be back at 3 p.m. for the next session. And save your questions for the discussion. Okay. Fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. So you're all these things. So the phenomenon is fully improved that human vector is saying. Oh, really? Oh, really? You can click in the team. Yeah, let me know what I have.     So if you've got a lot of specifications. But you know, it's very old, you know, it's beautiful. Uh, but uh, you don't need to be laughing. So, what we're doing is we're following all of these like. So I don't know if I want to get somewhere else. Very expressive. Yeah, I haven't done it with the best. I wouldn't be sure, yeah. So I heard you had to find something else if you wanted to have like a unit. I don't know. Yeah, we try to there are some challenges. Sometimes we'll get that's why eventually. There's some small issues to that. It doesn't matter if the HMG is a lot of the rents for it. Yeah, it doesn't have to work on it.
