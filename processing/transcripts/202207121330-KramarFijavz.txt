To take this invitation and to finally be in this famous place, Banf, which is really beautiful. So I hope we can meet one time we can come here again and also to use this week. And I'm also maybe not a member of this community, I only know a few people here, but it's really nice to meet all of you and to maybe talk to you more about mathematics as well. So this is my topic. Let's first introduce the second. First, introduce the setting. Okay, this is a very simple example of a graph. It is a finite, connected, compact, metric graph. By metric I mean that actually I partize all the edges. So I consider all the edges as an intervals where some functions will live. And on these intervals, I will consider the I will consider the transport equation. So, along every edge, I will have a transport equation. Okay, maybe I should call it also quantum graph, especially if you consider Schrodinger equation, then usually this object is called a quantum graph. But if I find it strange to call it a quantum graph by considering this simple equation, so what are T and S? T is time and S is space. So, S is inside. Is space. So S is inside this interval and T is just time. So we have this derivative in time equals some velocity, which may depend on space and the space derivative. One could also add some other absorption coefficients, but let's keep it like this. And standard boundary conditions for such an object. For such an object. So, on each edge, we have this equation, and then we have to tell what happens in these vertices. And usually, one assumes for the transport equation one have some distribution rules. So, you can imagine some material being transported, and then you say, I don't know, one third of material goes here, and two-thirds here, or something like this. And usually, one also assumes some conservation of mass, so like the inflow equals to outflow equals. Inflow equals to outflow in every vertex. So, this is so-called Girlhof laws, right? And these are the standard conditions, and such a problem has been studied by many authors, although it did not deserve that much attention as Schrodinger equation or Laplace equation. The usual quantum graph communities, there are more papers than just this transport equation, but nevertheless. Just this transport equation, but nevertheless, let me mention that to my knowledge, Barletti first studied this problem when he was studying Kinar-Boltzmann equation on a graph, and it was 1996. And then next work I'm aware of was actually the paper I wrote together with Esther Shikolya, it was 2005, and we used semi-group methods to show well closed. To show well-posedness of such a problem and also to study spectrum of this operator. And then there were many, many authors who actually followed our approach, the semi-group approach, and some of them are named here, not all of them. And then from here on, Jakob Zwart and so on, there is another approach. So I forgot to mention, so all these papers, so initiated with our work, we studied. Initiated with our work, we studied this on the L1 space, and we used the Banach-Lattis theory, the positives and group theory on these spaces. While there is another approach by another group of people who study this problem on L2 spaces, and they use fourth-hand-dominant system and system theory approach. And these are actually the classical approaches so far. Now, what I would like to do now. Uh now what I would like to do now is actually first to consider not just compact graphs, but also non-compact parts. So which means that to my compact graph I also add some semi-axis. So these are 0, 1 intervals and here are R plus glue to it. Okay then I also will consider very general velocity coefficients. So in the initial works I will So in the initial work, so maybe I should go a little bit back. In the initial works, so actually these were numbers, they were not functions, and then there were even some conditions on these numbers. To obtain nice vector results, one should have some rational dependence and stuff like that. But just to obtain the well-posonance, you don't need this, and you can even have the functions it's normal, just the constant, right? So, this is what I will do, and also. I will do and also classical mistake so I will also put these C's so these velocities will not depend actually so you you will see later on they will not be diagonal so on each edge they could I mean one could have dependence between different edges also. Okay also I will directly go to LP space. I will directly go to LP spaces for any p between 1, including 1 and excluding infinity. Previous approaches, I think we just recall were just L1 or L2. And my boundary conditions will be very general. Not this standard one, but I will try to be as general as possible. And my goal is to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for imposing. So I would like somehow to. For imposing. So I would like somehow to characterize the boundary conditions such so that the problem is not possible. So not that given boundary conditions are possible, but I would like to characterize the conditions so that the problem is not possible. Okay, so and the main idea is the boundary perturbation. So what I mean by that, so the main idea is actually very simple. So I consider I first Consider, I first take my graph and put it apart. And I have actually just intervals. Some intervals are infinity. So these are 0, 1 intervals, these are 0, infinity. And then I perturb, and then I consider equations on these intervals, which is known. And then transport is simple, right? And then I glue together this. Glued together these intervals via boundary conditions, via perturbation, actually. And then I obtain my graph back from this. And the okay, now how we do this abstractly? So this is my abstract Cauchy problem. Operator A is actually the right-hand side of the previous equation, of the transport equation. So we have this operator matrix. We have on each enter we have some. We have on each enter we have some time, some space-dependent coefficients and space derivative. And my space consists is a product space, so there are two kind of LP spaces. One is on the finite, on the contact part and one on this semi-axis part. So let's assume we have M finite edges and L semi-axis attached together. And the boundary conditions are hidden in here. So this phi is my boundary operator. So this phi is my boundary operator, and which describes the boundary conditions. And what is the dimension? So I have this Banach space is this one, and the dimension of my boundary space is smaller than m plus L. I have m plus L edges. And the first mistakes one does is actually that one thinks that the measure of the boundary space is the number of the vertices, which is not correct. Which is not correct. Because if you take a b uh maybe I should go to so if you have this equation, for example, so my equation is the first derivative, which means the first derivative is a generator of a transport semigroup, right? And we have to put, so if you have a finite interval, you have to put the boundary conditions at one end. It depends whether this first derivative is positive or negative. This first derivative is positive or negative, whether it goes from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. So once you put here, one direction once you hear it. It depends on the sign of this coefficient c, whether it is d to dx or minus d to dx. And when you have this semi-axis, actually, there is only, so if you have plus d to dx, then you don't need to, there are no boundary conditions here. But if you have minus, But if you have minus, then you need to put abandonment conditions here. So altogether you have for all the compact parts, you have conditions either here or here, so altogether m and here could be smaller than l because it depends on the sign of the velocity. So altogether my boundary space will be smaller, dimensionally smaller than m plus l. Okay, now Okay, now I will use the abstract result from the about the perturbation of the domains of the generators. And this actually goes back to work of Greiner, Minto Greiner in 1987. Then Weiss and Staffans proved some results in the language of system theory and which are now called Weiss-Staffens perturbation results. And then simultaneously, these two groups, actually almost simultaneously, I think they did it simultaneously, but it was published in different years, they proved these results in the language of semi-group theory, which I will use now. And so, what is what I will just first say their abstract setting. So, we have these two Banach spaces, we have our maximal operator. Operator on balance is X, and then our boundary operator we split to two parts. So part, we just split it to L minus C, where L is actually the if I just take the L, then and I take the kernel of L as my domain with the same action of the maximum operator, then I have a generation of a C0. Then I have a generation of a C0 semi-group. And then I need to perturb this with this operator C to get my original operator I'm interested in. So I know that A0 is a generator, and now my question is, what are the conditions on this phi so that the perturbed operator, which also contains this other boundary condition, would be a semi-group generator. Generate. And there are some abstract results here. So, under this assumption, they prove conditions which are quite complicated. So, I will not state the results here because I would have to introduce many more notations, which would be then just to take so much of my time. But let me just say that, in a way, one needs to show that one associates an object. one associates an operator to this high so that this operator should be invertible. So the invertibility of a certain operator is crucial to get it to get the robustness or to semi-group generation. The boundary condition operator is relatively compact with respect to the very weak perturbation, right? Perturbation, right? Which you mean which one? So the boundary of the rate of C with respect to C? Not necessarily, not necessarily. But it's relatively bounded. Yeah, this probably is, yeah. Cool, yeah. It does not need to be smooth. So you can imagine here, so for example, in our, when we have this compact. When we have this compact case, A naught is typically you assume you take boundary condition, directly boundary condition, directly for transport is strange, you take zero condition, you take the value zero at the beginning. And this is A0, and then you have the nil potentially. And then instead of taking zero, then you want you want to start assign something else. And this something else could be a I don't think that there are many assumptions in this. Could be pretty much Could be pretty much it's not this smallness or abundantness here that it matters, yeah. Okay. Uh so um and I will not also I I did not formulate this the abstract result and I will also not formulate our most abstract result we obtained because it is it would again demand too much patience. I will only concentrate on the special case and this is the case where our boundary conditions can be written. Where our boundary conditions can be written in a matrix-wise fashion. So I call these boundary matrices. So, what are my assumptions here? This velocity coefficient should be bounded, so functions. Then, an important assumption is okay, I said that this could be uh any, but uh actually I need uh to know that they are uh diagonalizable. Diagonalizable, and that so these are these velocity coefficients in front of the time of the space derivative. And what are these E means external and E internal. So internal part are this compact part of my graph and external part are the semi-axis. And when I can diagonalize this so that all this, so that this diagonal this function These functions on the diagonal have strictly contact sign on an interval. So they are either on the whole interval positive or either on the whole interval negative. Because I need to know this so that to impose the boundary condition on the right end. And these q's here are just some bounded continuous functions with bounded numbers. Okay, so these are my assumptions. And then what I do, I take the And then what I do, I take the projections to these, the spectral projections to these positive or negative values. So with plus or minus are actually those who have plus or minus here and external and internal. And then I know that actually what is now the dimension of my boundary space I was talking about. So actually in the compact case I take all the intervals because on the compact intervals, either on one side or on the other side I have a boundary condition. Or on the other side, I have a boundary condition. While on the semi-axis, I need boundary conditions only where I have minuses. So that only this range of this operator, P minus, is important. So I have, I denote by N this space which is smaller or in the measure smaller equal than L plus N. Okay, now our theorem is: so if this boundary So, if this boundary operator looks like this, so this delta minus delta 0 and delta 1 are point evaluations. So, actually, this condition means that if I apply it to, okay, I have here f external, f internal, it would be I have V0 and then I apply F zero. 0 plus U 0 I F I 0 plus 1. It's a minus there, I guess that minuses. Okay. So this is this means this denotation, this means just evaluation of a function at 0 or at 1. And so, and this And so and this y v0 and v1, these are some matrices. And additionally, I also have this, I also have some operator B of this and this B is any bounded operator. And what was our result? Operator A would be a generator if and only if this This thing holds. So this guy is invertible. So I have this. So this is a matrix. This is then Q's for this in my diagonalization of the velocity field and then velocity functions. And you see that also these pluses and minuses appear here because it they take care that I take the conditions Take care that I take the conditions in those sites where it is needed. So, this is very nice because we have if and only if result. So, this is the characterization. Now, you can try the different matrices and you see immediately whether this is well-posed or not well-posed properly. And it is even simpler if you consider just complex graphs and also. And also just diagonal velocities, because if I take diagonal velocities, I don't have these q's anymore, I don't need to diagonalize them. And then the condition is much simpler than actually I have m times n, m, so I have a square matrix, and I can just compute the determinant. And if they are, for example, all of the same sign, which are usually one even assume, orient them in such a way that one have the same sign, then you only compute one matrix, either this or this. 1 matrix, either this or this. Depends which sign you take. And also, because if A and minus A generate a semi-group, then A is a generator of a group. So you can also prove when you have even a group. Just to compute the other way to determine that. But this is a very simple condition to verify. And now let us check this with the standard conditions that were Check this with the standard conditions that were already known before. Usually, in all the literature, it was assumed that the velocities are diagonal and they were all oriented so that you had minus sign there. And in this case, the standard conditions were like this. So we just take some coefficients evaluation in zero should equal to something evaluated at one. These are the standard conditions written in a matrix manner. And by our results, Matter and by our results we have a generator if only this matrix is in particle. So it doesn't this matrix doesn't even matter. Okay? And maybe I forgot to mention this B. You see I had this B here and the condition does not depend on B either. So I can add here anything I want which is okay, anything which is bounded. Anything which is bounded from x to v. Okay, and what does it so actually my if this v naught is invertible, I can write these conditions in this form, and this is how they are usually written in the literature, and this matrix here is actually it has resembles the graph structure, this adjacency matrix of the line graph, which edge is connected to which edge. That's what it's like. In each edge. That's what this matrix actually. And now we do the same for the non-compact graph. So now the standard boundary conditions could be written in this form. So we know that we have in one we only have the compact part, the inner part, and in zero we have both. And then our conditional invertibility condition says that A would be a generator if and only if this would be a full rank matrix. rank matrix which means that it is more penguins invertible and one can write them like this and this would be now the new equivalent of this adjacency matrix with this morphendross inverse so this is something that was not received before but with the previous result actually we cover all the previous results on compact routes okay now let me conclude conclude with some simple examples Conclude with some simple examples. Okay, this one is maybe too simple. Okay, we'll just go quickly. So, this is the compact graph with diagonal coefficients. These are the standard conditions. We just say, for example, here we have alpha, proportion alpha goes here, and one minus alpha here. And here, everything goes back to the street. So, these are these conditions, can be written with matrices like this, and we. With matrices like this, and we have here an identity matrix, which is, of course, invertible. So we have a semi-group, but it's not a group because this is not invertible. Easy to check. And then you can play around, so you can, for example, put two semi-axis and then write the conditions with certain coefficients and you verify our invertibility conditions and you see that A would be a generator if and only if so this A, D and mu are not. G and μ are not zero. And the others do not matter, for example. And then let me just, okay, there is another example with non-diagonal velocities. I wanted to point this out because if the velocities are non-diagonal, then you also have this Q here. And I chosen here a very simple example, and this matrix is invertible, but and if both And if both, so if I have if in both cases in the same direction, everything would be fine. I would have invertible semi-group, I would have a semi-group, but if they are in the opposite direction, like it is here on this picture, then one actually uh checks this and if if you evaluate q in one and q in zero and then you take one uh different uh rows, you get the ma matrix that is singular. The matrix that is singular. So, actually, also these values of Q, this is important for the product. And let me just, for the last example, I want to show you something more, because actually our general theory does not only cover the graphs, I mean the these graph matrices or these graph conditions, but you can also, for example, take just one interval. Okay, just one interval, and then you take this kind of condition. So you say a function evaluated at one is equal to this b actually the integral of the whole interval. Okay, so these are non-local boundary conditions. And by our results, because I told you that this B does not matter, actually this is what goes from. And this is very applicable in. This is applicable in bio biology, it's called candle or candle, I think. It's not me called boundary coolness. Oh, it's not really boundary, yeah. Okay, well, but on one side it is boundary. So here you take evaluation at this point depends on the everything what happened before on this. So one side. Okay, so the Okay, so that's it, and all the results and more general version can be found in this paper which has been published this year. And for some overview of these final processes, I just write you to this survey paper. And the last thing I wanted to say: if you're interested in this kind of problems, you are welcome to join our course action. You can find this on this address. You can find this on this address, MaltinNet, where we have several working groups and organized workshops and research days. We mostly confound European participants, but maybe some visits to some external hosts can also be covered for this. So thank you. Are there any questions, comments? But I didn't get why when you have this semi-interval, especially the particular elemental, why do you need to put some extra condition only when the direction of the spatial direction is outgoing and not ongoing or plastic? Because I mean, correctly, you are looking for boundary conditions that make your spatial operator maximally symmetric, so you have the generator of the semi-group, this is the condition. This is the condition. Why maximum is the spectrum? Because when you are going to get a generator of a semi-group, you just need the spectrum to be just on the upper half plane or in the lower half plane, depending on what the time direction that you might have at distances. But in any case, why are you getting just border definitions when you have? If you have this, this is the simplest. I mean, if you have. So, if you have a transport that's coming from here, you can, I mean, you don't have, it's just coming, and you must not prescribe anything here because, you know. This is the usual, so the translation semi-group is the solution to this problem. And then, without the boundary condition. And this is one, so maybe it's And this is one so maybe it's um yeah it it it is uh I don't know the the symmetry I don't understand what you were talking about. It is different than the second order equation, so it's just the first order and this is the difference and then O D E is a first order O D E. Either the solution flows and then you you you don't have any first order or it doesn't in which case Or it doesn't in which case? Yeah. Yeah. My question is about the LP. So you have conditions if and only if generated. Is this for all P and then the negation of that with that? If that condition is not satisfied for some P that is generated or it's only I was cheating a little bit. So if and only if only does not Only if only does not, we don't have a result for any kind, just for the boundary matrices. Because when you have these point evaluations, then it is easier to write this invertibility condition. If you don't have point evaluations and you have more abstract operators, then we have only sufficient conditions. We don't have necessary. But for everything we have, actually, the P does. We have actually the P does not matter. So, for any L P Do also have on continuous functions on the graph? That it's not if you have a state compact graph? You mean for the transport equation? Yes, and then that you have a semiconductor on the continuous functions of it. So, not with these tools, but there are some results here. Yeah. But I don't know what are the boundary conditions there. I think for the standards, probably. Yeah. So Adam Buburevsky had something for the continuous function on graph, I think. For the transport equation. So suppose I have a big graph. Have a big graph, and in between two vertices, there are several parallel edges. But maybe I don't actually care about what's happening in between those two vertices, I just care about the rest of the graph. Is there a way that we can collapse those parallel edges into a single edge to make the problem simpler? So, okay, first of all, here I only treated uh sing so between two vertices there was just one edge. Vertices, there was just one edge in my case. One of your first example you did had. Ah, because they were in different directions. You had two in one direction, one in the other direction. Yeah, but there could be just those two, and then that's it, yeah. Yeah. Okay. If you have several in the same direction, then you either actually I do the opposite, I put vertex in the middle so that I don't have parallel edges. But if you want to put them together. Probably one should be able to do this, but I never try to. So, thanks a lot, and let's thank the speaker again. I will be trying our first online quote.
