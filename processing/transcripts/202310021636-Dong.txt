Welcome back to November. It was very cold at the time. And this year, the weather is much better. Okay, so today I'm going to talk about our end result with Francisco Concerto and also Fuyi Muyan about the 1D one-phase Moosecut problem. So we consider a free boundary problem in 2D or 3D fluid filtered in porous media. So this equation So this equation is known as one-phase Moosecut problem. So what we proved is that if the initial free boundary is a graph of a periodic Lipschitz function, then there exists a unique verbal solution which is also Lipschitz, which is back to the time variable. And the solution is also unique. Okay, so first of all, I'm going to go ahead and Okay, so first let me give you a formulation of the problem and also some previous results in this direction. So the equation describes the fluid permitting a porous medium. So the porous medium is assumed to be homogeneous. So the equation can be described as the classical Darcy law. So mu times the velocity u is equal to u is equal to minus gradient of the pressure minus rho times 0, 1. So this is the two-dimensional case. The last term is the gravity term. And also we assume that the fluid is incompressible, so we have divergence of u is equal to 0. So in the 2D case, we assume that the fluid is occupied in this omega t with some free boundary sigma t. So here u is the So here u is the velocity, p is the pressure term because if you take the divergence of the first equation, you can see that using the divergence-free condition, the left-hand side is equal to zero, and the right hand side becomes Laplace of P. So Laplace P is equal to zero, so that means p is a harmonic function. And here, mu is the dynamic viscosity, and rho is the density of the fluid. So this problem is known as the So this problem is known as the one-phase most card problem and the mathematical rate is also equivalent to the vertical hybrid shield equation. So this problem was first introduced by Maurice Muscat in 1930s and it arises from underground water flow in the oil industry. Okay, so the free boundary of the domain omega T. of the domain omega t is denoted by sigma t. So the free boundary moves around the velocity of the fluid. So this is the equation. So V of the free boundary is equal to the projection of the velocity in the normal direction. So n is the normal direction, but the free boundary. So here we uh do not consider the surface tension uh so that the pressure is actually continuous function across the the free boundary. function across the free moment. So let's assume that the pressure is equal to zero outside the fluid, then P is equal to zero if you restrict it is P on the boundary of the fluid. And what we are interested in is the geometry and also the regularity of the free boundary as time evolves. So there are two cases which people studied. One is the case when the boundary The case when the boundary can be described as the graph of a certain function. So, the other case is the boundary is not a graph. For both cases, there are many results in this direction about the existence and uniqueness of local strong solutions in various settings, for example, multi-phase rigid boundaries with surface tension and also non-constant probability. So, let me mention some results in this direction. So, first is the global existence and the uniqueness of solutions when the initial free boundaries has a small norm in certain boundary spaces starting from 2004. So, there are several works in this direction. And also, there are work when the initial data is not small, but also not large. Also, not large, so-called median data in the Wiener algebra space or the Lipschitz space. For example, see the work by Kanstein in Kotova conceptual strain in 13 and 16. And also, people study the case when the initial data is small in critical solvent spaces, but large or also large in the reach is small. So, for this equation, we will see later. For this equation, we will see later that the Lipschitz norm is also a critical space. So the initial Lipschitz norm can be large or even infinity, but if you impose the smallness condition on the critical subject space, you can still prove the global verposeness of the equation. So when people consider the equation, when the initial data is not abroad, usually Usually it is assumed that the sigma zero is close to a circle. In this direction, there will apply a check-up chain and also constantly. Okay, so how about largely? So for the two-phase problem, there's a work by Deng, Lei, and Ling in 2017. They proved that if the initial Uh the initial uh uh free boundary is a monotone uh function, then uh there exists uh a global big surge. Uh but they didn't prove the uniqueness of solution and also the surgeon is big. Uh and there has not been any global well-posedness result uh for initial data of arbitrary size either for weak or strength. So these are the story for the well postnets. Also there are many work in this direction for the finite time similarity of solutions. So let me mention some of them. So for the two-phase problem, it has been proved that if the initial graph has a very large slope, then at some point the At some point, there's a tunnel means that the solution is no longer a graph. So it's from stable region to unstable region. And if the solution enters the unstable region, then it is possible that after another some time, the solution lose regulating point of time. For the one-phase problem, if starting from a graph initial boundary, On a graph initial boundary, there's no ten over. So that means it is always a graph of some functions. And also for the one-phase problem, it has been proved that the solution can develop scratch singularity. So this is a result by Castro, Kotopa, Settlement, and Concerto in 2016. They prove that if They prove that if the initial data is not a graph of a function, then it is possible that the solution, for the one-phase problem, it is possible that the solution will develop so-called sparse singularity. So that means the solution will, the graph of the solution will touch itself at some point. However, for the two-phase problem, this cannot happen. So these are the results by Kansas and Baulstreme. Concept of and false grain. For both cases, it has been proved that there is no spread singularity, so the solution cannot touch with itself along a curve. This case has been about okay, so nevertheless, there are still two fundamental questions for the one-phase problem. The first one is: does there exist a unique Does there exist a unique role solution if the initial data is large? Another question is: what is the long-term variety of such solutions? So in our work, we address the free bone. So roughly speaking, we prove that if the initial free boundary is a graph of periodic and Lipschitz function, then there exists a unique global Lipschitz solution in the strong sense. Reaches the solution in the strong sense. So the solution satisfies the equation at almost every point. Moreover, the solution is a unique viscosity solution. This is roughly speaking, our result. Okay, so next let me reformulate the problem. Again, omega t is the can be written as y is less than f x t. So this is the region occupied by the fluid. By the fluid. So we assume that this f is a 2π periodic function in x. Then it's not difficult to derive from the previous equations that this f actually satisfies the following equivalent in the local probability type equation. Ft is equal to minus kappa GFF, where kappa is equal to the ratio of log and u. So what is this kappa G? So, what is this capital G? So, this capital G is the relation to Newman operator. Suppose that you have two functions, F and G, both periodic. Then, this F is the function of the graph of the boundary. And this G is H1 function, and we assume that F is a H's function. Then, what we do is we first solve this drill. So we first saw this Dirich boundary problem. So Laplace phi is equal to zero in omega with boundary condition fx phi x f x is equal to gx. And then we take the normal derivative of the solution, then this is the derivatives to moment operator. And turns out that uh this is actually a first order uh elliptical. And uh uh because of this, this equation is uh distributed. Is distributed. So, some examples of the derivatives normal operator: if the domain is the half space, then the normal derivative of the solution is exactly, can be written as the square root of the half in this case. So, this is the square root of Laplace in the one-dimensional case. And if the domain is above relative 1, then you can also write down the explicit. Then you can also write down the explicitly the direct normal equation. So this is very similar to the previous case. So instead you integrate from i s pi to pi and you take the finite segment of the difference divided by square of sine x prime square dx. Okay, so for this derivative to numeral operators, there's a very simple and useful property. That is if you add a constant to G and add another constant to S. g and the other constant to f, then the value does not change. So because of this, if f is a solution to the previous equation here, then f plus a constant is also a solution. And also if you shift f by x0, this is a skew a solution. So this is the more precise statement of our result. We assume that f0 is a Ripschis function, then we can find a solution. Then we can find a solution which is continuous in t times 0 to infinity. So this is the time variable, this is the x variable. And also if this is L infinity in t and if it's in x. And also the time derivative of f using this L infinity L2 space. And F satisfies the equation in L infinity in T L L 2 in X. So it satisfies the equation. So, it satisfies the equation almost everywhere. And moreover, we have this Lipschitz maximum variety. So, for any time t, the Lipschitz norm of the solution with respect to x is founded by the Lipschitz norm of the initial condition. And the search solution is unique. So, our result appears to be the first global repository result of the Musca problem for arbitrary finitions. So before I give you a description of the proof, so let me give you a remark of the so-called comparison principle. So if the solution is sufficiently smooth, then we have the following comparison principle. If you have two initial data, F0 and F0 tilde, then evolving from F0, the solution is always less than or equal to the solution evolving from F0 tilde. So we have these components. So consequently, So, consequently, by using this property I pointed out before, so this simple property, we can ensure that if the solution is affinitely smooth, then the modulus of continuity of the initial data is preserved. And furthermore, if the uh the solution is sufficiently smooth, then uh the slope of the solution at any time is bounded by uh the the lipid slope. The Lipschitz NOR of the solution of the initial condition. So, this is called the Maximum principle for the Lipschitz North. Okay, so next I will give you a description of the proof of the existence part. So, we used the viscosity solution approach. As usual, we can define viscosity super solution and subsolution by touching the By touching the solution below and above smooth functions. And of exposing disposal, it's positive sub-solution. Okay, so what we do is we add this extra dissipation term, epsilon times the partial x square, f epsilon, and then we solve this new equation and the possible limit as epsilon goes to 0. And from this, we can get a disposal solution. And we use the real potential representation of the. The layer potential representation of the Dirichlet Uni operator in the next slide. Okay, so there's something interesting in 2D. So in 2D, the Newtonian, the final solution of Laplace in this T times R can be written down explicitly. So this is 1 over 4π times log of hyperbolic cosine of y minus cosine x. So So, I didn't know this before. This seems to be quite interesting in 2D. Then, by using this, we can write down the double layer potential of a function as follows. And also, we can write down the single layer potential by using this quite explicit formula. With this, the deletion problem I mentioned before can be the solution. Can be the solution can be written in terms of the double random potential. So this is k acton inverse of I over 2 plus k acton G. And if f is a Lipschitz function and G is a H1 function, then we can express the ratio to normal operator in terms of the single layer potential. So you first take the single layer potential on theta, where theta is a solution, can be expressed by. The solution can be expressed by this potential. Then you take the gradient and you effectively you take the normal derivative or the singular potential. And you can express this derivative to normal operator in terms of this integral on the torus. So this is a singular integral, so we need to put the principal value here. Okay, so Okay, so because now we are considering Lipschitz domain, so it is not very classical, but still it's classified as a classical result due to Macheta in 1984, where he studied a real potential estimate when the domain selections. So in particular, he proved that one half i minus k star, where k star is the adjoint operator of the double layer potential, is a bounded operator. is a bounded operator from L20 to L20. So here is L20 is a function in L2 such that the average is L20. And it is also invertible provided that the boundary is richness. So in our work we require this result and furthermore we actually did a more quantitative estimate. So what we proved is that this operator inverse Operator inverse is bounded from L20 to L20, and its operator norm can be bounded by 1 plus the expression norm of f to the power of 5 over 2. So somehow we need a more precise, more quantitative estimate in our proof. Also with this, we can estimate the deletion rate to Newman operator, the L2 norm. So if you look at the So if you look at the right side, so this bit is basically the H dot one of G. So roughly speaking, this GFG is the first order derivative of H. And the norm is controlled by the square of one plus the repeat normal of it. Okay, so with this estimate, we can do the energy. Estimate and so the existence of solutions of the epsilon problem can be proved by using the contractual mapping method. So here, because the equation is quasi-linear, so the energy method is quite involved. And we first approve the L2S may then H1, H dot one, H dot two, then finally H dot S for any square two. And the S may depend on epsilon, but then the H is normal. But then the witch's norm of the solution does not depend on its norm. So we can pass through the limit and then take the weak star limit to find our viscous solution originally. So this is the idea of the construction of viscous solution to the equation. Okay, so next I'm going to discuss the uniqueness of such solutions. So if we know the comparison principle, If we know the comparison principle for viscosis origin, then we have the unique case. Because suppose you have two initial data and one suppose if you have F0 and F0, such that if this is true and we have a comparison principle, then you just let F0 tilde to be able to. Let F0 tilde to be F0. This implies that if you have two viscous solutions, then they must be the same. So our focus is to prove such comparison principle. So this is the theorem I stated here. So this theorem is a consequence of the consistency result. So this is also a well-known method in the viscosity solution community. Suppose that we have. Suppose that we have a viscosity solution which is C11 by some point x0, t0, and satisfies the then it satisfies the queen principle at the same point. So this is called a consistency result for viscosity solutions. So to prove this, a key step in the proof is the point-wise C1 alpha estimate, which allows us to pass through limiting the integral representation of the derivative to nuanced. So let me explain to you what it is. Explain to you what is this point-wise C1 estimate. So, suppose that omega is a relationship to me in R2. And we denoted this omega R, X0, Y0 to be the intersection of omega with this 4, and X0, Y0 is a point on the boundary. We assume that the 0 is on the boundary, and suppose that the boundary of the domain can be expressed as a Lipschitz function. So the picture looks like this. But the boundary is in general only in Lipschitz. And suppose that at some point we know the boundaries, at the origin, we know the boundary is like C1. At this point, this is C1. But at other point, it is only Ripshits. And we assume that we use a harmonic function in in this omega. In this omega, and you vanishes somehow. Okay, so in general, we only know that the solution is at most holding domain solutions. So here we impose a stronger condition that at this point the boundary is C11. Then we can show that the solution is actually point-wise at this point, the same point, the solution is C1r. So this is a statement of the C1 alpha, point-wise C1 alpha regularity result. Okay, some remarks about this result. I mentioned that we require that the domain is C11 at this point, so in fact we only require the domain to be C1 beta at this point for some beta greater than zero. Second, by using Second, by using a simple barrier function and using the comparing principle, we can show that in any dimension, u is always ellipse at this point. So this can be proved in any dimension. With a bit more work, we can show that the solution is actually C1 in any non-tangential direction. So this is a result due to Kafari and Salsa in 2005, again in any direction. However, in our Finally, in our proof, we need something stronger than C1. So we need C1 alpha or at least C1 to pass the limit in the integral representation. So here's some proofs. So first, we kind of are using a barrier function to show that the solution is actually in C1 half per cent zero. So this follows from the comparison principle. And then what we And then what we okay, so then we use the distribution estimate and also reverse folders in code that we can show that the solution is actually in W1P0, where P0 is P12. Then after that, so we use a decomposition argument. So probably I should skip the details. So basically, we multiply the solution by a cutoff function so that the boundary Cut off function so that the boundary becomes flat. And then we decompose this product into two functions. One is harmonic, the other is small. And for the harmonic function, we have a very nice estimate. And for this small function, W, we can use the W1P0 estimate. And if you combine them together and do an iteration, and eventually we can obtain this, we can approximate this U. Uh we can approximate this u in a neighborhood of for the origin by a sequence of linear functions. So this is basically the the idea of the let me just skip the proof of the of this part okay so how about the uh so what I did what I talked about before is the 2D case. How about the 3D case? So recently we established the global weapons in the 3D case. So this is actually two years after So, this is actually two years after we solve the 2D case. So, we spent roughly two years for the 3D case. So, compared to the 2D case, in 3D, one difference is that the fundamental solution is not explicit. So, if you remember before, in a in the 2D, in t times r, you have this quite explicit fundamental solution, but this is not the case in 3D. Not the case in 3D. And also, imagine before that we used the result due to Chelta for the real potential estimate in the PC demand. This is still true in 3D. However, in 3D, the H1 regularity turns out to be critical in 3D. So in our proof, this is not adequate if you just apply the H1 estimate. So instead, we apply the Uh so instead we applied uh the uh W12 perception of US meet in episodes demand due to Darborough and uh Koenig in 1987 and also later refined by M. Tree and Taylor in 1999. We also need a corresponding version of the C1 alpha variety for the uniqueness of solutions. So for that we used the W1 comma 2 3 perceptive serum estimate for harmonic. 3 plus epsilon estimated for harmonic functions in IPS domain due to Jerusalem and Klinik in 1995. So they proved that if the domain, the boundary of the domain is Lipschitz, then in 2D you can show W1 comma 4 plus epsilon and then in 3D you have W1 comma 3 plus epsilon. So here this is the result. Okay some further questions, I guess I'm too quick. I guess I'm too quick. Okay, so first of all, is the smoothness of strong solutions. So another question is: does the solution we constructed become C1 or smooth in finite time? So last year there's a result by Sidre. He showed that for the 1D, one phase smooth cut problem, meaning 2D, there's no instantaneous smoothing of solutions. So if the nature data has If the initial data has an angle, accurate angle, then the angle is preserved for a short time. So this result, a very interesting result, shows that there's no instantaneous smoothing of solutions, but nevertheless it is possible that if the initial data is rip sheets and with small rips, it's constant, then the solution will still become smooth medium. And also there's also it is also possible that if the It is also possible that if the uh the initial data is vicious, uh even though there's no instantaneous uh smoothing, after a certain time we get eventual realization of the solution. So in fact in our setting we can show that the L2 norm of the solution along with all the C alpha norm of the solution decays exponentially mostly. So because the decay of the solutions, it is The decay of the solutions, it is expected that the solution will also become smooth in point of time. Another interesting question is the global reality of solutions in the whole space. So, in our proof, we use the crucial radar, the domain is periodic, so it's compact. That gives you the W12 reparatory solutions. Because as long as the solution is if she is then the solution is W12. W12. But if the domain is not compact in the whole space, we cannot directly get the W12 vertical solution. Another question is like can we add a surface tension to the surface tension usually is helpful for the corporate method, but nevertheless, in our proof, if we add a surface tension, then it get gets much more complicated. Okay, that's all. Thank you.
