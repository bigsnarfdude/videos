Thank you. So, I would like to thank the organizers for organizing such a wonderful meeting and for coordinating everything so nicely. So, I have been given an assignment to condense a semester's worth algebraic number theory course into one lecture, a lot of which I had myself forgotten. Forgotten, in order to prepare you for the lectures of Alia and Professor Ramouthi. So let's start. So as you know, a fundamental theme in number theory is the interplay between properties and explicit properties of the L functions versus the arithmetic properties of Arithmetic properties of prime numbers and other interesting sequences. And in this workshop, we are emphasizing a lot on zero-free regions of certain L-functions, which include the Riemann zeta function, Dirichlet L-functions, Dedekind zeta functions, which are analogues of the Riemann zeta function for number fields, Hecke L functions, which can be viewed as analogues of the Dirichlet L functions with the help of the number of functions. L functions with the help of characters of what are called what is called the ideal class group of a number field and Atin L functions which are Dirichlet series associated to linear representations of a Galois group G. So our goal today is to study review some algebraic number theory in order to understand a little bit about RTNL functions. I will not be introducing RTNL functions. I leave that to Artinell functions. I leave that to more capable hands. We'll review some notions which are needed to set up the RTNL functions and state the Jebotarev density theorem. Okay, so let's start with the basic notion of algebraic integers. So as you all know, in algebraic number theory, our first goal is to generalize the study of the integral domain of the integers and its quotient field, namely the set of rational numbers. Field, namely the set of rational numbers. So to start with, we define what is called an algebraic integer of a given degree d. So if a complex number alpha is a root of a monic integral polynomial of degree d, that is a root of a polynomial of the form f of x, which has coefficients in the ring of integers, but the leading coefficient is one, and which is also irreducible. And which is also irreducible over the rationals, then alpha is called an algebraic integer of degree t. Okay. So, for example, in fact, these are a very favorite set of algebraic integers. A plus bi is an algebraic integer of degree 2, being a root of x squared minus 2ax plus a squared plus b square. And since b is not equal to 0, it is not a root of an integral monic. not a root of an integral monic polynomial of degree one. So the degree of a plus bi is two. Another interesting example is the primitive mth root of unity. So this is a root of x to the m minus one, but not a root of the polynomial x to the d minus one for any natural number d, which is strictly less than m. So this is called the primitive mth root of unity. Emeth root of unity, a primitive mm-h root of unity. It's not unique, there are many. For example, plus or minus i are primitive fourth roots of unity, right? Minus one, plus or minus square root of three times i over two are primitive cube roots of unity. And later, when we study cyclotomic fields in some more detail, we will be looking at the set of algebraic integers in those fields. So we In those fields, so we introduced this notation of cyclotomic integers of order n, which are combinations of one zeta sub n, zeta sub n square, up to zeta sub n raised to the, actually this should be phi of n minus one. So we also have the notion of algebraic numbers, which is very close to that of algebraic integers. So this is a root of a polynomial over the set of Over the set of rationals of degree d, and not the root of any polynomial of degree less than d. So we want an algebraic number of degree d to be the root of an irreducible polynomial of degree d over q, equivalently an irreducible polynomial of degree d over the ring of integers, but we do not insist on it being monic. So we have examples. We have examples of algebraic numbers which are not algebraic integers. Algebraic integers, obviously, are algebraic numbers. So, square root of 2 over 3 is an algebraic number. It is a root of 9x square minus 2, but I leave it as an exercise for the grad students to show that it is not an algebraic integer. Similarly, if we take d to be a square free integer, let's say absolute of d greater than 1. say absolute of d greater than 1. And if 4 divides d minus 1, then we have this algebraic integer minus 1 plus or minus square root of d over 2. So let us denote the set of all algebraic numbers by q bar and let z bar denote the set of all algebraic integers. One second, I think. So, we are interested in algebraic number fields. So, an algebraic number field is a field of the following form. It is the field generated by the field of rational numbers along with finitely many algebraic numbers, let's say n many algebraic numbers. And if you look at this carefully, suppose your n were one, if you just had f equal to q of alpha one. equal to q of alpha one, then it's very easy and very transparent to understand the structure of an algebraic number field. It can be viewed as a vector space over the rational numbers with basis 1 alpha alpha square up till alpha to the d minus 1, right? And the amazing thing is, and this is probably one of the earliest theorems that we learn in algebraic number theory. It's called the primitive element theorem for number fields, which says Theorem for number fields, which says that actually any number field is indeed a simple extension, that is, any number field is of the form q of alpha for some algebraic number alpha. So even if you define f to be q adjoined with n many algebraic numbers, you can find some algebraic number such that f would be of the form q of alpha. And so it can be viewed as a And so it can be viewed as a finite-dimensional vector space over the set of rational numbers over the field of rational numbers. And an algebraic number alpha of degree D over a number field F. Now, so far we were talking about algebraic numbers of degree D over the rationals. The same thing can be extended and defined over arbitrary number fields. So an algebraic number alpha of degree D over a number field F is the root of an irreducible. Is the root of an irreducible polynomial of degree d with coefficients in the field F. In fact, an algebraic number of degree d over some number field F is the root of a unique monic irreducible polynomial in f of x of degree d. And we call this polynomial, we give this a name, it's called the minimal polynomial, and we denote it as, say, m of x with alpha and f denoting the Denoting the specific parameters related to this alpha to this polynomial. So, a couple of quick observations about algebraic integers. The set of algebraic integers is a subring of the set of algebraic numbers. Okay, and if we take a number field F, then the intersection of F The intersection of f with z-bar is a ring in F, and it is called the ring of algebraic integers of F. It is denoted as O sub F. And the ring of integers of rational numbers is exactly the ring of integers. And for any number field F, if you take the intersection of the ring of its algebraic integers with the set of rational numbers. With the set of rational numbers, you end up getting exactly the set of all integers. And the quotient field of O sub F is F. So this is how number fields can be viewed as generalizations of the field of rational numbers. And another very beautiful theorem we learn in algebraic number theory is that the ring of integers or sub F is a dedicated domain. What does that mean? So it is an integral domain such that every domain such that every ideal of O sub F is finitely generated, every non-zero prime ideal of O sub F is maximal, and O sub F is integrally closed in F. So if you have an alpha in your field F, which is a root of a polynomial with coefficients in O sub F, degree greater than one, then alpha will also lie in O sub F. So now we come So now we come to a very interesting notion of embeddings which are very important to state the Shabutarev density theorem. So let us take k to be equal to q of theta for some algebraic number theta and let f of x denote its minimal polynomial such that f of theta is equal to zero. Now we call a function sigma from k to c to be an embedding if it An embedding, if it is a function that satisfies certain properties. So, sigma of a plus b is equal to sigma of a plus sigma of b, sigma, it also respects the multiplication operation. And more importantly, sigma of r will turn out to be exactly r if r is in q. So, we are viewing k here as a number field over q, as a finite extension of q. We can also We can also, the reason I'm saying this is because we can also talk about towers of number fields, and then you can talk about view k as an extension of some other number field, which is an extension of q. And you can generalize all of these notions with respect to that particular base field and that particular field that you are talking about. Now, we note that because of the properties of the embedding, if you apply sigma to apply sigma sigma to f of theta it turns out to be equal to f of sigma of theta but you know that f of theta is zero right so sigma of f of theta is also zero so if theta is a root of f sigma of theta also must be a root of f for any embedding sigma from k to c so there are only n choices for sigma of theta namely the distinct roots which we denote as theta to the one Which we denote as theta to the one, theta to the two, and so on. And we denote each embedding as sigma to the i. So let us take that sigma to the i to be that embedding, which takes theta to some theta to the i. And the fields k to the i, which you obtain by adjoining the conjugates theta to the i to q, are called the conjugate fields of k. Okay. Okay, notice one thing. If you have your Q basis of K, let's this our theta is, so sorry, K was Q of theta. So one theta theta square up till theta to the n minus one is a Q basis of K. And if sigma is an embedding, then it respects this Q basis in the following form. So theta just essentially ends up going to sigma of theta. ends up going to sigma of theta. So if theta to the i is real, we call k to the i to be a real embedding of k. Otherwise, k to the i is called a complex embedding of k. For example, if you consider q of root d, the embeddings are simply a plus so a plus b root d going to a plus b root d, which is just the identity, or a plus b root d going to a minus b root d, right? To A minus B root B, right? So the conjugate field, this is a very nice field because its conjugate field is identical to itself. So this leads us to the notion of what is called a Galois extension. We call K a Galois extension of Q if all the conjugate fields of K are identical to K. So I just gave you an example. Any quadratic extension of Q is a galaxy. Extension of Q is a Galois extension. Here is another simple exercise. Q adjoined with cube root of 2 is not a Galois extension of Q, right? Okay. So again, all these notions, we studied the notion of a Galois extension over Q. We can also generalize this to when we view K as a number field over some other number field, which may not necessarily be Q. Okay, and we can talk about conjugate. Okay, and we can talk about conjugate fields relative to f accordingly. So we also have the notion of norms and traces. So trace is the sum, essentially, of it is the sum of all the conjugates of alpha. Okay, so where you view k to be a finite extension of a base field F. And we define the norm of alpha with respect to the base field F to With respect to the base field F to be the product of all the F conjugates of alpha. So I've typed O this is not the trace, this is the norm. Okay, so trace of our in the context of our favorite field is 2A and norm of the element a plus b root d is a square minus dv square. Okay, so if we are viewing k as an extension of the base field q. Extension of the base field q, then to avoid too much cluttering of notation, we may just simply denote these notions as trace of alpha or norm of alpha. Okay, so then a lot of algebraic number theory is about understanding the structure of the ring of algebraic integers. So if k is q root d, what is the ring of algebraic integers? So this is also So, this is also a very fun and interesting exercise when you start learning algebraic number theory. That if D is congruent to one mod 4, then the ring of integers is of the form z 1 plus root d over 2. And if d is 2 or 3 mod 4, then z of square root of d. Here we take d to be a square free integer. More generally, so something like this is also true when you have an Also true when you have an nth degree extension of Q. So you can always find algebraic integers and many algebraic integers such that O sub k can be written as, so you have an integral basis of O sub k consisting of these omega i's. So this omega 1, omega 2 up till omega sub n forms an integral basis of O sub k. basis of O sub K. In another example, let zeta denote a primitive p-th root of unity and let K to be Q of Zeta. So this is called the p-th cyclotomic field. Then 1 zeta, zeta square up till zeta to the p minus 2 forms an integral basis of k. Exercise for the students to work this out. Then we talk about the notion of the Then we talk about the notion of the discriminant of a number field. So let us start with an integral basis of O sub k, where k over q. So k is the degree of k over q is n. Then for each omega i, we talk, we list out all its conjugates with respect to the different embeddings. We form the matrix and the square of the determinant of Square of the determinant of this matrix is what is called the discriminant of a number field K. This notion is well defined, irrespective of which integral basis you take, you will get the same number. Okay, so in particular, again, go back to our favorite example because it's so easy to state if D is congruent to one mod 4, then the discriminant of, if you wanted to evaluate the discriminant, what do you do? The discriminant, what do you do? You take one, one plus square root of d over two, which is your integral basis, then consider its, there's only one more embedding to consider, and you consider its conjugates with respect to that. So this ends up giving you just D. And in the other case, when D is congruent to 2 or 3 mod 4, the discriminant is equal to 4 times D. So we can generalize the notion of a discriminant for arbitrary. Of a discriminant for arbitrary elements of k because in the definition, what had we done? We had taken omega sub j of omega i, sorry, sigma sub j of omega i. So we can generalize this to any collection of elements. So let us take a1, a2 up till a sub n to be a collection of k n elements in our field k. Then we can define the discriminant of these elements. Of these elements a1, a2 up till a sub n, by generalizing the definition of discriminant that we had just learned. So now you take sigma j of a sub i and you square the determinant of this matrix. It can be shown. So this is another fun exercise, which I'm pretty sure in all of you who've taken algebraic number theory, you got this as an assignment problem. If you take one elements which are One elements which are powers of a. So one a squared up till a to the n minus one. The discriminant has a very beautiful formulation, and you show this with the help of the Van der Monde determinant. So in particular, if you take k to be equal to the mth cyclotomic field, then we know that it has an integral basis of this form. So 1 zeta m zeta m squared, all the powers up till zeta m to the powers up till zeta m to the phi of m minus one this forms an integral basis of o sub k and by applying the above formula you can actually explicitly compute the discriminant of the cyclotomic field again this is an exercise for you and a very uh important fact is that if your discriminant is square free then o sub k is equal to z of theta equal to z of theta. So your one theta, theta square up till theta to the n minus one will form an integral basis of O sub K. Next we talk about ideals of O sub K. So so far we have seen how O sub K can be viewed as a generalization of the integers. To draw a meaningful generalization of the unique factorization of integers, we have to treat We have to talk about ideals in the ring of algebraic integers, and we discuss the factorization of ideals into prime ideals of this ring. So we recall the following fundamental facts. So any ideal in O sub K also has an integral basis. Any non-zero ideal in O sub K, it has a finite index. Let's Let's denote it as cardinality of O sub K over A. We define this to be the norm of the ideal A in O sub K. And if alpha lies in the ring of algebraic integers of K, then if you take the ideal generated by alpha in O sub K, the norm of this ideal turns out This ideal turns out to be exactly equal to the absolute value of the norm of the element alpha, which we had defined. So let's now focus on prime ideals of our ring of integers. So for any non-zero ideal A in O sub K, any such non-zero ideal must contain a non-zero. Ideal must contain a non-zero integer. Okay. And by definition of a prime ideal P, we know that if AB lies in P, then either A has to be an element of P or B has to be an element of P. So this tells us that P must contain some rational prime. So whenever you talk about prime ideals in any finite, in the ring of integers of any finite extension of Q, that prime ideal. Of q that prime ideal must contain some rational prime, and in fact, with some work, you can even show that it can contain only one rational prime. Okay, so this prime ideal p can contain exactly one rational prime little p, and we say that our little p lies below this prime ideal p. In this case, so now let us talk about this rational prime p and its ideal generated by this p in O sub K. This turns out since your this P lies above this rational P, so you can write it as a product, say P times Q for some for another integral ideal Q of O sub K. And this. And this tells us that norm of this shows immediately that norm of your ideal p must divide norm of your rational prime p. Now, what is the norm of the rational prime p? So all the conjugates of p are p itself, right? So norm of p is just p raised to the n, where n is the degree of k over q. Degree of k over q. So n of this ideal in the ring O sub k p, so norm of the ideal p, turns out to be a certain power of the prime lying below it. And this f is called the inertial degree of your p in O sub K. Okay. Now we also have this very nice theorem, which is your Your correct extension of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. It says that every proper non-zero ideal in O sub K is uniquely representable as a product of prime ideals. So up to the order, of course. So you can write it as a product of certain prime ideals, where your, so your P sub i's denote distinct prime ideals of O. Denote distinct prime ideals of O sub K containing your ideal A. Okay, so we are interested in the factorization of the ideals generated by rational primes in extensions of Q. So the ideal generated by this rational prime P can be written as a product of prime ideals. And all these powers, your E sub i, they also have. Your E sub i, they also have a name, uh, and I'll tell you more about it soon. So, f sub i, which we had just defined, uh, let f sub i denote the inertial degree of p sub i. Then, if you take sums of all the ei times f i's, it must turn out to be exactly equal to n. So, in the learning activity hour, there is an assignment for you and it includes. An assignment for you, and it includes this question. So, this E sub i is called the ramification index of PI in K or in O sub K. So, what does that mean? So, your PI to the EI divides the prime ideal P. So, to divide is to contain. This is this analogy that we learn in algebraic number theory. But, Pi to the EI. But Pi to the EI plus one does not divide the prime ideal, the ideal generated by the rational prime p. Also, in this decomposition, there were L many prime ideals that show up. So this L also has a name. It is called the decomposition number of P in capital K. And obviously, L has to be less than or equal to N. So this takes. So, this takes us to the notion of ramification. When we talk about rational primes splitting in rings of integers above them, how do they split? Like, what are the powers that show up in the splitting? This is studied in the notion of ramification. So, following the same notation that we have been looking at before, let P1, P2 up till PL be the prime ideals in. till P L be the prime ideals in O sub K which lie above the rational prime p. That is, we have this factorization. If one of the exponents, if at least one of the exponents is greater than one, then we say that our rational prime P ramifies in K. But if all the EIs are equal to 1, then we say that P is unramified in K. And a very nice theorem by Dead. A very nice theorem by Dedekind tells us that a rational prime p ramifies in k if and only if p divides the discriminant of k. So this is a very helpful application of the notion of discriminant. It is very closely connected to the study of splitting of crimes in fields above it. So there is this theory There is this theorem when you factor primes over quadratic fields. So, I'm just going to state it for you. And in the learning activity hour, you will work on this. You'll work out the details. So, if so, our ideal generated by a rational prime P in this field, what are the different possibilities? Either it will be a product of two distinct prime ideals, or it will be a product of two principles. It will be a prime ideal itself, or it will be the square of a prime ideal. So if your prime is greater than 2 and if it is a square, so if d over p, if d is a square mod p, then the factorization of is of the form p1 times p2, where p1 and p2 are distinct ideals and they both have the norm exactly equal to the rational prime p. If d over If d over p, the Legendre symbol is minus one and p is greater than two, then norm of p has to be equal to square of the rational prime p. And your ideal is exactly, it is a prime ideal. Your p, the ideal generated by p turns out to be a prime ideal in the ring above it. And then in the third case, if p divides d, then you have a factorization. Have a factorization of the form which is square of a prime ideal. What happens when p is equal to 2? Then we have to classify cases for d as decongruent to 1 mod 8, decongruent to 5 mod 8, or decongruent to 2 or 3 mod 4. And then again, you have these factorizations. So this is a fun exercise to do. In cases one and four, when you And four, when your prime t splits into distinct prime ideals, we say that p splits in k. In cases two and five, when your ideal generated by p is a prime ideal, we say that this is inert. Okay, p is inert in k. And in cases three and six, we say that p ramifies in k because you, by our definition, you have an exponent two. Have an exponent 2 which is greater than 1. So we say that p ramifies in k. We can also talk about factoring primes in many different types of number fields. So another exercise that will show up in the learning activity hour is talking about factoring primes in what are called monogenic number fields. So basically, number fields where the ring of integers turns out to have one theta. turns out to have one theta up till theta to the n minus one as an integral basis. So let f be an irreducible polynomial such that f of theta is equal to zero. And it's quite nice that in number fields of this form, the factoring of prime ideals is very closely connected with the factoring of your irreducible Irreducible polynomial into various components mod b. Okay, so this is the whatever the method that does it. So let p be a rational prime and let g1 g2 up till g sub l be distinct monic irreducible polynomials in z sub p of x. Z sub p is the ring of integers mod p. So you have this factorization of So, you have this factorization of f into powers of certain polynomials modulo p, and then you've got the respective powers e1, e2 up till e sub l. Now let us take f sub i to be some polynomial in the ring of integers, which is in fact congruent to g sub i of x mod p. And define. So, you have this factorization of f of x mod p, then you define. Then you define your p sub i to be the ideal generated by your rational prime p adjoy and f sub i of theta, where f sub i is whatever the variant of your g i in the ring of integers. Then you have this explicit factorization of your little prime p in this number. Little prime t in this number field, and it's quite nice that this can be expressed exactly in terms of the factors of your polynomial mod P. So, some more observations. So, as I mentioned to you before, we can generalize the notions that we have learned so far and ask how a prime And ask how a prime ideal in O sub F factors in O sub K. Okay, so not just rational primes, you can take a prime ideal in some finite extension and see how it will factor in other extensions of that F. So, so many different types of P. So, let P, so let big P be a prime ideal in O sub K. Then there exists exactly one. There exists exactly one prime ideal in the base field in the ring of integers of the base field, and we call this the prime ideal. Let's call this small p, lying below big p. So whatever we learned with respect to k as a q extension works verbatim when we see k as extensions of some other finite fields. So all those notions can be repeated more or less. And then we can also talk. less and then we can also talk about the inertial degree the um so inertial degree is it has the following definition it's a slightly different way i defined it for k equal for f equal to q in a slightly different way but they are equivalent and we can also talk about so what happens now is this field o sub k mod big uh p i this Pi. We call this the residue field at big PI, and this can be viewed as a finite field extension of O sub F mod P. Okay, and this degree of this extension is what we call the inertial degree of Pi in O sub K. If I make a mistake, please point out. So now we have everything. We have everything that we are going to define in the remaining part of this lecture really pertains to these factorizations. So we have the number E sub I here. It is called the ramification index of big P I in O sub K and it is denoted. So we had called it E before, but now it is E sub K over F. P is said to ramify in K if E is greater than 1 for some i. Otherwise, P is said to be unramified in K. And similarly, we can talk about a decomposition number of P with respect to the field K. So this notion of inert, completely split, ramified will now carry over in this more generalized sense. Over in this more generalized setting. So, suppose you have a finite extension of number fields and let P be a prime ideal in O sub K, in O sub F in the base field, such that it has the following factorization in O sub K. Then, as we saw before, the sums of the product of EI times Fi turns out to be exactly the degree of K over F. P is said to be completely random. P is said to be completely ramified or totally ramified if one of the EIs would be exactly equal to the degree of K over F. So in that case, obviously, the decomposition number has to be 1 and the corresponding F also has to be equal to 1. Then we talk about the notion of splitting completely in O sub K. Again, generalization of No sub k again generalization of what we just learned if our L, if the decomposition number is exactly equal to the degree of K over F. Okay. So if our inertial degree is equal to K over F for some I, that will force the decomposition number to be one and also the E, the ramification index to be equal. Ramification index to be equal to one. So, in this case, we say that t is inert in O sub K. Okay, now we talk about Galva extensions. We had defined Galva extensions before, but we look more closely at this notion and discuss ramification and inertia a little more. So, this is a very nice theorem, which tells us the following. Suppose you have a field extension, which is a Galvan. A field extension, which is a Galois extension. That is, all the F conjugate fields of K are identical. And suppose you have this factoring of the prime ideal. Then for all the distinct prime ideals in the factorization, the inertial degrees have to be equal, the ramification index also has to be equal. So this is the nice thing about Galva extensions. Galva extensions. And so we may, since they are all equal, we may simply denote them in terms of the prime ideal T lying below them. And it's once you prove this, it's immediate to see that E times F times the decomposition number has to be exactly equal to the degree of K over F. Yeah. Okay, now two important notions of decomposition group and inertia group. So we go back to the set of all F embeddings of K. We had just defined them, but if you look at it closely, it's easy to see that this set of all F embeddings, in fact, forms a group called, which we call the Galva group of K over F and denote as Galva of K sub F. As Galva of K sub F. So suppose K is a Galva extension of F, then for any element in this Galva group, this sigma, it is a function from K to K, right? And sigma of your base field F is exactly equal to F. In other words, your sigma fixes F. In fact, your F is exactly the base field turns out. The base field turns out to be the fixed field of this Galva group of K over F. So, all the elements of K, which are fixed by all the embeddings sigma, are exactly equal to the set F. Now, let us take P to be a fixed prime ideal in O sub F. Then, Galva of K sub, this Galva group of K over F, because of the theorem that I stated in the previous slide. That I stated in the previous slide. It's a very beautiful interpretation of that theorem. Your galo of k sub f will transitively permute all the prime ideals of O sub K lying above your P. So suppose you have what that means is suppose you have this factorization of your prime ideal from the base field into this. Then if you take any two prime ideals in the factorization, ideals in the factorization big pi big pj there would be some sigma in the galva group will which will take p i to pj okay so now for a prime ideal of o sub k the decomposition group is defined as follows it is the set of all those embeddings or all those elements in the galva group of k over f which fix this prime idea Which fix this prime ideal P. Okay. And so the decomposition group can be viewed as a subgroup of the Galva group. Here's a very interesting fact. If you conjugate the decomposition group of this D sub P by some other element, by some element in galva of K sub F, then you end up getting. Then you end up getting another decomposition group, but with respect to rho of the p that we have started with. Okay, if capital P lies over a prime p in O sub F, then the cardinality, the order of this decomposition group is exactly equal to the product of your inertial degree and the ramification index. We also have the notion of an inertia group, which we define as follows. So, this is the set of all those elements in Galva, in the Galva group of K over F, such that sigma of A minus alpha, sorry, sigma of alpha minus alpha lies in the prime ideal P for all alpha in O sub K. In other words, sigma of alpha is congruent to alpha mod P for all alpha in O sub K. For all alpha in O sub K. Now, this also has a conjugation property, which is very similar to the decomposition group. And another nice thing is that this inertia group turns out to be a normal subgroup of the Galva group. And the index of Galva of K sub F over the inertia group. Group turns out to be the product of the decomposition number and the inertial degree. So it looks like I finished the crash course in 45 minutes. We'll work out examples and proofs of some of the theorems here in the learning activity hour, which Habiba has been. Yeah, it has been sent. Yeah, it has been sent to you. So, and And so that I don't know, I'm really looking forward to learning about the Chevotorev density theorem, but it is a theorem about which describes the density of primes which are unramified in fields above this. And it describes the density in terms of these arithmetic quantities that we have learned and some more. And so Alia will take up after this. Alia will take up after this. Thank you. Oh, yeah, five minutes, not 15 minutes. Questions for Kenya? Alia will answer them. Here's something like this decomposition and neutral group group and Gala group. Isn't there like some short exact sequence that these all fit into somewhere? I don't know. I remember maybe seeing something like that. True or okay. Yes, you're right. And if it turns out that the inertial no, no, go ahead. No, no, go ahead. Yeah. The inertia is the normal computer in this composition. And the way to prove that this inertia, the inertia of the competition become surjective and the mortalism from the decomposition into another into that we talked about fine ideas we've mentioned that Kenilli has shown is right. This is uh and the quotient group of the decomposition group by the inertial group turns out to be simpler and a generator of that is the use of the water, which I just wanted to mention, I know that there are some students here who are just starting graduate school. Is it not? Yeah, so here are some nice references. There are plenty of References. There are plenty of very good books in algebraic number theory. So I'd like to refer you to three in particular. So one is Problems in Algebraic Number Theory by Jody Esmond and M. Ramuti. This is a Springer GTM book, and you basically learn the entire theory by working out problems. Two other books, which are nice in the sense that they give lots and lots of examples and fun exercises. One is Algebraic Number Theory by Richard A. Algebraic number theory by Richard A. Mullin. And then there is introductory algebraic number theory by Saban Alaka and Kenneth Williams. So for those who are starting these, you could pick one of these books and study from there. Okay, thank you.
