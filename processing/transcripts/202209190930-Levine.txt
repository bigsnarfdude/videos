I got the title right, which is always good for a start. So, yeah, that's the title explains what I'm going to be doing. So, from in very basic form, there's a package that goes into enumerative geometry. There's a lot more to it than that, but the basic package is three gadgets: there's intersection theory. There's churn classes, and then there's degrees. So you end up counting things. So this is a very, you know, very basic package. It has, of course, a lot of details to it, a lot of developments coming out of it. But what I'd like to explain to you here is how this package here can be referred. Package here can be refined to include. So, this is basically the degrees of what you're getting out of it, and this is values in the integers usually. And the whole idea here is to make a quadratic refinement so that you refine all these gadgets and you end up with, if you'd like, quadratic degrees. Degrees living not in the integers but in the Grotendieck-Wittring of quadratic forms over a field K, where K is the field defining the problem that you're interested in. Could be the reals, for example. You might want to count real curves that do something or other. Okay, so that's the basic principle. And so for today, I'm going to I'm going to do a very elementary description of some examples of how this package works for some very elementary problems. That's hopefully the first half or two-thirds of the lecture. And then I'll make a complete jump to something completely different to show how you get quadratic information in a very abstract and categorical way. And then this is more like a teaser to. To lead up to the other lectures, but we'll show methods for actually making concrete computations of this, which are not at all apparent from the definition. So that's the program. So today we'll look at, I think, three, some, let me put some, because I have some very elementary enumerative problems. So let's say classical, so integer value. So, integer value. Problems to illustrate the package here. And that, of course, will be a lead-in to showing how these same problems can be made quadratic. And of course, the theory is not limited to these problems, but I think those are very elegant. Problems, but I think those are very elementary but still illustrative examples, which would give you some idea of how this all works. Okay, so that's the background. So first of all, what's the package? Well, intersection theory, IT, so that's intersection theory. It really means for me, it's the Chow ring. Chow groups are Chow ring. So you probably all know what this is, but just for the sake of completeness, Is but just for the sake of completeness, let me do a quick review of what this is. I apologize for boring everybody in the audience with this, but just let's go with it. Okay, so make the following definition. So we take X to be a K variety. So by this, this is maybe non-standard. This I mean a finite type separated K scheme. Then we have so for some integer n, we have the group of algebraic cycles. These are the dimension n algebraic cycles on x. And this is just the free abelian group on the set of w inside of x. W is an integral. W is an integral subscheme and dimension. So we fix, let's say, I guess, yeah, we're fixing a base field K here. I should have said that. Dimension of W is N. Okay, so that's what that is. Very simple gadget. And then, of course, the Chao Ring is built out of the notion of rational equivalence. So these are the relations. If you have some sub-variety. Some sub-variety of dimension n minus one and a rational function on it. You have the divisor, which is then an element in this group. And those are the trivial guys. So this is the set given by divisors of functions f, such that f is a non-zero rational function on some kw, w inside of x integral dimension. W equals n minus one. Sorry for that. Pardon me? Yeah, code. I think of codimension. Plus one. Thank you very much. Yep. I even wrote n minus one here. Good. And then the chow group of n-dimensional cycles mod rational equivalence is just the quotient. Very good. Very good. Okay, so what are the structures that this thing has? I'm not going to give any proofs of any of this, but just let me mention the various important structures that this guy has. Well, the most elementary thing is you have for F from Y to X a proper map. We have, first of all, a push-forward map from site. This is just defined on the level of site. This is just defined on the level of cycles already. And this is very simple. It's just, of course, on a generator here, you send one times W gets sent to F lower star of one times W, which is either equal to zero if the dimension of the image. So the image is closed because the map is proper, is strictly less than n and it's equal. Less than n, and it's equal to the degree of the field extension. So this will be a finite field extension if the map, so this is f dimension f of w equals n. Okay, that's a very simple thing. And the point is that this f lower star descends to To F lower star on the child groups. Okay, that's the first thing. So, and it's a functor. Both of these are functors, F G lower star and f lower star, G lower star, any way you want to do it. Okay, so now we get into. To slightly more turbulent waters. Now we take x to be smooth over k, and we take z1 and z2 integral subschemes, subschemes, both subschemes on x. And we take w and integral component of the inner. Of the intersection. We could just take the reduced intersection if you like. And we say that the intersection is proper at w if the codimension on x of w is the sum of the codimensions. And in that case, if proper. If proper, then we have an intersection multiplicity. So that's the multiplicity on Z1 dot Z2 along W. This is an integer. This is multiplicity. So if you're familiar with this, this is given by Sayre's intersection multiplicity formula, but I'm not going to use that really too much. Really, too much, but just let me mention that this is one, this m is equal to one, if and only if the intersection is transverse along w. So it means at a general point of w, so this means generally, so that means at a general point of w, both z1 and z2 are smooth and the tangent spaces intersect. Spaces intersect exactly on the tangent space of W, if you like, one way to say it. Transverse intersection. Okay, so now if the intersection is globally proper, we say that Z intersect W is proper. If it's everywhere, you know, I'm not going to write it. It means that all the components satisfy this codimension condition, then we have the intersection. The intersection product z1 dot z2, which is defined to be the sum over all the components w of this multiplicity times w. So this lives in cycles of this codimension. And so on smooth things, so no, on x equidimensional, in particular for x smooth, we But for x smooth, we use codimension instead, or we often use codimension instead of dimension. So we define chow upper n of x to be chow dimension of x minus n of x. And the theorem is that this partially defined Find intersection product actually gives, well, yeah, there's various assumptions. I think just smooth is enough at the present state of technology, gives a well-defined graded ring structure. So it descends to a So it descends to a well-defined graded ring structure on star of X, which is the graded group direct sum over N. And the unit is, I've said, one on X, which is the class of the whole subvariety. So this is something of dimension equal to the dimension of X. So it's of co-dimension zero. It's in Chow upper zero, where the unit should live. Chow upper zero where the unit should live. Okay, good. So that's intersection theory. And let me just mention one more thing. Again, now if you have f from y to x, a morphism of smooth varieties, then sort of intersecting with the graph on the product, you can get a pullback map. Which is actually a ring homomorphism as a map where you, you know, from child star on child star and satisfies a projection formula if f is proper. So if f is proper, you also have the push forward. It says that if you take f lower star. That if you take f lower star of f upper star of something from x and intersect it with y, it's the same as taking x intersected with f lower star. Okay, so that's most of the package of intersection theory, the chow groups. I hope you can all read this. Are there any questions about anything? Everybody now completely bored? Good. Okay. Should I close this thing here? Is that better? That enough? Great, thanks. Okay, doke. So that's the intersection theory part. And then we have the churn classes. I think that's all for the intersection theory. Then we have the part, the churn classes. Okay, so the intersection. Okay, so the intersection theory, as stated here, already gives you top churn classes without doing anything. So the usual way you do this is you first define first churn classes for line bundles, then you use a projective bundle theorem and some relation. This was Grotendieck's approach to define the other churn classes. But I'm not going to do that. I'm just going to not say anything about that so much, but I'm just going to say that if you have a vector bundle. A vector bundle, a rank R vector bundle. And let's say, so you always have this special section, the zero section, that's S zero. And let's say we take some other section, any other section, S, then we can define the Rth turn class of V. It's not really a definition because it depends on the S, but I'll say it actually doesn't depend on the S. say it actually doesn't depend on the s it's s upper star of s zero lower star of one on x okay so this all makes sense this will live then in child r of x and part of the definition is that it doesn't actually depend on the choice of the s upper star if you wanted to give a definition you could say it's just s zero upper star of s zero lower star and then prove that you get the same thing if you take any section but just avoid doing that Section, but just avoid doing that. So that's the top churn class and some properties that this has. Is that really correct? Oh, okay. This clock seems to have stopped. So don't pay no attention to the clock. It's really, it's really a quarter two. Yes. All right, so I have an infinite amount of time to give the rest of my lecture. Okay, so that's the top turn class. And in particular, so I should also say it only depends on the isomorphism class of V. So if V is isomorphic to V prime, the churn classes are the same. And so in particular, And so, in particular, we have a map of sets C1 from the Picard group of X, that's the group of isomorphism classes of line bundles, to Chau1 of X. And this is actually an isomorphism of groups of abelian groups. So, in particular, it says that C1 of L tensor M Tensor M is the sum C1 of L plus C1 of M, and that's actually not completely trivial. It doesn't formally follow from, I think, from the things I've defined so far. I mean, you have to prove something. Okay, so that's that. So we now have the first turn class of line bundles. We could proceed via Grotendieck, but we already have these top turn classes. So I'm just going to say, in fact, we have. In fact, we have Chern classes CI of V for I equals 1 up to R. I define the CR, but V is the same V here. And the C1 of V is the same as C1. Well, if you have a vector bundle, you can take its determinant line bundle, and that's the same thing as that. I'll just mention that. And we can define the total churn class to be one. There's one on X. To be one, there's one on x, that's the one, plus the sum i equals one to r of the ci of v. And these satisfy the Whitney product or some formula, depending on whether you're looking at the input or the output. It's called the Whitney formula, which says that if you have a short exact sequence of vector bundles, That says that the total churn class of V is the product of the total churn classes of the kernel and the pokernel. So, in particular, if V is a direct sum of V prime and V double prime, the total churn class is the product. Okay, let's see. Ah, so that's the churn classes. And then finally, we have the degree map. We have the degree map. So now, if we have x is a proper k-scheme, so let's call the structure map px. Let's say this is proper. Then we have the degree map degree over k going from cell zero of x going to z by the following. To z by the following, you can take, can everybody see this? You take px lower star, and this goes to chow zero of spec k. But what's chow zero of spec k? Well, the z0 of spec k is the free abelian group on zero-dimensional sub-varieties of spec k, and there's only one spec k, so it's z0 is z, and there's nothing of dimension one on spec z. So this. On spec Z, so this is just Z, right? By sending, you know, one times the class of spec K goes to one. That's the isomorphism. So that's the degree map, very simple. Yeah, explicitly, it sends this thing is generated by closed points of X. So maybe I just mentioned explicitly. And this has to do with something I didn't define here. I didn't, well, it's this. Here, I didn't well, it's this push forward, right? If you take uh w here to be a point of y, well, to be x, x is y and x is, well, y is x and x is spec k. So it's just the degree, the field extension degree, if I want to, in other words, degree over k of one times a point, a closed point of x, is just the field extension degree. Is just the field extension degree. That's all it is. Okay, so of course, if k is algebraically closed, this is always one, but if not, it's not always one. All right, so I think that's the package roughly described. Any questions? Good. Okay, so let me now give three completely elementary but slightly illustrative. Illustrative examples of how you use this to say something geometric. Okay, so three or so many, three, maybe there's four examples, I don't know, three examples. So the first one is almost barely an example, but I'll say it anyways because it's there's Anyways, because it's the Zeus theorem, and we'll just look at the case in the plane, the most elementary form of this. And we're going to take, since most of these, so counting things over a non-algebraically closed field, you pass to the algebraically closed field anyways. You count if a point shows up and the point has degree n over your base field. Over your base field, it means when you go to the algebraic closer, it's really n points. So we work over algebraically closed field. And so now what's the setup? We take C1, C2, plane curves. So curves in P2 of degrees D1, D2. And we assume with no common components. Common components. So the curves don't have to be reduced. They're just, it means they're C1 is defined by a homogeneous polynomial F1, non-zero homogeneous polynomial F1 of degree D1. It could factor into factors. It could be multiple factors. We don't care. We just care that they don't have common components. And this implies that the C1 intersects C2. Uh, C1 intersect C2 is proper, they just intersect in points, which is the right codimension. So we have these multiplicities, and then you take the sum over all p in the intersection of the multiplicities, this is d1 times d2. Okay, so there are a million proofs of this, but let me just give the proof using, or a proof using this package. Or A proof using this package, our little sketch. So each of these curves is the variety defined as a zero locus of some polynomial. Phi is polynomial variables of degree di. And of course, this is the same thing. These are the global sections of the sheaf O of DI. So in other words, O of di. So in other words, Fi we can think as a map of OP2 to OP2 of DI. And I think of these things as line bundles. This would be the trivial line bundle. This would be the line bundle whose sheaf of sections is this familiar sheaf here. Well, okay, these are sheaves, and then I can think of them as sections. I'll call the line bundles with the Roman law. Just a notational difference, more or less. So, those are the sections associated with the sections of the sheaves. And this gives another section. We get, let's let V be the direct sum of these two line bundles. Well, now the rank two bundle. And the S well, this should have been, of course. Q2 was a section. Sorry. Sorry, V2 to V, just the diagonal section. And if you take S star of S zero lower star of P2, you get actually, if you just compute this thing locally, it's essentially, I mean, you have to, the definitions are, but this is just equal to as a. Equal to as a, in fact, this is well defined as a subvariety. This makes sense as a sub variety without passing to rational equivalence. It's really the sum of these multiplicities p in the intersection times p. It's really well defined as a zero cycle. Okay, this is just you write down the local equations for defining these things. The point is that this. For defining these things, the point is that this multiplicity here just depends on the local equations. And this thing here is another intersection multiplicity. It's the intersection of the graph of S with the zero section. And if you look at the two definitions and the multiplicities, you get the same thing. So I didn't, you don't really have to do this, but this will come up later. So that's why I'm doing this this way. Okay, but this thing, of course, if you take the class of this thing, now I'll write it as a class in. This would be. In this would be in child over two of P2, or it's just the same thing, child over zero of P2. Then this, of course, is just the second turn class of this V. And now the Whitney product formula says it's the first churn class of O of D1 dot the first turn class of O of D2. But again, this But again, this is the same thing. See, we have these sections. And again, the zero locus of this section, if I take Sfi upper star of S zero lower star, that gives me the curves. So this thing is just the class of C1 dot C2, which is just the class of C1 dot C2. Okay, and now I use the fact that C1 is a group homomorphism. group homomorphism so that says that d1 times d2 times c1 of all of one right this is all of one tensor d1 times c1 of all of one is equal to this thing here. Okay, now I just, what about this part here? I do the same argument. I do the same where Fi is Li, two linear forms, for example, Xi. You could do that. And now the intersection here, well, it's just two lines intersection, intersecting, and they intersect transversally. So this thing here will just be the class. thing here will just be the class of you know one times a point and in this case it'll be the point one zero zero okay and then I take degrees so that's that's using a little bit of the intersection package and a little bit of the churn class package and now I use the third ingredient the degrees So now I apply this push-forward map, in other words, the degree over k, and note that this sends one times p goes to one because I'm over an algebraically closed field, and I just get that the sum for multiplicities is equal to d1 times d2. To d1 times d2. All right, so rather long-winded proof of Bazoo's theorem, nonetheless. All right, so let me give a second example. Any questions on this? Any questions? Okay, so a second example. Let's counting lines. On hypersurfaces of degree, what is it? So does it two and minus three in the n. That's right. Okay, so this is another bit of elementary numerative geometry. So let's So let's actually restrict to the simplest case. Simplest case, we'll take n equals 3. In other words, this is the classic count of lines on a cubic surface in P3. And we all know the answer, 27. Okay, so we can go home. But let me just say how this works in this setting. We take the parameter space for lines in P3. Of course, this is two planes. I'm thinking. Planes, I'm thinking linear algebra, two planes in four space, linear two planes, linear. So planes to the origin in four-dimensional linear space. And this is a projective variety of dimension four, and it has on it the total. And it has on it the tautological sub-bundle sub-bundle of the trivial bundle, right, which a fiber over a point x is the two-plane pi of x. Okay, that's autological. All right, so now we have our surface F, surface S, a cubic surface, defined by a cubic polynomial F. So we have our surface S is V of F for F cubic polynomial in variables X0 to X3. And now this defines my S, F gives me a section SF of the bundle sim three of E2 dual. Of E2 dual, which is just the dual of sin3 of E2. So, how does it do this? Well, I have my function f, and if I take some x, what's its value on this thing here? Sf of x equals the restriction of f to f to the two plane pi x. Right, so this is f is a polynomial function of degree three in four variables. If I restrict it to this two plane, I get a polynomial function of degree three on this two plane, but that's exactly so in other words, the restriction, this lands in the polynomial functions of degree three at this point x. Right, okay. So, okay, you have to see it's really a section, but I'm sure you believe me. That's the section. And when is it zero? Sf equals zero is just the set where f, where this f is identically zero here. So if you take the projective space here, it's a line. It is just saying that the line is contained in the zeros of f equals the set of lines contained in s. Okay, where you view right a point in here, you can view as a two-plane in four-space or a line in P3. Same thing. So, note in general, sim D of a rank two bundle. Well, the fiber again are polynomial functions of degree D in two variables, so this has rank D plus. D plus one. And in our case, the degree is three. So this is equal to four, which is equal to the dimension of the Grassmannian. So if we have our section here, so we can take SF upper star of S0 lower star of one on the Grassmannian, and this will represent C4 of this sim3 of E2 dual. Okay, so now we just want to calculate what this thing is. And this brings up a very useful tool, this whole story, which is the splitting principle, which I won't go into detail, but the basic principle is that if we want to make a calculation, some universal calculation of churn classes, we can pretend that the bundles we're looking at are sums of line bundles. Okay, so. Okay, so how do you compute? Let's see four of sim3 of a vector bundle E, where E has rank two. So the idea is you can reduce to the case where E is a direct sum of line bundles. And this says that sim 3 of E, well, you have the sym3 of this, or you have sym2 of this times this, right? It's equal to the direct. It's equal to the direct sum. Did I do the general case? No, I just did the sum i equals zero to three of m1 sir three minus i tensor m2 tensor i. So if you want the fourth churn class, three of b, that's you can use the Whitney product formula. Use the Whitney product formula. That's the product of the first, these are each all line bundles. C1 3 minus I and 2 minus I. Okay, but remember this is a group homomorphism. So this is 3 minus i times the first term. Let me call x1 the first term. Let me call X1 the first turn class of M1 plus I times the first turn class MI. And so if you just multiply this out, you get, you know, 9 times X1 times X2. And then you have a 2x1 plus X2 times X1 plus 2x2. And we can x2 and we can rewrite this guy here as 2 times x1 plus x2 squared plus x1 times x2. Okay, so just a little elementary algebra. So you get here 18, sorry, you get 9 times x1 x2 squared plus 18 times x1 x. times x1 x2 times x1 plus x2 squared. Okay, but of course x1 plus x2 is just the first turn class of m1 tensor m2, which is the determinant of e. So this thing is c1 of e squared. Well, this thing is c1 of e. And this thing here is c1 of m times c m1 times c1 of m2, which again by the Whitney formula is C2 of E. C2 of E. So that's what we get, right? So that's the principle: is that when you write things in terms of the symmetric functions, you get an expression that just involves the Chern class, and then the answer is correct, even if your bundle is not sum of line bundles. Okay, so that's our formula. And then we apply that to our case E equals E2 dual and take the degree. And take the degree, so the number of lines is equal to the degree of 9 times C2 of E2 dual squared plus 18 times C2 of E2 dual times C1 of E2 dual squared. Okay, so now we have another intersection theory problem on the Grassmannian to figure out, and this can be done. And this can be done rather simply, noting that now we take instead of f, we could take l to be again a linear form. Let's say l equals x3, linear form, and this gives a section sx3 from the Grossmannian to now just to E2 dual, sim one of E2 dual. And where does it vanish? It vanishes on the lines contained in x3 equals 0. In x3 equals 0. But x3 equals 0 is just a p2 inside the p3. So this is just giving you the lines in p2, which is another p2. So that says that the second churn class of E2 dual is represented by the class of a P2 inside of this Grassmannian. The second term class squared, well, you could take x. Well, you could take x2 also. It's the lines contained in the locus x2 equals x3 equals 0, which is just a single line. And it's not hard to show that that intersection is transverse. So this is just the class of the single line L. L is equal to V of X2 intersect V of X3 side of P2. It's a single point. A single point, okay, and similarly, when I take c2, this thing intersected this c1 squared, it's just taking the c1 of this guy and restricting to the p2. And when you take, that's the determinant, c1 of the determinant, and the determinant of this thing, that's what gives you the plucker coordinates. And if you restrict it to the p2, you just get the o of one. So I went through that rather quickly, but let me just cut to the chase. Let me just cut to the chase. The moral is you need to know a little bit about the intersection theory on the Grossmanians, which is an old, old story. So it says degree of C2 E double squared is just one as is, and the degree. is and the degree of C2 E2 dual C one of E2 dual squared is the degree of C1 of O1 on P2 squared, which is also one. And that tells us that our degree, the number of lines, which is the degree of this C4 of sin3. In 3 e2 dual is 9 plus 18 plus 27. Okay, and you get a similar computation for whatever you want to do for other hypersurfaces of other degree. It's just the computation in the Grassmannian becomes a little more complicated. Okay, so let me give a third example. Maybe in the interest of time, I was going to do the Riemann Hovitz formula, but maybe I skipped that. Horbitz formula, but maybe I skipped that. Here's Euler characteristics of a hypersurface X of degree D in P N. Okay, so this uses the Gauss-Bonet formula. Formula. And I'll say a little bit in maybe in lecture three about sort of a very general version of this formula. But it says you take X to be smooth projective dimension. Let's see. Oh, maybe I'm going to take this in the P N plus one. Sorry. Dimension, yeah, dimension n over k. In n over k, then the degree, and maybe take k to be algebraically close, doesn't really matter. The degree of Cn of the tangent bundle of X is equal to the topological Euler characteristic of X. So how is this defined? Well, you can say if X, if this field is contained in the complex numbers, you just take the complex points of X, and that gives you a complex manifold, so a topological space, and it Manifold, so a topological space, and it has a topological Euler characteristic, the alternating sums of the ranks of the usual cohomology, or you can use the ranks of the eta cohomology or dimensions et al. cohomology if you'd rather, if you don't want to assume that your field is contained in the complex number. So, this thing is a well-defined gadget, and that's the Gauss-Bonet formula. So, how do you use this? Well, you just have to calculate what. Just have to calculate what this degree is in some explicit terms and get an explicit formula. So, let me quickly do that. Okay, so we say Xi, Xi. Ah, Xi. So, we take X now to be included in our P n plus one degree D, and we have Degree D. We have two basic sequences. We have the tangent normal bundle sequence. Okay, and the normal bundle is the dual of the conormal bundle. Okay, and I of x is the ideal is this is degree d, so this is equal to O Pn plus one of minus. plus one of minus d and circle. So this is the same thing as i star of this thing dual. So this is just equal to i star of all d n plus one of d. So that's what the normal bundle is. And then we have the Euler sequence, which says that the trivial bundle on Pm plus one goes to the goes to the O of one to the n plus two goes to the tangent bundle of P n plus one and putting these together tells us that the total churn class of this thing here is just I star of the fraction so you this thing here has churn class the total churn class the same thing as this because the total churn class of the trivial bundle is just one and then you have to take this You have to take this thing churn class here divided by the total churn class here. And you know what that is because this has a C1, which is just D times a hyperplane. So in other words, you get one plus the C1 here is my hyperplane section H to the, this should be an N plus two, sorry, to the N plus two over one plus D times H. Okay, and so if you And so, if you look at the degree n part of this, this just is equal to i star of, right, you have the degree i part in one over this and the degree n minus i part here. So you're taking the sum over i plus j equals n. And there's the degree n part here is minus, I guess I'm using j for the numerator, the denominator, minus. It to the denominator minus one to the j d to the j times h and then here you have the binomial coefficients all times h to the n okay and then the point is what's now you want the degree of this thing So, sorry, not of this thing, of this thing. We want the degree of Cn Tx, which is equal to the degree of this I star of this gadget here. But that's the same thing. The degree is a push forward. So, I could take the degree, it's also the degree viewed as a cycle. It's also the degree viewed as a cycle on Pn, so that'd be I lower star, I upper star of the same thing. And it's just this number times this sum times I lower star I upper star of H, and then the projection formula tells you that it's H to the N times the lower. h to the n times the lower star of one and the degree of this thing here well it's just a line intersect x and that's just d so it just gives you this formula this is just equal to this sum minus one to the j d to the j plus one n plus two i okay and then you get familiar answers for n equals Your answers for n equals one, two, three, et cetera, which I'm run out of time, so let me not write those down, but you can easily write them down. And I'll have to skip the Gauss-Benet formula because I do want to tell you about this abstract quadratic version in this case. So this whole machinery has quadratic versions of it, but I think the nicest one to explain from a very abstract point of view, which is amusing, is this Euler. I'm using is this Euler characteristic. So, in the remaining time, 10 minutes, I think I can say something about that. Let's jump to our first quadratic version. So, quadratic Euler characteristic. So instead of getting an Euler characteristic as an integer, we're going to get an Euler characteristic as a quadratic form. And this relies on Euler on traces or Euler characteristics in symmetric monoidal categories. So, what is that? That's a category C. That's a category C together with the product C cross C into C, and then there's a unit for the product, and then there's a commutativity constraint. So this thing here is a functor C cross C to C. The one means you always have a natural isomorphism of one tensor something is isomorphic to the identity, is isomorphic to something tensor. Is isomorphic to something tensor one. And this tau is a collection. It's a natural transformation. You have tau AB going from A tensor B to B tensor A. It's sort of its square, if you define it properly, is the identity, and it makes this into a representation of the symmetric group if you have three elements. Okay, so I'm going to assume strict associativity here. Good. So here's the basic definition. Here's the basic definition. You take an object here and you say this has dual x dual delta x e x where delta x is a map from the unit to x tensor x dual. This evaluation is a map from x dual tensor x into the unit such that so satisfying So, satisfying the following compositions are the identity. So, you can take X, and then that's isomorphic. I always have to get the side right. It's isomorphic to one tensor X, there we go, which then goes by delta tensor the identity to. tensor the identity to x tensor x dual tensor x and then you can take the identity tensor the evaluation and that goes back to x tensor one which is isomorphic to x so that should be the identity on x and since i'm running out of time you get a similar story where you switch the orders of everything and you get this is also the identity on x dual X dual. All right, so it turns out that this is a nice notion. This triple is unique up to unique isomorphism if it exists. And then if you have, let me just, in the interest of time, let me just cut to the chase. You can then define the Euler characteristic of an element X that has a dual, a so-called dualizable element. This is an object in the endomorphism ring of the unit as the composition. As the composition, you take the unit, and this goes by delta to x tensor x dual. And then you have this symmetry going to x dual tensor x. And then you have the evaluation map going back to one. So that's the Euler characteristic. And it's not hard. Give a couple examples. A couple examples and I go like three minutes over time. Is that all? Okay, sorry. Sorry about this. So, some examples. Take C to be K vector spaces, then V of Then the vector space is dualizable if and only if its dimension finite. And let me just say it. What's the evaluation map? It's just evaluation. You have a dual vector and a vector you evaluate. And the delta, this is where you need the finite dimensionality. You view v tensor v dual is isomorphic to the endomorphisms of v. That's because v is finite. Of V, that's because V is finite dimensional. And then you send one, that one is the vector space K, you send one in K to the identity map. That's the delta. So the delta from the K to V tensor V dual, and this is the usual V dual sends one and goes to the identity map on V. Okay, and then if you view this this way, View this this way, you can see that the Euler characteristic of V is just the dimension over K of V. So the next example is C equals graded K vector spaces. And then if again, V is a sum of graded pieces, this has to be finite dimensional. And now the here I didn't say it, but the Here, I didn't say it, but the transposition is just a tensor b goes to b tensor a. Here, you have to take the graded version where a tensor b goes to minus one to the product of degrees of a and b, b tensor a, and that introduces signs. Then the Euler characteristic of v is the sum minus one to the n dimension over k of v n. Now let's take v to be the derived category. Now let's take V to be the derived category of Q of, say, K vector spaces. In this case, we take some complex. It's dualizable if its total cohomology is finite dimensional, and this becomes the sum minus one to the n dimension over k of h n k star. And now we'll take c to be the stable homotopy category. And if you take a suspension, And if you take a suspension spectrum of some topological space X, this is dualizable if, for example, X is a finite CW complex, and then the Euler characteristic of this thing is just the usual topological Euler characteristic. You can see this. Let me just, yeah, so I've kind of gone way over time, but let me just finish this up. The point is. Up. The point is that this construction is completely natural in the symmetric monoidal category C. If you have a symmetric monoidal functor from C to D, it induces a map on the endomorphisms of the units, and it sends the Euler characteristic of X to the Euler characteristic of the functor applied to X. And you apply this to the functor here, which sends this guy to its singular chain complex. With coefficients in k. And then it has to send this Euler characteristic to this thing here. And why does that give you everything? It's because the endomorphisms in SH of the unit object are just the zeroth stable homotopy groups of the sphere spectrum, which is Z. So the answer lies in Z. And if you take K to B Q, that is detected by its answer here. Is detected by its answer here. All right, so let me finish off with just the definition of the quadratic Euler characteristic. Won't be able to say anything about any of its properties, but that will come later. So definition. So X to be a smooth variety over K, then it turns out that you have an object called the P1 spectrum. Object called the P1 spectrum, the P1 suspension spectrum of X. This lives in the motivic stable homotopy category of K, which is a symmetric monoidal category. And this is always a dualizable object. Well, this is known if the characteristic of k is zero. And so maybe you need. You need to invert p equals the characteristic of k if this is positive. But let's ignore that. So it has then this thing here lives in the endomorphisms of the unit object. And there's a theorem of Morel. Which says this is the Grotendig witt ring of non-degenerate say symmetric bilinear forms. So the characteristic is different from two, that's the same as quadratic forms. Over k. So I'll say more about what this ring is, but this is how you get this thing. This is then defined to be the quadratic Euler characteristic x over k. Okay, so sorry for going over, and let's say more about this gadget. Say more about this gadget and how to compute it and what it's good for in the next two talks. Thanks very much for the very nice lecture. Are there any questions from the audience? SH is the category of spectra, the stable homotopy, the standard stable homotopy category. So this is the So, this is the I probably didn't say it. This is the stable homotopy category. Which is the standard calculated category of the category of usual spectra. Right. So, if you have a space, you have its suspension spectrum. So, and then gives you an object here. And if the space has the homotopy type of a finite CW complex, then it's a dualizable object. Then it's a dualizable object in there. So, sorry, I went a little fast at the end. Sorry about that. Thanks for the question. Is there a class of characteristic B varieties that are known to be dualizable? Yes, all smooth projective varieties are always dualizable and arbitrary characteristics. So the question is: right, so it's the usual business resolution of singularities. Business resolution of singularities says you can complete the thing to be to have a be smooth projective with a normal crossing divisor at infinity, and then an induction will tell you that the open thing is also dualizable. There's a scissors relation. So, yeah, those are the properties that I wanted to mention. So, this Euler, quadratic Euler characteristic has many of the usual properties you'd expect. Any of the usual properties you'd expect. The scissors relation, you need to actually twist it a little bit by a unit in the Groten-Diek-Wid ring. And I'll get to that later, but that's the basic principle. And then you can use De Jong's alterations to show that it's a little tricky, but it says if you invert P, then the thing is still dualizable in general without having resolution of singularities, but using alterations. Thanks for the question. For the question, yeah. Do they exist some kind of equivariant version also? What's that? Oh, yes, certainly, yeah, yeah, yeah. You can do this. You can, well, there are many different versions of equivariant stable homotopy. And the simplest one is where you just apply the Borel construction. So, let's see. So, does that have an? I think that maybe doesn't have. Maybe doesn't have an Euler characteristic because then you get sort of infinite dimensional things. But if you view it, if view it as an object in the stable homotopy category over B of the group, then if the original guy was smooth, then that I believe is a dualizable object. So yeah, you have a relative Euler characteristic over that group. So it will give you something not in GW of K, but in some reasonable. But in some reasonable GW, which is like an equivariant version of the BG. So that should work. There's a real problem in, so we'll get hopefully get to this in the last lecture. There is a nice equivariant theory, but unfortunately, I mean, it comes out in the usual theory where if you want to define degrees for quotient stacks, for example, you have to work with rational coefficients. And the reason for that is there really isn't a nice For that, there really isn't a nice categorically defined push-forward map for proper maps of non-representable maps. You have to do some fudge. So, maybe, Barbara, you can tell me how to avoid that. But it's not really built into the general theory. And then it's quite mysterious how to extend that in this quadratic sense. So then there's no really good pre-dawn series. Oh, yeah, you can make a reasonable definition, and people have done that. So it's, I think, the most general, I mean, it's only for diagonalizable groups that you have a real general definition. This is due to Khan and Ravi. They have sort of a genuine homotopy theory, equivariant homotopy theory, but only for diagonalizable groups. There's a splitting. The group has to sort of have. Of have a tameness property for all subgroups, and yeah, so maybe in characteristic zero there's a more general theory, but I think it's it's a little open, but yeah, that's the genuine theory is a little still open story. There are some constructions like that. Okay, Liz, do we have any questions from the audience? Any more questions? There's nothing let's thank Mark forget. That's not okay. Let's thank Mark again. Thanks for your question. And we meet again at the end.
