On last day of the conference. So it's my pleasure to introduce to you Jaslav Brugner, and he will talk to us about falling through masses in superposition quantum reference frames for indefinite metrics. Please go ahead, just love. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thanks to Chris Omelis and Robert for inviting me. I wish I could be over there. I know that some people that I met in Canada last week are there. Unfortunately, I had some lecturing here in Vienna and I could not join, but at least I can be online with you today. So let me start to share the screen. To share the screen, and I hope wait a minute that you will see this in the mode. Yes, I hope you see it right now. As Robert said, this is a work that we entitled Falling Through Mass's In Superposition: Quantum Reference Frames for Indefinite Metrics. Indefinite metrics. It is a work that I'm going to talk about actually about two papers. The first one with Anna Katrin de la Gemette and Victoria Kabel, who are the PhD students with us, and Esteban Castro, who was, but now it's a postdoc at ETH Zurich. And the second paper that I'm going to talk about, somewhat in a shorter form, is the one with Flamino Jacomini, who also. With Flaminio Giacomine, who also was a PhD in our group and now it's a postdoc researcher at Perimeter Institute. Now, let me start with a cartoon. This is a situation which is relatively familiar with us, which we have good means to describe: namely, a quantum mechanical system in a definite space-time background. Background. So we know what's going to happen when we let freely falling object in a gravitational field, and we have good means to describe this after all with the quantum field theory on a curved space-time in case that we consider quantum fields. This situation is a situation in which we have a large mass, like an Earth, put in spatial superposition. Put in spatial superposition. And now it seems that we don't have a good means or not broadly accepted theory to deal with these situations. And we may rely on some approximative methods in a low energy minute. But even there, there is no agreement amongst physicists: how should we deal with this situation, ranging from proposals that one should think about a collapse? Think about a collapse of the gravitational superposition to something which where the gravity will be treated in a full quantum mechanical framework. Now, given this question mark, what I want to suggest with this talk is that we might be agnostic about the nature of the gravitational field, but instead of that, I will propose a certain symmetry. A certain symmetry. And the symmetry is that actually our dynamical laws are invariant and the change of reference frames or the change of coordinates. But in this particular case, I will talk about more special coordinates, quantum coordinates or quantum reference phase. And this change will allow us to To reformulate the previous situation into the one on the right-hand side, namely, if we, in a certain very precise manner, jump on the earth or sit on the earth, then from this perspective or from this quantum reference frame, metric will be fixed and we will again have a situation familiar with our known physics. But objects that might be localized in the previous on the left. Localized in the previous on the left-hand side, in the previous situation, might appear now in superposition. So we somehow trade off the superposition of space-time into the supersposition of objects in a well-defined space-time. And this situation we do know how to solve. And then after solving this, we can, with this solution, go back in the previous reference frame and get an answer to the situation that was not so obvious. So obvious. So that's more or less all what I want to tell you today in a cartoon. And now I'll try to give some framework to support this manoir. So here's the outline of my talk. I will talk first about quantum reference frames in general. I will try to introduce this formalism. Then I will introduce the generalized principle covariance that will allow us to change between quantum reference frames. Change between quantum reference frames and solve the problem. Then I will look at two particular cases of that applications. First, for the motion of a test particle and then for time duration. I will talk about limits of this method, about some generalization, and then I will move to the quantum mentions equivalence principle, the second paper, for all the cases where the first one, first method will not work. And finally, Work and finally, I will give a summary and outlook. So, here is the situation that I want to treat to introduce the notion of a quantum reference means. Imagine that you have three particles, the blue, the orange, and the gray one. And furthermore, assume that one of these particles would be upgraded to a reference frame, and the one that is a reference frame will have a flag. Frame will have a flag. So on the left-hand side, the blue one is the flag. In this reference frame, the blue particle has a zero position, but the two other has some position xA and xb. Now, when we move from the blue to the orange reference frame, we have to shift the zero origin of the reference frame and therefore also the shift correspondingly the distances of the blue. Distances of the blue and the gray particle to the orange one. And what I will assume is that every state of the system, be this a classical or quantum mechanical, will be always given relative to other physical systems. So on the left-hand side, the state will be just the state of the yellow and the green, orange and the green, sorry, gray particle relative to the blue one. The blue one, and the really dynamic degrees of ring on the right-hand side would be just blue and gray relative to the orange one. And this is very much in spirit of Rovelli's proposals that states are defined relative to other physical systems. Now, the step that we took back in 2019 was really to think about these systems as being quantum mechanical systems. And for the first moment, let's assume that they are really. First moment, let's assume that they are really very localized. And therefore, what we had previously for the physical variables, we can now add the cats to these states, but nothing dramatical will change. Now, if we want to identify the transformation that transformed the first three cats into the last three cats, then let's do this and try to identify what will be the transformation. What will be the transformation for any possible choice of xA and xb on the left-hand side? Now, what I have here is a notation that I will use throughout the paper, namely this would be the state given relative to the reference frame C of ABC, and this will be the state given relative to particle A of ABC. And of course, the reference frame relative to itself is not a dynamical degree. Itself is not a dynamical degrees of freedom, it will be just a zero, a fixed state. But I will take this for completeness and such that it's maybe more clear what I want to say. Now, this is the state in the final stage after making a transformation. And if you look how it can be obtained from the previous one, there are two parts: the gray part that I want to explain the next. The gray part is just the shift of part. Is just the shift of particle B with respect to A. Just because we shift reference frame from C to A, then the distance of B to A has changed and therefore can be implemented by the translation operator with the generator of the spatial shift momentum of B. But how much we shift this depends on what was the position of A. So that's why we have here XA. And then there is a second part of. And then there is a second part of this transformation, which is so-called parity swap. What it really does is takes the initial state, 0C, XA, and then what it first reflects XA around 0, making from XA minus XA, and then swap the particle C and A. So that's exactly what happened here. So we start with this state, we make out of XA. We make out of xA minus xa and then swap and shift it into the c, whereas now a becomes what was c, namely the zero state, because this is the origin of the new reference frame. Now, this is what identifies the transformation. It is easy to see that it transforms orthogonal states in orthogonal states. That's a unitary transformation and can be written in the short form as this complex. In the short form, as this composition of the conditional shift of B, depending where A is, and the parity swap operator. Now we want to go beyond this localized situation of localized base packets into something where we have extended, non-locally extended states in the space. Now, one possibility to extend this is to treat the particle B. Treat the particle B, which never was a reference frame here, but really just an object that we see from different reference frames, to extended wave function. And nothing really interesting happened. We can go through the whole derivation that we had, just replacing the local state, sharp states of X with some wave packet for the B particle. Now, the really interesting case happens actually. Case happens actually when our to be reference frame, the new reference frame, is in a quantum mechanical state. And here I take the simplest case when it is really the superposition of two sharp values. Now the question is, if I jump on the orange particle, what would be the state of C and B as seen from this new reference frame? And given this transformation, the state would look entangled. And it will be entangled. And it will be entangled because whether we are closer or further away from the blue or green particle in the previous reference frame depends on which amplitude we are for the orange one. And therefore, we get some kind of an entanglement. So from the initial state where A was in a superposition, by jumping onto the A reference frame, the remaining states A and B will be entangled. And they will be entangled. And they will be entangled in a specific way. First of all, particle C will be at different distances, depending where previously was A. But depending also on this distance, we will shift the particle B for either XA1 in the first amplitude or XA here should be two of the A particle. So the shift of the B particle Shift of the p-particle depends on the position of A. And again, this can be obtained from our initial unitary transformation. Now, one way to understand this is really a quantum control translations, as I said, depending on where the A is pushing B correspondingly. Now, this is all what I need for the first paper, basic formalism. Basic formalism to try to attack the question: how does an object fall in a superpositional gravitational field? And again, let's say on the left-hand side, I said I have something which I a priori want to say I don't know how to solve, but I seek for an explanation where I jump on the earth and do conventional physics. Here, even the particles in the Newtonian limit or certain Or, a certain approximation, or whatever approximation of the GR you want, or in extreme cases, quantum field theory and curve space-time. Now, this is the place where I want to suggest a generalist principle of covariance. This covariance of dynamical laws under quantum coordinate transformation says that physical laws retain their form under quantum coordinate transformation, under change from one quantum reference phase to another. From one quantum reference phase to another. And here is an example of how this principle can work if I want to describe a motion of a test particle. Imagine that we have a situation like previously, a large mass in a spatial superposition, a system, and initial reference frame. Now I change the notation with respect to the abstract part of quantum reference frames just to match the ones that we. Reference frames just to match the ones that we have in the paper. But R is our previous reference frame, the original one, C. M will be the next reference frame, which was A in the previous case. And B was the system S that we then look from old or the new reference frame. Now, here is the idea. The idea is to move from R reference frame to M, in which case the M will be localized. M will be localized, therefore, the gravitational field will be well defined. But everything else around the mass, and this in this case, this is system and the old reference frame, will become entangled. Then we solve dynamically this problem. Basically, we will have a free fall of all objects. In the third picture, I didn't draw the old reference frame, but there will be as well the old reference frame. And then finally, And then finally, after I solve it until a certain time, then I can go back, or for every instant of time, I can go back and look what the trajectory will be in the old reference frame. And basically, we'll see that the particle travels in superposition towards one or the other mass. So, here is how it works. I start with basically absolutely density. With basically absolutely identical state as in the abstract part of the reference frame. The old reference frame is zero, the new reference frame is in a superposition of masses, and I have a system. And now what happens is that depending on where the mass is, I will, through the quantum reference transformation, jump over the mass and shift of the The R, but also the system, such that the system is just on the relative distance to one or the other mass, entangled with the position of the old reference frame R. Now, I'm at the picture two. This is just the state rewritten. And I want now to solve this dynamically. Well, there are many different ways, depending how exactly you want to do it. And since we are concentrated here more on the Concentrated here more on the conceptual side, will take the most simple situation, namely the situation in which I can treat this in a semi-classical approximation. What it really means is the following. First, there is a work by Stotolsky from 79, where he showed that the situation with freely falling objects in the superposition, the freely falling object The freely falling object localized will follow in the semi-classical approximation geodesic motion. So I will know how I can evolve these different cats of the system. And in addition to this, there will be a certain phase accumulated, which corresponds to accumulated time dilation. Sorry, proper time, accumulated proper time along the path between two paths. So that's the semi-class. So that's the semi-classical approximation, but note here that it's not a classical state, it's a superposition of semi-classical states. Now, having this description, we can go back to our initial reference frame. And this we do with the inverse quantum reference frame transformation, where the phase is exactly the one that we are computed from the state. Computed from the stage three of our commutation diagram, if you want, and then we can also easily adjust the cats because we know that they follow the geodesic motion and we just need to adjust them with the position of mass. The position of the mass themselves are treated as a fixed, so they do, there is no back reaction of the pro-particle on the large masses. So that's the way how we can. So that's the way how we can solve this. And if you think about how really dynamically looked the Hamiltonian in one other case, it indeed preserves its form, at least in this Newtonian limit. In the one where we are in the mass localized, which is on the left-hand side, we just have a Newtonian potential that depends on the relative distance to the system. Distance to the system, and we have also the three part kinetic part of the Hamiltonian of the systems. And in the old reference frame, it's transformed such that it preserved the form. Of course, now the relative distance should be rewritten in terms of the coordinates that were valid in the old reference frame. Now, can we go beyond Newtonian approximation? Approximation. And yes, we can. In the next, what I want to describe is actually the first order towards GR, and I want to describe also time delation effect. And for these purposes, I will use the same commutation diagram. And I will also consider a simple case when the clock is fixed, it's localized with respect to the old reference frame. Respect to the old reference frame and maybe some quant atomic clock in a deep potential potential, non-gravitational potential. And then let's look what will be the time showed by the clock. Now, again, we can go into the appropriate reference frame of a fixed mass in which the metric is well defined. There we can consider this clock as being. That this clock is being a single clock in a superposition at, in general, two different distances from the mass. What we see in the third picture is actually the time as shown by the clock that depends on the mass. And finally, we will go back and look at the same picture from the old reference frame, basically having the same physical contact of this experiment. Of this experiment. Now, again, now I start with the original reference frame where the mass is in a superposition. Of course, we can have much more general quantum states. I think you will see the idea from this simple one. Now, the state of the system is consisting of two actually sub factor spaces, one which is external degree of freedom, so the position of the clock, and the other one is internal degree. And the other one is internal degree of freedom because we want to have a clock, so the clock should tick. And if a clock has internal degrees of freedom, like ground excited state of an atomic clock, then we prepare the state in some superposition of these two states, such that we don't have a non-stationary energy eigenstate of a clock, but really ticking of the clock. Now, when we move from one to two into a new reference frame, we again have. Frame, we again have the same situation as before from the external degree of freedom, but the clock is still there in addition. Now, the clock will, if we start with such state, as the time passes in the experiment and we keep the clock at the distance, a different distance towards the mass, the clock will start to tick with a different rate due to time dilation. Time dilation. And one possibility is to use the framework that we developed back in 2011, exactly for the situation where we thought about new possible experiments on Earth, having a clock localized in the superposition of two paths in gravitational field. And what we will get is a huge entangled state where not only the whole reference frame and not only the external degree of freedom of the External degree of freedom of the clock, but also internal degrees of freedom get all entangled with each other. It's known that the closer the clock is to the large mass, the slower the ticking rate is. And so the state of the clock can be given in terms of the proper time of the arguments. So S could be understood as maybe a spin or pointer of the clock that is parameter. Of the clock that is parameterized at the proper time, but the proper time will depend on the relative distance. And given that the two relative distances are different, we will end up with a different state of the clock at the end, where omega is in this description, the energy, internal energy of the clock. Now, we have not only the internal degree of freedom relevant, but there is also another effect which Is also another effect which we also have for the test particle, and there that's the accumulated phase between these two amplitudes. And finally, we can go back into initial coordinate system or reference frame in which the mass is delocalized in the fourth case. So now again, the reference frame, initial one. Reference frame, the initial one becomes unimportant actually at the end. It can factorize out, but what is important is now entanglement between the clock and the mass position where the external degree of freedom is again localized because we kept it localized all through the evolution. Now, if one look at the numbers to see something like that, well, they are not very Well, they are not very much discouraging. If we would have even a mass of 10 to minus 8 kilograms put in the superposition where the distance is of the order of 10 to minus 5 and we keep the clock at this distance for one second, the difference in time delation will be 10 to minus 32 seconds. But what I want to say is that this is indeed a very tiny effect, but still many orders of magnitude closer. You orders of magnitude closer phenomenologically than the Planck time. Well, because sometimes, of course, in the high-energy limit is exactly the time when one expects some quantum gravity effect. But I would claim that what we would see is indeed a genuine superpositional space-time because the clock could be made by any mechanism, and soon we will convince ourselves that is a universal. Convince ourselves that is a universal effect. And whenever the clock is localized, but nevertheless runs in superposition of proper times and shows superposition of time dilation, it must be that the space-time itself is in superposition. Of course, just like moving from one reference frame to another, we can think about the clock being in superposition in a definite space-time. The result of the clock with Of the clock would be the same. That's the basic idea of this. But I guess in this other case, we will not conventionally call this a superposition of space-times. So I think this is important experiment, and it goes beyond having just a structureless pro-particle because it can also measure time. Now, Now, when we think about different approaches, as I said, there are still disagreements what we could expect from the nature of gravitational field. And I here gave three examples: semi-classical gravity Collapse model, and something which will be in agreement with our approach of generalized covariance. And now I want to argue that. That semi-classical gravity in colleges models do not obey this principle general covariance, and the reason is the following: if we think about semi-classical gravity, then jumping from one to another reference frame would correspond to these two pictures put one above the other. Now, in semi-classical gravity, we will have in the lower picture situation in which Situation in which the mass would be the only source of gravity. And if we put a particle in a superposition left and right from that, and the particle is attracted by the mean value of the gravitational field or average value of gravitational field, well, then we will have indeed the situation that the particle in superposition would fall and move towards the mass. However, in different reference frames, In different reference frames, this is not the case. Because if we put a mass in an equal superposition left and right from the localized particle, the average gravitational field exactly in the middle will be zero, and therefore the particle will stay still there in the semi-classical gravity. These two things are observably different, and therefore semi-classical gravity does not obey general covariance, namely the dynamical laws are invariant and the change from one. Are invariant under change from one quantum reference frame to another. The similar is in the collapse model. Again, if we have a localized mass, there is no collapse because the small masses can survive in DH pendulums like collapse models. However, if we move into the another quantum reference frames, then the mass should collapse. And we can easily convince ourselves that here there is no coherence. That here there is no coherence, whereas there is a coherence, and therefore, again, there is an observable difference between description in one or the other reference frame. And so the general covariance will have the same effect no matter whether we are in one or the other reference frame, which in a certain sense suggests, but now a posteriori, that we can put the cats around the position of the mass and do what we have done before. Have done before. And if the masses are understood as a source of gravitational field, then put also the cats around gravitational field. And then we will have obeyed generalist covariance. So now let me think about generalization of that. Imagine that we have n masses in a superposition, like something what we have on the left and right-hand side. And let's say that we have these two. Let's say that we have these two amplitudes of planets being in this configuration of planets being that configuration. Now, the question is: can we always find a reference frame in which the metric becomes definite? Well, no, no. No, because we can only restrict to superposition where the relative coordinate distance is preserved. Just like we could move one mass left and right, right, through translation. Here again, we can do similarly if we have n. Can do similarly if we have n objects, if we can move all of them with a global translation, or maybe rotate under global rotations all of them. This is because then we can, sorry, this is because then we can put one on the top of the other and therefore have metric that is well defined. If this is not the case, like in this picture, our method will not work. The method will work only if you have global... Method will work only if you have global translations and global rotations. However, this is very important. You should realize that this does not limit us to trivial, namely diffromorphism-related situations, as the presence of the pro-particle, like this small atom, breaks the symmetry. And therefore, if this is a physical object, then these two configurations cannot be translated to each other by different morphism. Differentorphism, although the metric itself is differomorphic related. That's a very important point. Now, if you do that generalization for the case where we have a global rotation, global translation, you can do the whole cycle, documentation diagram, and solve the problem. And if you are interested in more technical details of this procedure, in that case, you can look at that paper. Now, I want to move. Actually, I want to ask first how. Move actually, I want to ask first how much time do I have? This is a shorter part, but I still want to check. You have like 10 minutes left. Okay, great. That's exactly enough. So, what I want to talk now is a paper by Plaminia, Giacomini, and myself, and it's an attempt to extend the formulation of Einstein Cuirman's principle. And here, I rely on the formulation by Miesner, Thorn, and Wheeler. Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler, stating that in any and every local Rorens frame, anywhere in any time in the universe, all the non-gravitational laws of physics must take on their familiar specialties form. And while if we have a freely falling object, then in the vicinity locally around a freely falling object, we have inertial frame and familiar specialistic form. Now, what we want to suggest in this quantum Want to suggest is a quantum extension of that, where we say in any and every quantum local inertial frame, anywhere and any time in the universe, all the non-gravitational laws of physics must take on their familiar special optimistic form. And what we mean with this is that even if this object that is free and falling is a quantum object, if there is a way to transform into vicinity or locality of this object by a quantum object. Of this object by a quantum reference strain transformation, we will see that locally we have a linear special healthistic form. And again, just like in the previous cases from outside, well, this frame will after a while get entangled and freely falling either with one amplitude towards the left amplitude of the mass or towards the right amplitude of the mass. But nevertheless, when we jump into this reference frame, Jump into this reference frame locally that will be in the Kovskyan space. I should compare this with Lucian Hardy quantum equivalence principle, which I think we can discuss also after the talk, which was very inspiring for us. But I also see certain differences between these two principles and happy to discuss this more. Now, let me discuss. Now, let me discuss what are the regimes that we can address with this. We will talk mostly about semi-classical and superpositional semi-classical states of the gravitational field. And with this, I mean that first, macroscopically distinguishable gravitational fields will be a sign of orthogonal quantum states. And when I say macroscopically distinguishable gravitational fields, I imagine always that there is some configurations, for example, of mass that is distinguished. That is distinguishable by measuring the positional mass. I will distinguish this configuration from any other configuration and therefore I will assign them orthogonal quantum states. Then for each well-defined gravitational field, I will apply just the conversion GR and I will assume the quantum superposition principle holds for this superposition of semi-classical states. So it's, I would say, rather conservative approach. Say rather conservative approach in which both quantum theory and GR are kept unchanged. Now, here's the, I think, drawing that I would like to that you understand. We will have in generally n manifolds, and on this n manifolds, n distinguishable gravitational fields. So, I have a certain family of GI on Certain family of GI on a manifold MI. Here in this picture, I draw only one of them and I give a cat to this one chosen and every one indexes by I. Now, what I want, as we know, we need to define points through the coincidences or through physical points, not points on the manifolds. And therefore, I will also assign a quantum. A quantum state of a particle, a particle that in the manifold i has a position xi, and this particle will be particle m as a kind of meter or measure. This will be really a helping particle or helping tool to define the gravitational field such that we only have statements that are operational. Have statements that are operationally meaningful. Namely, we will talk and say gravitational field has this value where the particle m has a position xi. And so we will introduce also something which is operator-valued gravitational field. So the full state of the gravitational field, physically meaningful, with the state that has a metric state, but also the position of this meter. And when I And when I act on an operator of gravitational field, it will depend on the position of M such that it returns exactly the value of the metric field at the position where the particle M is localized. And as well, I will have orthogonality condition, which follows the three conditions, namely that these are distinguishable. Namely, that these are distinguishable metric fields or gravitational fields, and that's why delta ij I have. And also, if I pick up two different positions of the particle, I will also have a delta function. Okay, now I pick up only one point of this particle of the meter, but let's say that I have an extended object and a general state of. And a general state of particle n. And then I will assign a state of this gravitational field with this small tree angle, which will be some kind of reading of the metric field where the particle is. And this total state will be given with invariant measure as some wave function, some on the support of the particle, and then the product of the metric. Of the metric field and the position of the particle. Now, if I want to evaluate the metric field in this state, well, then I would need to apply, this should be no equality, I should apply this operator on the state and where what I will get at the end is exactly the value of this metric field at the position of the particle, and that's everything for one. And that's everything for one I manifold. Later on, we will sum up over all manifolds. Okay, now that's the definition of the gravitational field, but I also want to have a way to jump on a certain particle, for example, an additional particle, freely falling particle. And I want to underline that M and P has different conceptual status. Has different conceptual status in the formalism. M is the helping tool to define the value of the gravitational field. P is really an additional freely falling pro-particle. And I want to find a way how I can jump from the initial reference frame R into the particle P. And so I want to change the coordinates to be center at pro particle P. And what I do is the usual coordinate transformation where Where I have a coordinates center of pro particle and the relative distance to m and if I change the coordinates then of course my metric field will also change correspondingly where lambdas is nothing else than the matrices of the partial differentials of the old after the new coordinates. And so now I introduce something which is a quantum reference frame transformation. Quantum reference frame transformation, and it's a transformation that allows me to jump to the frame of the pro particle. And again, it consists of two parts, like in the previous case, similarly more complicated. Namely, there is a coordinate change, which is really changing from x prime coordinate to psi coordinate and correspondingly changing the metric field to Gi to Gi tilde, and also a parity swap between. swap between P and R. So whatever was R before and P, I will have this reflection and then the parity swap like in the previous case. And one can easily convince oneself that this is a unitary transformation. Now, if I want to evaluate the state of such a transformed state, the evaluate the gravitational field in such transformed state, we will Transformed state, we will see that what I pull out is actually the gravitational field exactly corresponding to the coordinate transformation that depends, of course, where the particle P was in the beginning. So depending on where the particle P is, this lambda depends on X, the gravitational field will be different. Now, the same applies also to superpositional space-times. And in a certain Space-times, and in a certain sense, very trivially. First of all, I assume here that now I have a superposition of many manifolds and gravitational fields that are distinguishable among themselves, let's say n of them. So I have some complex coefficients in this superposition. And then I have again the most general case in which I have my particle that helped me to define the gravitational field. Find the gravitational field and the other one on which I want to jump. And so the total state of the particle M, pro-particle, and of gravitational field in the superposition of any false looks like that. It's just sum of i's, and I have these supports of wave function of the particle mm and pro particle with corresponding integration measures. And now I have everything to apply the quantum reference transformation and to jump into what we call quantum local inertial frame. Namely, we choose for every possible position x of the pro particle and every possible gravitational field Gi a different transformation and always such transformation that precasts to the local inertial frame. us to the local inertial frame center in X on the space-time MI, manifold MI. So what I apply is just this transformation on the entire state that I had before. And what you get when you apply this transformation and evaluate state is evaluate metric field is a new metric field that is now around the That is now around the point particle P. Particle P is now the zero point after jumping on particle P. And we can choose different transformation depending on X and depending on I. So depending on where the mass is, depending on where the particle is, and depending P and depending on which manifolds I am. And therefore, I can choose always such that local. Always such that locally this transformed metric field will be equal to the flat Minkowski spacetime. So this shows two things. This shows that if I have a fixed metric and I have a non-local distribution of the freely falling particle P, I can jump on the freely falling particle P such that depending on the position of this particle, I change locally coordinates. Locally coordinates. That will mean that I can always, even for the non-local distribution of particle P, find quantum local inertial frame. And secondly, I don't need to stop there. I can also think about superposition of different manifolds and different gravitational fields, and I can do again the same. But now this coordinate transformation will not only depend on the position, but also on the gravitational field. On the gravitational field. Now, with this, I want to come to the outlook. Next, what I think we would like to do is to expand and apply frameworks where we do not rely on the notion of particles, but maybe quantum fields from the very beginning, as a pro-particles. Then we want to go beyond semi-classical approximation and both for the massive objects. Both for the massive objects in the first case, but also for the gravitational fields in the second case. Then we want, of course, to think about possible experimental proposals for testing the general symmetry principle or the quantum Einstein-Guerems principle. And I'm coming to the summary. We made predictions based on this extending symmetry principle while staying agnostic about the nature of gravitational fields, source by MS in superposition. Mass in superposition. So we show that particle moves in superposition of geodesics entangled with masses, or also that clock ticks in superposition of proper times entangled with masses. I think this provides the validity of assumed validity symmetry principle provides independent argument in favor of the quantum nature of the rotational field sourced by the masses in superposition. And finally, we gave a formulation of quantum Einstein's. Of quantum Einstein's equivalence principle. And with this, I would like to thank you for your attention. Thank you, Tresla, for this very intriguing talk. We have a little bit of time for questions. Okay, so good. Okay, somebody. Okay. Somebody. You have been uh treating uh um this uh change of reference frame, the quantum change of reference frame, uh, implicitly as if it were a group. So you seem to be able to compose them. Probably you have an inverse, you have an identity, etc. But the groups, well, they're well known. What groups are there? So my question is as a mathematical structure. As a mathematical structure, what is this collection of quantum change of references? So, the analog of, say, Lorentz transformations in the quantum setting, where the velocity, for example, is not sharp, it's a quantum, the boost parameter is a quantum variable. What group do they form if they do? Yeah, I know. So, what we that depends on the problem you want to. That depends on the problem you want to tack. We have also something in the relativistic framework with boosts and quantum boosts. But so, what we do here is some kind of a, especially in the first part, is some kind of a, well, Euclidean global translation global rotations. So that's a Euclidean group. What we have done in the Done in the relativistic case is also quantum boosts. And very recently, what we have done is something like a quantum conformal transformation. And so it depends what problems you want to tackle. Since we stayed in the Newtonian limit in the first case, it was enough to look at the Look at what we call the quantum Euclidean group. Yeah, I don't know whether this answers your questions, yeah. Well, let me make the question even shorter. Are these transformations? Do they form a group? Yes, they form a group. They form a group. Which group is it? I know that the one, so the work in which they were really completing the group, I was not involved in. I know that Flaminia has a paper on that, where they do in the extension of an Euclidean group. They have a new, they have additional generators. They have additional generators and they complete the group. But I was not involved in this paper. Okay. Thank you. Welcome. Okay. Let's thank Jaslav again. So no more questions, I guess. There could be time later when we have the closure.
