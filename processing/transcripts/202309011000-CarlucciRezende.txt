This is Alexa Volante. Muchas gracias. For me, there are many things, but this is no podido, but that is Brazil, we can participate in the Congress via online. Via online. This is very bien. In the benefit for all, and many gracias for the door for the limitation. This very felicon is well, I'm going to change to English and talk about quadratic differential systems possessing variant ellipses. I have to tell you that this I have to tell you that this talk, I have given this talk before, and I chose this because this is maybe a topic that is closer to the aim of the conference. And well, I hope that I can reach anyone there. So I'm going to talk about quadratic differences. Talk about quadratic differential systems, so differential equations, and they I'm going to give some conditions for these differential systems to possess invariant ellipses. This is a joint work with Professor Hegelino Liveira from Brazil, Professor Donna Schlumiuk from Canada, From Canada and Nicolai Wuk from Moldova. This paper was published in 2021 in Revista Matematica Computense. And one of the reasons that I chose again is because this is an important result because I gather I gather some results from previous papers in this, and we give another approach to the proof. So, I'm going to talk more about these, the tools that I use it. Okay? Very good. So, previous studies, there exist many papers on the study of quadratic differential systems possessing, in general, in very Possessing in general invariant conics and also straight lines. For example, in 2004 and 2008, Shlomiuk and Wupi proved, classified all the patriarchy systems with invariant straight lines. These systems are known as logicable systems, and they proved this. And they proved this using the approach that I'm going to show you here. In 1996, King Wanshung, a Chinese researcher, classified all the quadratic systems with ellipses as limit cycles. So in this talk, I'm going to show you not the results from Not the results from King Yung Shung, but his results is inside this paper. Moreover, in 1968, Drushkova gave us some sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence and uniqueness of invariant algebraic curves of second degree in terms of the coefficients of the quadratic. Of the coefficients of the quadratic systems. This work was done using several normal forms, and this is the point that I want to talk about in this talk. In 1968, these tools were not developed yet, and to reach these sufficient and necessary conditions. The necessary conditions, they used a lot of normal forms. And one question is: how can we pass the information from one normal form to another one? It would be very interesting and useful and easier if we could apply a tool to any normal form. Of a quadratic differential system. And this is what we do. Moreover, in 2002, Cairo and Guibra proved that, classified the quadratic systems having invariant algebraic conics in order to investigate their integrability according to their book. Their book. And in 2016, Oliveira, me, and Vopi classified the quadratic systems having invariant hyperbolas. So this work that I'm presenting is the continuation of our project that we started in 2015. We started with invariant hyperbolas, then invariant ellipses. then invariant ellipses, and after in the future, invariant parabolas. And there are many other papers in this way. So irreducible affine conics. The irreducible affine conics over the field are hyperbolus, ellipsis, and parabolas. And one way to distinguish among Among these three types of conics is to consider their points at infinite. For example, a hyperbola is an irreducible real affine conic which has two real points at infinite. Let's think that we have the plane, R2, compactified into a disk. So I have here So I have here disk. This is R2. Okay. R2. This compactification is known as compactification of Poincare. So I can compactify these R2 here. And I identify the infinity of R2 with. With the S1. The circle. So in order to have these points at infinity, I mean something like this. If I have here an hyperbola in the affine plane, in the interior of the disk, at the infinite, this high prevalence. this hypergola had to to meet two singular sorry two singular points or better two I don't know what's happening two pairs of infinite similar points so that's what I mean by having two real points at infinity A parabola is an irreducible real affine conic which has just one real point at infinity and at which the multiplicity of intersection of the conic with the line at infinity is two. So an example here would be like this. We have a parabola at the affine plane and at infinity And at infinity, they meet, well this this curve meets a unique point at infinity, and this point is double. The multiplicity of this point, the geometrical multiplicity of this point is two. One thing that I forgot to mention: the normal form for this hyperbola is x. is x squared minus y squared minus 1 equal to 0. The normal form for the parabola is y minus x squared equal to 0. And finally, we have the ellipse which is an irreducible affine conic which has two complex points at infinity. And the normal forms are x squared plus y squared. are x squared plus y squared plus minus one equal to zero. I remark that here hyperbola I pointed out that this is a real affine conic parabola again real affine conic but for the ellipse I only said irreducible affine conic and why I have And why I have set like this. So here I have two normal forms with plus one and minus one. If we consider x squared plus y squared minus one equal to zero, I mean the ordinary real ellipse that we know, that we learn in basic course. In basic course. And if I have here plus one instead of minus one, this represents an empty set in R2, but with points in C2. And if we have the ellipse like this, this normal form, we are going to call it complex ellipse. But for both cases, this For both cases, these conics have two complex points at infinity. What I mean about this, if I try to draw these in the compactified R2, drawing an ellipse in the affine plane, it doesn't meet the infinity in real points. In real points, but only in complex points. Right? Okay, very good. So denotation here, I'm going to use this abbreviation, QSF, for the family of quadratic systems possessing a finite number of singular points, both finite and infinite ones. And infinite ones. Okay? And the first step here is to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a quadratic system having a finite number of singular points to have invariant ellipses and also determine the invariant criterion which provide the number and the multiplicity of such And the multiplicity of such ellipses. And the second step is to determine invariant criteria which provide the configurations of such systems possessing invariant ellipses and maybe straight lines. So my aim here is in fact this first step. This is what I'm going to present today. To present today. And the second step, if I have some time at the end, I can talk a little bit about it. Okay, so let's talk about necessary sufficient conditions to have invariant ellipses in a quadratic differential system. So we consider a plumber quadratic differential system x dot is equal to p of xy having Of xy having this expression here, this expression. I'm facing some delay. Y dot having this expression here. And the coefficients i j and b i j are real parameters. And we suppose that this system one here This system one here, so every time that I talk about system one, is this general quadratic differential system? I'm going to suppose that this system possess a finite number of singularities, both finite and infinite singular points. Right? Very good. I'm talking about invariant algebraic curve. So the definition, if I have If I have phi in this complex ring of polynomials, we say that the curve phi of xy is equal to zero is an invariant algebraic curve for system one if there exists another polynomial k in the same ring such that this equation holds. So I'm going to consider the integral curves of the system along this curve phi here. And this is precisely the curve phi times a cofactor. So K is called a cofactor of the algebraic, the invariant algebraic. algebraic the invariant algebraic curve phi equal to zero so this equation here will be will play a very important role in our work in this presentation we are all interested in invariant ellipses so this phi of x y equal to zero will represent an ellipse In Elips. And we know the note by QSE the family of quadratic systems in QSF possessing at least one invariant ellipse. So it may have other conics, other invariant conics, but if it has at least one invariant ellipse, we consider we put this system inside this class. This system inside this class QSE. Now, the algebraic tools that we use to prove our results. This system here, if we recall, let me come back a little bit. This system here, one, let's wait a little bit. This system one there, we have here. have here the coefficients a00 a10 a01 and so on so for x dot we have six parameters or six coefficients and for y dot we have more six coefficients so in total we have 12 parameters for this family one here If we consider this order 1 x y x squared x y squared this order for the variables and its exponents, we can identify that system one with this point in R12. In R12. So I put all these coefficients in order, one before the other, and we have a point in R12. And we also consider this polynomial ring R of A, this point A in R12, together with X and Y. So we started. So we started with R xy, the ring of polynomials in two variables, and we are now considering the polynomial of the ring of polynomials with coefficients in R with these 14 variables. And we abbreviate this ring here only by R of AX. only by R of Axy, to be short. The group of affinity transformations in the plane acts on the set of the quadratic systems. And in what sense? If I have a system in the QS, I can identify this with this point in R12. And if you consider And if we consider a transformation, affine transformation in this affine group, I can transform this system under this transformation, under the action of this group on this set, and we will be taking another system that I call transformed system. system and this system till the S is identified with another point in R12 which is the transformed point of this A here in R12. So everything is connected here. If I transform a system I can transform the point in R12 that it is identified. 12 That it is identified. So, if we have a quadratic system in the plane, we can look at this as a point. And any transformation, a finite transformation that we make in the system, we make in R12. And any transformation that we make in R12, affine transformation in R12, we make in the set of quadratic systems. If I take here an action or an action g in action g in a fine transformation, we consider this function here, rg from given by this relation, where a tilde a is the 12th tuple of A is the 12 tuple of the coefficients of the transformed system S tilde S by the affine transformation G, what I have just mentioned before. And this map R gene is linear and the map R from the affine the group of affine transformation to the special group G L is a group homomorphism. Is a group homomorphism, and this is important because for every subgroup of affine transformation that we consider, this function, this map here are, induces a representation of G onto a subgroup G of G L. Why is this important? Because of this definition. So I'm going. So I'm going now to define what a committed or invariant polynomial is. If we take a polynomial U in 14 variables in this polynomial ring here that I defined before, where A is the coefficients of a quadratic system. This polynomial here in 14 variables is a commit. Variables is a commitment for systems one with respect to a subgroup G of affine transformations if there exists an impinger lambda such that for every G A which is an affine transformation and a point in R12 and for every xy in R2 RQ this relation holds. What does this relation mean? It means that if I consider the polynomial u in 14 variables, okay now I'm going to make a transform and a finite transformation in R2. So I'm going to change this xy into g of xy. x y and now so I'm going to transform this point a of our 12 into this point tilde a of our 12. We have another polynomial in 14 variables, right? And the good thing is that these two polynomials are These two polynomials are equal up to a constant. And this is precisely a constant because the determinant of this g is not zero. And we have here a real number multiplying this or this polynomial. So if I take, if we consider a quadratic system and And I have an information about this quadratic system, and I can see this information in this polynomial. And moreover, if I change it, make a change of coordinates in this system, and I have another normal form, and I consider the polynomial. Consider the polynomial U with the new variables, the information that this U, this new U gives is the same information that this original U gives. Wait a little bit to see what it happens. One important thing is that if this polynomial U does not depend on X and Y. Does not depend on x and y only in the coefficients of the system, it is called an invariant, and this number lambda here, which exists, is called the weight of the committee. Another piece of information: if we consider x a subset of our twelve. Subset of R12, we say that this subset is G invariant, this G here that we consider in the definition. If for all affine transformation in G, we have this, the image of X by the transformed transformation RG in X again. So this is Again, so this is invariant, G invariant. So let's understand a little bit more about this committee and invariant polynomials. If we consider P equal to P0 plus P1 plus P2, so this P, I mistaped here, it should be copy. Be capital P and here capital Q. This is X dot, this is Y dot. And I separate this polynomial P and Q, which defines the system in homogeneous polynomials. The homogeneous polynomial of degree zero, the homogeneous polynomial of degree zero. The homogeneous polynomial of degree 1 and with degree 2. The same as for Q. Here I give these polynomials Pi and QY. And they are all polynomials in this ring here, the ring of 14 coordinates, and we construct our And we construct or consider these five new polynomials, Ci and Di. Ci is y Pi minus X to I, i from 0 to 2, and di is the partial derivative of pi with relation to x plus the derivative, the partial derivative of qi. the partial derivative of qi with respect to y and i from 1 and 2. In 1986, VOP showed that the polynomials of degree 1 with respect to the coefficients of the initial system, these five polynomials here are G L committance with respect to With respect to the coefficients of system O. What does it mean? If I apply any change or any action in a fine transformation in the plane, the information that C0 brings is the same that C0 of the transformed plane gives. The same information that C2 of Axy gives is the same information that C2 of the transformed That C2 of the transformed plane gives. And moreover, we define this differential operator called transvectant of index k of two functions f and g. By this equation here, this formula seven here, we use the partial derivative of f ng. Of f and g here binomial and a sum from 0 to k. And k is the index of this transvectant. WOOP proved that any GL committed polynomial can be constructed from the elements of the set 6. So from these five elements, These five elements, if I sum, if I subtract, if I multiply, or if I apply this differential operator, I can construct other GLL committance. So we have a minimal basis of committance and invariance, which are the bricks to construct. The bricks to construct other ones. So, these two, which started with Sibirski in Moldova, and Vopi is one of the PhD, was one of the PhD students of Srbiski. They started working on this and they finally in 1986 They proved that we have a minimal basis of committee polynomials. We can construct other ones using these four operations here. So some examples. Nu zero of A. This is an invariance because it does not depend on y on It does not depend on X nor I is defined by the resultant in X of the polynomials P2 and Q2 divided by Y to the fourth. And the geometrical meaning that this polynomial gives is that it determines when at least one finite singular point coalesces. finite singular point coalesces with an infinite one. Geometrically, we think about we have something like this. Imagine that we have here the R2, the compactified R2, and we have a finite singular point. When we have new zero equal to zero in this surface, this point This point here goes to infinity and there it coalesces with another singular point an infinite singular point. Another example is this polynomial here, D of A, which is this given by this expression, determines Determines when at least two finite similar points coalesce. To give a numerical example for this, consider this polynomial here, x dot equal to x plus ax squared plus xy and y dot equal to x plus dy squared. And we consider b different from zero. be different from zero. So this polynomial has only two coefficients, only sorry, only two parameters in the coefficients. And if we calculate the singular, the finite singular points on the affine plane, we have these four singular points. The origin is of multiplicity two and we have these two more singular points. two more singular points with plus minus here. Observe that in the in the denominator of the two coordinates of P3 and P4 we have a and b. b is always different from 0 and a could be 0 or not. If we have a is equal to 0 then these two points does not Two points do not exist in the real affine plane because this is going to be zero divide by zero, so it does not exist. On the other hand, if we compute mu of AB, we have this expression a squared b squared. So if a mu equal to zero is equal to zero is equivalent to a is equal to zero since b is not zero and this is equivalent of at least one of the singular points p3 or p4 goes to infinity here we have a picture so for for that system with a is equal to one and b equal to three And b equal to three. We have here the origin, which is a point, a singular point of multiplicity. Here we have points at infinity on the S1. And we have two more singular points at the affine part, this one and this one. If we Make A is equal to 0 and keep B equal to 3. What's the difference here? This point here, which was in the fine part, I have the delay with the screen, just a second. This point there does not exist here in the file plane. In the final plane when a is equal to zero. So, what happened? This point here coalesced with this point here. Just a minute because the screen, there, this point coalesced with this infinite similar point. But many other things happened, this point here. This point here, this infinite singular point there also coalesced with this point. So this new point here is triple, has multiplicity three. Because if you apply a perturbation, a small perturbation, we can split this point into three singular points. Two infinite one and one finite. And one finite. So, this is what happens if we consider mu equal to zero. One of these points goes to infinity. So, what is important here? These committee polynomials and invariant polynomials translate some geometrical features of the systems. So, we can So we can write or translate the geometrical features of quadratic systems into the zeros of polynomials in 14 variables. Which variables? The coefficients, the parameters of the systems, and x and y. Other example, we have this W4, which means that we We have or a node or a focus. We have also these two head gamma1 and head gamma2, which are invariants specifically related to the existence of non-parabolic invariant curves in quadratic systems. And we are going to use them right now. So let's start. So let's start the issue, the topic of my talk. If you consider the homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 of x dot and y dot, we construct D C2 as we constructed before. And with DC2, we construct other two invariants, eta, which is the discriminant of C2. The discriminant of C2 and M tilde M, which is the Hessian of C2. C2 equals 0 means that the infinite of R2 is filled up with singularities. This is the geometrical meaning of this surface. And eta equal to zero or negative or positive will tell us how many similar points we have at infinity. Points we have at infinity. So in 1988, Sibirski proved the following result. The number of infinite singularities, real or complex, of a Pagrati system in QSF is determined by the following conditions. We have three real singular points at infinity if eta is positive. is positive one real and two imaginary if eta is negative two real if eta is zero but m is not zero one real which is triple if n sorry eta m is equal to zero and c2 is not zero and the infinite is filled up with singularities if eta m and c If eta, m, and c2, the three of them vanish. Moreover, for each one of these five cases, we have a specific normal form or a canonical form for each one of these points. So if I consider, for example, this system here, S5, for sure. For sure, the infinity is filled up with singularities. Moreover, in 1989, Christopher proved that system one, the generic one, possess a second-order non-parabolic irreducible curve as an algebraic integral if the system can be. system can be brought into this form here. Where A, B, G, H, and K are parameters and phi, which appears here, and this is the derivative, is given by this expression here. It's a conic, right? And a straightforward calculation gives those two. gives those two invariants that I told you, head gamma one and head gamma two, vanishes for system eight. If the system is in the into this form, so gamma one and gamma two is equal to zero. So this is a necessary condition for a system to possess a non-parabolic irreducible curve. The results of these Of this talk are in this paper that I showed you in the beginning. And we give necessary sufficient conditions for the existence of invariant ellipses in QSF. And for the main theorem, we have to construct new 36 affine invariant polynomials. And you are going to see just five of these 36. So, the main theorem is the following. Consider a non-degenerate quadratic system and the conditions hat gamma1 equal to hat gamma2 equal to 0 and either eta negative or C2 0 are necessary conditions for the system to possess at least one invariant ellipse. And if we assume this, this condition, if we have eta negative and n not zero, then the system could possess at most one invariant ellipse. And moreover, we give here in this diagram necessary and sufficient conditions for the product system to possess an invariant ellipse. So, how can we read this? So how can we read this this system? If eta is negative theta not zero hat beta one not zero and we split into beta two not zero and beta two zero and if we follow any branch of this this diagram we find that a system We find that a system possesses a real ellipse, for example, which is a limit cycle or not a limit cycle, or if it has a complex ellipse, or also if we don't have ellipse as an invariant algebraic curve for this product system. Moreover, if Moreover, if we continue the diagram here, we have these special branches that we have an infinite number of real invariant ellipses, and their configuration are like this. If B is negative, they are intersecting to each other in two points. Other in two points. If b is equal to zero, then they are all tangential at this point. And if b is positive, we have an infinite number of real ellipses and infinite number of complex ellipses, and they do not intersect in any point. And if we have the infinity filled up with singularities, which means C2 equals zero, then we have another diagram. And this diagram is simpler. And here we also have infinite number of single of invariant ellipses, and they are in this configuration here. Moreover, we find we solve the problem of having or not having limit cycles because since we have ellipse is a closed orbit, it could be a limit cycle for the system. So we also give sufficient and necessary conditions in terms of the polynomial, invariant polynomials for the system for the ellipse to. system for the ellipse to be a limit cycle so we are going to prove these diagrams of course i'm not i'm not going to prove everything but just a piece to start the proof we rewrite system one in in these parameters a b c d e f and so on until n and we take the conic to be this It to be this written in this way. If we consider the definition of invariant algebraic curve and set the cofactor to be this way, a linear polynomial in x and y. So we have to solve this equation here. And this equation leads to this. Leads to this system of 10 equations and we have to determine these nine parameters PQRSVU for the conic and UVW for the cofactor. So, in order to have at least one invariant ellipse, then the What could be the infinity? We must have gamma one and gamma two equal to zero. This is the necessary condition. And eta negative to have two complexes, infinite points, singular points, or C two equal to zero to have an infinite number of singular points in the at at the infinity. At infinity. So we have these two conditions. We split our diagram in these two conditions. And then we're going to prove here, very quickly, this case. The first branch of the first diagram. Eta negative and theta, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, and R1 not. 3 and R1 not 0. We are going to prove this case here. How do you prove? Well, since eta is negative, we have the normal form from that lemma. We have five normal forms. We take the second one corresponding to eta negative to have two. two complex points at infinity and we compute C2 which is not zero and theta. The geometrical linear theta is the direction that the curve goes to infinity. Since the C2 has this quadratic part, then the quadratic part of the ellipse is this thing here. Is this thing here lambda times x squared plus y squared with lambda not zero? Then we can assume lambda equal to one. And then in the equation, in the equation of the conic, the ellipse, we can set s u equal to one and v equal to zero in order to have this quadratic part for the ellipse. ellipse right then we have to look for only p q and r we compute these two two two polynomials here and since theta is not zero then we have h plus one not zero g not zero and h minus one not zero these three conditions here in particular if we take In particular, if we take h plus 1 not 0, we can apply a transformation and assume C and D, the parameters of the system, equal to 0, and we reduce system 9 to these 14. Now we calculate gamma 1, which is given by these three factors, where psi 1 and psi 2 are these expressions. And psi 2 are these expressions here. And since h plus 1 is not 0, gamma 1 equal to 0 is equivalent to psi 1 plus 2 equal to 0. Then we have to have this, gamma 1 equal to 0, because ellipse is non-parabolic curve. So we have to make this To make this multiplication vanish, if we calculate beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3, we have these three expressions there. And we claim that if beta 1 is not 0, then gamma 1 equal to 0 implies psi 1 equal to 0. And if we assume that gamma If we assume that gamma psi two is equal to zero, since h plus one is not zero, then we must have f is equal to zero. Then we obtain psi two equal this expression and beta one this expression. And since beta one is not zero, it implies psi two not zero. it implies psi 2 not 0. So if gamma 1 is equal to 0, it must imply psi 1 equal to 0. Since psi 1 equal to 0 is this expression and this expression is linear in in the in E with coefficient g and 1 minus 3h. So we have to consider beta 2 equal to have to consider beta 2 equal to 0 because beta 2 equal to 0 means g equal to 0 and 3h plus 1 equal to 0. So if we set beta 2 not 0 then g and 3 h minus 1 is going to be not 0 then we can psi 1 equal to 0 Psi 1 equal to 0 implies e equal to this, to this expression. Moreover, we have to calculate gamma 2. This gamma 2 has this factor B1 here, which has this expression. And gamma 2 equal to 0 is equivalent to B1 equal to 0. And we isolate B. So we isolated E and B. E and B. Then that family 14 now is transformed into this family 16, possessing this invariant connect here. After a translation and a change of parameters, we obtain a simpler expression 17, which is simpler than the previous one. Than the previous one. And the expression for the conic, the ellipse, is even simpler, right? And this ellipse is real if A times G is negative, is a complex ellipse for A G positive, and it's a reducible conic if A is equal to zero. We note that G is. We note that g is not zero. Again, calculating R1 and beta1, beta2 and beta3, and since b1 and beta1, beta2 are non-zero, a is equal to 0 is equivalent to r1 equal to 0. We have a here, and all of these other factors are not zero. The other factor The other factors in R1 are not zero due to beta one, beta two, and beta three are the three of them not zero. So this conic is irreducible if and only if R1 is not zero. And the sine of AG is precisely the sine of R1 because we have A and G here linear. linear and all of and all of all the others factors are squared so well defined they have well defined sign and to finish if we take these values for the parameters we have to all of them eta negative theta different from 0 beta 1 beta 2 beta 3 0 beta 1 beta 2 beta 3 not 0 and r 1 negative and this ellipse is real so for this value of the parameters which I call picture one we have this picture here and since t three times f is negative we have a We have the ellipse, which is drawn in pink here, is a limit cycle. And this is precisely this ellipse, which is the circle of radius square root of 2 over 5. In picture 2, we have T3F positive, and we don't have. And we have the ellipsis here, but it's not a limit cycle. If we take now these values for the parameter, we have R1 positive and this ellipse is complex. And the face portrait of this system is this one. We don't draw. We don't draw the ellipse because it's complex. We have this expression over here. It's a complex ellipse. And just for curiosity, if we vanish R1, I mean A is equal to 0. A is equal to 0. Then we have R1 equal to 0, and we have the. To zero, and we have this conic here, which is reducible and is equivalent or leads to a point. So we have this face portrait here, and the conic is the point, the origin, which is a reducible conic. Here are some references that I used. The main reference is the article and it's one here, sorry. And thank you very much. I cannot listen to you, sorry. I cannot listen to your sorry. No. Bueno? Okay, to the questions or comments? I think the particular case of homogeneous Come in a degree two polynomials. I think that a clear picture of what happens on that particular case would be interesting to have. I know it can be deduced from what you have here, but maybe it would, well, it's an important, I think it's an important particular case that would be. Would be nice to have a clear picture. Yes, yes. Well, for the homogeneous case, they are included here. And this first step, we don't distinguish the homogeneous system and the non-homogeneous. But in the second part, that we talk about the configurations, then we can visualize Then we can visualize this difference and have the see the pictures of the face portraits. But here, yes, you're right that we cannot distinguish very well these cases. I brought only few cases here, the pictures of few cases, and of course we cannot see the whole thing happening here. One important thing that I One important thing that I forgot to say, sorry, the diagrams here is a kind of bifurcation diagram for this class of quadrats possessing variant ellipses. And this bifurcation diagram is split or divided by the zeros of these invariant and commutant polynomials. We can find some regions where the homogeneous quadrat systems are located. Yes, if you want, we can do this. More questions? Thank you for your talk, which was wonderful. Your talk, which was very clear. So, are there any algebraic maybe characterizations for those systems that have finite number of conics, not necessarily only ellipses, but ellipses and hyperbolas, for instance? And in this case, are there any bounds for the maximum number? For each case separately, we give this upper bound. Well, we could see that there's some cases here that we have an infinite number of ellipses, like here, for example. But for the other case that we have a finite number of invariant conics, we give the upper bound. For example, for harpebulus, For example, for hyperbolas, we have cases with exactly three hyperbolas, invariant hyperbolas, and this is the maximum number. We don't have more. Altogether, we don't have it yet because it's missing the case of parabolas that we are doing right now. And after the plan is. And after the plan is to try to make a unique and global bifurcation diagram. I don't know if it's possible, but maybe we are going to try. Oh, okay. Thank you. Other comments or questions? No? Online, Jawette? No? Okay, so let us. No, okay, so let us thank the speaker again. Thank you, thank you, Alex. Thank you. Beautiful talk. Thank you. Thank you. So we now have a coffee break.
