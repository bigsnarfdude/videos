So, non-uniqueness of admissible weak solutions to the compressible Euler equations with smooth initial data. Yeah, so thanks, Eduard, and thanks to the organizers for inviting me to this workshop. It's a pity that we cannot meet in Banff, but okay, I hope that we meet someday there again. So, yeah, so this workshop. So, yeah, so this workshop should be about complex fluids. So, I apologize that my talk is not really about complex fluids. But at least I'm glad that Alexis spoke ahead of me and also not really on the topic, so I don't feel that bad. Yeah, so my system of equations is also a very simple one. It's the compressible isentropic Euler system in the 2D space. So, here the Space. So here the unknowns are the density and the velocity of the fluid. And the pressure which appears here is a given function of ρ. And throughout my talk, the pressure will be actually ρ squared. But it doesn't mean that the results I will be speaking about do not hold for other pressures. I mean, they hold for other power low pressures as well. Power low pressures as well. So, this is just a choice for simplicity. And yeah, so this is a hyperbolic system of conservation laws. And as you may know, the existence theory for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws is still quite open, and there are some satisfactory results only in case of. uh in case of uh 1d or of in case of systems in uh in systems of systems in one d or in a for a single equation in several space dimensions however as you see uh i will be talking about the system in multiple space dimensions and there the the existence theory has some gaps still but in particular already for But in particular, already for as simple equation as the Burgers equation, it is well known that the hyperbolic equations do not need to have unique solutions and some additional conditions have to be imposed in order to select a unique solution. So, in our case as well, we will We will talk about admissible solutions, so these will be solutions that satisfy this sort of energy inequality, which in the terminology of hyperbolic system of conservation laws is actually the entropy inequality because this quantity here, which is the total energy of the system, plays the role of the mathematical entropy. So, here this epsilon of rho is related to. Of rho is related to the pressure through this formula. Okay, so yeah, so the whole content of my talk stems from the results of Camilo de Lelis and Las Los Ekelihidi. So following their groundbreaking works in 2009 and 2010, And in 2010, there appeared a whole tree of various results related to their results. And I had the privilege to be involved in a couple of branches of this tree. And one of the branches of this tree is actually the following. So already in their second paper on the topic in 2010, they actually showed that Showed that there exists initial data for the compressible Euler system ρ0 and V0, which are just bounded, such that there are infinitely many bounded admissible weak solutions. So this in particular suggesting that the admissibility condition, the energy inequality or entropy inequality, if you wish, does not play the same role as, for example, in one diagnostic. For example, in one dimension, and it's not enough to use this to select a unique solution. So this was for initial data in L infinity. And then concerning the questions about how regular the initial data can be in such a way that this pill poseness appears. Appear. The next step was due to Elizabeth Achiodaroli and also Eduard Feyeraisel, who showed in 2014 that you can have actually a regular density, rho zero in C1, and find an irregular initial velocity V zero, which is still just L infinity, in such a way that you get essentially the same result, which is ill poseness of bounded admissible weak solutions. Bounded admissible weak solutions. And then, together with Elizabeth, Chiodaroli and Camilo de Lalis, we have shown that actually you can have Lipschitz initial data, rho zero and V0, such that you have still the same result, that you have infinitely many bounded admissible weak solutions. Right, so at this point, you may say, okay, well, this is weird because we have a weak strong uniqueness which holds. weak strong uniqueness which which holds here and you will be right. The point is that you have the weak strong uniqueness which holds only on the finite time interval as long as the strong solution exists. And once the strong solution fails to exist and some discontinuity appears, then of course you don't have a weak strong uniqueness anymore. And actually you can show that there may exist infinite limits. There may exist infinitely many weak solutions starting from still the same initial data, which is exactly what is written here in our theorem from 2015. So we have shown that there exists Lipschitz initial data such that there are infinitely many bounded admissible weak solutions. However, these solutions all are local ellipses on some finite interval of time, and they all coincide with the unique classical solution here. Solution here. So, our proof was based on the analysis of the Riemann problem and a suitable application of the theory of Camillo and Laszlo, which was developed originally for the incompressible Euler equations. Right, so what is the Riemann problem? I just recall here that the Riemann problem is a special type of initial value problem where the initial values are actually piecewise constants. Piecewise constant. So for negative x2, we have a pair of constants rho minus and v minus. And for positive x2s, we have another pair of constants, rho plus and v plus. And we call this the Riemann initial data. And as you can see, these initial data are one-dimensional. They depend only on x2 and not on. They depend only on x2 and not on x1. And you can use the 1D theory, which is a well-established theory, to show that there exists self-similar solutions to this Riemann problem, which are all of them, of course, one-dimensional, and actually they depend only on the single variable x2 over t. But of course, you may ask whether you have also other solutions which are not one direct. Which are not one-dimensional. And the answer is for certain values of these constants that indeed you have other solutions as well. Sorry. So here is our main theorem, which is due in our joint paper with Elizabeth Achiodaroli, Václav Macha, and Sebastian Schwarzacher, which says the following: that we can actually have, as this Have, as was hinted in the title of the talk, the initial data which are C infinity, such that there exist infinitely many bounded admissible weak solutions to the Euler system. There is a slight catch here because our solutions we cannot prove, or at least we didn't succeed in proving that you have these solutions global in time. So our solutions are So our solutions are defined on time interval between zero and some capital T plus delta zero, where this capital T is the time of existence of the unique smooth solutions, which starts from this initial data. So essentially what happens is that at time capital T, the smooth solution, which is unique, develops this continuity, and you can continue this solution. Continue this solution in a highly non-unique way, but only at least we are able to prove it only for a short period of time of the length delta zero. Okay, so what are the ideas of our proof? The idea is the following. So we have the Lipschitz theorem, we have the Riemann data there, and the idea there was to take Riemann data which were generated by Riemann data, which were generated by a compression wave. So the compression wave is Lipschitz, and therefore, of course, that theorem worked for Lipschitz initial data. And we know that for this, we have infinitely many weak solutions. So the idea is somehow natural. We smooth out the compression wave and see what happens. And indeed, this yields a sort of generalized Riemann problem where you no longer have piecewise constant initial. Piecewise constant initial data at the time of the discontinuity. And therefore, you have to generalize the proof, introduce some generalized definitions of subsolution and so on, and calculate a lot. But in the end, you can use the key convex integration lemma from Dalalis and Secalihidi to show that to prove the existence of. Prove the existence of infinitely many admissible weak solutions, it is enough to find a single admissible fun subsolution, where of course the subsolution is an object which is suitably defined. Okay, so of course I don't have time to go through the whole proof here, so I will just speak about what was maybe for me at least the more fun part of the proof, which was Part of the proof, which was actually the first part, how to construct the compression wave, which is C infinity instead of Lipschitz, in order to make the proof work. Because then, again, the convex integration part is somehow technical and not really that interesting. Okay, so what is a smooth compression wave? So, here we use the well-known relation between the Euler equation and the Burgers equation. Equation and the Burgers equation. Namely, the fact that if we take one function here called W1, which I think is called the Riemann invariant, which if we take this to be constant, then another quantity which is called here lambda one, which is the characteristic speed for the Euler equation, then this quantity solves the Burger's equation. Quantity solves the Burgers equation. And the point is that if you have smooth solutions to Burgers and you define this W1 to be constant, then of course you produce smooth solutions to the Euler equation. And in particular, since these are smooth objects, they satisfy the energy inequality with the equality sign, so there is no problem there. Okay, so this is what we call the compression wave. I mean, the I mean, the simple picture, you have two states, lambda minus, which is bigger than lambda plus, and they are connected with a straight line. So you can see that this guy is Lipschitz, and it's not smoother due to these points here and here. And if you let evolve this through the Burgers equation, you know that at a certain time, finite time, which is given by the slope. Finite time, which is given by the slope of this line, you develop a discontinuity, a jump discontinuity between lambda minus and lambda plus. So what we need to do is to smooth this out. So we introduce the initial data for which will be in the end the initial data for our Euler equations as is written here. As is written here. So maybe instead of looking for a long time on this formula, I can show you the picture what happens here. And what happens is you keep the shape, but instead of these corners, which were not smooth, you introduce some smooth functions, which I call here f0 minus and f0 plus, which of course are such that what you create here is seen. Create here is C infinity. So that's the idea how to proceed. And then the question, of course, is: what happens if you let this evolve through the Burgess equation again? And the point is, what happens is that at time t equals capital T, again, a discontinuity appears. And the solution at the time capital T looks like this, where again, I can. Again, I can simply show you the picture how it looks like. So, you have a jump here between these two values, and there are neighborhoods of this point on the left and on the right, where you have some functions which, okay, I call here inaccurately F0, but F0 will be a little bit different thing. Next, so essentially, the question now was how this How these functions here in the neighborhood of this discontinuity look like? And the answer is that one type of a function which you can get there is this one. So if you take the function which is written here, one minus two over pi of our custangans of log log x, then you can use this function to construct backwards. function to construct backwards somehow C infinity initial data. So the lemma is here and again it's maybe a little bit technical but what you can see is that you use this function f0 which is this one minus R custangans of log log x and say that if you have on the neighborhood of the discontinuity these functions then there exists Then there exist initial data which are C infinity, which produce solutions to the Burgers equation which are C infinity up to the time T and at time capital T the solution to Burgers has the following has the form which was written before. So this was a good function to look for and And this function has all the good properties we need. And this may be a well-known property somewhere, but we were looking for this in the literature and we were not able to find actually examples of such functions. And we had to sort of figure out ourselves how to do it. And as I said, this was the more fun part of. More fun part of the proof to actually find this because what we needed later in the proof was indeed to know exactly how the function behaves around this discontinuity. And so now we know, now we know that using the Burgess equation, we can use our nice function, which is written here. And then And then, okay, let's go back to the to the idea. Sorry, let's go back to the ideas of the proof. And okay, so we have now our smooth compression wave and we end up at the time t equals capital T with the sort of generalized Riemann problem. So, this is the problem where you have this discontinuity already, and you ask yourself how to proceed further with. How to proceed further with solutions to the Euler equations. And here comes the part where you use this convex integration stuff. So just briefly, because I will run out of time in like three minutes, I will show you. So, first of all, we instead of velocity, we use momentum here, but this is not really a big issue because all the Big issue because all the way through the paper, we always assume that the density is bounded from below by some constant. So, this is not really an issue. And we introduce, first of all, something which is called a generalized fun partition of our space-time. So, the generalized fun partition consists of three sets. So, essentially, what we do is we split our space. is we split our space-time starting from the time where we have the discontinuity into three into three regions. So one of the region is P minus and the other one is P plus, which are here. And they are separated by curves which are functions of time here. So this nu minus tilde and mu plus tilde. Minus tilde and mu plus tilde, they define the generalized fund partition. And then using this fund partition, we introduce something which is called a generalized fund subsolution. And I will not go through the details here, but it is a piecewise continuous object or piecewise differentiable. Differentiable object which has jumps here across these curves. So actually, what happens is that the fun subsolution actually coincides with the solution to the Euler equation in this P minus region and in this P plus region. And it has a jump discontinuity across these curves. And here in this region P1, This region P1, it is some object which we call the strict subsolution, which satisfies a relaxed version of the Euler equations, which is written here, together with some pointwise inequality between these functions m, u, and rho, and c, which are all parts of the generalized function. The generalized fun subsolution. And then the rest of the story is simple. Yeah, and moreover, of course, you need to define the sub-solution to be admissible if we want to end up with admissible solutions to ILER. And then the rest of the story is simply to find the admissible fun sub-solution because the work of Delelis and Sekelihide tells you that if you find Tells you that if you find just one subsolution, then you have infinitely many solutions. And yeah, after a lot of technical stuff, you can indeed do that and find the admissible fun subsolution with the initial data, which I told you before, which are generated by the smooth compression wave. And you end up with the result. And that is actually the end of my talk. So, thank you for your attention. Thank you for your attention. Okay, thanks a lot, Andre.
