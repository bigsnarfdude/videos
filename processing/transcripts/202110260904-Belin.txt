And can't, but such is life. I only have been to band once before, many, many years ago. I'll show a picture at the end. So it would have been great to return, but such is life. Yeah, so my talk today is going to be sort of the continuation of what Jan talked about yesterday, maybe with a different perspective. And it's going to be based on a paper that we wrote with Jan, say, a year and something ago, and also on a bunch of ongoing work. And also on a bunch of ongoing work, basically three papers that should appear soon, one hopefully by the end of the week, and two in the weeks to follow. So, oops, here we go. I wanted to start this talk by a quote of John Wheeler that I discovered not long ago that says that every law of physics pushed to the extreme will be found to be statistical and approximate, not mathematically perfect and precise. And I don't know if that's true. And I don't know if that's true of every law of physics, but it seems to be really the kind of Rhine mindset to think about semi-classical gravity. And because it was also John Wheeler that came up with the terminology wormhole in the first place, I thought it was sort of relevant to start with a quote from him. So, you know, from the point of view of the dual system, the dual boundary system, which is a chaotic quantum system, very complicated, at the level of the microscope. At the microscopic level, the degrees of freedom where the parameters that encode the theory are the energy levels, which are very complicated. Say our dual quantum system is n equals to four super Yang mills at strong coupling. We expect that the energy spectrum is going to look something like this barcode here. So that's one part of the dynamical information in the theory. And the other part of dynamical information are the matrix elements of operators. Elements of operators, which you can think about again as a matrix, a very complicated matrix. Here's a cartoon of that here. And together, you know, these two things together, they describe, you know, the microscopics of quantum gravity. Now, of course, we don't believe that semi-classical general relativity can really capture fully these microscopic degrees of freedom. But the picture But the picture that's sort of becoming clearer and clearer is that, you know, one way to think about semi-classical gravity is as the theory of the statistical distribution of these energy levels and matrix elements. Okay, not the true microscopics, not the actual numbers, but rather the statistical distribution of these numbers. Now, of course, part of that's been known for a long time and is just what you would call black hole thermodynamics. You would call black hole thermodynamics, or maybe the application of black hole thermodynamics to ADS-CFT. And sort of the prime example of that is the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for black hole entropy. So, you know, we think we can accurately capture the entropy of a black hole using this simple formula. And what this is telling us is not the actual eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, but rather it's a counting of how many eigenvalues lie in a particular energy band. So some sort of coarse grained or average or a statistical one-point function. know a statistical one-point function of the density of states. And of course, you know, there's many other things that you can compute in sort of a similar logic. If you wanted to try to extract statistical properties of these matrix elements, you could compute correlation functions on this background, including loops, if you wanted to. You could also compute the partition function on some complicated manifold with topology. Or you could look at squashings of Could look at squashings of spheres or all that kind of things. We might hear more about that from Toby, I guess, later in the week. So, this is all things that we think we can capture with semi-classical gravity, and it gives us statistical ideas about the statistical distribution of these microscopic degrees of freedom or these microscopic parameters. And what's maybe less clear, but we've sort of had a picture emerge from this over the last couple of years now, is that Of years now, is that actually there's ways to access more refined information about the statistical distribution of these parameters, and that's coming now from considering things that have multiple Euclidean boundary or multiple disconnected asymptotically ADS boundaries. So here's a cartoon for this in two-dimensional gravity, some wormhole that has four boundaries. Here's a cartoon in three dimensions where you have something called the genus tool wormhole that will play an important role in the top. Wormhole that will play an important role in the talk today, or you can have also correlation functions on top of these wormholes. And somehow, the picture that's kind of emerging is that you know, this is a way to understand more refined information, more refined statistical information about these microscopic parameters here. And yesterday we heard from Jan, you know, there's many ways that you can think about statistics, you can think about, you know, averages over states or probability distributions over density matrices. And today, Distributions over density matrices. And today, what I really want to focus on is I want to focus on operator statistics. And, you know, sort of the prime language to think about to discuss that is coming from quantum chaos and is known as the ETH anzas. And what the ETH anza says is that in a chaotic quantum system, you know, the matrix elements of simple operators and energy eigenstates has a universal structure. And so the universal structure is And so the universal structure is the following. If you look at these matrix elements, there's a diagonal piece parameterized by a smooth function f, which is basically the microcanonical one-point function of the operator O. And then there's off-diagonal pieces, which are exponentially small in the entropy, times another smooth function, which is basically the Fourier transform of the micro-canonical two-point function of this operator O. And the matrix that appears The matrix that appears here, this RMN, it's often said that these are independent random numbers with zero mean and unit variance. Okay, so this is sort of the form of the ETH Anzatz that you hear about and we've already heard about in this workshop. But there's a couple of important comments that I want to make about the ETH that are not always emphasized and I think are quite important. The first one is that, of course, you know, these Of course, you know, these numbers, RMN, they're not random. They're fixed in any fixed theory. So, you know, if you take your favorite chaotic spin chain, you know, for a low enough dimensional Hilbert space, you can just exactly diagonalize and solve the theory, and you'll find definite numbers for this RMN here. And it'll look a little bit like this cartoon of a matrix that I had on the previous slide. So we shouldn't really call them random numbers. And I don't know if there's a particularly nice name for them, but I like to think about them as pseudo-random. them as pseudo-random and they're pseudo-random in the sense that they're fixed definite numbers but of course if you look at you know the distribution of these numbers these numbers over this matrix that i had on the previous slide then they have a certain statistical distribution and in that sense they have a statistical distribution of zero mean and unit variance okay so i'll i'll i'll try to call them pseudo-random from now on um and the other part that will be important and will play sort of a central role in this talk today um is that um Is that in fact, it's simply just wrong to say that these RMN are independent and Gaussian. Okay? And the reason people say this is because often the quantity of interest that you want to compute is the two-point function, the Odocorrelation function of the operator O. But in fact, if you take this Gaussian answer too seriously, you'll just completely fail to reproduce higher-point correlation functions. So, consistency of the higher-point correlation functions implies that. Of the higher point correlation functions imply that these numbers actually are correlated amongst each other and they're not Gaussian. Okay, so for example, if you want to correctly reproduce a four-point function, you need some non-trivial four-point correlation functions of these r's here. So this is like a quartic moment with particular cyclic contractions. And one thing that may not be obvious is that, you know, even if you want to take your dual CFT to be, say, generalized free fields, so, you know, if you compute the four-point function on a black, So, you know, if you compute the four-point function on a black hole background, you think you would get all wicked contractions. Well, even if you use a Gaussian anzats, you'll fail to reproduce all of the wick contractions. Okay, so even sort of a generalized free theory on a black hole background will require quartic moments. Okay, so this is quite important. So in any realistic theory, the Gaussian approximation is only an approximation. And so this is how you should think about it. And this was worked out in a really nice paper by Foni and Kirchhoff. Worked out in a really nice paper by Fuan Yu and Kurchan is that really, you know, you can ask about what's the size of the k-th moments of these matrix elements, RMN. And the point is that the k-th moments are all are proportional to e to the minus entropy times some pre-factor, you know, that's becoming bigger and bigger as a function of the k-th moment. Okay, so it's the point is not that the non-Gaussianities don't exist, they're always there, but the point is that they're further exponentially surprised. The point is that they're further exponentially suppressed in the entropy. Okay, but of course, when you compute correlation functions of multiple operators, because there's many sum over intermediate states, these kth moment can be as big in correlation functions as the Gaussian part. Okay, so that will be quite important in this talk. But of course, I want to talk about holography. And in general, if you're not studying 2D gravity, the boundary theory is not just any quantum mechanical theory. Is not just any quantum mechanical theory, it's a conformal field theory. So, how do ideas of ETH apply to CFDs? Well, the first thing that we can note is that, you know, the one-point function of a local operator in energy eigenstates, thanks to the state-operator correspondence, is just a three-point function, or in other words, an OPE coefficient. Okay, and it's an OPE coefficient between particular types of local operators, two of which are very heavy because they're the operators that Heavy because they're the operators that create the state. And in the thermodynamic limit, you know, the operators become very, very heavy. And the third operator has a conformal dimension that's fixed, which is just the scaling dimension of this probe operator here. And of course, there's another complication, which is that, you know, in CFTs, you have to organize the operators according to conformal symmetry. And it's very easy to show that if you take, you know, these operate, if these operators are allowed to be descendants, it's very clear that you can. Allowed to be descendants, it's very clear that you can violate the ETH ANZATS. So the ETH ANZATs, you should think, only applies to primaries. And of course, this is particularly subtle in 2D CFDs because of erosorosimetry. But an important point to emphasize is that, you know, if you're trying to describe the dynamics of CFTs or the dynamics of high energy states in CFTs, ETH is not enough to describe for you everything that you wanted. And in particular, And in particular, you know, there's another part of the dynamical data of the theory, which is just not captured by these types of OPE coefficients. And so there's other OPE coefficients where, you know, all three of the operators are taken to have a parametrically large scaling dimension. Or there's also OPE coefficients which are called light-light-heavy. So two fixed operators and one operator whose scaling dimensions goes to infinity. And ETH doesn't really tell you what to say about. ETH doesn't really tell you what to say about these types of OPE coefficients and their statistical distribution. And this is not just an observation. There's actually physical quantities that you may want to compute where you would need to know what's the statistical distribution of these quantities. So for example, there's a nice observable that you can study in two-dimensional CFTs, which is the genus II partition function, which if you take a particularly simple slice of moduli space, has a single modulus. Moduli space has a single modulus that you can think about sort of as a generalized temperature. And then the genus 2 partition function is just, you know, some kind of Boltzmann sum, or you sum over triplets of operators, but it's weighted by the OBE coefficient squared. And so, you know, in the limit of small temperature or small temperature, this will be dominated by heavy operators, and you sort of need to know how these things behave. And then there's, you know, interesting probes of quantum chaos that somebody that was just studying. Somebody that was just studying random matrix theory or quantum chaos and quantum mechanics would have never had the idea to ask about. And one nice quantity like that that I won't say too much about today, but that I think is very interesting to study is what's called the genus II spectral form factor, what we call the genus II spectral form factor, which is just, it's very much like the usual spectral form factor. You take this object, you square it, and then you analytically continue in Lorentzian time. And you can do this for the genus 2 partition function, and it'll 2 partition function, and it'll now depend not just on correlations among the energy eigenstates, but it'll be weighted by these OBE coefficients. Okay, and we would really like to understand how to think about this from a quantum chaos point of view, but quantum mechanics doesn't really tell us much here. So it seems like we need something else, we need something more. And this is kind of what led us with Jan to propose the OP randomness hypothesis, which is a conjecture. This, which is a conjecture that's saying that in a chaotic conformal field theory, you know, not just the light, heavy, heavy prime OPE coefficients are random, are basically random variables or pseudo-random variables, but also these other types of OPE coefficient. Basically, any OPE coefficient that has a parametrically large operator in it should be described by a pseudo-random variable, you know, with zero mean and unit variance. But of course, these prefactor functions, which are And these pre-factor functions, which are smooth functions of the energy, basically just encode the variance of these. We've pulled out basically the variance from these random variables. Okay, so that's a proposal that we think applies to chaotic conformal field theories. And the gravitational implication of that, or the way we think about it from the gravity point of view, is because semi-classical gravity can never really distinguish black hole microstates, what it has access to is all these smooth. To is all these smooth functions. And in principle, you know, one might hope all the moments of these random variables. And that's a bunch of smooth functions. And so that's a lot of information, but it's never the true microscopic information. And because it's not the true microscopic information, certain calculations that you may do will not be exact. And in particular, that this explains the lack of factorization. But this doesn't require any averaging over Hamiltonians or any averaging over parameters. Any averaging over parameters of the CFT, but it's a sort of quantum chaos perspective on what gravity has access to. Great. So my plan for the rest of the talk is pretty simple. I want to try to give some evidence for the OP randomness hypothesis. And then I want to, you know, from the evidence that we've gathered, try to ask what does that imply about wormholes? Great. So, how can we check that the OP randomness hypothesis is true? Well, the first thing that you might like to do is do numerics. You know, for the ETH ANZATs, you can, like I said, you can put it on a computer and a bunch of people have done this and have checked that to very good accuracy, the ETH seems to be true. Okay, now, unfortunately, for conformal field theory, there's no obvious way to do that. Hopefully, one day, the bootstrap, the numerical bootstrap, The bootstrap, the numerical bootstrap, will be good enough to tell us about the OPE coefficients of something like C light, light, heavy, or even C heavy, heavy, heavy. But that's still far, far, far beyond reach of what it's capable of doing right now. So the best we can do is sort of look for consistency checks. And the point is that you have constraints from crossing symmetry or modular invariance in two dimensions that actually highly consistency. Dimensions that actually highly constrain the distribution over OPE coefficients. And you know, this was sort of first explored in a paper by Papadou and all many years ago, where they said, okay, let's take this four-point function and go to the OPE limit where these two operators become very, very close together. That will be dominated by the identity exchange. But of course, because of crossing symmetry, you should be able to expand that also in the cross-channel. And so, you know, for Channel. And so, you know, for this to be compatible with identity exchange, here you need to exchange many, many, and you know, an infinite number of heavy operators with particular OPE coefficients. Okay, so in other words, you know, the exchange of the identity operator in this channel constrains the asymptotics of the heavy operators. And, you know, you can think about this as being sort of the Gaussian part of the distribution of COO heavy. Okay? And, you know, this started a whole book. Started a whole bunch of explorations, some of which took, I guess, quite a few years. And these are known as asymptotic formulas. Asymptotic formulas don't apply just for OPE coefficients. In some sense, the oldest asymptotic formula is the Cardi formula. And so many people have explored what type of asymptotic formulas you can write down for OPE coefficients in various ways. And one that will be particularly useful in this talk will be the asymptotic formula. Formula for heavy, heavy, heavy OPE coefficient squared that was worked out in these two papers. And that takes this particularly nice form. Here I've already taken the large C limit. So this is like a generalization of Cardi's formula for heavy, heavy, heavy OPE coefficients. And you should think about it again as sort of the Gaussian part of the distribution of these random variables, Rijk. Okay, and now you can ask: well, what about higher moments? Okay, one thing that I told you that was really important is that, you know, it's not that the higher moments are zero, but you would want to show that the higher moments are further exponentially suppressed. And without going into technical details, so this formula here on the slide, this was obtained from exploiting modular invariance at genus two. So it's kind of the same idea as here. So it's kind of the same idea as here. You go to one channel where the identity dominates, and then you ask, what does that imply in the cross-channel? And then you derive this formula here. But once you've understood that, you can exploit that in principle at any genus. And what we looked at is what the constraints from modular invariance at genus G give you. And we were able to derive asymptotic formulas for these OBE coefficients with particular These OBE coefficients with particular wick contractions. So, in particular, we studied two channels, this one that we called the skyline channel because it looks a bit like New York. So, you know, this is meant to tell you how the indices of KOPE coefficients are contracted. So this is the skyline channel, and there's another channel called the COM channel, which sort of obviously looks like a com, which contracts indices in a different way. And from exploiting modular invariance at genus G, we could figure out how big the kth moment would be. How big is the kth moment with this particular cyclic contraction? How big it is. And what you find if you go through that exercise is that you know the higher moments are further exponentially suppressed in the entropy. So when comparing to ETH, you should compare this with the thing that was e to the minus k minus 1 over k times s. Okay, so here you get different integers that we couldn't have guessed from first principles. For this, you have to work through the ViroZero crossing kernel and it's messy, but numbers come out and what you see is. Numbers come out, and what you see is the higher moments are further exponentially suppressed. And in fact, so this is true both in the skyline channel and in the Calm channel, and you see that the numbers are different. So basically, not just the topology of the Riemann surface tells you how suppressed the Don-Gaussianity is. It also depends on exactly how the indices are contracted together. Okay, so this sort of again, this is not these asymptotic formulas, they never check. They never check ETH or the OP randomness hypothesis because they don't tell you about individual coefficients. But they tell you, you know, on average, if at least something like ETH or ORH, if at least it's possible that it's true on average. And then it seems to be consistent here. You can also ask about, you know, extracting higher moments of things like C, light, light, heavy. And I won't say too much about that today, but we've also carried this out. But we've also carried this out. And you can even, by using crossing symmetry of like the six-point function or higher-point functions, you can even extract information about C, heavy, heavy in dimensions greater than two. And that's kind of interesting because there's no nice observable like the genus two partition function that probes this in higher dimensions. Okay, so one piece of evidence seems to be that the non-Gaussianities are sort of further exponentially suppressed as you looked at the higher moment. And there's sort of a nice way to encode all of this. You can write down a generating function. All of this, you can write down a generating function. Can I ask a question, Alex? Yes, yeah. Sorry. So, I mean, as I think you briefly mentioned, like, you know, every theory is modular invariant independent of whether it's chaotic or integrable. So, in a sense, you should expect that no consequence of modular invariance would ever, you know, provide evidence for ETH or anything like that. So, right, because it's equally true in a chaotic and an interpretable theory. A chaotic and an interpretable theory. So you have to be adding some additional assumptions. Can you articulate exactly what that is? Like when you say it's evidence for ETH, what exactly? You just mean the factors of the entropy that are appearing in these formulas? Yeah, it's a consistency check because, you know, say these factors were not further and further exponentially suppressed. Yeah. Then, you know, the Gaussian approximation would just not work at all. Right. So, so this doesn't. Right. So this doesn't prove it, but you know, I view it sort of as an internal consistency check. Okay. But indeed, you're right. You know, asymptotic formulas will never be able to verify for you if ETH is true or not. I mean, because those formulas would be equally true in integrable theories as well. It's just that the way that they would be true is different because they're a much larger window. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I mean, to me, it seems like the real distinction is the size of the window you would need to add. Is the size of the window you would need to average over in order for these formulas to be true, right? Yes, yes, I agree. That's certainly one way to think about it. And, you know, the hope is that in a chaotic theory, you know, the individual OPE coefficients are of this size, but we don't know if that's true or not. So again, to really check that, that's where one would need numerics. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. There's another question in the chat asking if you get the coefficient functions. So, could you ask the question again? Question in the chat was asking if you also get the coefficient functions. So, not just the exponential prefactor. Oh, yeah, yeah. There's a lot. I'm suppressing a lot of detailed information. This is, you know, expanded at large C, and it has, I mean, when you work through the Verizer crossing kernel, you get a lot more than just what I wrote here. So, yes, you do a lot more. You basically get Liaval endpoint functions. You basically get Leopold endpoint functions, right? Basically, yeah. Okay. Great. And do they smoothly interpolate? Like one of the features of the thing that you got from Genus2 is that it smoothly interpolated not just heavy, heavy, heavy, but also light, light, heavy and light, heavy, heavy. Does that feature persist for the higher genus things? Yeah, it's just a Virazoro cross sync cross. I would assume the answer is yes. I imagine it is yes, but we haven't. I imagine it is yes, but we haven't checked. That's a good question. Yeah. Good. So there's a sort of nice way to repackage all of this. So you can repackage it all in a generating function. So, you know, you write a generating function for the OPE coefficients where then sort of the kth moment or the average value of these OPE coefficients is given by taking derivatives of this generating function and then setting the sources to zero. The sources to zero. And so, you know, if you just sort of think that there's kind of some RMT picture behind it, then you should only write things that are sort of unitary and variant. And I'll get back to that in a second. So you should write things that are sort of scalars with these index contractions. And so, you know, with two J's, you can write this and that, and that corresponds to two different decompositions of a genus 2 surface. And then with, you know, with five, oh, sorry, this is a typo. These should be J's here. With four J's, Here. With 4j's, there's five different contractions that you can write. And you can write this generating function, and then you can ask, you know, how do I extract these? So these are functions of the energy out front, and you extract them just by doing the trick that I did before. And in other words, you extract the asymptotic formulas that fix for you what these things are, and that just builds the generating function for all these average double PE coefficients here. Okay, so there's a nice way to. So, there's a nice way to incorporate all of this in here. And there's an interesting question that I'll come back to at the very end. Maybe is just, you know, I've only written sort of single trace contractions here, and you can ask, what about double trace contractions? But let me come back to that in a little bit. Okay, so another piece of evidence that you can do, and you can try to, if you really want to force on you to use what you learn from random matrix theory and try to apply it to understand something about C, heavy, heavy, you can play. About C heavy heavy, you can play the following game. So there's a way to derive a form of the ETH Ansatz from random matrix theory in the following way. If you write a simple operator in its eigenbasis in the following way, and then you look at expectation values of this operator or matrix elements of this operator in energy eigenstates. And then you assume that this operator is basically a random operator on the Hilbert space, which means that the overlaps. Which means that the overlaps between the two bases is basically a HAR random unitary. And then you can derive the form of the ETH antas just by doing har averages over these unitaries. And in fact, if you use an EFT of quantum chaos developed by Atlanta and Sunner, you can sort of show that this has to apply at least for sufficiently small separations between the energy eigenstates. So is there any way to use sort of this? So, is there any way to use sort of this RMT intuition to constrain C, heavy, heavy? And so, what we did is we played the following game. We said, okay, let's define a linear operator. This time, no longer on the usual CFT Hilbert space, but on a tripled Hilbert space. And then you can say, and the way this operator is defined is that, you know, its matrix elements between triplets of the energy are just given by the are just given by the OPE coefficients. And so if you define. And so, if you define the operator in the following way, and then you say, let's assume that this operator is HAR random. And so, you do a sort of more sophisticated version of these HAR averages on multiple unitaries, you can derive something like the OP randomness hypothesis this way, okay? By assuming that this sort of fiducial operator that we defined is har random. And then pushing on this a little bit and using this effective field theory of quantum chaos. Effective field theory of quantum chaos, you can argue that from that point of view, then this genus 2 spectral form factor is also supposed to have the behavior that it has, you know, a decay, then a ramp, and then a plateau. Okay. With time scales that may be different and that you can't control from first principles. Okay. Just a little less than five minutes left. I have less than five minutes left. Perfect. It's all I need. Okay. So what does this mean for gravity? So the thing that I want to compute. So, the thing that I want to compute in gravity is the, you know, I want to compute the path integral of gravity with boundary conditions such that you have, you know, two genus two surfaces at the boundary. And so if you compute that using the semi-classical path integral of gravity, there's two types of contribution that you'll get. One of them is just to fill the two genus two surfaces in particular ways. These are called handle bodies. And then there's also going to be connected contributions, and in particular, Connected contributions, and in particular, there's this connected contribution here that's known as the genus 2 wormhole. Okay, and then if you estimate the partition function using the on-shell action, you'll get that the leading term behaves this way, where C is the central charge of the theory and beta was this modulus of the genus 2 surface, plus 1. And this one here just means that the on-shell action of this geometry vanishes. Okay, so you can ask, how can we? How can we reproduce that by some kind of CFG calculation? And so, what we showed in the paper last year with Jan is that if you try to compute the product of genus 2 partition functions using the OP randomness hypothesis, if you just assume that C's are Gaussian random, you get sort of two different wick contractions. There's the kind of trivial wick contraction that gives you just kind of like the square of the partition function that you had before. And then there's this sort of non-trivial wick contraction that spreads across. That spreads across. And if you estimate how big this thing is, you see that you get a sum of this type that you need to do. And there's no longer a large, exponentially large in C saddle. And so, you know, for practical purposes, might as well treat this as one, as the number one. So this seems to match the structure that you get from the gravitational calculation. And now you can ask: if you add quartic moments, how does that modify? Moments, how does that modify the story that we had here? Um, and so there's various games that you can play. One of the games is just focus, for example, here on the skyline quartic moment of these four C's. You know, and you ask, if you add that quartic moment on top of the Gaussian contractions here, how big are things? And what you can check is that, again, you get a sum of this type. So, it's in other words, it's just as big as the wrong wick contraction here, which is kind of interesting because, you know. Which is kind of interesting because if you really wanted to check that the prediction of ORH is correct, you really should compute one loop determinants. Once the on-shell action vanishes, you should really be computing and comparing one-loop determinants. And what this is telling you is that to check if the one-loop determinants match, you should not just compute those on a genus 2 handlebody, but you'll also require knowledge of the genus 3 handlebody one-loop determinant, because the two things are comparable. Another thing that's even more interesting is that you can compute the genus 2 partition function in the different channel by taking a different limit on the moduli space of the Riemann surface where you contract the operators this way. This is called the dumbbell channel. And then you can ask, you know, if I look at these quartic moments, how big is the answer? And how does that compare to the genus 2 wormhole? And what you find is that this time the quartic moment gives you an exponentially large answer in the central charge. And it turns out that when you work through the details, it also depends on the lightest operator in the CFT in this particular way. Okay, so at least if delta chi, if the lightest operator in the theory, the lightest primary operator theory is small enough, this sort of predicts that you would have new large saddles that are some connected geometry that's bigger than the genus 2 wormhole. And we haven't found that geometry yet. You can ask exactly how big does this Ask exactly how big does this operator need to be, or how light does this operator need to be for you to find this new large connected saddle? And it turns out that the exact expression is given this way, as given by this expression here, where the right-hand side here happens to be the conformity dimension of a Z6 conical defect. Okay. And, you know, so if you're definite, so what you mean by pure gravity might depend on or not if you include. Or not if you include conical defects. You know, in a paper by Alex and friends, they showed that including this can cure some spectral problems that you have in pure gravity. So it's kind of interesting. This is just a sort of phenomenological observation that this comes out, but it's kind of interesting that, you know, whether or not you have a new saddle might could even depend on what you mean by pure gravity. But certainly, you know, in any top-down theory that has supersymmetry where the genus 2 wormhole is at least perturbatively stable, it seems like you would expect a new large. Stable, it seems like you would expect a new large connected geometry. So, let me just finish with some open questions. So, like I just said, it seems that the OP randomness hypothesis, including these quartic moments, predicts that there should be new wormhole solutions. And, you know, why haven't we found them yet? Because the lightest operator enters in some way, you might think that maybe it's because they're matter supported. Maybe the matter somehow is supporting this formal. And we just haven't looked for solutions of this type. That's why we haven't found it. Haven't found it. And maybe taking a step back, there's sort of a bigger question that I'm sort of continuously confused about is that to me, it seems that there's two possibilities. You know, you can think that typicality or the fact that you need to do har average plus the asymptotic formulas that you can compute using, you know, just partition functions or what you would call one-sided information, you might say, okay, maybe the two things are enough to predict everything. And so, in particular, this should predict the world. And so, in particular, this predicts the wormhole contributions. And this has to work at all levels, you know, including one-loop determinants and so on and so forth. Or maybe it's the opposite is that, you know, wormholes give you exactly access to the statistical information that goes beyond what you can capture by asymptotic formulas, assuming typicality or hard averages. And okay, it's literally one of the two. I mean, you need to go and check and see whether wormholes go beyond this typicality. Wormholes go beyond this typicality arguments and these hard averages, or whether you know they're predicted by these hard averages. And somehow I think that has to do with whether or not you want to allow multi, whether you want to allow multi-trace terms in this generating function. Okay, but this is a speculation. And let me just stop here and thank you for your attention. Questions for Alex? I'll be blind to that. I don't know if you can hear me from Dr. Do I need to move up? Yeah, I hear you. Yeah, okay. I have two questions. First one is you mentioned that you would improve numerical evidence to try to see what the size of the window is that you need to average over. Is there also a Tauberian theorem way to analyze the entire moment? Yeah, yeah. So Tauberian theory is sort of the sophisticated. Varian theory is sort of the sophisticated way of trying to make precise how large a window you need to average these. So these formulas are never true per se, because at the end of the day, we're summing a bunch of delta functions. So Tauberian theory is telling you how fat the window needs to be for you to trust this formula. Is there a big extension of it needed to discuss these higher moments or is it sufficient already? I'm not familiar with its details enough. I'm not familiar with its details enough to know. Yeah, I don't think it'll tell you, you know, I don't think it'll tell you for sure. Like, if I hand you a CFT with all the microscopic data, like Tauberian theory alone will not tell you, you know, whether that satisfies the ORH or not. You really need to go and check what the individual OPE coefficients are. It might be able to give you bounds on how big the window, at least how big. Big the window, at least how big the window must be for it to be consistent, or something like that. Yeah, I guess I was wondering: is that doable like finding the required window width? Is that doable for these higher moments in a similar way? Yeah, yeah, I think one should be able to do Tiberian theory for the higher moments. As far as I know, this hasn't been done, but you know, one should work harder and do it. Yeah. Any other questions? I have a second question if no one else does, but maybe we should give online people a chance. I don't see any online at the moment, so go ahead. Okay, I'll ask my second question then. Is there an easy way to see from the semi-glastal gravity on the original background that you're going to need these other cells? Is there a sharp diagnostic that's visible from there? Yeah, so there. Yeah, so there's sort of a sharp, there is something sharp. So the point is that, you know, if you compute, say, the connected part of the gravitational product of genus 2 partition functions, and you assume that you just have these two saddles, you will not match what you predict from the OP randomness hypothesis. So, in other words, the lack of factorization, which comes from the wormhole, here is. Which comes from the wormhole here is order one. Whereas, where did I write it down? Here it's exponentially large in C. So if you don't include a new geometry, you're just going to be off by a lot. I don't know if that answered your question. I think so, because this is the, it's basically saying that if I assume you're Assume you're ORH, then I can compute and see what I should expect that fraction to look like. Yeah. And it may not be big enough for pure semi-classical gravity. Yeah. Okay. It's also possible there's another logical possibility that the ORH is just wrong. And so, you know, you shouldn't trust this result and then you don't predict any new solutions. But somehow that's the type of situation where, you know, one should go and check. And, you know, so we can try to put this to the test. So, we can try to put this to the test by looking for this solution. Can I ask a question? So, the proposal that there are these extra conical defect states in pure gravity was motivated by this negativity in the partition function right at the, you know, near E equals J. There's an alternate proposal by Maxfield and Tiriachi, which is that you add little wiggles, you know, to the spectral edge. Spectral edge. And as far as I understand, that seems like a perfectly plausible explanation as well. But you seem to be distinguishing between those two possibilities with your randomness hypothesis. I don't know. Do you have any comments on that? Well, all I'm saying is that, you know, whether or not you expect a new geometry depends on the spectrum of the theory and whether or not you have an operator. The theory, and whether or not you have an operator here in this window. So, I don't know exactly what I see. So, you're saying that if you really had a totally pure theory of gravity with no states of dimensions, no distances over 12, then there's nothing. Yeah, exactly. Okay, so that seems perfectly self-consistent then, because if the genus II wormhole, if you're in a pure theory of gravity, the genus II wormhole is just the dominant thing. Yeah, yeah, okay. Exactly. If you're literally in pure gravity, yeah. Literally in pure gravity, yeah. By which we mean the thing with no nothing below C or okay and sorry, oh there we go. Go ahead. Could I just when you said um you couldn't find uh wormhole geometries that explained this, you were looking in a particular theory of gravity, presumably. Uh, yeah, we haven't looked at all, to be honest. Yeah, we haven't looked at all, to be honest. So we haven't looked at I said. Yeah, I mean, the statement is that nobody at least has talked about a wormhole geometry of this type. And somehow this expression kind of predicts it. But this is a geometry of two disconnected genus two boundaries or. No, no, it's connected. It's really connected. Sorry. The boundary is connected? Oh, no, no, yeah, yeah. Sorry. The boundaries have two. Yeah, yeah. The boundaries is two disconnected genus two surfaces and the bulk geometry connects them. surfaces and the bulk geometry connects them then then all you all you have is the um okay actually let me not make a statement that might be wrong okay thanks you know there's all these condensations of scalar fields that we both love alex so maybe there's a genus to wormhole version of that and this is what's happening here i i don't that's that's speculation but but you have you you have attention even if your latest state is dimension of order c, not c over 12, but order c. And you wouldn't expect something Order C and you wouldn't expect something like that to condense as a nice perturbative something or another. So this looks a lot more confusing, absolutely. Yeah, I think we should probably stop measured. I have one more question. So the reason here you don't consider the identity is because the identity you separated out the disconnected contribution. Oh, no, thanks. Yeah, that's a great question. It's just because in some of these asymptotic formulas, sometimes you don't always get to keep just the identity in the cross-channel. The identity in the cross channel. Sometimes the contribution of the identity in the cross channel happens to be zero. And when that happens, then you have to sort of keep the lightest operator in the lightest non-trivial operator in the theory. So this was already observed for the torus one-point functions. For example, the asymptotic formula for the torus one-point function depends on the lightest operator in the theory, just because the identity gives you zero. Oh, I see. Why does it give you zero? Maybe it's an elementary question. So it gives you zero because the dynamical information that enters is something like C light OO. And if you set O to be the identity, then it's just, you know, it's the L P coefficient between an operator and two times the identity, which is zero. So you have to sort of go to the next state, the next trivial state, the next non-trivial state. Ah, okay. There's like selection rules. Okay. There's like selection rules dictated by OPE coefficients, if you want. Okay, very good. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. That's clear. Let's save the rest of the questions for Alex for the coffee break and thank him again. Thanks a lot.
