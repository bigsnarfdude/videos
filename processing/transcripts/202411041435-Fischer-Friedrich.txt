And I would like to take the opportunity to speak about some experimental work of ours, or at least mainly experimental work. What I'm showing you is a collaboration with our colleague at Dresden University, Christian Larman, who is a Drosophila geneticist. And he was closely involved here. And it's about mechanical aspects of epiphilia. Let me quickly introduce what epiphilia is. Let me quickly introduce what epiphilia are, given that we have here a mixed audience. So, epiphilia are sheet-like arrays of cells. As you can see here, they come in different shapes. This particular one would be a Coulomba epiphilum. And epiphia are key components of all organs. And in fact, epiphal cells are the majority of cells in our body if we disregard red blood cells. So, if you find a human cell, then the likelihood is high that it is. Cell, then the likelihood is high that it is actually an epiphal cell. And epiphia are polarized cells, so they have an apical surface and a basal surface, apical shown in red here. The apical surface is decorated with ectomyosin inside the cell. And we also have a basal surface, which can be also subject to some ectomyosin at the intracellula. Myosin at the intracellular phase. However, the special part of the basal surface is that we have, in addition, a thin layer of specialized extracellular matrix attached to it from the outside. And this is called basement membrane. Okay, and then of course cells are attached to one another at their lateral phases through different molecular complexes such as tight junctions and others. So, epiphilia undergo shape changes during development. So, frequently, they start in a relatively flat conformation and then transform to a much more folded conformation as part of healthy development. And this shape formation, this morphogenesis, is vital for their normal function in the adult organism. So, here we have a very prominent organ that you will all recognize. Organ that you will all recognize, the human brain, heavily folded. And the epithelium of the brain starts out like that. And then through development, these multiple folds are forming, giving rise to the large surface area. Similar concepts in the intestine. The intestine epithelium starts as a tube, looking like that in the cross-section, and then over time we have. And then, over time, we have the development of these multiple folds here, again, increasing surface area and thereby enhancing the resorption of nutrients. So, folding is an important theme in morphogenesis of epiphilia. So, of course, it's worthwhile understanding how folding is induced in developing organs. So, if we have a top-down symmetric epiphanial cell like this one here. Epiphile cell like this one here, and you stack them together, you actually get a flat part of the epithelium. So, top-down symmetric cells make flat epiphia or flat parts of epiphia. However, if we have wedge-shaped cells looking like that and we stack them together, then we actually get curvature. So, in order to go from a flat At a flat part of an epithelium to a curved part, we need to transform top-down symmetric cells into wedge-shaped cells. And the way of doing it is through emerging asymmetries in apical and basal cell surface tension. So, if we would enhance apical surface tension in this cell, then fun fact. This cell, then contractility, or in other words, at the apical side is increased, we get actual contraction and therefore a transition to this wedge shape. So, in order to understand epiphilial folding, we first of all need a thorough understanding of apical and basal surface tension regulation. That's what I would claim. Now, we know a lot. Now, we know a lot about apical tension from the literature. It's pretty clear that apical tension is regulated through ectomyosin at the apical phase. However, for basal tension, we know significantly less. So how basal tension is regulated is pretty much unclear. At least it was until I would claim we published our study. So we set out in this project. Set out in this project to ask how does the basement membrane contribute to basal tension? Because the basement membrane is what makes the basal site different from the apical site. Okay, so we use a model organism to study that question, namely Drosophila. Sorry for that. And within the Drosophila larva, we use this tissue here. We use this tissue here. This is the Drosophila imaginal wing disc, and this is the precursor tissue of the wing in the adult fly. So this is how the wing disc looks like at the beginning of the third larval stage. So from the top, it looks pear-shaped. If you have a cross-section, look at the vertical cross-section along this line, it looks like this. Along this line, it looks like this. So we have a columnar epithelium here, the lower side, and we have a thin squamous epithelium at the top, which will not be the object of the talk. So please focus on the columnar epithelium, the wing disc proper. And the basal side of this epithelium is outside. So, shown in green here, we have a basement membrane all around this wing disc tissue. This wing disc tissue, and inside we would have the apical phase with a lumen. So, as part of healthy development, the wing disc forms three folds, as shown here. So, first, it is flat, and then these three folds are emerging. And in particular, for the central fold, our collaborator Chris and Darwin has found that it seems that. Has found that it seems that the basin membrane is actually being degraded there concomitantly with full formation or with the onset of full formation. And he also found evidence that if you induce base membrane degradation locally in an ectopic place, you actually induce full formation. So we had some hints that basin membranes actually can Actually, can trigger in a certain way fault formation. Okay, so in this project here, we first wanted to understand and actually be able to measure basal tension in this tissue, and we chose to work with the AFM, one tool of our lab. So, what you see here is an AFM cantilever with a pyramidal tip. We have an explanted wig. We have an explanted wing disc tissue that is adhered to a glass bottom. And what we did is we indented into the central part of this epithelium, measuring the force necessary to do that. And here you can see the setup, how it looks like in the microscope. So this is the top view. We have a triangular cantilever. About here is the pyramidal tip. And this is the kind of This is the kind of force indentation curves that we were measuring in this experiment. So, for those who have not worked with AFM yet or are not used to look at those kind of curves, what you see here is force versus indentation and time essentially proceeds along this axis. So, first, we have the candy level above the tissue not yet in contact, therefore, the force is zero. You bring it down at a constant velocity, and once contact is made, then the Contact is made, then the cantilever starts to deflect because the force is being necessary now to further indent. And we have a force increase that, in fact, looks close to linear. So this linear increase of the force was actually a surprise to us because we initially were expecting to do an indentation that would be predicted by the Hertz model. And the Hertz model would actually give rise to different Give rise to different force indentation curves. So let's look into this. So Hirtsching contact mechanics tells us, or like assuming that we have indentation into an elastic half space depending on the indenter type, tells us the force-indentation relationship for conical or pyramidal indenter. We have that the force increases with the indentation to the power of two. So if this were true, we would see. If this were true, we would see here a parabolic increase of the force with indentation depth. However, this was not the case, telling us that this model probably is not the correct one for this kind of measurement. And instead, if we pick up this picture of indenting into a tensed sheet, namely the tensed basal surface of the tissue, looking into the literature, we see that this gives just. We see that this gives just the right prediction: namely, force increasing with the in-plane pre-stress in the sheet times the indentation delta. So, here we would get a power law one force increase. Here we would have a power law two increase. We actually also quantify that, and we see the experimental data are closer to the power law one relationship, so linear increase. So, a linear increase. Okay, and the actual force-indentation relationship still gets the pretty factor pi here. And then what we did is we fitted the slope of these curves, just with a linear fit. We get a certain slope, namely pi times basal tension. And this is the way we determine basal tension in these explanted wing discs. Okay, so now being able to measure basal tension, we set out to understand what actually sets basal tension. So we did a couple of perturbation experiments. The first perturbation experiment that we did, or that our PhD student Janine did, she first measured basal tension in the untreated swing disc and then added collagenase to Added collagenase to the medium to digest the basement membrane. And then she measured basal tension again after some incubation time. She finds that basal tension significantly drops by digesting the basement membrane by about two-thirds of its original magnitude. She also looked into what activiosin perturbations do to basal tension and, not too surprisingly, also. And not too surprisingly, also ectomyosin perturbation changes basal tension. So we were inhibiting myosin through the rock inhibitor, also leading to a significant reduction of basal tension. And also trying lapfranculin, which depolymerizes actin, we get as well a reduction of basal tension. So from these experiments, we could conclude that the basal membrane. That the basal membrane has a strong impact on basal tension, and maybe not too surprisingly, also ectomyosin gives a contribution to basal tension. So, in order to explain this finding, we came up with the hypothesis that we actually have an elastic stretch in the basin membrane, so an elastic tension that is present in epithelial homeostasis. In epithelial homeostasis, which contributes to basal tension. In other words, the basal membrane is not in its elastic reference state, but it has been expanded away from this elastic reference state. So in order to consolidate this hypothesis, we wanted to know what kind of material properties the basin membrane has. So in particular, we were asking, is the basic membrane solid-like? Of membrane solid-like. So, you might be maybe surprised about having doubts about this, but we were, or our lab is particularly coming from investigating mechanical properties of actomyosin. Ectomyosin in the cortex turns over on time scales of a minute, roughly, and therefore on longer time scales, morphogenetic time scales, behaves like a viscous liquid. Now, the question is whether this is also true for the basal membrane in order to. The basal membrane. In order to look at this, Yanine performed photobleaching experiments at explanted wing discs. The wing discs are expressing fluorescently labeled collagen 4 here. She bleached such a rectangular spot into this fluorescently labeled basin membrane and then waited several hours. And what you find then is that there is essentially no fluorescence recovery within the square. I have to mention that. I have to mention that collagen 4 is actually not produced by the wing disc itself. So it's kind of expected that there will be no new material coming in from the outside. But we can also see that collagen 4 that is present in the unbleached part of the basic membrane is not fading away, it keeps its intensity, meaning that it is not, the bonds are not unbinding, it's not released. Unbinding, it's not released into the medium of the dish. And what we could also see is that this bleached spot within this seven hours of imaging that she did essentially does not blur in shape. So it keeps this pretty sharply bounded bleached square. So we can see that looking at the intensity before the bleaching, that's the green curve. Directly after the bleaching. Directly after the bleaching, that's the blue curve, and then seven hours later, the orange curve telling us or suggesting that collagen 4 mobility is actually very slow on the basement membrane. The residence times of these molecules within the basement membrane are very long, suggesting that indeed this basic membrane behaves like a solid-like material. So, solid-like also on morphogenetic time scales of Also, on morphogenetic time scales of several hours. So we have that the material looks like a solid, behaves solid-like, can therefore bear elastic stresses, but what does actually generate the elastic stretch in the basement membrane in epithelial homeostasis? So there are no motoproteins in the basin membrane, so what should possibly generate the forces? And to understand that, we came up with that kind of force balance here, described in this little schematic here. So the picture that we came up with is described through a force balance between a small hydrostatic pressure axis inside a cell, so not a very big one on the order of 100 Pascal. Then we have actomyosin-generated contract. Ectomycin-generated contractile stresses in the lateral and also in the apical surfaces of the cell. And we get, or we imagine that there is a force balance between orthogonal stresses generated by the hydrostatic pressure on the one hand and the contractility of the lateral phases on the other hand. So force balance means low motion, right? Then in the horizontal direction, we fancy with the small We fancy with this model that there is a force balance between the hydrostatic pressure-generated stress and stresses from the contractile basal and apical tension in the tissue. So, again, what are the ingredients? Active surface tensions on all the cell phases, a hydrostatic pressure excess inside the cell, presumably generated through an osmotic gradient across the cell boundary, and Boundary and an elastic modulus of the basalt membrane described by some modulus Kb. We have here essentially a Hooke's law type behavior for the passive part of the basal tension. So we would, or we imagine that there is a force balance between an expansile cell layer. So the cell layer by itself would like to expand, but the base and membrane. But the base of the membrane is holding against it, and therefore elastic stresses are generated in it. So, if this model were true, we can actually make some predictions about shape changes upon perturbations. So, shape changes of the basal areas of the cell. So, if we digest the basal membrane, then this Um, then this model says we have an expansile cell layer. This is held together by the basin membrane. If we take the basin membrane away, we should have an expansion at the basal phase. And indeed, this is what is happening. If we do the experiment, we have a roughly 15% increase of basal area. If we do actomyosin perturbation with the ROC inhibitor, With the ROC inhibitor andor vice versa, the blatrunculin, then interestingly, we get the opposite. This is normally the point where the biologists say this cannot possibly be true. You get basal compression upon inhibition of actomyosin, but it is actually true the force generated to widen up the elastic. To widen up the elastic basal membrane is then seizing upon actomyosin inhibition, and therefore the elastic stretch is going down, and you see basal compression. How much time do I have left? I started later, right? Yeah, yeah. Okay, thanks. Yeah, one can also describe this model with an energy functional. So, this is something like a simplified version of the vertex model. So, saying that the energy of the cell is given through terms emanating from the active surface tensions at all cell phases. So, this would be the first one here: apical area times surface tension of the apical site, same for basal phase. Same for basal phase and lateral phase. We have a volume contribution due to the present hydrostatic pressure, and we have an elastic contribution due to the elastic stretch of the basin membrane. Now, if we say we have an energy equilibrium situation, the cell geometry is adjusted such that this energy is minimized, then we can make these, write down these equations here. Write down these equations here, demanding that the energy, the derivative of the energy with respect to cell height equals zero, and that the derivative of the energy with respect to edge length of the cross-sectional area equals zero. And that gives us two relationships telling us that the basal tension should be proportional to the lateral tension within this epithelial layer times the geometrical vector cell height divided by. vector cell height divided by square root three times edge length and that the basal tension at the same time is proportional to hydrostatic pressure inside the cell again multiplied with a geometrical factor so we wanted to test that predictions of the model by doing experiments so we started with the first prediction saying that basal tension is proportional to lateral tension so we So we perturbed the lateral tension in the cell. How did we do this? We used optogenetic activation. So we had a cell, a fly line with an optogenetic construct based on the CIBN-Cry2 interaction. So CIBN-Cry2 interaction is activated by exposure to 488 nanometer light. 88 nanometer light, and in the darkness, there is no interaction between the two. And CIVN is tethered to a construct of GFP and the plasma membrane anchor. So it is located to the plasma membrane in the wing disc epithelium. Try2 is bound to Rho Gef2, that means an activator of Rho and thereby downstream actomyosin. So upon light exposure, Rho. So upon light exposure, Rho GF2 is localized to the plasma membrane, activates Rho, and thereby actomyosin contraction. So in the experiment that Janine did, she performed optogenetic activation in the center of the wing disc epithelium to avoid activation of the apical and the basal actomycin network. So only the central part. Only the central part of the lateral faces. And she did this through two-photon illumination. If you would do a regular confocal activation, then you would activate throughout with two-photon illumination. It's possible to restrict activation to the central part and get only activizing activation here. This is how it looks like before the activation, after the activation, and then Activation and then there is a relaxation happening. We can see it again. So activation happen now and relaxation. So you can see the activated tissue shrinks in height. Our cells are widening in relaxation. Cells are widening in response, and then there is a relaxation towards the old geometry over time. This is how the cross-sectional areas look like. Activation happened, they're widened, and now they are shrinking back to the old conformation. Okay, this is the movie is a bit fast. So, before activation, right after activation, cells are shorter and wider. Are shorter and wider, and then relaxation takes place over about 10 minutes. This is the quantification. So, height shrinks about 10%, and basal area shrinks by about 14% upon activation. So, of course, we are not only changing the geometry here by activating actomyosin in the lateral phases. And in the lateral phases, we increase temporarily lateral tension. And this is how the basal tension changes during this experiment. We have normalized the values of tension before to one. Every data point is a wing disk measured. So, right after activation, basal tension is indeed increased by approximately 15 percent and then decays back. Then decays back or relaxes back to its original value of one, normalized value of one. Okay, so this confirms the prediction of the model. So basal tension indeed correlates with lateral cell tensions. So prediction one has been confirmed. What about prediction two? So prediction two says that hydrostatic pressure also corresponds. Pressure also correlates with basal tension. And in order to test that, we performed osmotic shocks on the wing disc. So both hypo and hyper osmotic shocks. So this is the hypo osmotic shock leading to osmotic swelling, and during the swelling process, there is an interval of increased hydrostatic pressure. So that osmotic swelling is. So, the osmotic swelling is not particularly large. So, this is before, this is right after. Here, the wing disc is slightly swollen. It's difficult actually to see it by eye. And after half an hour through active cell volume regulation, the wing disc again has like readjusted the swelling and brings down the area again. This is the quantification. So, wing disc area. Area again normalized to one before, swelled to about five percent more right after the hyposmontic shock. And then there is a relaxation process now to a reduced regulated wing disc area. So, how does basal tension change in correspondence? So, we see that in the We see that, in accordance with the prediction, basal tension indeed increases in the phase where we have this increased hydrostatic pressure due to osmotic shock. And then with the decline of the basal area, you can understand that through Hooke's law, increased basal area, more elastic stretch, reduced basal area, then after some time, reduced basal tension in accordance with. In accordance with the simple elastic behavior. So, what happens in the opposite case if we do an osmotic shrinkage for a hyper-osmotic shock? So, there obviously we reduce wing disc area. So, reduction by about 8% right after the shock, and then a relaxation through osmotic volume regulation of the cell. The cell, and here, in accordance with the prediction of the model, we first have a reduction of basal tension, then an overshoot. Where I have to say that this part we do not completely understand. I would guess that there might be some miscoelastic effects coming into play. But in the long run, since the wing disc area remains reduced, also basal tension remains reduced, which we can again understand through an elastic behaviour. Understand through an elastic behavior the basal membrane. So overall, at least in steady state, basal tension correlates with hydrostatic pressure. So prediction 2 also has been confirmed through experimental data. And with this, I'm at the end of my talk. So let me summarize. So before, we already knew that. Already knew that the apical cell phase is their detention, is regulated through actomyosin, providing contractility but behaving like a viscous material on somewhat longer time scales of minutes and more. On the basal side, we have distinct material properties. It is a solid-like also on morphogenetic time scales, thereby can convey a shade memory to the tissue on those time scales of ours. Those time scales of ours, we surprisingly find that the basal membrane is subject to elastic stretch, even in epithelial homeostasis. So there has been no deformation of the tissue, right? Still, it's under elastic stretch. I would say we still need to do some research to fully understand this. And stretch generators seem to be the cell internal hydrostatic pressure and lateral ectomyas. And lateral ectomyosin, but overall, like forces generated by ectomyosin in the lateral and apical phases of the cell. Okay.
