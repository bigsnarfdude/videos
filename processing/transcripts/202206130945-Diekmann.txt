So, this is really a multi-scale meeting, I think, because after the broad overview, grand overview of all aspects of epidemics modeling and also interacting with politicians, etc. I will focus on some aspect of models. So somewhere inside the machinery of model building, there is this aspect that we need to prescribe for a given. For a given, not a given, but for any infected individual, how it will contribute to the force of infection in the future after its infection. And this actually is now, I will explain it in the context of an outbreak. So not with demographic turnover, not with temporary immunity. There is one-way traffic in the sense that you can only the susceptible population can. Only the susceptible population can only go down. Also, I will ignore many aspects of epidemic models, for instance, heterogeneity and how you model contacts in a population. I will focus on the simplest context. But in the second half, I will talk a little bit about a very caricatural way of modeling contact structure and say a little bit about that. But certainly at the start, I will just focus on this simple situation in which every individual is the same in the sense. Individual is the same in the sense that it experiences the same force of infection as any other individual, and also it is equally susceptible. In that case, like I said, the size S of the susceptible population can only go down, and the definition of force of infection is given in this equation. So the F is the force of infection, which I abbreviate, as you see. And the product of F and S is the incidence. And then the question, of course, is what is this. And then the question, of course, is what is this force of infection? And Kerma Kemerkendrick in 1927, following IDs really due to ROS, said the following. Well, it's simple. Just accumulate the contribution to the force of infection of those individuals that were infected a while ago. And the while ago is quantified by the tau variable. So tau is time on the clock that starts at the moment that you become infected. And then we just hypothetically. And then we just hypothesize that there is this ingredient of the model, A of tau, a function, that describes the expected contribution to the force of infection at time tau after you became infected. Like I state here also. And that's an input-output way of looking at it. So the infection is an event. It happens at some time and then the clock starts. And the output is distributed over time, is described by this function a of tor. Is described by this function a of tau and is a contribution to the force of infection. And if a parameter is infinite-dimensional, people often talk about it as non-parametric. And the general idea is that the function A should look something as the graph depicted here. So it should be zero for very small values of tau, because then the infection has not built up inside the body to be able to contribute to the force infection. And after a while, home. Infection and after a while, hopefully, the immune system brings the pathogen down in the body and it should become identically zero. So, that's the general form. And later on, I will come to this particular parametric form of the prescribing the function A of tau, where you choose a dimension n and two vectors u and v. v is in the state space of, well, I will use the word state, and you will see in a moment. You will see in a moment. U is in the dual space, in a sense, and sigma is a matrix that generates the state dynamics, as indeed written here. So we imagine here an individual as this input-output generating machine, but we now think in terms of a state representation where V is the initial state. At the moment of becoming infected, your state will be described by V, and the sigma is in this Markovian way. Is in this Markovian way the matrix that specifies the state transitions, and u is the output. And so, in a sense, this is a state representation for the input-output system, but as I will argue later on, this is a suggestive, nice terminology, but it's fake because we don't really model the within-host dynamics where the pathogen and the immune system interact, and that results. system interact and that results in this A of tau. It is a phenomenological approach where you assign labels and then use them. But I will come back to that in a moment. Let's now discuss what you can do by way of analysis with this very simple model in its generality as a function A of tau. There is the disease-free steady state where there is no force of infection, that also F is identically equal to zero. And if you linearize around it, it means that you ignore that the means that you ignore that the susceptible population is going down because of the infection process itself. So you replace in the incidence the S by N, the total population size. And then you get a linear renewal equation, which is exactly the same, apart from notation, as the one studied by Lotka when he studied in the 30s of the last century the age-dependent population growth. And then it was analyzed by Feller and Feller made a lot of theory about this linear. Made a lot of theory about this linear renewal equation that looks like you see written here, and it's a linear equation and it's translation invariant. If you change time, nothing changes. And always in those cases where you have these two properties, linear, translation invariant, you should look for exponential solutions because that's the key characteristic of an exponential function. If you translate, you multiply by a constant. And the parameter labda is, of course, unknown. And if you Unknown, and if you plug it into the equation, you get an equation for Labda, which is the Euler-Notka equation, because Euler had already centuries ago a discrete time variant of this where he found the same equation. And since A is non-negative, if you take a real labda, it's very easy to see that it's a monotone decreasing function. So if you make sure that A is such that it's zero at infinity and it's infinity. And it's infinity at minus infinity, then for sure there will be a real root that is unique, and that is the Lautusian parameter. On the other hand, you can also look at the value of this function at the right-hand side of the Euler-Lotka equation in zero, and that gives you the basic reproduction number. It's by this given by this formula, and it has this interpretation that it's the expected number of secondary cases as a result of one primary case. As a result of one primary case. And then there is the reassuring sign relationship that you have growth in real time, meaning R is positive, if and only if you have growth in this generation perspective, if R not is bigger than one. When we deal with emerging diseases, then usually from data, you get some idea of what the little R is. And what you want to know often is an estimate of R0. Is an estimate of R0 because control often has this feature that it acts multiplicatively on this A of tau, and so you want to know how much should you reduce to get the R0 to below one. And that's a reason to want to know something about R0. And then from the Euler-Lott calculation, you see that the shape of this A of tau, the shape of the graph, really matters a lot. And that is just for. That is just for that. I want to notice this explicitly. This was for the linear situation. Now, if we don't linearize, it is good to write the incidence not as f times s, but as minus s dot, so minus the derivative of s, because then you can integrate this identity over the interval from minus infinity to t and note the integration because this is important, it will come back. Will come back, and then you can work with the fraction susceptible, so the capital S divided by the total population N, or with the cumulative force of infection, which I denote by W. And the two are related by this equation that you, this identity that you see here. And whichever way you prefer, you can write the equation. I do it here in terms of W. You get a scalar new equation again, but this time nonlinear. And the nonlinearity is this. And the nonlinearity is this capital psi, and it's explicitly given by this form that I write here. And please keep this in mind because later on psi will return, but with a different definition. Well, you may forget it, but it's not a big deal, but it's nice if you keep it in mind. A very short description just to tell you that for renewal equations, there is a nice theory about how to think of them. Theory about how to think of them as dynamical systems and also results in the tradition of dynamical systems about stability and all those things. And this is to think about renewal equation, and this is different from the way I should say that Feller thought about it. To think about renewal equation as a delay equation. And then you may wonder, yeah, what is a delay equation? Well, for me, a delay equation is a rule for extending a function of time towards the future. So time has a direction. Future, so time has a direction towards the future on the basis of the past. And to get started, you have to assume that you know the past. And later on, you shift along this extended function, that's the dynamical systems part. But to get started, you have to assume that you know the past. And there are the traditional ways of thinking about delay equations, delay differential equations, but the renewal equations are a bit different. But if you define a delay equation in terms of this rule, they Terms of this rule, they both fit in excellently, and then, like I said, you get a dynamical system by translating along this extended function. So that means even though time is a one-dimensional variable, you should think of time in two ways. One is the t here that defines the time in the dynamical systems framework, and the other is the CETA, which is like the bookkeeping variable about the past. But that's aside. You don't need this for the rest of the story. It's just to tell you. The rest of the story, it's just to tell you there is such a zero. What can you do with this non-linear equation? Well, it's very easy because of this monotonicity of s to take the limit, and you get the so-called final size equation, which is a consistency equation if you look at it probabilistically, because on the left-hand side, you get the fraction that escapes at the end of the outbreak, and at the right-hand side, you get the probability to escape at the end of the outbreak. And here, remarkably, the shape of this function A is Of this function A is irrelevant. You only need the integral. So there are aspects of the course of an epidemic that are dependent on the shape of A, and there are aspects that do not depend on it. Now, what are compartmental models? In work with Hans Mitz and Mats Diedenberg, we have shown that for renewal equations, scalar renewal equations, you get equivalence with an ODE system if and only if the kernel A has The kernel A has exactly this form: that it is a matrix exponential sandwich between two vectors. And if you do that, you can go to the ODE system as follows. You write this cumulative force of infection W as this output factor U that describes the infectiousness as a function of the state variable. So the components of U are the infectiousnesses of the various states. The infectiousnesses of the various states. You say, let it be of the form U times a factor Q of time. And then you just plug in the whole thing in the equation and you do a little bit of manipulation. You find that the Q satisfies this ordinary differential equation, where again, the function C returns, and also, of course, the sigma and the U and the V. And this, I claim, is the integrated form of compartmental. Of compartmental systems in epidemiology, and you will probably not, at least for me, it was a kind of surprising to find this form because I was not used to it. But it took me a little while to understand that this is the way it is. And let me first take the next one. No. So just a detail, this sigma and u. This sigma and u and v, the dimension may be large. I mean, you have nowadays sometimes people who write compartmental systems with 27 components, but you can all fit it in this framework and it has this structure. And to get to the form of a compartmental system that you might be more familiar with, I write the Q and remember the integration step that I had before, and that the W is like cumulative force of infection. W is like cumulative force of infection. You write it as the integral of a variable y. And then the y satisfies this equation now, system of equations where the s also reappears. So like before, the s dt is minus the force of infection times s. The y is like the compartments where the infected individuals can be in. Sigma describes how they change state with what rates. And you enter the system. And you enter the system by along this vector v. And how much enters is given by this incidence f times s. And finally, the f itself is the output vector u applied to y. Example that you are all familiar with, the SEIR model. So here the y variable is the vector of two variables e and i. The sigma description The sigma describes that when you are in E, you go with a certain rate to I, and when you're in I, you move out of this, you go into the R category with a rate alpha. You enter always in E, so the V here is the factor one, zero, and you're only infectious if you are in I, and so the U factor has U factor has a zero component first component. Component, first component, and a non-zero component only in the second variable. So that's a simple example. But like I said, also when you have 27 variables, it will fit in, provided you have this one state at birth, as I call it, or at infection, this V. If you have like sexual transmitted diseases with males and females, you have to have two Vs. So there is actually in that paper with Hans Smetz and Max Wieldenberg, we also With Hans Metz and Mazzinenberg, we also deal with those situations, and so it's a little bit more complicated, but it works essentially the same way. But if there's just one state at infection, then it has exactly this one. Now, much to my annoyance, I must admit, compartmental models are omnipresent. And I always wondered why. Well, one thing I think is it because they are. Because if you enter the field and you see everybody uses compartmental system. Compartmental systems, then of course what you do is use it. And that's a self-reinforcing sociological phenomenon that is hard to eliminate, I think. Then, of course, renewal equations I realize that are unfamiliar, and there is also a certain lack of tools for them. I mentioned this dynamical systems approach, but it's not, I mean, there are not like for ordinary differential equations, there are thousands of text books, and for renewable equations. Books and for renewal equations, there is one or two. That's all. Now, about the lack of tools. Somewhere early in 2020, I was approached by Matthias Kreck, who is a former director of the Oberwolfach Institute. And he was worried about the situation in Germany and wanted to kind of check the calculations done by the Public Health Institute there. And he wanted to work with a discrete time framework because, and I Framework because, and I think he's absolutely right. He argued that this one-day time unit is very natural. First of all, for us humans, time is not homogeneous. It is homogeneous if you go from day to day, but you have this day rhythm, this night-day pattern in our behavior that makes one day really a very natural time unit. Also, the data for COVID came available on a day-by-day basis. On a day-by-day basis. So, if you want to model directly in terms of numbers that also are in the data, then it's very natural. And then, of course, I wanted to convince him that he should use the Kermit-Pekendrick approach. And I started searching in the literature where there was a good formulation of the Kermit-Pakendrick discrete time version, but couldn't find it. And so I sat down and wrote it down myself. And the key point here, first of all, is don't do forward Euler. Don't do forward Euler to discretize a differential equation. Instead, think in terms of the interpretation and write the little s at time one day later as a probability to escape from the infection, given that you already escaped up till the last day. And so that's written here. And this F hat is like the force of infection, but integrated over this unit of one day. And then, like in the curve. And then, like in the Kermit-McKenrick setting with the towel, the force of infection is, of course, by adding contributions of individuals infected some days ago. And a nice thing, of course, is now it is parametric in the sense that it's a function with only finitely many values, and you can have the values of this function as the parameters. So, you have finitely many nice, finite-dimensional parameter space. Parameter space. And we wrote a paper about this. It's published in the PLOS. And we also looked there with Martin Boltzmann Hans Ottmer and Bob Plancket. And we also discussed this phenomenon of when the peak arises and how high it is and whether that depends and how it depends on the precise form of this A of tau. But I don't go into that now. But if you're interested, take a look. I want to say a little bit things. Uh, say a little bit things uh also. Um, I'm sure Gabriela is saying much more about that in one or two days, uh, about this herd immunity threshold, which in the homogeneous case is simply you have to reduce the susceptible population by a factor that compensates for the R0 multiplication factor. So it's one over R0. And a hot topic is what should you do in the heterogeneous case? Should you do in the heterogeneous case when some are more susceptible than others? And I was motivated by work by Gabriela and also Tom Britton and Frank Uliger and Nigel Goldenfeld. And together with Martin Bochma, Danny Chan and Misashinaba, we decided to write a kind of survey paper just to make ourselves familiar with this theory and write it all in one framework and try to see how it fits in with the Kermit McKendrick situation. Situation. So, what we did is assume that there is a trait that takes values in some set omega, which is a measurable space. And then we have the distribution. So the capital N is still the total population size, but the distribution with respect to this trait is described by a measure phi, capital Phi. And here the idea is that by using a measure, which of course a little bit heavier machinery, but the good thing is you can, in one go, capture both the disk. Capture both the discrete situation where you have just finitely many types, traits, whatever you want to call it, and the continuous situation. So it's all in one framework. And the price you pay for this generality is that the function A now has two more arguments. Namely, you have to specify the trait of the individual on which you consider the force of infection, which is X, but also the trait of the individual that contributes to the force of infection at the moment it became infected, which is disk psi. It became infected, which is this psi. And so, no, not yet, but I will soon. Well, independently, you have to be very careful what you mean by that. But yes. So here, no, everything is allowed. It's a function of three variables. And there's general theory. You can do these things about R0 and little R and many final size. Final size equation is actually nice. But part of the size equation is actually nice to think about. So there's many, many things, and we will say something about that in that paper. But here, I want to concentrate on the case of separable mixing, which is a kind of independence assumption. But the independence is as follows. You assume that the likelihood, say, of contact, that's the easiest way to express it in words, depends on the two traits of the individuals involved in an independent manner. So there is no assortative mating or whatever you want to call it, it's independent of the You want to call it is independent of the two traits involved in the meeting. And then you get in this capital A two functions a of x and another function of tau xi. But I will go one step further and assume that the tau and xi also have like independent influence on this second factor. So then I have three functions, and this makes life very easy because now we can work with such a little s as we did before. As we did before, but it has an x-dependent weight factor A of X. And then, of course, there is the W, which is the cumulative force of infection. And I like you to observe that if you know one of these at some time, one of these S of T and X, you know all the others because they are proportional because of this particular equation they satisfy. And so for the W, you get again a scalar normal. You get again a scalar non-linear renewal equation, but now the definition of psi has changed. And you see how the ingredients of the model, the C, the A, and the distribution phi, they act together in the definition of this psi. And so that's the very simple way, if you are willing to make this independence assumption, how heterogeneity can be captured by just changing the nonlinear function. By just changing the nonlinear function. And the nice thing is, of course, that, oh, let me first make this remark. It's a side remark again, but if all the heterogeneity is in infectiousness, you can average it out always. And that's illustrated here technically, but also in our book with Hans Hesterbeck and Tom Britton, we emphasize that very much. And I think it is important to keep this in mind that susceptibility is completely different. Susceptibility is completely different from infectiousness in this respect. So, this is what I said here. Now, how about this herd immunity threshold? You have this effective reproduction number that you get by linearizing at the present situation. So, rather than having the derivative of psi in zero, you do it in the current value of w. And that gives you the effective. And that gives you the effective reproduction number. So that is the SOAD experiment where you imagine that the status of the population remains as it is now. And then you compute how many expected secondary cases will one primary case produce in that situation. And then the Hertz immunity threshold is by putting this equal to one, and then you get an equation for W and given the monitor. And given the monotonicity, you can solve it. And so you find a solution for W, and then you can see what is the fraction of the population that is still susceptible at that time. This is this little S with a wiggle above it. You have a formula for that. Now, there will come now a lot of formulas. Don't pay too much attention to the special form. Just keep in. My point is that you can find formulas for them. Special case. Omega from zero. Omega from zero to infinity, then we may as well take the trait to be the a itself. So you have axis x, and let's make it such that the mean value is one for as a normalization. And already Novozolov observed that if you take the gamma distribution for phi, you can do lots of things explicitly. And that's because it has a density. Because it has a density which you can Laplace transform, and then you get a very nice formula that you can differentiate, and so on. So you can manipulate easily in that case. And the one and only parameter after I have made the mean equal to one is this p, which is, so the variance is one over p. And this is the function psi in that case. And it depends on what you take for this. Remember, the c is. For this, remember the C is the infectiousness. So the A of X is now X. So the X is really the susceptibility. But if the infectiousness is the same for all individuals, you get a different exponent than when it is actually proportional to the susceptibility, which it is if you think of sexual transmitted diseases and sexual activity, then it's very natural to take C of ψ equal to xi. C of xi equal to psi. And so the one thing I want to stress here is that this herd immunity threshold does not depend on which particular B of tau you take. So it's the same no matter what the infectiousness as a function of tau is. And you can compute it explicitly. And it has these power representations. But now I want to come back to what I said before about compartment. Back to what I said before about compartmental systems, I did the reduction to this scalar renewal equation in the renewal framework. But now, when I assume that this B has this special form that gives you a compartmental system, I can, after this, go back again to another compartmental system. So, my point is that this is a systematic way of deriving compartmental systems that incorporate heterogeneity in a full general In a full generality, so without specifying what compartmental system exactly you look at. And you see here, you get this equation for Q, which is the same as it was before, but with this psi now with a different definition, and you have the U and the V. Sorry, no, that's the same. So, but the Psi has just a different definition. So, the only thing in this integrated form, which I think is kind of nice, in the integrated form of the compartmental system, Of the compartmental system. If you want to incorporate this separable heterogeneity, the only thing you have to take is to change the psi in this manner. And so, in particular, if you have the gamma distribution, you have an explicit formula. You can then wonder, of course, maybe you do, how does it look if you go to the ordinary form in which you are more used to? And then normalization matters. And let me normalize such. And let me normalize such that A in X, there is some X bar, which I consider like the representative case. And like in the gamma distributed case, you can take the point one and you normalize it in this way. And then it looks like this. And you have only to look at one of these little S variables because the rest follows because of this special relationship between the differential equations. So you have, again, also. So you have, again, also here, the same form as you had before, but the psi prime is the new element in there. And like I said, sometimes you can explicitly calculate it. Here is a formula for it. This is how it looks. In general, this is what the total susceptible fraction is. And here's an example with just two types, just to illustrate that it also works for this discrete time. Also works for this discrete time. Assume that you have this compartmental system that you are very familiar with and you have studied it already for four years. And now you want all of a sudden to understand what if a fraction of the population is actually vaccinated and another fraction is not. And vaccination, the effect is captured by two epsilons: one, the reduction in susceptibility and the other reduction in infectiousness. And then you have this formula explicitly for. are explicitly for psi prime and you have your compartmental system with the heterogeneity taken into account. In the gamma distribution case, you can, rather than working with the representative S in X bar, you can work with the total fraction still susceptible and you have an ODE system and this is the formula. Let me summarize. First of all, and it's so It's so irritating that so many people think that the Kermit-McKendrick 1927 model is about the SIR componental system. It is not. It is about a renewal equation. Secondly, the kernel in that renewable is the essential ingredient for a mathematical model of the spread of an infectious disease in this outbreak situation. And it has this drawback of being infinite-dimensional, but like I emphasized, if we take discrete I emphasized if we take discrete time, it becomes all of a sudden finite-dimensional. And I claim that compartmental models, so I'm mixing up two stories in some sense, which is not a good idea in general in a talk. On the one hand, I want to argue against compartmental models. On the other hand, I wanted to show you that you can, using this way by way of the abstract renewal equation, you can very easily describe variant or derive variants of. Variant or derived variants of compartmental models. Anyhow, I think they missed the point that the Sojourn times in general are not exponentially distributed. It is this aspect that creates that for an A given in this form of a compartmental model, you will never have that it is zero for small value of tau, never that it is zero for large values of tau. It will never be that case. And then my story about this abstract. And then my story about this abstract variant was to show you that bookkeeping, in some sense, in terms of this kernel, is so much easier than in terms of the rate coefficients in ODE models. So if you want for more complicated models, I think it often pays to first formulate it in renewal equation and even then perhaps go to ordinary differential equations if you must. Now, this was my original next. My original next slide, but yesterday on the plane, I thought maybe I should make a little bit stronger statement and be a little bit more provocative. So in order to prepare for the next pandemic, I think we first of all should go back to 1927. And by this, I mean that I think that modelers should train themselves in incorporating in their sophisticated models, taking all kinds of heterogeneity and contact structure. Of heterogeneity and contact structure into account, integrate in there this idea of Kermik and McKendrick that we should describe infectiousness directly in terms of this function of the time elapsed since you became infected of the infection age. I think that is so much more powerful than all these indirect ways and cumbersome ways in terms of matrices and vectors, etc. So, first of all, use it in the model formulation, but then I think it's It in the model formulation, but then I think it's very, very essential to also develop software for Bayesian parameter estimation of this function, of this ingredient, based on the combination by combining physiological information, so medical information about how long patients are shedding virus, etc. And at the same time, also at this higher population level, the incidence data and combining these things in a big And combining these things in a Bayesian framework. And I think it Bayesian is very natural for that. You have some prior ideas about it, and you get data available, and then you improve, etc. So that's the thing I want to stress. Now, for COVID, there have been a small number of cases where this has been done. In particular, Nigel Goldefeld and the group around him has done this. Then there is Sophonia and Ellison in France. Ellison in France, and there is Creck and Schultz in Germany, but they can be counted on the fingers of one hand and compare that to the thousands and thousands of papers using compartmental models. So my wishful thinking, in a sense, is that by the time the next pandemic arrives, it will be the other way around. That by that time, the compartmental models will be at the brink of extinction. Models will be at the brink of extinction, and everybody uses A of Tor. Now, this is, of course, a personal opinion. It's open for discussion, so I stop lecturing. Thank you for your attention.
