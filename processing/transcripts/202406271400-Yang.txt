Thank you for the introduction. Let me know if I'm not writing large enough for anyone to see or if I'm not speaking loud enough if I remember to. Reject. Okay, so the title is a real HKR stands for Hock Shield Constant. Is that Rosenberg era? Okay, but we'll start writing HKR or maybe HKR in what follows. Okay, so before I start talking about anything HPR related, I know we've seen HPR in at least Noah's talk. In at least Noah's talk. But I've really enjoyed this workshop because I think I've learned a lot of things. I kind of come more so from the K-theory slash homotopy side. But I've been learning a lot of things. Okay, so I wanted to hopefully take some of the things that I've learned about, newly learned about how what I'm working on is maybe related to some stuff I didn't know about before this week, and to put it all into sort of. Put it all into sort of put those connections out there. So I'm going to start with that, and then we're going to kind of mosey our way onto what does HKR mean without the without the Blackboard bold and then HKR with Blackboard bold. Okay, so maybe what should I call this? Context, maybe? Okay. Or at least this is sort of really learned context for me. So, okay, then, oh goodness, you know what? I read this and I did not record the attribution. Okay, so someone should, so if someone knows who it is, then you should just tell me. Okay, so if I have, if A is a central simple algebra over a field. Over a field. We've seen a lot of these this week. Okay, then there's the following correspondence. So then the Brouwer class of A is two torsion if and only if A admits an involution. Of the first kind. Okay, which is just an involution of A, which fixes F pointwise. Okay. And okay, yeah, and there are some, you know, there's some generalization. And there are some, you know, there's some generalizations as well. Where F is replaced by some ring. And however, what happens is instead of asking for, okay, we have some sort of generalization, except now on the right-hand side, instead of having the A admits an evolution of the first kind, That A admits an evolution of the first kind, we need to replace A by something else in this Brouwer class. Okay, so when you say fixes F pointwise, you mean that the elements of F are the only things that are fixed. You mean that the fixed sub-algebra is F. Is that right? I think so. Can someone tell me if I'm wrong? I couldn't hear the answer, but I can't hear what anybody else in the room is saying, except for you. I was just saying that, no, it's not necessary that everything, that the only thing fixed is that it's necessary that. necessary that so so i mean so so the so the condition is that the involution of the first kind that to the involution of the first kind the fixed the fixed subalgebra is is f so a a upper sigma is equal to f yeah yeah so sigma restricted to f is the identity then it wasn't that equal to anything oh just that it oh but so it could be that the whole involution is the identity for example uh no it could be any a No, that would be any A. That would be any A. No, an involution is an anti-automarkism. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Okay. So it has to. Okay. Involution. Okay. I see. All right. As opposed to the second kind meaning that it's non-trivial on it. Oh, okay. Sorry. Yeah, I just don't know the definitions. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. Well, thank you. No, no, no. That's great. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. You want new to me as well. Okay. Right. Right. Okay, right. Right, so what are they saying? Right, there's a generalization, I guess, due to Saltman. Okay, which says that, you know, if I if I ask for, if f is then replaced by a ring, then I should ask, then on this right-hand side here, I should, I need to replace A by something else and it's Bauer class. Okay, it's an involution. An involution scientist. Okay. Now, right, so like has already been mentioned, right, we're talking about an involution of the first kind, which suggests that there are also other types of involutions. Okay, so let's talk about what happens with involutions of the second kind. So if f over k is some separable. Separable quadratic extension of fields. Okay, then a theorem of Albert. Okay, I can't quite tell what I wrote. This is an R. I'm sorry, folks. I think I scribbled the name here in my notes. This is an R. This guy's last name starts with an R. I'm very sorry. And Charlotte? Okay. Which says that if A is a central simple algebra over K, okay, then Then A has an involution of the second kind. Okay, what does that mean? That means I have some involution. Of A, which is some automorphism of, or sorry, not automorphism, an equivalence from A to A up, which squares the identity. However, I'm not going to ask for my map here, my equivalence just to fix F, or K, sorry, doesn't necessarily fix Fixed. Okay. Okay. Then A has an involution of the second kind, if and only if. Well, so I have A here in the Brouwer class, or in the Brouwer group of K, but I can forget. I can forget A and just remember, wait. Oh, wait. I have K and algebra books function. Okay, right, sorry. Okay, so then if I take the co-restriction of A, which now lands in the Brower group of F. Oh, so this is so this guy's is an element here and the condition is that this guy is the class of zero. Okay all right so now I kind of want to make a hard left turn and and mention not Not power groups, but something about K-theory. Okay, so right, as we've seen, I think a little bit earlier before, right, what is so what is K-theory? So I'm gonna be a little bit vague, let X be scheme or some sort of geometric object. If you prefer to think about topological K-theory instead, that's great. You know, X can be something. Okay, so if, so what is K-theory? K-theory says. Theory, K-theory says, well, let me start with vector bundles, like some category of vector bundles on A, or finite dimensional, finite dimensional. Okay. And maybe I also want to consider, if I want to produce just K0, right, I just consider isomorphism classes and do some kind of group inflation or right sort of. right sort of um i i uh take you know i i impose some kind of equivalence relation which takes short exact sequences to uh sums okay um and if i want to produce higher k groups i sort of remember automorphisms of vector as well okay so anyways uh what i just wanted to say is this is kind of what we start with the starting point um but on the other hand you could imagine uh that we might care about not just vector buttons About not just vector bundles, but vector bundles with some additional structure. Okay, so on the other hand, we might want to consider a vector bundle, okay, with, let me call my generic vector model V, okay, with a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form, okay, which I can think of as a map from V turns or V. As a map from V transfer V to O of X, or equivalently, right, some map, some equivalence from V to V dual, okay, which has, which satisfies some conditions. Okay. And if I start with, I have this question here. And if I start with, and sorry, let me back up. Right, so for vector bundles, right, we talked without this additional structure where we said, okay, we have short exact. Structure where we said, okay, we have short exact sequences, we can add things, et cetera. Okay, but over here, we can also take direct sums of vector bundles of symmetric bilinear form, et cetera. So we still have this structure on here coming from, for instance, direct sum, which means that we can apply some sort of similar group completion procedure to produce an abelian group. Okay, and and furthermore, actually, okay, but but the the theory that we're after okay is called a growth and dequid theory growth and bequid okay or g w okay so this is my input okay and what happens what is my output a theory is kind of But make theory kind of a spectrum. Okay. But not only do we have these two objects, whatever these are, right? These sort of two collections of things, but we have sort of relationships between these two objects, right? They don't exist sort of sort of in just purely independently. For instance, if I had a vector bundle w over x, okay, then w. Okay, then W plus W dual has a canonical symmetric bilinear form, which is evaluation. Yeah? Okay. Or really, it's like, oh, something like this. Okay. And on the other hand, maybe I should have started, maybe I should have started with this. Okay, if I have a vector bundle with some form on it, then I can just forget the form. Yeah? Okay. So I also have some sort of forget. Forget. Okay. And moreover, I also have an action of a cyclic group of order two here. I can take the v dual. Okay. So I'm just saying, okay, here I have all of this structure in this picture. And now if we go, now what do I want to do? I want to kind of go back to this, do these. To these pictures, and say, okay, well, what's going on here? This is saying, right, so if we look at these two results, what this is saying is, okay, well, maybe I should consider, you know, not just, it would be helpful to not just consider, you know, one field at a time, but to consider some sort of systems of data relating these fields. Okay, and what does this look like? Let's see, I have K including into F, right? Into F, right? And okay, well, this is a quadratic extension. So I have some action of a cyclic group of order two. Oh, shoot. I usually call the Lucian sigma, but maybe I shouldn't call this sigma here. Okay, so I have some this. Oh, sorry. Oh, shit. Thank you. Right. Okay, so I have my Galois group acting over here. And right, I have. Z mod Q. And right, so I have this action. And so everything over here is a map of fields, map of rings. Okay, but also I have another map of abelian groups going in the opposite direction, just some kind of a transfer map. So I can take a little x, and you know, if I have a one gamma, and take this to x plus gamma x. This is to x plus gamma x. Okay, so okay, so now if I just sort of stare at this picture, you can notice that it's actually quite similar. Sort of the data here, right, is very similar to this data over here. Okay, so what I want to do, or sort of for the, so in the next part of this talk, okay, what I want to do is I want to say, oh, well, let's consider this data systematically and sort of do derived algebra, derived algebra, homological algebra, et cetera. Algebra, et cetera, with sort of all of this data together. Okay, but let me be more precise about that. Okay. So definition. Ah, right. So let me click some notation. So I'm used to writing C2 first to click group of order two, but then someone told me that. But then someone told me that the only homotopy theorists do this. So let me just make sure that there's no confusion here. Order two. Okay, great. Right, so a C2 backy functor. Now there are Now, there are a couple different versions of this. Okay, so in abelian groups or R modules, where R is some commutative ring, or a spectra, if you are so inclined. Okay, is well, let's just take this data and x minimize. Let's just take this data and axiomatize it. Roughly, it's a diagram which looks like this. I have two objects. Let me write M sort of for the end for the whole thing. And okay, some action. I have two maps: restriction and the transfer. And the transfer. Right, so, right, so I have a diagram like so. I'm going to ask for right, it's just a symbol, right. However, it's trying to sort of suggest or, I don't know, evoke an idea that we should sort of think of this as being the fixed points of this action. I mean, it doesn't. Of this action. I mean, it doesn't necessarily have to be, right? You could just, this could just be like zero or something, right? But the kind of idea is once we've passed to some sort of homotopy coherent lamb, okay, then strict fixed points doesn't make sense anymore, right? Because everything is only up to homotopy. Okay, then we have to add the strict fixed points back then. That's an E, yeah, for like a trivial subgroup. Yeah, okay, sorry. Okay, right, so I have a diagram like so. Okay, I'm going to ask for these maps to be maps in whatever category I started it in. And I want to ask for one more condition, okay, which is that if I take restriction composed with the transfer, that this is multiplication by two. Oh, oh, yes, you're right. You're absolutely right. You're absolutely correct. Eventually, I will ask for my MaciePunkers to be honest. Yeah. It does. It does. Cool. Yeah, very exciting. Yeah, very exciting. Okay, okay. Where was I? Okay, great. So some examples. So if I have any, if A is some abelian group or some R module or a spectrum, well, I can always, for any diagram, I can always just take some, or and some object in whatever category, I can just take. object in whatever category, I can just take a constant diagram. Yeah, right. I can take some, I can take a diagram where everything here is a and all of these maps. Oh, sorry, I guess not the transfer. Okay, but I can ask for the restriction and the C2 action to be the identity and then the transfers. Okay, so I can take constant diagram okay, and I'm going to name this a underline. A underline. However, right, I can, this is zeroth example, but right, if I had something like this, or I guess, I think I'm just going to go over here. I'm just going to write one of Macy of a C2 Mac. Ah, that is a great question. So, right, let's see. It's let's see, I can take. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. Right, so it is a Machiefunctor in abelian groups. You're right that I could consider an abelian group as a sort of spectrum with a single homotopy group, et cetera. Single homotopy group, etc. Right, there are like relationships there. Um, I know there's more structure here given by the sort of multiplication, which we haven't talked about yet, but that's what I want to talk about next. Okay, okay, so uh she um so A C2 Cambora functor. Let me call this. What do I want to call this? R maybe? Okay. Is a C2 Mackey functor in abelian groups. Okay, plus the data of a map of sets. Of sets. Okay, from R superscript E, okay, to R superscript C2. Oh, I should have given these names, huh? Okay, so we typically call this sky the underlying. And then we call this sky just names. C2 fixed ones. Okay, so I have a Okay, so I have a map of sets, capital, rename this capital N, okay, from the underlying to the fixed points, so that each of these guys are let me this. So if I just remember the restriction map and the C. And the C2 action over here, that this is a diagram of commutative rings. Okay. And I'm also going to ask for n to behave like a multiplicative transfer. Okay, so I have that n. So I have that n of the restriction is equal to squaring. Question? I mean, can I just view them as from other maxi categories within this? Yes. Like, um, I'm sure it's like the span. Okay, sorry, it's like the span of category of like finite C2 sets. Yeah, we can talk more about that later, but this sort of this can be finicky, so great, huh? Yes, yes, serving, okay. Okay. Go over here. Okay. Okay, so there's something else. I just want to introduce it now. It might seem a little bit odd, but we're going to want to use this later. Okay, which is that. Okay, which is that, ah, right, so actually, like we saw in just the talk just before this one, right, we sort of have an analogy between, right, sorry, let me, I'm getting ahead of myself. Okay, so something that we'll need later is yes, yes, thank you. Okay, okay, let me say a few things. Okay, actually, I want to make a remark about Tambara functors. Okay, so for mapping functors, right, I said I could start with, you know, Belan groups, our module spectra. Okay, and I could And I can talk about this diagram. Okay, but if I wanted to do something, if I wanted to talk about spectra, or yeah, it's sort of Tambara functors with values and spectra, then we could say, okay, well, I have a C2 Tambara functor. Okay, and then I get to here, and it's a little bit unclear. And then when I get to asking for this map, N, a little bit unclear what I should replace this by. I should replace this by. Yeah, what I should replace this by. And it turns out that there is a sort of suitable homotopy coherent notion, a sort of generalization of this guy, but it's really complicated, so I don't want to get into what the definition is. Let me just say that there is one, and we can talk about what that is after if you're curious. There is a homotopy coherent analog. Of C2 and VAR functors where we can take abelian grips and then we can replace these by spectra. Place by spectra. Okay, but this is at the cost. But this is at the cost all this C2 infinity algebras. Okay. And what we want to do is we want to replace A map like so. For this guy is the Hill Hopkins Ravenel norm. And we ask for additional coherences. Okay, but I'm not going to tell you what those coherences are at this moment. Coherences are at this moment. Okay, right. And this, what is this? I want this to be, and it makes sense now for this to be a map of spectra, or map of, yes, C2 mapping functors. Okay. So here I don't have to talk about underlying say underlying. Okay. And just Okay. Um and just for later um a V2 space okay is a diagram of topological spaces. Okay, I really want here's maybe diagram of infinity group voice. I want to consider everything sort of up to up to clear and homotopy or up to homotopy spaces. Puppy spaces where I have X for some sort of collection of data, like so. Okay, so here, instead of asking for a transfer, I'm just going to ask for a restriction. Okay, so for instance, If so, how is this related to everything we've been talking about? So, if, for instance, I consider, ah, okay. So, so what I can do is I can consider S1. Will we regard that as a question? Yeah. I'm sorry, just like I'm trying to start at first, like about when you're defining the. When you're defining the the spin up above, is that going to our C or what what are we or what I'm sorry just up above yeah um this map yeah where is that going? What is R oh right so sorry so R you should think of as being some um underlying no R is a whole No, R is a whole diagram. R is a diagram, but now I'm allowing everything to be a spectrum. Yeah. Yes, exactly. Right. So this is actually a natural transformation of diagrams that look like that. And the values are kind of maybe a little bit mysterious, or I haven't told you what those values are here. But yeah, this is a natural transformation. Okay, I'll process that. Yeah. I know. Yes, yeah, okay, yeah, that's a great. Yeah, yeah. So if I sort of, if I only look at the sort of this underlying piece, okay, then what, then if I take this and I look at the underlying, then what that looks like is R tensor, which is our R E tensor R E, okay, mapping to R E. To Re okay, but the subtlety is: okay, you can say, okay, well, isn't that just like some multiplication map? Okay, but in here, right, I had this sort of given C2 action, and now I'm going to ask for C2 to act diagonally on this guy. So it's going to act sort of on each of these pieces and it's going to swap them. This is the action is like R tensor S goes to like gamma S tensor gamma R. Okay, and I ask for an equivariant map, like so. Yeah, thank you. Where was I? Right. So now what I want to do is let me consider S1 as sort of being the unit complex numbers. Okay, this is an action via complex conjugation. Okay, and I have, and the fixed points, plus or minus one, include like so. Okay, so this is an example of a C2 space. Okay, and I'm going to call this S. Yeah, S because sphere, sigma because action. Yes, yes, yes, thank you. Yeah, so what do I okay? I'm gonna be a little vague here so that we have factorization where this actually lifts up to the homotopy fixed points. Once. Okay. So, why am I introducing all of this funalism? Okay, so, okay, so, but these don't quite exist in a vacuum yet. So, maybe remark. Okay, if X S C 2. X S E 2 space. Okay, then what I can do is I can take its homology or its cohomology, okay, and that's going to be some Machu functor in, or I can sort of, I can take its homology or cohomology and then, and then ask, and then sort of force it, I can sort of produce that cohomology as a Machu functor in abelian groups, in graded abelian groups. Okay. Um acquires we equivariant cohomology acquires the structure of A C2 Aki Gunter. Another trace that's that factorization as well. For the trace part of it, you need that characterization you wrote there. You wrote there. For the trace, actually, okay, so actually, what I'm going to do here is I'm actually just going to sort of freely freely produce something that has a trace map. You're about to do it. I'm saying it can be done. It can be done. We can talk about this later. I think the property that's a satisfactory thing is between the resmap and C2AP has to be relevant to the trace map, right? So, what's going to happen is I'm going to add in, I'm going to add in the trace freely. So that, yeah. So, yeah, it's the fixed. Okay. Yeah, we can talk more about it later. It's just the formulas get really kind of ugly. Okay, but we can do this. Okay. And right, so there's an analogy here, okay, which is that, right, so as spaces, you could say R to DZ. R to UZ as maybe C2 spaces are to, okay, so what is this? This is modules over the Eilenberg-McLean spectrum of Z in spectra. I know that's our favorite definition of DZ. Okay, but here I can take modules over the constant mackerefunctor of Z and maybe consider my lump. You can maybe consider I'm a Brook McLean guy, so consider it as a C2 machine functor in spectra. Okay, yeah, so this is so, right, these two definitions kind of sort of an analog, what am I trying to say? Yeah, these you should think about these as sort of equivariant generalizations of these classical correspondence between some sort of unstable guys, stable changes, right? I should have brought my watch back. How am I doing on time? Okay. Well, cool. All right. So now that we've introduced, we've given you a whirlwind tour of equivariant homotopy theory, I want to go back and explain, yeah, yeah, and use this to fill out this picture. To fill out this picture. Okay, right, so we've seen not just K-theory, but right, we've seen some objects related to K-theory, you know, some techniques to compute K-theory, and how does that work? We said, okay, it's a trace theory. Trace theories are, you know, some other kind of functor defined on, you know, themes. Okay, and a trace theory is some kind of an is some other functor which Of an is some other functor which receives a natural transformation from K-theory. Yeah, right. So we've seen topological Hochschield homology. Okay, and we've also seen Hochschield homology. These should be relative to a base lighting that for a moment. Okay, and what Okay, but what's so good about these? I mean, I could just, I mean, it's not just any functor and any natural transformation. The trace series have sort of two good W. Okay, so trace theories have two good properties, okay, which the first Good properties, okay, which the first of which is that these maps, these maps are good approximations. Good approximation. Okay, results. Okay, and so a theorem that says that, you know, this trace map here is, or one of these trace maps is a good approximation is due to a dundas good really McCarthy. Okay. And not only are these guys good approximations, okay, but they're also computable. Okay, so what do I mean by computable? So one version of this says, okay, well, oxygen homology, A over K, okay, can be tackled by a homological algebra. Can be tackled by a homological algebra. I could write this as some co-limit of some cyclic bar construction. Okay. Okay, but this isn't, right, this is kind of a lie. This isn't really sort of a good way to compute Hochschield homology. Okay, but we can do better. Something a little better is, okay. Little better is okay. If A is some ring, and A is a smooth A algebra. Oh, and this is the original HKR theorem or something along those lines. Okay, it says that there exists a filtration on the Hoch-Shield homology of A over K, okay, so that Okay, so that or where it's associated graded of this filtration, okay, is given by the pieces of the Durham copper. Omega star A over K, right, which is the starth edge power of differential forms. Okay. All right. All right. However, we can do, we can actually do a little better, right? So box shield homology here. I'm trying to remember if I think you wrote down this formula, yeah? Or maybe over the sphere, right, for A center S1. Okay, great. All right, so Noah already wrote this down, which means that I can just assume you know what it means. Which means that I can just assume you know what it means. No, okay, I'm kidding. Okay, but we shouldn't, okay, but but what am I trying to say? What I want to say is, okay, because a, or this functional homology is defined by a universal property, okay, we can actually sort of using using structure on here kind of sheds more light on this theorem. You know what? You know what? I'm running out of space here. So let me see if I can finish the table without using up all four boards. That's why I put it in the board here. Yeah. I have to keep it on. I haven't completely done. Everything should be derived, tensor colour. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Sorry, I'm not sure if I answered your question or speaking out loud. Okay. All right. All right. So continuing. Okay. So let's look at this for a second. So what is oh, oh, I'm sorry. Let me. There's one thing that I did want to say actually. So in this special. want to say actually so in this special case okay their star is just going to be its star homotopy group this is h h star of a over k okay so okay so if i have my functional homology okay then and it has an action of s1 well this guy is an a module okay in particular it's a k module In particular, it's a K module. Okay, so this actually turns out to not just be, you know, it's an action of some topological group, okay, but this upgrades to an action of chains on S1 with coefficients in k. Okay, that I have this module structure. Okay, or okay, if I apply some duality, et cetera, okay, then I can consider this as a co-action, a co-module over coutines. Over proteins. Okay, we're actually, you know, okay, great. So I have this action on the level of the derived category. Okay, and then if I pass the homotopy groups, I can make star here, and this becomes cohomology. Okay. But what does this mean? Why did I do this? Okay, well, what's the cohomology of this guy? If I consider this as some graded object, that's a copy of K in degrees. That's a copy of K in degree zero. Okay, and it's a copy of K, let's see, in homological degree minus one. Okay, but if I use the consider the grading coming from cohomology, then it's in grading degree plus one. Okay, so okay, why have I done this? So having a co-action of this guy exactly means means that I have a map of k modules, yeah, from h star minus one to h star, okay, which because star ranges over all integers, okay, I can sort of consider, I can sort of apply d multiple times, okay, and I have that this map squares to zero. This is a differential, and in fact, Differential. And in fact, this using that identification under the HKR theorem, this recovers the DeRam differential. Once you sort of unravel the conditions. Okay, so right. So this is what I'm going to say. Right. So using this, so. Using this, so we can actually do, nowadays or whatever, we can do somewhat, we can use this structure, yeah, to say more about this filtration. Okay, so so great, great. So a sort of modern or slightly more modern version of the Modern version of the HTR theorem due to, so there were different versions due to Rexet and Molino-Sfravalo. So when? I'm more familiar with the former, so I'm just going to sort of roughly try to indicate the statement in Arpon Raxit's paper. Okay, and there's a sort of slightly different version that I won't discuss, but I just want to. That I won't discuss, but I just want to include the reference. Okay, then it says that there exists a functorial assignment. Okay, which takes a A derived K algebra. A derived algebra over K, like so. Okay. Two. Hawthield homology of A over K with a filtration. Yeah. Okay. So a filtered gadget. Um don't want that to be too messy. Oxfield homology. Within HCAR filtration. Okay, and what type of object is this guy? Okay, this should be this is a filtered derived. Derived algebra. I'm running out of space, so I'm just going to continue over here. In co-modules over, let's see, co-chains on S1 with coefficients in K equipped with its possible function, or I guess Wi-Fi tower. Okay. Okay. Okay. You know what? I committed to the table, so we're sticking with it. All right. So it's just a crazy thing. Exactly. Mm-hmm. Exactly. Yeah. Right, right. So A is just something. Okay. But so that if I take the associated graded on this guy, okay, that this is functorially equivalent to the direct. equivalent to the derived Rome complex over K with this. Okay, but what is this equivalent saying? Well, okay, if I take a graded, if I take this guy and I take its associated graded, it's not just some graded derived algebra, but it's going to be. Graded derived algebra, but it's going to be an algebra in co-modules with the associated graded of this guy. Yeah? Okay, so this is going to be some like differential graded, some kind of equivalence of differential graded objects. Okay, and if I just take the underlying derived algebra of this filtered guy, I recover. I recover the actual homology that I started with. Okay, great. Right. And so I know, I think, or Noah's probably already mentioned this before in his talk, but I just wanted to iterate, reiterate, right? Like, so here what happens is this is kind of an, I don't know, actually, I don't know. I can't decide if it's a miracle or happy accident or something. If it's a miracle or happy accident or something, but this is kind of an this is a sort of a computation, and then functoriality is kind of not obvious from here, or it's kind of an accident, okay? But functoriality here is really something you really need if you want to perform descent arguments, et cetera. And we know that, and we've seen in earlier talks, for instance, what Elder mentioned, right, that having sort of additional Dimension: right, that having sort of additional structure, filtrations, and whatnot is really helpful. Okay, okay, so in the last couple minutes, I want to talk about what this picture looks like for growth and digit theory. Okay. Okay, great. Right, so what is, so if I take GW, so if I just take this guy, this collection of objects, and I perform some sort of group completion or whatnot, okay, then. Or whatnot, okay, then okay, then I just get a spectrum. Okay, however, if I remember sort of all of these compatibilities, all of these relationships, then what I end up getting is I have KGW, okay, actually maps to K-theory, okay, but then it actually goes, I have some map going the other direction, okay, and I also have some sort of duality on K-theory, okay, so what this ends up being is this is some. ends up being is this is some kind of a machu functor d2 machie functor in spectra okay this is uh d2 machie in spectra okay the gw is what lives oh oops i erased it uh is the fixed points okay but if i consider all of this data assembled together we name this real k-theory Okay. Real. Okay. Similarly, we have some trace theories, okay, which we just very creatively creatively, what we just did is took everything and appended an R to it. Okay, so T H. Yes. You got H. Okay. Okay, so what is THR? Okay, this is real THH. All right, what am I saying? I'm saying that there exist, trace theories, there exist real or sort of C2 analogs, equivariant analogs of this picture, sort of two, sort of sort of, yeah, yeah, sort of lifting over to this side, okay, and also real she'll. also real epistemology. Okay, and sorry if I suddenly stopped giving attributions. Okay, right, so this is due to Walt Madsen. Okay, and this is among other folks. Oh, my touria. At least okay. All right. So similarly, we have good approximation results over here. This is due to Harpaz Nicolaus. Okay. And right. And as far as computability goes, okay. Computability goes, okay, what do we have here? So, similarly, we have sort of description as some sort of simplicial, some geometric realization of a simplicial object. Okay, and this one is actually not very, it's not very pleasant. I don't know. It's just like some, it's like some big, I mean, it's, it's, it's not simpler than this, for sure. That's for sure. Okay, and I have, okay, I don't remember. There's like a bunch of, there's a bunch of norms in here. There's a bunch of norms in here, and there's also just copies of A. Okay. This is huge. Okay. But what I have been thinking about, what I want to do is I want to talk about a sort of real version of HGAR story. And let me just start over there. Just start over there. Okay. Ah, okay. So you want to say? Okay. Um, here I am. This perhaps deserves to be in quotes. Okay. Is that if I start with some K, which is a discrete ring, discrete commutative ring, okay, then I can associate to this guy my constant C2 machine functor value k. Okay, then first of all, First of all, so first of all, what is so first of all, I want to, so Hawksheal homology, talks about Hochschield homology are defined in a bunch of different contexts. Yeah, E infinity algebras, whatnot. Okay, what I'm interested in is a sort of more strictly commutative, sort of derived and varied algebras and not sort of E infinity guys. Okay, so first off, Okay, so first off, there exists a category of not necessarily connective derived involutive algebras. I'm going to write my d alge sigma over k. I want to think of as, yeah, some sort of derived version of Tambara functors. A little different, but okay, we can. A little different, but okay, we can. That's a good zeroth-order approximation. Okay, they're this suitable notions of a cotangent complex Duram forms or Duram complex four is derived. In polluted algebras. Okay. Let me name this. Okay. Um and there exists a A functorial filtration on the real Hochfield homology of A over K, where A is some derived involuted algebra. Okay. With associated graded, this sort of involuted version of my cotangent comments. Of my cotangent complex, or sorry, of my Durham complex. Right. Sorry, I think we should stop now. Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much for the talk. Any questions? So how does this uh real version of the RAM context go? If my reading is that it is right, so something, oh right, so I could take you know anything here, right, this like these diagrams or whatever, and I could just ask, okay, what's the underlying object? Right, what happens that just the sort of piece was superscript. That's just the sort of piece with superscript E. And what happens is if I do any of this and I take the underlying guy, it recovers this story. And then on fixed points, a little bit more complicated, but it's not going to be sort of widely different. It's not going to be widely different. So just like, again, from like a philosophical point of view, should I imagine that this theorem that's down there in the corner is saying There in the corner is saying that the DRAM complex is really not the right thing. This is the right thing. This filtered functional homology doohickey is what we should have been thinking about all along. Yeah, that is one way to think about it. It's well, what do we want to say? It depends on what you mean by right thing, I guess. What do I think the right thing is? Oh, what do I think the right thing is? Um, that was pretty good. I'll go with this. Yeah, but people didn't know that this thing, yeah. So somehow we realize from understanding, we kind of realize that this is like a panced thing that is also functorial, that's just there. Does that say better? Does that say better? But no, I just oh, I sort of meant ah, maybe this one here. I just sort of do plane. Okay. I mean, what? I mean, people have known since before we're accidentally followed Cohen that there was some connection between, for example, H C minus the drone compound for London. I think one of the reason I personally care about age agents. The reason I personally care about age agent is because I care about pageants, because connecting and I know how to compute for our cohomology software. Yeah. Um yeah, so this is a HR what about the other one? HTHR and FT or whatever. I mean are they real yes yeah yeah yes um right uh what do I want to say? Right, right, yeah. There's a sort of Right, right, yeah. There's a sort of there's a sort of expectation that if something is true for K-theory or whatever on this side, that there should be a sort of different version of this on the right-hand side. However, something I guess I didn't really get to mention is just doing algebra or whatever in this diagram category setting is quite complicated. Very complicated. So, yeah, sort of the sort of yeah, these objects exist. Yeah, these objects exist, but for sort of more, but maybe the whole zoo of everything you would expect isn't quite complete. I mean, I can't take it to the paper. Is that something? Is that something to follow? Yeah, that's a good question. Right. So if you're just purely interested in like groups and the representation theory and algebra or whatever, you could have Machief for any finite group. Great. But as far as having this sort of these like derived algebras or this like THH or whatever, okay, what it's really saying is, okay, we have a natural notion of like involution. A natural notion of like involutions or symmetric bilinear forms on vector bundles, and I sure you could take like vector bundles with g action for random g, but that's maybe like that theory is like less well developed. Yeah. Okay, so in the beginning of the talk, you mentioned the public data. So are are you gonna look at are you gonna look at like like osmiology in pollution relative to these like wacky thingies? Yeah, yeah, right. So I've been talking to Noah and Victor and another collaborator of ours about sort of just asking okay I have this category now. Okay, what does it mean to have an Azumaya algebra or a Brouwer group? I guess maybe Brouwer Mackie functor, yeah, sort of internal to this category. Mackie functor, yeah, sort of internal to this category. Okay, and what does that structure look like? And hopefully that's related to those results that we talked about and mentioned earlier.
