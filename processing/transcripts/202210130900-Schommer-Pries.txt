Well, first I want to say thank you for the invitation to speak. I'm very happy to talk about these results because sort of, you know, as I was listening to talks throughout the week, I noticed many of the similar themes kind of coming in to this. So it will hopefully touch on a couple of other things that we've seen so far this week. So far this week. So, this is a talk about manifold invariants and a certain type of manifold invariants and what they can actually see. And, you know, manifold invariants are great. Here's one of my favorite manifold invariants. There's an invariant of four manifolds, which if you feed it a four-manifold, it spits out the number one, if that four-manifold is diffeomorphic to the four-sphere, the standard four-sphere, and zero otherwise. Using this invariant and its cousins, you can. This invariant and its cousins, you can completely distinguish all four manifolds. But of course, this is sort of useless because there's no way to, unless you have some way to compute that invariant, you can't do anything with it. It's sort of a tautological mess. And so one of the motivations for topological field theories is that they are supposed to provide manifold invariants that are more computable. They have some kind of computability. They have some kind of computability built into them because they have a local feature. So the manifold invariance, the numbers that you get out from a using a topological field theory, can be computed by taking your manifold and chopping it to pieces. And we have, you know, there are lots of useful things in topology where you have properties like this, where you can compute an invariant from local constructions. For example, comology is very computable because. Is very computable because you can chop up your manifold in any way you want, basically, or any space that you want into nice pieces. And then, using Meyer Vietaurus, you can reassemble them and compute things locally. So, for TFTs, it's not quite as free as that. You're allowed to slice your manifolds along codimension one manifolds, so sub-manifolds, like in this picture here, divide it into pieces, and then you associate something to these pieces and then be able to reconstruct. These pieces, and then be able to reconstruct the invariant from these more elementary components. And this gives you a kind of hopefully a way to kind of compute these invariants, some kind of local, local formula for these, these kind of manifolds, these things coming from T of T's. Now, the most naive thing you could guess would be like, if I divide my manifold here into two parts, into M2 and M1, you might suppose. You might suppose that you could associate maybe a number to m2 and a number to m1, and then the resulting number for the closed manifold could be obtained just by multiplying the two numbers together. That'd be like the simplest possible thing you could imagine. So that's sort of a naive thing that you might hope for. They're not as powerful, those kind of invariants. Something better would be where you associate something more complicated to the Something more complicated to the boundary, like a vector space. Okay. And then rather than just a number to M1, you would associate a vector in that vector space and to M2, perhaps a co-vector. And then you obtain the number for the whole manifold by pairing them together. Or in a kind of more categorical language, you have a functor. And for M1, you get a map, a linear map, which goes from the trivial vector space to the vector space. Vector space to the vector space associated to sigma. And for M2, you get one going back to the trivial vector space. And by composing them, you get an endomorphism of C, hence a number associated to the closed manifold you get by gluing them. So all of that can be packaged into the following sort of categorical definition of a topological field theory. So this So this goes back to Atiya and Siegel's work trying to axiomatize these kinds of structures. So a topological field theory is a symmetric minoidal functor from a bordism category to a target category of vector spaces. And right off the bat, I want to sort of add some bells and whistles to this situation. So one of the things I want to do is for my boardism category, I want to allow some flexibility in what type of manifold we consider. So I want to allow various tangential structures. So maybe our manifolds are oriented or spin, or as we'll see in a second, could have some more exotic types of structures. And I'll talk about that in a minute. But we have a category where the objects are D minus one dimensional, smooth. Minus one-dimensional smooth closed manifold with some type of structure and the morphisms are diffeomorphism classes of compact d-dimensional cobordisms also with X structure and the symmetric monodal structure is disjoint union and a TFT is a functor from this to the category of supervector spaces so I want to I want to all enhance the Enhance the you usually often that you just look at vector spaces, but I want to make a small little upgrade here that will sort of be key to what we're talking about, which is pretty mild. What we want to do is our objects now are not just vector spaces, but they're Z2 graded vector spaces. So you have an even part and an odd part, and your morphisms preserve the grading. And when you have your symmetric minotal structure, there's the causal sign rule. So the category of super vectors. Sign role. So they're categories super vector spaces rather than just vector spaces. So a t of t will then be something like this. So for d minus one manifolds, you get a super vector space. For cobordisms, you get a linear map between super vector spaces. And for our tangential structures, so in general, what we're going to allow here is we're going to have is we're going to have a space over BOD. And if given a manifold, you have a tangent classifying map. So if it's a D manifold, you have a map to BOD. And an X structure is just a lift of the tangent classifier to X. Now, if you have a D minus one manifold, you can define X structures. You can define x structures. The tangent bundle of a d minus one manifold is only d minus one dimensional, so you have to stabilize it with a trivial bundle. And then you can ask for a similar structure. Now, if you have a cobordism, though, you have to sort of identify, you know, so if I have a way of thinking of sigma as living as part of the boundary of my manifold, my cobordism, then I need to identify. To identify the in order to talk about an X structure cobordism, I want to say that the X structure on the boundary is compatible with the X structure on the ambient cobordism. And to do that, you need to identify the restriction of the tangent bundle of M with the bundle down here that you have an X structure on. So you need to choose some kind of inward or outward pointing normal vector. And so for inward boundary, we could choose incoming boundary. We can choose incoming boundary, we can choose inward pointing, and for outward going boundary, we can choose the outward pointing normal vector. And in that way, you can glue cobordism with X structure, and you get a nice X structured cobordism category. So the question I want to sort of consider is: what do oriented topological field theories detect? So, you know, I just talked about this X structure, and that will come in later. But the most basic type of probabilism categories you could consider would be for the most basic type of structures. So maybe just unoriented manifolds with no structure, maybe oriented manifolds. So you can, you have this definition. An oriented TFT is a functor from this Bordism category, the super vector spaces. What is it that they can What is it that they can see? What about oriented manifolds? So you might think: well, maybe they're just combinatorial. Maybe they only depend on the homotopy type. Can they even see the homotopy type of the manifold? Maybe they're very strong invariants. Can they see the diffeomorphism type, distinguish exotic smooth manifolds, and so forth? It's sort of not so clear just from the definition. So you can ask this question. So, you can ask this question: what exactly do they see? And now, if you have particular constructions of these TFTs, if you like build an example of a TFT and your construction uses something like a triangulation of your manifold, the combinatorial structure labeling it, well, then you only expect to get out of it what you kind of put into it. So, many of the examples of TFTs that have been built in higher dimensions didn't. didn't do a really good job of sort of addressing things like this: diffeomorphism types, exotic smooth structures. So, the evidence sort of suggests something more like that they only depend on combinatorial structure, homotopy type. And there were even many, there have been some examples of results that show that certain classes of TFTs can't distinguish exotic structures, can't distinguish certain features of the manifold. Features of the manifolds, in some cases, even can't distinguish the homotopy type of certain manifolds. I'll mention some of those a little bit later. So, one of the things that I want to, one of the possible types of things you could try to look at is related to stable diffeomorphism. So, this will show up in this talk here. So, stable diffeomorphism. Ask the following. So, two manifolds, so this is something which makes sense in even dimensions. So, two manifolds are stably diffeomorphic if there's some number r such that m and n become diffeomorphic after taking the connect sum with r many copies of sq cross sq. Okay, so this is a this is a notion that has been A notion that has been around before. You can ask, you know, when are manifolds stably diffeomorphic? You can ask various questions. If they're stably diffeomorphic, are they diffeomorphic? What do we know about these manifolds if we know that they're stably diffeomorphic? Many things become easier if you stabilize with SQ cross SQ. This is just a remark that this notion of stable. This notion of stable diffeomorphism can also be done in some cases with tangential structures. So, you need to, in order to make sense of stable diffeomorphism, you need to have an X structure on SQ cross SQ, and you need to be able to do connect sum. So that would be, that works perfectly well if you have a space over BOD where the homotopy fiber is a Q minus one type. Is a Q minus one type. So if the homotopy fiber isn't too complicated, then you have a unique X structure on this product, and you'll have a well-defined notion of connected sum. So for example, this makes sense for oriented manifolds, for spin manifolds, and for other flavors of structure that you might be interested in. And just from its definition, stable diffeomorphism is a priori. It's coarser than diffeomorphism. So here are some. So, here are some results about stable diffeomorphisms of the stable diffeomorphism. So, in dimension, in four in dimensions divisible by four, so four n-dimensional case, you know, larger than four, but eight and higher, but a fourn. Then, there are examples through the Matthias Krak and Schaefer that where there are large families of Large families of highly connected manifolds which are stably diffeomorphic, but they're not even homotopy equivalent. So in these dimensions of 4n, stable diffeomorphism is even coarser than the homotopy type. So you can't even see that the homotopy type. In contrast, if you're in dimensions 2Q where Q is odd, so like dimension 6 or dimension 10, and you're simply connected. And you're simply connected, then being stably diffeomorphic is equivalent to actually being diffeomorphic. So, in this sense, in this case, it's a really strong sort of notion. So, if you can show two things are stably diffeomorphic, then in fact, they're going to be diffeomorphic as well. And another sort of thing to bear in mind here is that, which is something I, you know, it's interesting. Just something I, you know, it's interesting here, potentially interesting, is that exotic spheres, for exotic spheres, stable diffeomorphism is also the same as diffeomorphism. So two exotic spheres will be stable diffeomorphic if they become, if they're, if they're diffeomorphic, be stood away from the most interesting dimension here. So, the goal for this talk is to explain how, in certain cases, In certain cases, oriented TFTs give complete stable diffeomorphism invariance for certain classes of manifolds. And also that this is the best you can do for a large class of TFTs called semi-simple TFTs, which include basically all TFTs that we know how to build in dimensions beyond two. So most almost all examples of these functorial type of TFTs that we have. Type of TFTs that we have, the best you can do is stable diffeomorphism. But so that's sort of a negative result. A positive result is that we can actually construct TFTs that do see stable diffeomorphism, at least in some cases. So I'm going to, there's a lot of pieces here. I'm going to focus on trying to show the positive results. So the showing that explains how we can have TFD. Explain how we can have TFT to show that there are TFTs oriented TFTs that do detect stable diffeomorphism. So the plan is then to use three different pieces to kind of, you know, there's three different stages here. So I first want to talk about, you know, so in order to show a positive result, we need to construct some examples of T of Ts that will do this. So this is going to be done in a couple of stages. So first I want to talk about in So, first, I want to talk about invertible T of T's, invertible field theories, some class of field theories that we call invertible. And these can be completely classified. And the classification of these uses Tom Spectre, one of the themes of the conference. So we'll talk about that. And then I want to talk about another type of TFT. So diagraph-Witten TFTs are a kind of well-known class of topological field theories, and they've been generalized. Topological field theories, and they've been generalized a bit. Part of this story involves something which was called homotopy cardinality, but now you might, nowadays, you might use a more modern phrasing of rational ambidexterity. So that's something we'll touch on. And then kind of something that David and I do is we generalize this to a kind of twisted version of these diagraph-witten theories. Diagraph-Witten theories. And these are kind of theories that are built using, they're kind of motivated by physical construction. So, in physics, you would say you have some classical field theory, space some classical fields and a Lagrangian, and then you do some path integral quantization, which doesn't necessarily exist. So, this is sort of like a situation where you can make sense of the path integral quantization using the so-called finite path integral quantization that was advocated by. That was advocated by several people. Dan Fried, among them, was someone who really put that perspective out there for these kinds of field theories. And then we got to take these, after we've kind of put those things together, we can then come back to this question about stable diffeomorphism. So that's sort of the plan. Okay. Okay, so let's start here with invertible topological field theories. So a topological field theory is invertible if the vector space that you associate to a D minus one manifold, to every D minus one manifold, is one-dimensional. So it's either a one-dimensional even vector space or a one-dimensional odd vector space. It's a line, it's a super line. Space. It's a line. It's a super line. And in addition, if each morphism that you have for each bordism is invertible, that second one is actually automatic in the case of the Bordism category. It's not true for general functors, that that would be from general categories. But for the Bordism category, you can actually show that two follows from one. I don't want to, but that's another part of it. So we have associated to each object. Object here. We have a line. So that's a vector space which is invertible for the tensor product. There's another line where you can tensor it together to get the trivial line. And for each cobordism is sent to an invertible map. So a map between two lines, you know, they'll have to have the same parity. So it's an endomorphism of the trivial vector space or an endomorphism. Vector space or an endomorphism of the trivial odd vector space of one dimension. So these are just numbers associated to each manifold. And for these types of TFTs, these have this sort of, these are the kind of, these correspond to this sort of naive notion where you have numbers essentially associated to the two halves, and the number associated to the composite is just obtained by multiplying them together. So if So, if you were trying to make this naive version of an invariant sort of more precise, you might come up with this. So, they're TFTs which happen to factor through the subcategory of complex superlines. I didn't mention that at the beginning, but I'm working over the complex numbers here. Okay. So, this is a notion you can study, sort of this more easy type of TFT. Um, more easy type of TFT. Um, and you can ask, okay, what can these see? So, in for oriented TFTs, they're pretty classical. So, not a lot of exotic, interesting invariants. So, invertible TFTs, oriented invertible TFTs, they can see Pontryagin numbers and Stiefel-Whitney numbers. So, you can see the oriented Bordism class of your manifold. And you can also see. And you can also see the Euler characteristic. And you can see something else, which is a little bit more exotic. You can see the Kerberic semi-characteristic. So this is something which makes sense for manifolds of dimension 4n plus 1. You take the sort of sum of the even-dimensional homologies up through just below the middle dimensional mod 2. So it's kind of a half Euler characteristic. Other characteristic, Ma2, and it's a Ma2 invariant. And that's something which you can detect also with these kinds of invertible TFTs. So, okay, so that's not enough to see the homotopy type of your manifold if you're in dimensions 4k. It is. Dimensions 4K. It is if you're in high, if you're in other dimensions that are not 4K, but it's okay. So that's at least a nice list of things that you can do. See, and as we'll see in a second, well, maybe able to say it's a fact of life that you can show that invertible TFTs in the oriented case, this is all you can see. So these invariants can be detected by invertible field theories in any invertible. Theories and any invertible field theory can be expressed in terms of these invariants. The invariants you get out of invertible field theories are just these. And these are also the invariants that determine the fundamentals, you know, the pi zero of the Madison-Tillman spectrum in the oriented case. So this. This homotopy group of this spectrum, which this will come in in just a second, is it's been computed, and it looks like there's a factor which looks like oriented bordism. And then there's another factor, which depending on your dimension, essentially amounts to either the Euler characteristic or a combination of the Euler characteristic and a signature, or to this Euler, or to this Caravair semi-character. This Euler or to this Caravair semi-characteristic, depending on your dimensions here. So essentially, what invertible field theories can detect is just the class of your manifold corresponding to the element it represents in this homotopy group of this Tom spectrum. And that's sort of key to the classification of any invertible field theory, as we'll see in a second. Field theory, as we'll see in a second. So, to classify them, let me take a little detour into something called Picard categories. So, a Picard category is a symmetric monodal groupoid. So, it's a symmetric monodal category where the morphisms are invertible and where the objects are tensor invertible. So, an example of that would be the category of superlines. So, any functor from the Bordeson category into From the Bordism category into the category of superlines, will factor through the sort of Picard completion of the Bordism category. So, this is where you would take the Bordism category and you would invert the morphisms, you'd formally invert the morphisms of the Bordism category to provide inverses. And then, if in addition, if you needed to, you could then invert the objects. It turns out that it will automatically, the objects will automatically be tensor. The objects will automatically be tensor invertible after you've inverted all of the cobordisms. And so you have this universal way of forming the Picard completion of the Bordism category. And any functor, any invertible T of T will factor through that. So if we want to understand invertible topological field theories, it suffices to try to understand this. Try to understand this Picard category and functors from it into superlines. And now we can actually do that. We can answer that question completely using some previous known results. So the first result is that the category of superlines among Picard categories actually has a pretty nice universal property. So Given any Picard category, so symmetric minidal groupoid, where the objects are invertible, you can obtain an abelian group by looking at the automorphisms of the unit object, okay, inside that category. So the property of superlines is that, you know, so any, so a functor to superlines will then, let me just write that here. So in particular, just write that here. So in particular, a functor of the superlines, it's going to take the automorphisms of the unit. So let me have, so I have C going to S lines. It's going to take the automorphisms in C of the unit, and it's going to map it to the automorphisms in S lines of the unit. Well, that's just C cross. Okay, so you get a homomorphism to. Okay, so you get a homomorphism to C cross. Now, in general, a symmetric minidal functor, you would expect it to have all kinds of extra structure in addition to this homomorphism. But the universal property of the category of superlines is that, in fact, no, the entire functor is determined just by this homomorphism to C cross. So, this is a result that goes back to, well, in the kind of braided monetal case to Joy Allen's Street in the 80s, it also appears in Appendix of Hopkins and It also appears in Appendix Hopkins and Singer. So, this is known to the experts, if you will. And it's not too difficult to show this. So, for any Picard category C, you want to classify functors into superlines, you just need to understand the automorphisms of the unit object. The other ingredient. The other ingredient is that we have this fantastic result by Galatius, Matt, and Tillman Weiss that tells us that if we take the bordism category, you can enhance it to a topological category, and then you can universally invert the morphisms, which is equivalent to taking the geometric realization, and they've identified that space. It's this loops infinity minus one of this. Minus one of this Madison-Tom spectrum associated to the tangential structure X. And so following at that, you can use that to compute the automorphisms of the Picard, the automorphisms of the unit object in the Picard completion of the Bordism category. So the punchline is that the automorphisms of the unit will be pi one of the geometric realization. Pi one of the geometric realization, which is pi zero of the corresponding Madison-Tillmann spectrum. So, this is this is some homotopy group of this Madison-Tillman spectrum, and you can describe it as a kind of Bordism group. So, we might call, I'll call this the tangential Bordism group. It's a little bit more, it's a Bordism group of D-dimensional manifolds. So, I'll write D there. And it's sort of a nice exercise in the Pontiac and Tom construction to write out what it is. It's a little bit more. Write out what it is. It's a little bit more unusual than the usual types of bordism you see, but it's some kind of the interesting bordism group that you can define. And that will be, in virtue of the Waitius-Smans, and Tom and Weiss theorem, that will be the automorphisms of the unit in the Picard completion of the Bordism category, that group. So then combining these two things, you get a result, a theorem. You get a result, a theorem that says that invertible field theories are the same as characters on this kind of exotic orders and group. So that, so if you put that together, you can see we can go back a step and say, okay, let's look at the oriented theories then. Invertible oriented theories are determined by characters on this particular Bordism group. This particular bordism group. And so from that, it follows that they're, in fact, they can detect these numbers and they can only detect these numbers. That's the best you can do. So that's the class of invertible theories, and they can be completely understood in terms of some kind of characters on a kind of exotic border group. Boardism Boardism Group. And if there's time or questions, I can kind of talk about that a little bit more. But let me just leave that for now and move on to diagraph Witten theories. So this is another type of source of field theories. So here, the original input, this is in the 90s, was that you inputted a finite group. You inputted a finite group, G, and a cohomology class on the classifying space of DG. And using those two pieces, you were able to construct, the diagram Witten were able to construct an oriented TFT. And here the idea is you have a classical theory. The classical theory are going to be, the fields for that theory are going to be G bundles, you know, for BG. And this. And this comology class allows you to get an invariant of G bundles. So that'll be your Lagrangian. And by doing a finite quantization of this, you can sort of sum over all G bundles in some way to obtain a kind to build an oriented TFT. That's sort of the idea. So this was generalized based off of ideas from Konsevich in a preprint that was. In a preprint that was never published. They were developed by Quinn in 95 using, you know, extending, you know, basically writing down the idea there. And these are the so-called finite homotopy TFTs. So the input here is very similar to the one for diagraph Witten theories. So the input here is a pi-finite space. So rather than a finite group and the corresponding space BG, we have a generalization. We have a generalization to a pi-finite space. So, this is a space where the homotopy groups are finite and they're non-zero only for finitely many indices i. So, most of the homotopy groups are zero. Finitely many of them are allowed to be finite groups. In addition to that, we need a cohomology class, a G-dimensional cohomology class on y valued in C cross. Cross. And then the idea is that we're going to take you're going to have a moduli space of classical fields, and that moduli space is going to be the space of maps from M into Y. And then this cohomology class is supposed to kind of represent a kind of Lagrangian. So if I have a map from M into Y, I can pull back, and I have a cohomology class, I can pull back the cohomology class by. Back the cohomology class by the map and then integrate it over the manifold to get a number. So that process is supposed to be some kind of Lagrangian. And then we're going to sort of quantize this to integrate over all the fields. We kind of want to integrate over this space of maps. So what exactly that means is a little maybe mysterious, but we can actually write that, you can write. Can actually write that, you can write down a construction that's supposed to implement what this quantization procedure is supposed to do. And it produces a topological field theory. And for us, the most important part of it is going to be the invariant you get for closed manifolds. So I'm going to tell you what you get for closed manifolds. So for closed manifolds, the invariant you get, there's a nice formula for it. So it's a sum. So, it's a sum over all homotopy classes of maps from M to Y. So, you choose a representative for each component of this mapping space. And then, well, you can do what I suggested before. You can pull back the cohomology class and you can pair it with the fundamental class of your oriented manifold to get a number. And then you form a sum over all possible maps and you wait. All possible maps, and you weight that sum by a certain number associated to this component. This is the so-called homotopy cardinality. So what you do for this space, so if you have a space here, which is assumed to be pi finite, then you can define the homotopy cardinality of this space as an alternating product of the orders of the homotopy groups. So, this will be one over the order of the fundamental group times the order of pi two divided by the order of pi three times pi four, and so on. Now, if z is pi finite, this product eventually, you know, eventually the orders are all one, so that it's a finite product. Okay, so this makes sense. It's some rational number for a pi-finite space. Um, if the man, if y was pi-finite, If y was pi finite, then since m is a closed manifold that's assumed to be compact, you know, it's finite, it has a finitely many components itself, then the mapping space will also be pi-finite. So this makes sense. You can look at this mapping space and you can form this correction factor. So in other words, what you're doing to build this TFT is you're taking a weighted average over Average over all the possible maps from m into y of the value that you would get by pulling back this class along the map and just pairing it off. So you're kind of mapping into y as much as you can, averaging over all the possible maps to get some kind of number, which now doesn't depend on the map into y, only depends on m. That's some kind of average procedure. And that's going to that. procedure. And that gives you the invariant associated to y for these, associated to m for this particular homotopy finite t of t. So generalized diagraph witten theory is going to extend this. So what we're going to do, we're going to put this is going to be a construction that produces Going to be a construction that produces oriented field theories, and the input is going to be is going to change this a little bit. So, rather than having a pi-finite space as the input, we're going to allow ourselves a kind of twisted version of that. So, we allow ourselves any map from X into B S O D where the homotopy fiber is pi finite. So, an example would be: let me just write this here as a little note. So, for example, Is a little note. So, for example, you could have Y cross B S O D mapping to B S O D via projection. So that projection map would be an example of this, and that will kind of reproduce this example. But you could allow also more interesting fiber bundles, which are not trivial bundles. And the second bit of input. And the second bit of input is going to be an X structured field theory. So, not a, so okay, so it's some kind of field theory, functor from the X bordism category to supervector spaces that's going to be part of the input to this construction. So, in order, part of the details that had to be done by Quinn is to show that, well, if you have give yourself this cohomology class. This cohomology class, and enough choices are made, you can actually write down a Y-structured T of T. So then what you do with this construction, this generalized diagraph Witten theory, is you do an integration procedure. So for a given manifold, an oriented manifold, you integrate over all possible X structures to get an oriented. Get an oriented T of T. So there's this procedure that constructs out of this data an oriented T of T in supervector spaces. And for a closed D manifold, the formula for it is very similar to what you saw before. So all it does is it replaces the space of maps from M into Y with the space of lifts, the space of tangential structures. So you look at all the So, you look at all the possible X structures on your manifold M. And every time you have one of those X structures, you can evaluate using your X structure T of T. And then you can take this weighted average over all the possible X structures that you have on your manifold M, weighting each factor by some rational number that sort of measures something about the homotopy. Sort of measures something about the homotopy type of the space of X structures in that component. And that average, that sum, now no longer depends on any particular X structure, and it will be an invariant of your oriented manifold M. It only depends on the oriented manifold M and not on any particular X structure. Instead, you sort of average over all possible ones. So that's a construction that we have. So then, if you restrict this now to, we're going to restrict this construction to just oriented field theories, now that gives rise to a kind of pairing that we have. So I'll call this the sort of generalized diagraph Witten pairing. So the input now is going to be, so this pairing is between sort of two things. So on the one hand, you have fibrations where the fiber is a pi. Where the fiber is a pi-finite n-type. So we're going to fix the n for now. So each pipe, you know, any pi-finite space is an n-type for some n, because eventually the homotopy groups have to be zero. So we're just going to fix that n for now. And so the homotopy fiber of x is a pi-finite n-type. And we're going to now construct an invert. Now we need a field theory. So we're going to use an invertible. Field theory, so we're going to use an invertible x-structured field theory, and as we saw previously, that is equivalent to just providing ourselves a character on this kind of funny Bordism group associated to X. So some kind of funny tangential Bordism group, we have this character, and that is equivalent to describing an invertible field theory for that weird structure for X structured. And now, given this data, we can do this integration procedure to produce an oriented field theory. And so, if we're given an oriented manifold that's d-dimensional, we can evaluate on it, and that gives us a pairing into the complex numbers. So, given one of these and a manifold, the value we get in the complex numbers is just obtained by, well, take your manifold M, it's the same formula we just saw. formula we just saw average over all the possible x structures that that manifold has take a sum a weighted average over all the possible x structures we're weighting by some sort of factor corresponding to the homotopy type of the components of that space of x structures and we're then just evaluating using this character on that manifold and we sum that over all the possible x structures so that this invariant as an invariant of m does As an invariant of M doesn't depend on the next structure, it just depends on the oriented manifold. But we can view this now as kind of a pairing between manifolds and inputs into our construction to produce oriented field theories. It's kind of a weird thing to think about, but you can say, given this, we can build a field theory, and then we can evaluate on the manifold. So that gives us a way to take these things and pair them with manifold. Take these things and pair them with manifolds. So, a few remarks about this, about what this can see about the manifold. So, the first thing is that it doesn't, you know, is that because you're looking at maps from M into X over BSOD, you're looking at X structures on M, and because the homotopy fiber is an N-type, then it doesn't, it factors through a It factors through part of the Morse, part of the Moore-Posnikov tower of M. So given M, you have your tangent classifier to BSOD. That map factors through a space B and M. So this is something I'm going to call the tangential n-type of M. So we're factoring the tangent bundle through the space and The space and it has the property that the map from M into the space is an isomorphism on homotopy groups below n and equal to n and surjective on n plus 1. And the map from the space B M to B S O D has a complementary condition. So it's an isomorphism on high dimensional homotopy groups bigger than at least n plus 2, and it's injective on n plus 1. And it's injective on n plus one. So up to homotopy, there's this unique factorization of the tangent classifier of m into a space. And this map to BSOD, this will have homotopy fiber will be an n-type. That's what it says here. So the homotopy fiber of this is an n-type. So in other words, this is sort of a best approximation. Of a best approximation to M among spaces over BSOD where the homotopy fiber is an n-type. It's kind of like the n-type of M, but relative to BSOD. It's the tangential n-type of M. So any map from M over BSOD into another space which has homotopy fiber and N-type will factor uniquely. And n-type will factor uniquely through this. So, saying that another way, since X is one of those types of spaces, the space of maps from M into X is homotopy equivalent to the space of maps from this space into X. So, okay. The other thing I want to point out is. The other thing I want to point out is that if you have your manifold here with its tangent bundle mapping to BSOD, this factorization actually gives M a B structure, a B M structure. This lift here is a type of tangential structure on M for this kind of strange tangential structure. So M actually defines an element inside this weird tangential border. Inside this weird tangential Bordism group, but for this BM here. So if we have an X structure on M, that gives us that's the same as a map from BM to X over BSOD. You get a corresponding map on Bordism groups for these weird tangential Bordism groups. And the valuation of M with its X structure is just given by, well, view M as a border here. View M as a border here, push it forward, and then evaluate with our character to C cross. So that's this formula. So then a couple of then, this gives us some immediate things. If M1 and M2 have the same tangential n type and they give they correspond to the same class in this Bordism group, then they can't be distinguished by these type N generalized. By these type n generalized diagraph-Witten theories. They're invisible. As far as they can, because the pairing that you get, this universal pairing only depends on the tangential n-type and the Bordism class. And in fact, because you're summing over all maps from B to X, if you look at an automorphism of B and have that act on the Bordism group, those will. Group, those will take the same value because of this weighted averaging procedure, because we're averaging over all maps. In this case, all maps from B to X. If the two borders classes are in the same orbit under in this Bordism group, under the action of the automorphisms of B over B S O D, you also won't be able to distinguish them. So they don't even have to have the same class. If they're in the same orbit, you won't be able to. If they're in the same orbit, you won't be able to see the difference between them. So, this averaging procedure, you know, might lose some information. So, our, you might call it the main theorem, the first main theorem, is that this generalized, this pairing here, this generalized diagraph Witten pairing, actually, in some sense, given those constraints of what you certainly can't see, it's Can't see, it's non-degenerate as much as it can be. So it's non-degenerate in the following sense. So if M and N are manifolds which have a pi-finite tangential n-type, so the tangential n-type of M and N, the homotopy fiber is pi-finite. Then they're indistinguishable, so they take the same value on this pairing for all. Value on this pairing for all possible inputs into the generalized diagraph Witten construction. They're indistinguishable if and only if they have the same tangential n-type and they're in the same orbit under the action. And the corresponding Bordism classes are in the same orbit inside this Bordism group. And there's a converse of that too. So if the dimension, if the type is not too large, if the type is Is not too large if the type is small, then if you have these two inputs into diagraph-witten theory and they take the same value, sorry, if you take these two inputs and they produce the same diagraph-Witten theory, then in fact the spaces were the same space and the characters were almost the same. They have the same restriction on the fixed points under this action. This is maybe not as interesting for our perspective. Not as interesting for our perspective, but it's sort of a converse. It says, in some sense, diagraph-witten theories are determined by the partition function. I guess I want to say something. Well, no, no, it's stronger than that. It says the input into the construction is determined by the partition function. So, what does this mean? So, morally, what this is saying is that you can undo this averaging procedure subject to these constraints, having the things which you know you. Constraints, having the things which you know you can't see, you can actually reverse this engineering, this averaging procedure to see this data from your manifold using diagraph Witten theories for varying X and W. So now this has consequences now for understanding invariance of these manifolds because of a Because of a remarkable matchup with Matthias Kreck's classification of manifolds up to stable diffeomorphism. So he was able, what he showed is that if you have stably diffeomorphic manifolds, dimension 2q, they're stably diffeomorphic if and only if exactly the same conditions here show up, if they have the same tangential, well, Q minus one type. Q minus one type. So sort of they have the same tangential type up to one below the middle dimension. And they represent the same class. The Bordism classes corresponding to those manifolds in this weird tangential Bordism are in the same orbit under this. Now, Matthias didn't express it in terms of this strange bordism group, but his conditions. His conditions are equivalent to that. So I'll say it this way. So if you combine that with this, it tells us that oriented TFTs can detect stable diffeomorphism between even-dimensional manifolds, which have pi-finite tangential q minus one type. So let's see. Let's let me just say that again. So, this result shows that these generalized diagraph Witten theories can, if you look at enough of them using that non-degeneracy condition, you can actually detect this data about your manifold. You can detect its tangential n-type, and you can detect whether the classes corresponding to two manifolds lie in the same orbit. They'll take the same value on all diagraph-Witten theories if and only if that's the case. If they lie in different orbits, They, if they lie in different orbits, then there will be some diagraph Witten theories which distinguish them. Because that's the same as stable diffeomorphism, that means that for these pi finite tangential q type minus one type manifolds, you can detect stable diffeomorphism for those types of manifolds. So I'll just, so there's a few consequences of that. So in dimension four, that means that these TFTs can detect stable difficulties. T of t's can detect stable diffeomorphism. So you have to ask, what is this condition now? What does it mean to be pi-finite q minus one type in these different situations? So in dimension four, it means that your fundamental group is finite. So TFTs detect stable diffeomorphism of four manifolds with finite pi one. Now, unfortunately, there exist Unfortunately, there exist families of manifolds, which are okay. Well, so this is so, and as a consequence of that, your four-dimensional TFTs can sometimes detect homotopy types. That was something which I think is also wasn't totally clear if you're thinking of like four-dimensional TFTs from some kind of combinatorial constructions. So, there are examples of manifolds which are homotopy equivalent, but not stably diffeomorphic with. Ditheomorphic with finite fundamental group that were constructed by Teichner. So, these manifolds, even though they're homotopy equivalent, they can be distinguished by four-dimensional, some four-dimensional T of Ts. So, some homotopy types can be distinguished in dimension four. There's an unoriented version of this whole story, and then you do a little bit better. So, there are examples of these, these, this RP4, and there's this Capel-Shanison fake RP4. Those are homeomorphic. Those are homeomorphic, but not stably diffeomorphic. So, those two, this manifold RP4 and this exotic RP4, because they're not stably diffeomorphic and because they have finite fundamental group, there are four-dimensional oriented theories that can distinguish them. These were first pointed out by Arun de Bray. Moving to higher dimensions, we have in dimension six that TFTs can oriented TFTs. TFTs can oriented TFTs can distinguish simply connected six manifolds with finite pi two. They can distinguish six manifolds with finite pi two and finite pi one up to stable diffeomorphism. But if you're also simply connected, then stable diffeomorphism agrees with diffeomorphism. So that tells us that in dimension six, these oriented TFTs can distinguish simply connected six manifolds with simply connected six manifolds with finite pi two up to diffeomorphism. So it's a complete diffeomorphism invariant for these manifolds, simply connected finite pi two. And there are also applications of this to exotic spheres. So this shows that there are oriented TFTs, which can distinguish certain exotic spheres, the so-called hitching spheres. So these occur in dimensions 8K plus 1 and 8k plus 2. Essentially, Too. Essentially, these oriented TFTs can detect everything that the alpha invariant can detect. So you can see these exotic spheres following work of Anderson, Brown, and Peterson that shows that the alpha invariant can see them. Okay, so there's a kind of converse to this that says that a certain class of TFTs, this is the best you can do, is stable diffeomorphism. But me, But maybe for the sake of time, I won't talk about that. And maybe I'll just end here. So, thank you for your attention. Thank you, Chris. Yep, I have more stuff if people ask questions, so just Just there's a lot of pieces to this story, so it's sort of not always clear which things to focus on. Thanks so much, Chris. Are there any questions from the folks here in Oaxaca? This is maybe more of a background question, but how does the super vector space fit? The super vector space bit figure into like that theorem of Joyelle and Street and Hopkins and yeah. So the Joyelle and Street were looking at they were looking at the braided minota version of Picard categories where you have a braided Minota category, but the objects are invertible and the morphisms are invertible and trying to classify those. So in the symmetric Minota case, there's a classification Case, there's a classification of these Picard categories. So they're completely classified by a couple of variants. So you have two abelian groups that come out of them. There's the isomorphism class of objects. There's this automorphisms of the unit. And then there's a kind of K invariant, which is a map from the object's tensor Z mod 2 to the automorphisms of the unit. And basically what it does is it says you have. And basically, what it does is it says you have this object, you can choose an inverse, and you can choose it in a nice way to satisfy a kind of zigzag type equation. And then using that, you can build an automorphism of the unit by evaluating on this twisted link, this framed link, basically. So that's a universal way to take an object and get an endomorphism of the unit. And these And these determine all Picard categories. Any Picard category, you have these invariants, and they determine the Picard category up to equivalence. And you can then talk about functors between Picard categories using these in terms of these invariants. So there's a nice, there's a little short exact sequence. This should end in zero. There's a short exact sequence which says that a functor from That a functor from between two of these is, well, it's the functor on the objects and morphisms that preserves the k-invariant. And there's a little x, there's a little correction factor for the coherence maps, which take a value in x of the objects of a and the morphisms of the target. So for super vector spaces, you have that there's super lines. Sorry, this is this should be lines here. S lines. S lines. For S lines, you have that there are two of them, an odd one and an even one. So they have Z mod two, and the automorphisms are C cross. And the Kane variant, this is the self-braiding of the odd line with itself. It picks up a minus one. So the K-invariant is actually injective in this case. So if you look at this exact sequence, then a map from, so you would a priori, you would have. So, you would a priori would have like A0 mapping to Z mod 2, you'd have A1 mapping to C cross, but you have to preserve the K invariant. And since this is injective, that means that the map A0 is actually determined by whatever it does over here. So, the whole thing is just determined by that. And because it's injective, there's no X term either. So, you just get that maps are given by that. Maps are given by that. And so, if another comment here is that these Picard groupoids are like spectra that have two adjacent homotopy groups, and the spectrum corresponding to the superlines is the same as, well, it's a truncation of the Brown commonness dual of the sphere, the C cross version of the Brown Combinance dual. So it has that same universal property that you can maps into. Property that you can maps into it are just determined by what happens at the top layer. Thank you. Any other questions here in Oaxaca? I have one question, Chris. Could you say where the you said something about rational ambidexterity at the beginning, and I was wondering if that where precisely that comes from. That, where precisely that comes in? That comes in in this integration procedure. So let me describe it over here. So basically, what you're doing is you're you have some X structure, you know, you have like B. You know, you have like the VSOD, and you have some X over it. And then you're going to be looking at like manifolds and cobordisms, you know, which all have, you know, they're oriented manifolds. And you can build spaces, the spaces of the moduli spaces of X structures for your manifold. So for example, if I have a cobordism, then I have this moduli space of X structures on M, and I can restrict them to the moduli space of X structures. them to the moduli space of x structures on on sigma and the modulized space of x structures on the outgoing boundary. So 0 and 1. 0 and 1 is the prime. And I get a kind of span here. And if I have a x structured t of t, let's say it's an invertible one, so it associates to each x structured d minus one manifold a line. So for each point in here, I get a line. I get something which I get a line, I get something which is like a local system on this space. I get some line bundle over the space. If I have some invertible t of t x t of t then I get this kind of line bundle here and I get a line bundle here and the integration procedure, what you want to do is sort of you want to take you want You want to take, you want to sort of take a co-limit over, you want to be able to sort of define a kind of morphism by some kind of push-pull type procedure here. And to make that functorial, when you compose these bordisms, when you compose the boredoms, you'll have a pullback diagram. You need to sort of identify a, so this push-pull, there's sort of two versions. One where you can take a limit of this line bundle over this. Of this line bundle over the space of sections, or one where you can take a co-limit. And in order to make the composition compatible, you need to identify both of them together. So you need to know that in some cases, when you're taking this limit or this co-limit over this moduli space, that they agree with each other in a canonical way. So that's part of ambidexterity. Sort of hidden. This is the pi-finiteness. Yeah, this uses the pi-finiteness that these moduli spaces are pi finiten. That these moduli spaces are pi-finite if the fiber here is pi-finite. So we're using that some kind of homotopy limits in this rational setting agree with the homotopy co-limits if the thing that you're indexing your homotopy limit or co-limit over is a pi-finite space. So that's a kind of ambidexterity. Another, it's sort of hidden and it comes into this homotopy cardinality that I mentioned. And the rational, another way to kind of express it is that this homotopy cardinality is compatible with pullbacks. Cardinality is compatible with pullbacks in a nice way. There's sort of a nice pullback formula for homotopy cardinality. That's the more down-to-earth way to express the same thing. Great. So a quick follow-up question to hopefully quick. Is there any way to approach TQFTs that maybe live in modules over something like Morava K theory? Over something like Morava K-theory and get a similar sort of invariant in that setting using the sort of notion of Kn local homotopy cardinality doing a similar construction. Well, there should be, right? So, this is one of the, if you look at like Jacob Lorry's lectures on ambidexterity, one of the opening ones was motivated by TFTs. As far as I know, that hasn't really. As far as I know, that hasn't really been written down, which might be interesting. I think that what happens, what this shows, is that basically the best invariants that you could hope for in this case, stable diffeomorphism invariants, they're already detected by the rational ones. So I'm not sure you would get an improvement over like manifold invariants. But I think the general theory and being able to produce that would be quite interesting to look at. I see. Thank you. If there are no more questions in Ohaka, Questions in Oaxaka. Are there any questions from Zoom? Okay, maybe I can ask. Go ahead. Go ahead. You can go if you want. Sort of technical questions. When you talked about the boardism, let's say, so the invertible TFTs, the boardism, the ex-bordism category was first treated as a discrete category and then. Discrete category. And then when you use the Galustrius, Madsen-Tillman-Weiss theorem, it was thought it was a topological category. Yeah. Could it happen that there were some invertible TFTs that only exist with a discrete topology that were discontinuous, so they wouldn't extend when you introduced the topology? Not if the target is also discrete, like this. So the fact that super lines maybe I'm asking about the topology on C star here or C cross. C star here or C cross? Yeah, so if you view that, if you view C cross as discrete, so you're not providing now. If you're going to take into account the topology on the C cross thing, then yes, potentially those could be different because even though like it's just one more layer, then you, but it's in the spot where you could, there could be a difference in that case. Um, and I think it's quite, it can be, it would be uh interesting to look at. So there's um At so there's um oh yeah, so that's something where it could make a difference. So, in this case, though, the um because the target is being used as a discrete sort of category, then there is no difference between those two. Any way of sort of enhancing the caborzin category to a topological category, which has the same homotopy category, it doesn't matter, it'll still have the same. Don't matter, it'll still have the same fundamental group of the geometric realization. It's another way to. And I guess those character groups, one is considering they're always characters of finitely generated abelian groups or something like that. So because there's also where the space is a pretty nice space. It's not, yeah. Great. So this was also correct. I guess they eventually depend on surgery theories. Eventually, depend on surgery theory. So it's a little surprising that you get results in dimension four. Is that because the surgery is only happening on the cobordism between two four manifolds? It's because, so right, so like usually with the surgery stuff, you would say, okay, you know, you have some, you have some cobordism, you have two manifolds with your tangential structure or whatever, and you want to, you have a cobordism between them, and you want to surgerate it to make it an S-cobordism, and then deduce that they're diffeomorphic. That's not going to work in dimension four. That's not going to work in dimension four, but it kind of does work if you allow yourself to stabilize first. So, sort of, but you do kind of have an escobord, a version of the escobordism theorem in dimension four if you first stabilize with S2 cross S2. So, that's right. Well, my surgery theory is 30 years old. That's what's the problem. Great, thanks. Maybe one more question, and then we can release those who wish to be released. Polite. Be released politely, and then we could, of course, always continue. So, I wanted to ask: so it seems like you need to look at, if I understood correctly, you need to look at many TQFTs in order to be able to establish the stable diffimorting type. Is it possible to look at a single TQFT, like combine this information so that you have one that would distinguish it? Distinguish it in some cases it's possible, but yes, for the general for the general result, it's you kind of you do need to look at a bunch of them. Now, for any if you have a particular manifold, it's there's a there's this so basically what we're so this is very similar to so the MIA backup. So this is similar to stuff that was considered by Laflas in the 60s and 70s. He was interested in the following question. Following question: If I have some kind of object, some kind of algebraic category, x, is it determined by the cardinality of the spaces of maps from x into y for all y? So for example, like you could ask this of groups. Like if I have finite group, two finite groups, G and H, and I know that the sizes of the sets of homomorphisms from G into K and H into K are the same for all K. Are the same for all k? Does it follow that the groups g and h are isomorphic? Like, if he had a natural isomorphism of sets, well, yeah, that would be just Yonada, but if you just know the cardinalities, do you know they're the same? So, this is similar. And the way that he did it is you kind of, what's important is looking at sort of all the subgroups of these groups. You can kind of do a kind of induction where you build up from the subgroups of the groups and kind of undo this kind of. Of undo this kind of averaging. So, the thing this is kind of similar. We're looking at maps between these vibrations over BO. They're not finite groups, but they're maps between fibrations where the fibers are pi-finite spaces. And instead of mapping sets, we're doing some homotopy cardinality of mapping spaces. So some kind of weighted version of that. We're asking, can you detect? Can I detect the The maps, right? Can I detect the maps between two of these things just from this weighted average of maps? And so, you know, you don't need all the maps. You just need to sort of like factor this through all the kind of things which can sit between them that are reasonable, like all the, you know, image, you know, so you would, you would sort of like any map between groups, you would factor it as the, you know, the image and then the inclusion. The image and then the inclusion. And so you can, you can, you know, there's a finite number of those that you need to check. So that would be, that would, you know, that would, that gives you like a list of like the types of TFTs that you would need to consider. So given any manifold, you can look at its tangential n-type. And if you can understand what all the sub-objects are of that, you could use that to write down a list of the TFTs that you would need to check. And in some cases, there aren't any. And in some cases, there aren't any, or depending on the homotopy type of your manifold, or there's very few. So in that case, you can do some stuff. But in general, you need a lot. Okay, great. Well, let's thank Chris. And if I understand correctly, if you wish to leave now, you may. To leave now, you may. If I understand correctly, there is a QA session now.
