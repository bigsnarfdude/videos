I think that to more expert people, I think this is the best audience. Today I'm going to talk about trilayer, more trilayer. Let me begin with, maybe I don't need to explain the twisted polygraph. So this is twisted biology and more pattern depends on the theater. And we have a flat band and Flatband and we have many interesting things. And then a few years ago, some people added one layer and considered the trial layers. And basically the first people consider the neurosymmetric trial. So that means that layer 1 and layer 2 are aligned. Okay, so mirrorsymmetric with respect to a middle layer. Then the bound structure is. Then the band structure is like this. We have a flat band and we also have a graphene-like dispersive band. So those two bands have a trend mirror symmetry. And they have a nice superconductivity. The superconductivity is even stronger than the twisted body. So the people attracted a lot of attention, a lot of attention with this system. And then And then now I want to think about a general twisted trilayer, so not only in mirror symmetry. Actually, my colleague Ko Wang published a paper, not on that one, but another trilayer that was probably submitted before. It just took a long time in the review process. Okay, so I should take it off. Yeah, yeah, thank you. And twisted. And twisted toleragraph in general. So general means that we have some general twist angle between layer 2, 3 and layer 1, 2. And we obviously have more, okay, so more pattern, so we call more 2, 3. So that means more pattern coming from way 2 and 3 and more 1, 2. And those two more patterns are generally incommensurate. So this gives us some nesty quasi period. Some messy quasi-periodic structures. So then now this is one of the recent paper and show actually considered one of the general twisted traveler and they found some interesting superconductivity. They claim that this is quasi-crystal superconductivity. Okay, so now let me introduce the terminology. Use the terminology. So we have two cases. Maybe one is helical and the other is alternate. And they are determined by the relative angle between the theta 1, 2 and theta 2, 3. Theta 1 is layer from layer 1 to 2 and theta 23 is from 2 to 3. Okay? So w when those two twist angles have the same uh sign in the same direction, then it it's like staircase, uh it's a hel helical. Stair key, it's a helical. And alternate means it's opposite. So then lay one and rotate and rotate back. So the neurosymmetric trial graph is one of the special cases of older cage. I showed those two have completely different problems. Now I this talk I talk about on the first part is this twist, the channel lagrang, lattice relaxation. Lattice lattice to trial. We show some more domains like this, and we have some topological electronic state. And the other part is again trial layer, but different types, HPN graph and HPN. So this is actually previous work, and we didn't include lattice location. But we focus on the energy spectrum, and we have a Hofstetta-like, Hofstata butterfly-like spectrum, and we have some topological numbers. And we have some topological number. And this turned out to be the sequential. So this is a defect. Okay, so let me first start with the first one. Again, twisted children. We want to ask how relativizing occurs in this system. So actually, we didn't want to go to this direction because this is obviously complex. But original model. But the original motivation is: okay, so when we looked at the mirror symmetric twisted trial as a experiment, we wondered, can we really realize the mirror symmetrix? That means that we need to adjust theta one to the theta two, three exactly. So the actual it's not obvious to obviously To realize the borderline. So if we have a slight difference between the two twist angles, then we have actually more extraction. And this so if we do this kind of calculation without loss logization, then we actually destroys that nice monolayer-like flood bound structure. Completely we have the messy bound structure. Also, another thing is if we shift the ego when you have a Even when you have a theater equal theater one, two and theater two three, when we shift the top layer and in in in just translation, then again it mix up the more and down and we have something different. So this was actually done by uh several groups and also the some Harvard group uh uh showed that uh uh mirror symmetric state. Mirror symmetric state is stable energetically. So then in one structure, we should have some kind of domain formation of lattice fluctuation. So this is actually a starting point. But not only near the mirror symmetry, we have a huge parameter space including helical, and it turned out to be very interesting. So this is the history. Okay, so before going to Okay, so but before going to uh twisted trial layer, so let's uh let me mention the the laxal location in the twisted bilayer, because this is very crucial to understand the twisted trial. So now that this is a TBG without lattice, and obviously we have here it's a nearly AA stacking point, and here it needs to be AB stacking B A, sorry, B A and A B. BA and A and B. It's well known that AA is energetically unfavorable. It has a high energy. And AB and B, this graphite structure have the lowest energy. This is the energy profile as a function of shift. So naturally, the system tried to minimize the A stack and maximize the A B and P A stack by the lateral recognition. By the latest recognition, this automatically occurs. So, this was done by the several groups. Actually, we did this using some sort of continuum. Okay, so now I didn't put the atom. So instead of that, I just show the local stacking energy. So this is the original picture without lots of potential. We have potential profile. This is A. So we have potential profile. This is AEA. So we have a fairly big area of AA and AB and B. So a dry region means the high energy, dark region is low energy. And now LAT is managed some way to minimize this structure like this. And now actually the domain is full. So this was calculated in a cognitive model. So this is very simple. So the total energy. Simple. So the total energy is elastic energy plus binding energy. Elastic energy is just usual textbook form. This is just some of top layer and bottom layer. The binding energy is interaction between layer 1 and layer 2. And this is essentially the registry dependent potential. So that just we integrate high so A for a high energy at the A point, low energy and A point. Point, lower engine A point. And basically, this energy profile is taken from the initial calculation. So, non-rotated AD stack energy, we know the total energy per algorithm. And we also know the AB stack, B stack. And then we also have some intermediate shift. So then we just assume some sort of sinusoidal potential and interpolate all of those shifts. So this is the Okay, so this is the uh very simple. So we uh total energy is the summation of elastic energy, the binding energy, and uh uh a variable is unknown variable is u. u is a displacement, atomic displacement at the pudge, at the function pudge. So then we do that some sort of Euler-Lagulangian calculation and minimize the total value. So this is a very simple. And we get And we get such a okay. Okay, now I want to show how this distortion occurs to realize the expansion of A V and the short cage of AA. So this is the picture. Basically what the system does is local rotation at AA point. AA point. So this is basically the layer one and the layer two rotate in different opposite direction, depending on the position. So for example, this shows the rotation of layer 2, displacement of layer 2. So at AA point, you can see that this rotated in this way. So the original atom shifted a little like this. And the layer 1 shifted. And layer one uh shift in the opposite direction. And uh this means uh you in this case you uh sorry, okay, increase the in this part, you increase the load local twist angle. And if you increase the local uh twist angle, then actually more pattern expands, or sorry, m more pattern shrinks, right? If you decrease the twist angle, more pattern decre uh uh uh increases. Increase. So by using this, so here the local twist angle increases, then the AA pattern should show. At AB, so we do the opposite. So the atom moves in such a way that the local twist angle decreases, then the pattern actually expands. So in such a way, so that you can see that rotation app with respect. Rotation with respect to AA and the rotation at AB are actually opposite. So, in such a way, so they create this pattern formation. So, this is the crucial in the twist tri-layer twist. So, at the end, so the effect of lattice logistics. So, that such a pattern formation is very, very important for electronic structure. So, with that lattice regulation, magic armor, you have a on your magic animal you have a flat band but it it's actually the very close to the uh remote uh uh uh dispersed band. But if you include lots of rotation, actually the flat band is isolated by the energy gap. So this can be explained by the differentiate W0, W1 parameter in the BM model. So the original BM model assumed the rigid Assume that which is lattice, then the W0 and W1 are identical. So if you do that, some lattice relaxation, and lattice relaxation gives some several effects. For example, it gives a vector potential, strain-induced vector potential in each Dirac amperedonia. Also, it changes interlayer potential. So one of the effects of this, this is a W1, 0W1 differentiation. Differentiation. And another effect is some it gives some higher harmonics. But anyway, so it has a big energy gap as in the experiment, and we have energy gap because we are going to close the Chiron model. So W0 equals 0 is essentially Chiron model. You have a completely flat magic gap. So this is the middle way, but anyway, this is the reason to have energy. Okay, so this is the introduction on the trial here. Sorry, my biology. Now we move on. Then now we move on to our twisted trial label. Okay, so the sit down by the now. Before you go there, you relax vertically as well, do you? Relax. I know. So we just assume in-plane. But we also have out of plane dist distortion, actually. So this also works to differentiate WW1. But this is independent effect. But just independent effect. Yeah. But in this model, you know, in all our calculations just I uh animate the inflag uh sorry, auto flag distribution for the simplest. Okay now this is the same picture. So this is a uh uh a schematic picture of a moire or moire structure. So the red dot means an AA point. AA point. They are non-adults. The red dot means the AEA spot of Moira 1, 2. The blue is the AEA spot of Moira 2, 3. So with that, lots of reactions look like this. So now we have a slightly different theta 1, 2 and the theta 2, 3. So the blue lattice and red lattice are incommensurate, and we have some kind of beading, moire beading structure. So this is a mole mole structure. Now locally, this is Now that locally it's some different atomic structure anyway. Okay? So now we want to include lattical activation. The model is exactly the same as the twisted ballot. We have elastic energy for each of three layers and also we assume the interlayer, resistive dependent interlayer energy for theta one, two and also for theta two three. And we just neglect one uh interaction between uh one and three because it's remote. Because it's remote. Okay, so I show the result. So, this is a certain combination of the angles. And this is the original structure without relaxation. And after the relaxation, it looks like this, actually. So now you can see that now the red atom and the blue. The red spot and the blue spots act like an atom and they And they actually manage to be locally commensurate. So, for example, if you look at this point, then you can see that red dots, red spots come in the center of the blue hexagon. So that means the red dot and blue dot are somehow repelled each other. This is actually the question. Now of course the we have we we are assuming that one more superlattice is fixed so that we have a domain wall. So that we have a domain one. So now that this is, you can see that here it's like this, and here it's like this is just 180 rotation. Anyway, we have some sort of higher scale domain formation, just like formation by A, E, and B S that being twisted by the ultimate scale. And this is something at the higher scale. We have something like Like such a lot within Warren as well. So, this is a different example. So, this is an even greater period case. So, then you can see basically the same thing. So, you have some locally commensurate structure. So, here we chose some different angles. So, then more pattern of red, the Moire Pattern of Blue are very much different. But still, we Much different, but still we have some similar things. The red dots want to come inside a blue triangle. So they rebuild each other always. So this is some, yeah, this is the same picture actually, but in different type of plots. So this is essentially this case, and I plot here the total resistility dependent edge. Okay? So this is a measure of one. Okay, so this is a major one, two, two, three. So this is original, and then we check. So we have a sub here, this is red dot, and blue dot are overlapped here. And after multiplication, they don't like it because they do red or ripple. So that it goes like this, and you can see that this is dotted. Okay? So this is equal to. Okay, so now equations white, the blue dots, and red dots don't like each other, and this is. And this is actually easily understood by considering recalling the twisted boundary of relaxation. So I tried to explain this. How did you actually solve for your relaxed equations? Are you going to tell us? How did you compute those? Okay, so the. Yes. Essentially, the same as the. If it's later in your lecture, I don't want to. Yeah. Yeah, so the. Okay. Okay, total energy is assumed to the summation of this and this. And now, variable or unknown variable is U. This is a displacement of the function, R. So now we have three layers, so that we have a okay, then we have more and more at one. And then we are assuming that U is the periodic in that more and more supercell, then the U can be Can be Freed transformed and expressed by the finite number of G. It's actually infinite, but we have some cutoff. So then we have some number of cut of G and we start with some initial parameter and sorry, initial variable. So we just randomly put the variable and we actually do the numerical iteration. So okay, we have some equals. So okay, we have some equation of U. I think it is detailed in written paper. So but that equation we have Euler-Lagland equation. So that we put some n generation view to that equation that gives the n plus one generation view and we do this until the solution converges. So you have a Moray of Moray supercell. You choose angle special for that. Yeah. For that. Right? And then you have, and so you're solving for all three displacements. Yeah. Okay. And actually, we combinate those to U1, U2, U3 to the some layer asymmetric or layer dissymmetric. So we can do that. This is just a unitary transformation. And just we neglect that HOMO string. I mean, we just And uh we just uh uh extract a uh uh hetero string. That means uh yeah, so there's you want you to use really the yeah, but it's a detail, that's that's only important. Yeah, just have a so just to clarify for the binding energy you're using the binding energy associated with AB stacked graphene versus A A stacked graphene. Yeah, so this is like sinusoidal. Yeah. So A stack here, A B stacked graph. And it's going like this in the supercell. Like there are many, many oscillations in the supercell. Yes, yes. So you're not using the binding energy for the more of more A. Yeah, so then we are working on the atomic radius. Actually, yeah. Just one clarifying question for the incom, like the very incommunicative case, I guess not incommensure, but the very different twist case. It looks like on the right the pattern is not C3 symmetric. Is there a reset? Yeah, so the I think this is C3 symmetry with respect to some point. But yeah, actually it's complicated. So we also this calculate the result depends on the shift, so global. Shift, so global shift of the a little bit different. Yeah, so that we actually we did start from the different lateral shift and we get some diff very similar but a little bit different energy after the comparison and we just pick the uh the lowest one. And sometimes it breaks uh s uh symmetry. So I know this is this is uh some This is this is a some uh limitation of example. Okay, so the now the how to explain the repulsion between blue and red. So the in if you we call the twisted biography and uh I said uh uh it's uh locally rotate in different manner in between layer one and layer two and uh uh And to shrink the AA and expand A. So we have the same game in the trial layer case as well, but we have two more products, model 1, 2 and model 2, 3. So we need to optimize the two Moire Patterns at the same time. So the point is that layer 2 is shared with the two more products. So sometimes layer 2 moves in this way and thus improves, I mean lower the energy, improve the wire. I mean, lower the energy improvement, what I want to do, but at the same time, it may mean it's generally maybe not good for the other one. So there's some sort of frustration here in the layer two movement. So this is the point. So this shows Moira 1 to Moira 3, and this rotation arrow means desirable rotation. Desirable rotation direction for layer 2. Layer 1 is 3, layer 2. So in this case, the layer 1, 2 want to rotate in this direction, to shrink the AA of Mario 1, 2, and here it opposed. Like this. The MAR2, 3, you have the same thing. But it's completely opposite. Because with respect to layer 2, layer 1 and layer 3 are rotated in opposite directions. So that's why those arrows. So that's why why so those arrows are all opposite between one and two three. So the point is and uh now the model arrangement of model one two and one two three are determined in such a way that such a frustration becomes minimum. So this is the game. So if you overlap blue and red completely, if you get this, so this is a then you can see that those arrow directions are completely opposite. Completely opposite. That means you rotate layer two in this way, 100% improve the layer one, two, for example, and then this improvement layer two. So this is a complete fraculation, so that's why it's not fair problem. It has a high image. So if the real answer is this, then you can see that this rotation direction, now we call the alpha beta stuck, now we have the same direction. Now we have the same direction. But unfortunately we have the opposite direction on one of three positions. But anyway, this is the best. Anyway, so that's why the red dot don't want to come right above the blue and they come to the center. So this is an explanation. Also how about now that we I explain the helical case, okay? But we this game become completely opposite, automated. Become completely opposite, the alternate case. So I show the result. So this is a helical case, which I've already shown. And the alternate case is opposite. And then now the A and B, so the blue and red attract each other. So this is because now the film layer 2, layer 3, and layer 1 rotated in the same direction. So that means, okay, so this is the same, but this is actually flipped. So now the perfect. So now the perfect stacking is solved all the trust relation problems. So that's why we have complete opposite. So this domain actually has a mirror symmetric T V. So if you have alternate stars, you have a mirror symmetric T V local. Now a real interesting point is in electronic structure. So if you calc we can calculate electronic bump structure of Electrical biomass structure will be the speaker system, including those string stuff, and also modified VM model. And this is what we get. So you can see that, so this is the original Dirac, a more alibaba-like thing. And here we have some sort of strange region where the density of state is really, really simple. If you draw the Fermi surface at certain energy, then the energy The energy contour is very, very flat. So that means that very one dimension. If you draw the wave function, then it's very one dimension. It's like almost independent array of just one digit. So we have three directions here. I just take here and then it's like this. And if you take this, then uh yeah, it goes like this. Okay? So this is uh related to topology. Related to topology. Okay, so now we have this picture. This picture is just a schematic picture of this. So we have the alpha beta more commensurate structure here, and this down triangle is an opposite. So this can be schematically drawn like this. And you can calculate the alpha beta. You can calculate the alpha beta, local homogeneous alpha beta, and then we get this. So this is basically perfectly correspond to the talk by Patrick. And you have the energy gap here. And then you have this flat band here. We can calculate the chain number. So this somehow this is different from the one-half and minus one-half because this is just a single value. And alpha-beta stack. And alpha beta stuck, it's a become the opposite. So that means that if your frame energy is here, then this is a quantum. So this region and this region have a different quantum hull conductivity, so that we have the H j. So now this is only for the K value, and the K prime value is the opposite because of time association. So we have some sort of spin-hole effect. So you have the electronic traveling. So you have the electronic traveling at k electron goes like this and k prime goes electron goes like this and there's no scattering here actually. So that's why we have a completely one channel. So this is because of those channel numbers. And also if I understand Patrick's talk correctly, then we have a magic angle condition here, then that magic angle we have in the chiral model maybe, and you In the chiral model, maybe, and so those dispersion completely vanishes. And this here we decode both into the vortexable band with gel number 2 and gel number minus 1. So it's 2 minus 1 is 1, so it's consistent. Okay, so this is a result for the now the helical. So to summarize the helical bound structure has a funny energy window in which One-dimensional state curves. And if you go decrease the twist angle, so those central parts become narrower, and this is becomes flat. Anyway, so what about alternate? So this is a little bit worrying, but the relaxation effect is very big. So non-relaxed case, as I said, so if you, this is slightly aware. Slightly away from the neurosymmetric value, then we have a completely messy band structure like this. But after including the luxuration, then this flat band becomes flatter, then we have normally a light band resume in some way. So I think this is because we have a real sim uh neurosymmetric region in this way, so the energy structure uh electronic structure becomes uh uh closer to the Closer to the original mirror symmetry. So, this flat man in the middle is the one from the mirror symmetry? Basically, yes. So, this red means just a projection to the mirror of all the sector. You should wrap up pretty soon. So let me mention briefly the topological gap leveling. So now the same thing, but this is HBN graph in HBN. So we select vision. And we can calculate the bound structure. We assume some big commentary in this cell. And this is a function of angle. Now we rotate top and bottom edge. Uh, top and bottom HPM is opposite way, and uh it's like this. Do you see the Hofstutter light structure? So then main idea is the Hofstutter butterfly has a churn number. Chern number. So do we have some similar thing? Yes. So the it has some rich physics. In the periodic case, we have just two reciprocal lattice, but in uh respondal lattice but in this case we have four more periodic uh uh sorry so this is we have two more right so that means that you have four rispal lattices in total so this is the kind of ways like we saw and the gap leveling is like this in the region this is just periodic system so we have just single uh brown zone then the energy spectrum is like this and we can have the density of number of electrons below the any cap is integer multiple Integer multiple of this realm zone size. So this new is a gap-labeling number. So this is the essential number of balance below the gap. So this is obvious. We can do the same thing at the Puesperedic system, but the difference is we have four B vectors, so by combining that, we have actually six different realms. So the same equation, this equation is extended like this: n equals divided this n equals to because we have six numbers associated with each of each of them and like one times this and minus two times this or something like that so this this is some assumption and if you admit it then the we always have the integer so that we should have some yeah uh uh uh original why why this should be integer context and it turned out that this is uh it's very analogous to that uh To the 1D periodic potential, 1D periodic potential, you have 1D and two different potentials. This is equivalent to the 2D system in the magnetic field. So there's some mapping. And the Dolt Germ number is actually corresponding to those numbers. So this is essentially the same thing. We have number and this is the real size. And important And uh important point is if you apply the electric field you have a whole convectivity and that's that's one that and in this picture this this one of the two potential just shifts so this in this case this N2 becomes a console coefficient. So this is this is S and T usual we'll find that we do we have the same thing you know the complete views now this is the two-dimensional periodic crystal and we have actually six And we have actually a 6D system, and we have the 4D quantum hole. This is hub space in 6D. And we have 4D quantum Hall effect. And those numbers, we have some paper. And this is quantized in terms of second check. This is F times F, like thing. The F is very current. So this is corresponding to that now that we if you shift the mole pattern then we The mole pattern, then we get some current pumping. So, this is corresponding to the movement of this. So, I skipped how to map it, but anyway, those quantized second chain number is actually corresponding to this new eye jersey, so there is and I want to say, okay. And I want to say, okay, now that we have this rule, this was assumption, but new yj turned out to be a second number by mapping to the higher dimensional sub object. So that's why we have the quantitation. Okay, so this is how we actually reach physics. Okay, so the yes, so that is it. Okay, so this is summary. So then I talk about two different quasi-periodic systems. Different quasi-periodic systems. And also, we neglect the latest relaxation, but here the latest relaxation, tweet about the graphene HPN case, it doesn't change much. Yeah, it changes, but it never closes the NHPL. So I think we have a similar thing. Okay, thank you very much. Okay, so we have time for some questions. Across? At all? In the Elliot tri-layer, sometimes relaxation which may make the continuum approximation exact is if you expand or contract the central layer, for instance. Can you take that into account? So suppose the central layer was the lattice constant was changed a little bit aligned globally. So it's out of my constant. So it it's out of my calculation because we just assume the uh atomic displacement of overlayer is periodic in in the more units. So the energy in the elastic energy of a small contract. Yeah, this is possible, yeah. Don't include in my calculation. Oscar, is there a way to experimentally extract the second turn number? Yeah, so the, well, I think it's very difficult, but if you move the But if you move the one layer of the tri-layer system, for example, then we have some charge current. So this is a direct way to make a probe that number. So another way is just cut the system with some boundary, then we have some edge states associated with those second channel. This is quantum twisting microscope, right? Yeah, so it's possible. So the it's it's possible, but I I actually yeah uh because graphene is metal, so the I don't know, so the you can put a T V G on the top yeah hopefully yeah so we can talk about this later, but when when one angle was much smaller than the other Smaller than the other, then these higher harmonics are really going to come in. So it's not going to be the normal normal formula for a more. So there could be a much longer kind of periodic structure than that's when no, no, early, yeah, something like that, yeah. Yeah. That's right. Because just like the reason we have a more for twisted bilair graphene is because we have two vectors. Graphene, because we have two vectors that are the same. But if you took a really small vector, like another crystal, that had, like, say, one-fourth the lattice spacing, you could still create more-type structures, but it would not necessarily be the higher harmonics that would be coming in. I'll explain to you later, but yeah, I'm just saying, I think those are much more complicated, actually, than these guys. Actually, basically, for example, if you have wa one lattice vector and the disability
