So, this is a study about the viscoelascular non-Neutronian fluids, and we try to compare with Neutronian fluid to see the difference. And this is a joint work with my former postdoc, Hua Long Feng, and my former student, Francisco Hernandez, and also my colleague in the chemical engineering, Professor Jay Schieber. Professor Jay Shibur, and this is my former student and my colleague Shuwan Li. So this is the outline. Okay, so we are interested in basically applications of in the chemical engineering. So we would like to see the effects of viscoelastic properties of a fluid. So what do we So what do we, in the, my colleague in chemical engineering, they say that they study this as called passive microbiology. So what do they do is that they put small particles in the fluid, and that fluid usually is Newtonian, and they actually oscillate this small particle and to see the basic distillation before. That's the topic of today's talk. And so to see the reaction or And so to see the reaction or the flow properties in order to induce the property of that fluid. So that is what we are trying to do. Of course, these particles are very small sized. Okay, so first let's just review the basics. And so this is Navier-Stokes equation. Navy-Stokes equation incompressible. So, this is the standard equation. And what I want to point out is because later on, we're going to modify this to introduce a viscoelastic fluid. So, we call this extra stress. Okay, so extra because we actually take out the pressure in the stress. So, the tau is proportional to the linearly proportional to this rate of deformation temperature. Rate of deformation tensor. And so that is a Newtonian definition. And so it's basically the stress is instantaneous of the reflection of the deformation tensor. So if we non-dimensionalize this, the momentum equations, so the first equation, this is the conservation of mass. So you can see that this little bit different than the normal non-imaginalization. Non-dimensionalization. So we have two different dimensional parameters. One is the Reynolds number, everyone knows. And when Reynolds number is small, so the non-unit term drops, and it becomes the, sometimes if beta is also small, which is called a frequency, then it becomes the Stokes equation. But in our case, because we have a very high frequency of the oscillation of the small particles. Of the small particles. So we have the frequency number is different than the Reynolds number. So there's two parameters here. So this, the beta, the frequency number is out of one, but the Reynolds number is out of zero, basically. It's very compared with one is very small. So in this case, we have an unsteady Stokes equation. So it's a Newtonian fluid, but we have a non-unsteady term here. All right, so that's a little bit different than the A little bit different than the Stokes equation where this term actually drops out as well. So we're going to compare with this Newtonian food later on. So that's why I introduced it in this slide. So the next one is we introduce the very simple, the simplest actually, in my opinion, the simplest non-Neptunian fluid. It's called a linear viscoelastic fluid. Viscoelatic fluid. So for the viscous fluid, remember that I introduced this extra tensor. So this tau, now it's memory dependent. So in other words, that is not remembered instantaneous. Also, it is actually an integral of the past time, all the past time. So, and this E is still the radio deformation tensor, but you can see that it actually is an integral of the past time. And G is given a relaxation modulus. And in this And in this talk, we actually give a simple assumption of the it's called n-mode Maxwell fluid. In that, in other words, that we have this, you could have like n different time scales in this modulus. So we call it lambda j. And that basically is how long, if you see that this is the decay, basically is how much memory remembers. members right so um and then if you compare with the neutrino fluid is as i said it's basically uh the modulus is a data function of t so it only remembers right now okay it doesn't have the memory so that is the difference uh between these two fluid right so how we study it so um so we uh I have been doing the banner integral method Been doing the banner integral method for a long time. So, this is the technique we're going to use. But since this has the memory effect, so we're going to study in this in the Fourier domain, time Fourier domain. So, we do a Fourier transformation in time of the previous equation. So, that is This equation over here. Of course, the tau is replaced with the viscoelastic properties. So if you do this time basically Fourier transform of this equation, you get this equation over here. All right. Now, the advantage of doing the Fourier transform, obviously, is the key is that Is the key that the convolution with time or the time memory dependent becomes the multiplication in the Fourier domain? So you can see that the stress term becomes a multiplication. And so that's why this becomes a omega-dependent equation. Omega is the frequency. And so And so now it becomes a Linu equation. And then we can solve, and you can see that this leads to a like look like a Stokes equation. So we can actually solve it using a boundary integral method because we know the Greens function for that. So compare with the, so this is for the viscoglass equations and compare with the steady-Stokes equations. The stead-Stokes equations. The difference is that you can see that this term here is depend on the V-scale depend on the frequency, but this is independent frequency. So the modulus is a real number. So that is in the difference. And this is the, but if you look compare with these two equations, you can see that only the modulus is. The modulus is different between these two. And one is fully complex, and the other one is real. So that is one is independent of the Newtonian fluid is independent of the frequency, but this is the frequency dependent. So that is the difference. And this we call the corresponding principle between the viscous unsteady stopes and viscoelastic fluid. And that's the principle we set out. Principle with so we use this principle to try to induce the properties of this fluid. So in technically, basically, basically we want to compute it in the Fourier domain, then do the inverse Fourier transform to get back to the real time domain. But of course, that step is not easy. So we're going to look at the Fourier domain. Uh so we're gonna look at the Fourier domain. So we non-dimensionalize this uh visco elastic linear equation, Fourier time Fourier domain, and then we get this uh called Brinkman equation. And if you remember that the uh some of you may know that this is actually a parse media model for the but it's not in the Fourier domain, it's in the so I'm I'm gonna abuse the notations of these Fourier domains, so I'm gonna look at it. This is the Fourier domain, this is also Fourier. Is the Fourier domain? This is also Fourier. Just remember, all these parameters are in the Fourier domain, time-fourier domain. So, notice that this is the non-dimensional parameter lambda squared, and it's defined by this complex number. All right, so how do we solve it? So, because as I said, So, because it's a linear equations, and so we have just we're going to do it in the boundary integral method. So, that is that we look at an infinite domain, and then we have, let's say, I just illustrated with two particles here, and then we have the boundaries, and then this is the fluid, and these are the particles, and then we can actually write the velocities in terms of only the value. In terms of only the variables on the boundary of the interface. In this case, it's just the particle surface, surface of the particles. So the V is the velocity, and this integration is only on the boundaries you noticed then. And this F is the traction on the surface, and as I said, is the velocity. And G and T are these are Green's functions associated with the velocity and the stress. Right, yeah, and so these are the Green's function for the Brinkman equation. I'm going to write down this looks very complicated, but that's actually the numerical difficulty challenges are. So, how we actually going to look at it, solve this is that usually, as I said, in the experiments, what they do is that they actually apply forces to let these particles oscillate with a certain frequency. Oscillate with certain frequencies. And then what we're going to try to do is find these attractions on the surface. Once we find the traction on the surface, actually this equation is not only valid on the surface, for the point on the surface, also it's valid everywhere in the fluid. So you can actually, once you find the tractions, you can evaluate the velocities everywhere. All right? So that is the That is the advantage of the Bundle integral method because it reduces a three-dimensional, we're going to consider three-dimensional case, three-dimensional to a two-dimensional because the equation we solve is only on the boundary. Once we solve for the fraction, and we can get the velocity anywhere in the fluid. So, that is the plan. So, we're going to given the velocities of the particle, including the surface, because including the surface because and then we can find the retractions so that is uh so this is what the green's function looks like all right so if you let the a and b um just look at this a and b at the constant this is a very much look like a stokes loot right so green's function for stokes equation but for the brink's equation these uh a and b are the uh these functions of uh These functions of x. X is the distance basically is the lambda times r, r is the distance between two points. This we call the marker points. This is the point, any point on the surface. So if you can see that when r is equal to zero, so this is the, for those of you who are not familiar with the boundary integral method, is that you look at it when we integrated this boundary integral equations, when x at x zero. When x and x0 at the same point, then the g is singular and also this is singular. But when we integrate on the surface, so one of the point is x0, and you integrate around the surface so it can go through this x0 over here. So it's going to be singular at one point. That is the challenge we have face. Okay, usually the challenge of way face in the banana group method. So that is what we're going to actually talk about. Okay, and these functions, you know, Okay, and these functions, you look like a singular because you know that r is going to equal to zero and then this one over x squared is going to blow us up. But actually, it turns out these are actually well-defined smooth functions. Okay, just the way we've written it. But then later on, I would say that this actually matters. If you actually evaluate directly like this, which is the exact form of the Green's function, it will cause this called a runoff error. Uh it's called a runoff error, okay? Because you have a larger number subtract another larger number, it's almost equal, okay, because it's a smooth function, so that it must be almost equal. So it's a so we're gonna deal with, you're gonna see that there's a effect of that, so we're gonna have to deal with that. And this is the uh Bounce function associated with the uh stress tensor, and that is uh it looks very complicated, we can actually try to uh eliminate that. Try to eliminate that. So, that is the next step. I think. Okay, so that is what we already talked about. So, the microbead rheology is basically the particle, you actually know the motion of the particle is oscillating, and you try to find the stress on the surface. So, that's what we do. Okay, so this is what I try to say. So, let me go back to this original. This original. So, this is the boundary integral method. So, there's two terms. This is called a single layer integration, and this is the double layer integration. What we're going to do is we're going to use a trick to eliminate the double layer integral, and it can have only a single layer integral. And the trick is that we can find an exact solution, because these are solid particles, so you have exact solutions if we just do a simple solid. Do a simple solid body motion. So we're going to actually find an imaginary fluid inside the particles so we can eliminate the double integrals. I won't go to detail of this. So this F prime is basically exact solutions. And then you basically find a Q from this single layer integral only. And then it looks much easier. So then you, because you know this exactly, you can recover the true surface. Cover the true surface force. All right. So now I already talked about the challenges. So we have the complex singular behavior when the x and x0 coincide. And then, so the way we do it, the way to solve that is using the idea from a Using the idea from solving a Laplace equation is that we're going to rotate the X0 to the, so if you look at this sphere, because we are looking at the first spherical particles, if you rotate this X0 to the top or the bottom of the sphere, which is South Pole, we've got a South Pole, North Pole, and then we can actually use a very simple trick, and then we prove that the integrand is going to be infinitely smooth. So that is the idea. That is the idea we're going to use. So, this is rotation. So, it's a very simple rotation. You just do an orthogonal basically a rotation of the unit of the householder matrix. And it's very effective, very efficient to compute. So, it's basically a solon rotation. Depending on where the point is, so we want to do the most stable one rotation. So, that is. Rotation. So that is what this formula is about. These are all the household reflection rotation doom. All right, so once we do the rotations, and then we use going to use the spherical coordinate systems to integrate that. So this is the surface integral. So these are the singular integrals once we use spherical coordinates. And the reason we can get rid of the singular integrals is because Singular integrals is because this when it's south or north pole, this theta is equal to zero because zero or pi. So that is going to be basically cancel all the singularities in the integrand. So in other words, let me go back to the syntax proposal. So you can see that this is the finite. So this is the singular. This is also singular. Singular, this is also singular. But if you do the spherical coordinate integrations, and then you can prove that these integrals becomes smooth. The integrand over here is smooth. So this integrand is smooth because we have this term over here. So that's the key. Here. So that's the key. And then we can remember that the integration against the phi is because 0 to 2π is periodic. So you can get a swap-load rule is very accurate. But for the theta, it's not from the North Pole to the South Pole. It is not the periodic, but we can use a transformation to make it a periodic. And that is also an idea from Is also an idea from that CD's paper. So we use that to integrate that as well. So then we can have, depend on the transformation. So this transformation gave us a six order. But if you can get like even orders of accuracy of this integrand, of this integral, using just the tropical in the double trope summations. Right, so okay, so this is the transformed integral, and then as I said, we just use a part of the tropical rule to compute it. It's uniform integrations, and it's a sixth-order accuracy. So, how we know it's it's it's accurate, six-order accurate. So, we basically compare with exact solutions for Compared with exact solutions for a single particles, and you can get exact solutions. So, this is the traction. So, if, and this is the velocity you're given. So, you're given velocity, which is solid body translation, and you can get the traction on the surface. And then we can try to compute that and to compare with this exact solutions. All right, and then this is the table gave us the error. So, you can see that this is the number. You can see that this is the number of points, the marker points, or the discretization. You can think about this as a resolution on the surface. So we integrated. So we use a 6 by 16 and then double that and then double again. So you can see that the error actually decreases. But once we get to this level, you see that the order initially is 6. So the numerical, we can compute the numerical order of convergence is 6. But it actually stops because. But it actually stops, becomes only decreases at this high resolution. And the reason is exactly I said it's because of the Rondoff error. So the Rondoff error of the computer, the Green's function actually affects the order. So that is what we're going to do in the next. So instead of computing the Green's function directly, we're going to actually do the hybrid. So in other words, when the X is, let's say, it's a small. Let's say it's small, we use ATLA expansions. And when x is large, so let's say larger than 10 to the minus 2, then we just directly evaluate the Green's function. So if we use this hybrid, you can see that we recover sixth order at a high resolution as well. So that actually matters. Okay, so now I'm going to go to the result. So this is the primary result because This is the primary result because the results I'm going to show today is all ex-symmetric. We are in the process of computing this non-axisymmetric cases. So this is a single particle case. So this is a unsteady Stokes. So that's why I have this modulus is equal to data functions. So in this case, the Weissenberg number. The Weissenberger number is zero. And so the motion of this, this is a spherical particle. So the motion is actually this particle is moving. So this is different at different times. So it's moving, oscillating in this x direction, all right, back and forth. And these are the streamlines. And you can see that, so this is at time equal to zero. This is just before it actually because four it actually because remember that it's basically as you can think about it is a cosine omega t so the omega t at a zero is when it starts so it's moving to the right and this is just before it reach to the end point of the right okay so this is the streamline of that and then this is this is at coming back so that's why you see that this the streamline patterns are very different is you see a a basically a eddy is over here and then this eddy is The flow has a larger areas when it actually bursts, and then it disappears after it goes back. So, this is just the after goes back. So, you can see the flow dramatically changes when the flow actually reverse directions. Okay, so this is the Newtonian behavior. And now this is the same motion, but it is only interesting. Motion, but this only changes is that it's linear very stolastic. So in this case, it's the one mode. So you see that the modulus relaxation modulus is e to the negative t. So you have only one mode, maps well fluid. So it's negative one. And the wise number is equal to one. And you can see that this is the same time. So all these are the same time compared with the previous case. The case. So you can see that in this case, this actually, there's no eddies here, and then half eddies here, and actually, not just one eddy. I didn't plot the rest of it, but you have a sequence of eddies going further in this direction. And this eddy actually stays there when it comes backwards. So this is, you can compare with the previous one. Oops. So the previous one. So, the previous one is very different, right? So, that is the difference between these two. And this one we simulated using a different geometry. So, this is a spheroid, and with the long axis is in the, I call it a y direction, and the z is pointing towards us. So, you can see that there's this shape. That there's the shape of the streamlines at this time is conform with the shape, basically. And it's a different way. And this is only LBE. So this is different than the ones you before. And this one is aligned with the long axis aligned with x-axis. And you can see that it's different than the previous one. Okay, so this is a two-particle case. And the left one is the unsteady slopes, and the right one is the LVE. And then what we are plotting here is just using different two spheres actually is oscillating in the up and down, right, in this direction. And so you can see that the Direction. And so you can see that this is the, because it's an axisymmetric case. And the difference you see is on the top, you have the normal stress is pointing downwards, whites is negative. And then the color basically, you probably cannot see, but I will plot the stress again. But you will see that actually the stress. So this is the stress. So, this is the stress on the normal stress. This is the unsteady stokes. Okay, so what do you see that in this picture is that the stress around the one S mutual directions or the polar directions, this is the green one is the bottom particle, and the red one is the top particle, and this is a calculation of single particle simulation. Calculation of single particle simulations. So the difference obviously, you can see that is on the top and near the top or near the bottom. So that's the difference. And then the key is compared with this. Okay, so I plotted in the single graph. So you can see that with the basically the same, I would say that this is a very similar lambda squares. Lambda squares. One obviously is purely imaginary because this is a Stokes flow, and then this one is the L V E fully complex. So you can see that it's actually L V E is actually smaller stress on the surface compared with the Newtonian fluid. And so this is when the This is when the previous one, let me actually show you. So, this one, you look at it, look like these are the same. So, the reason is that the omega is very small. So, when omega is small, you see that this is almost identical because this is the square. So, you can see that, in other words, in the slow frequencies, this L V E behaves like stopes. And then, of course, the most interesting case. Course, the most interesting case is when omega is high, which is the next picture. When omega is high, you can see the very long linear behavior shows up in the L V E case, in the linear base fact case, right? Instead of the unsteady slope. I think that's my talk. And this is what we do, it is that we propose a sixth order, and what do we want to? And what we want to do is, of course, in the future, is that we try to do a fully non-axisymmetric three-dimensional calculations and hopefully to find more interesting fuel mechanics behavior of the fluid. Thank you.
