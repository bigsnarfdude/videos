Okay, so good morning everyone again, and thanks for the invitation. So, I was supposed today to talk only about Only about germline somatic association, but I will add a little bit about man coding RNA since we have like some man coding RNA people here. And this is also what I loved before. Yeah, so starting with the outline, yeah, it seems like there is a change in the layout between laptops. So yeah, so I will talk first about mancoding RNA curation. Curation. So, a couple of slides about 7-SkRNA curation and microRNA automated curation pipeline. Then, I will move to the germline somatic mutation association and cancer etiology. I will talk about specific cancer that I'm working on now, which is esophageal adenocarcinoma, EAC. It seems it's not working. It seems it's not working. Yeah, this is the file that I think. But it seems it like doesn't work here. Yeah, but the previous ones does. But there are a couple of slides missing. Okay, I don't know. Maybe we skip the 7 SKR and A because it doesn't appear here. I mean, on my laptop, it's working, but here it's not working. So I just talked like without visualization. So 7-SKRNA is known for the structure of the 7-SK RNA. It was discovered for vertebrates, but it wasn't like really defined for. It wasn't like really defined for invertebrates. So, my first project as a PhD was to refine the 7-SKRNA structure for invertebrates and to see how similar it is to the vertebrates. So, I used mainly two tools, Infernal tool, which based on like covariance models building, which focuses on not only on sequence level, but also the secondary structure of the RNAs. At the end of that project, At the end of that project, I was able to define vertebrates, 7SK RNA structure, secondary structure, and I showed that it's very similar to the vertebrates ones. Yeah, that picture was, so Peter Stadler, he's my PhD supervisor, and he's Maribel's PhD supervisor, and Clara as well. And in this picture, we really discussed the 7-SKR and API. Really discussed the Southern SKRNA project, and everything that came up in this project was from this card. And I would like again to thank Maribel for this impressive picture. And this was also in Mexico, so in Shepherd. Yeah, so moving now to also non-coding RNAs, mainly micro RNAs. So I developed also a pipeline called Mirfix. Pipeline called Mirfix, which curates the microRNA databases. So you can see here the biogenesis of the microRNAs, how like the functional small microRNA, how it's so the biogenesis, how it's processed. So first we have the primary microRNA, then it's cut by dosha, then we get pre-microRNA, and this pre-microRNA is processed by RNA is processed by Dyson. So then we get like two microRNAs. One of them is functional and the second is not. Then by Argonode, it recognizes the functional from the non-functional microRNA, and then also it's processed out. And there is an important feature for the dicer to detect this functional from non-functional that they have two flanking nuclear. Two flanking nucleotides, so they are not like 100% complementary to each other. Yeah, so the point in this pipeline that we included this biological feature, it wasn't included in any of the microRNA curation pipelines before. And this pipeline works on two levels: precursors level and alignments level. So it fixes the precursors because sometimes are wrongly annotated, like the functional should be. Like the functional should be at the five prime, then it's added on the three prime and the way around. So this pipeline fixes this annotation in the databases on two level precursors level, then it checks this pre-micro RNAs in the alignments. Yeah, there is also a slide missing here. So we applied this to Mirbase, Mirbase database. It's from Manchester University. It's one of University. It's one of the biggest or largest databases for microRNAs, like open source microRNAs. And we were able to improve like 78% of microRNA families in that database and also correcting the structure of the microRNAs of pre-microRNAs. Yeah, so now I will move to what I've been doing recently. I mean, I moved from non-coding RNAs to Non-coding RNAs to more like genomics, cancer genomics. I guess most of us we know what is in general cancer, but just like kind of recap that I will use in my next slides. So cancer is like the abnormal cell. So we have abnormal cells that they are dividing uncontrollably and they also invading the other tissues. So the factors can be So, the factors can be genetics, like variants that they are inherited, or can be external, like exposure to certain chemicals, or like bad lifestyle habits, like smoking, excessive smoking, or other habits. So, also, one of the processes that we can see that we have in our bodies, it's called mismatch repair. So, we have a function that So, we have a function that, so sometimes like some errors can happen in DNA replication. So, we can have some mutations, like some nucleotides, they are mutated. We can have some like indils. So, we have a process in our bodies that it's automatically correcting this. But this needs some proteins. And if we have some mutations in those proteins, then we have a deficient or deficiency in this mismatch. Deficiency in this mismatch repair process. So, now moving to the cancer, like specific cancer that I'm working on. It's called esophageal adenocarcinoma. So, quickly, how this cancer is developing. Actually, it's starting from like something, let's say, very simple, which is like gastroesophageal reflux disease. So, in this disease, what's happening is that the acid. What's happening is that the acid is like flowing back from the stomach to the tube connecting the mouth and the stomach. And so, this is just a disease, it's not cancer. But if this is happening for a long time, then another disease is appearing, which called Barrett's disease. And Barrett's disease is like, then you have in this leaning, like this close between the stomach and the esophagia, then it's affected. It's affected. And not all Barrett's disease patients develop, but some of them they can, on long term, also they can develop EAC from Barrett's disease. So some facts about EAC that usually it's discovered like really late. It's also aggressive neoplasm. It's also have like very low five-year survival. Five-year survival rate, like less than 15%. And also, what is interesting is that not like everyone having BE is going to have EAC, only 3.5%, like most studies report this, that progress from BE to EAC. And also, what's known about this cancer is that it's a multifactorial disease. So, it's like a group or polygenic variants that. Group or polygenic variants that they have. It's not like only some defined variants or genes. So just to familiarize some of you with germline and somatic, this is something I didn't know when I was working on non-coding RNAs. So I learned when I moved to this project. So germline variants are the mutations or the DNA changes that they are inherited. So they happen in reproductive. Reproductive cells. And the somatic mutations are the mutations that they are not passed because they happen during the life. So, from like exposure to, as I mentioned before, like external factors. I will show just like briefly related work, and I really like this publication. So, they did something similar to what we are going to do. They tried to find association between the Association between the germline and the somatic. So, for this, they built first like kind of models from the germline, germline variants. I'm not going into details, but yeah, feel free to ask about it. And then they tried, so also they collected somatic mutations and they tried to find the association between this germline variant and the somatic features that they are extracted from somatic mutations. On somatic mutations. So, for this, they used SCAT-O, which is a combined test between Burden and SCAT test to find gene-based variant association between the germline variants and the somatic mutations. And they were able to detect, so, this was, I forgot to mention, this was spine cancer analysis. So, it included. So it included, I forgot what was the number of cancers, but at least I guess like 15 cancers. So they found 207 associations and of course they like, and before they selected 891 known cancer predisposition genes. And they found like 42 genes in 207 associations between the stern and somatic features and 47. Features and 46 unique gene cancer typers were found. So I'm showing this just like to go into. So it's still like in progress, our project we just started, we are preparing the data. So I showed that to show what's the similarity between that work and what we are doing. So also we would like to find the germline somatic association for the EAC that we are working on. For the EAC that we are working on now. So, the idea is to find a polygenic risk score for the germline variants and to collect also the somatic features from the somatic mutations, and then to kind of like find germline somatic association so we can have a risk score for people having BE and how like. Having BE and how likely they will develop EAC. Just also, like a small note, what I mean exactly by polygenic. So, to understand this, I will start with monogenic. So, monogenic is like a trait that is affected or it's a result of one gene or one allele variant. So, for example, like cystic fibrosis is known by one variant, like even though we have several variants. Like, even though we have several variants, but it mainly comes from one variant. So, I come to the polygenic. Polygenic is the opposite, then it's like the trait or the phenotype we have it. It's coming from a group of variants and a group of genes. And this is the case in the EAC. Yeah, so what I mean by polygenic risk score, this is also cut. Risk score: this is also cut. Uh, polygenic risk score. Uh, so what we mean by that is that we develop a score for an individual how likely he will get to EAC from BE. But this score is relative score, it's not absolute score. And we mean by that that it's compared to the other people or other patients in this population, in the same population. Population. Yeah, so to better also understand what is relative, for instance, we have BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations for they are known like 60 to 80% that they can, like people with BRCA1 and BRCA2, they can get breast cancer. Yeah, so at this moment, as I mentioned, we are collecting the data. So the source of our data is ICGC Consortium. And so we had to launch. And so we had to run that germline like from scratch. I mean, like, we have the BAM files, but we don't have the germline calls. And yeah, this needs a lot of computational resources. I mean, like, people who is doing that, they know that challenge in this. And we don't have like our own cluster. So we are using one in Cologne, Cologne City. Yeah, so this took a while, like three or four months, to get it done for 400 patients because some For 400 patients, because some steps in this process take like 11 hours per sample. But luckily, we have the somatic mutations that they are available as VCF files on an ICGC consortium. And what I mean by somatic mutations, I mean single nucleotide variants and short ends, short yeah, indels, they are short insertions and deletions. Yeah, so the main So the main, yeah, so as I mentioned, we have 400 patients. It's all whole genome sequencing data. So when I picked up the somatic mutations or these VCF files, we decided to take the overlap. So the output on ICGC, they are, or the variants, they are called by two tools. One is Sanger pipeline, and the second is G8TK Mutec2. So it is. Mutec2. So we decided to take the overlap so we have more confidence about these mutations. So, what I mean by somatic features that I'm collecting, I mean, there are more somatic features, but at this moment, this is what I have collected so far, like mutational signatures, SNV transcriptive strand bias. This is all based like on NDIS and SNVs, or like counting mutations occurring. Like counting mutations occurring in CTCF cohesing, cohesing binding sites. So, I will explain a little bit about some of these features so you know what I'm talking about. So, starting with mutational signatures, mutational signatures are signatures collected or they are calculated by patterns of mutations, like similar patterns of mutations of single. Of mutations of single nucleotide variants that they are making up specific signature. But it's not only like the mutation itself, but also taking the 3' and the 5' or the 5' and 3' nucleotides into consideration, and then building up what is called a mutational signatures. For instance, also CTCF cohesion binding sites. TCF cohesion binding sites, why we collect data or like we create somatic features on these sites, because this is also known to be one of the factors for cancer. So the role of the CTCF cohesing binding sites that it's sometimes like you have distance between enhancers and promoters. So the role of this CTCF binding sites that somehow like it's like making a tie for the DNA. So it brings For the DNA, so it brings the enhancer and promoters together so the transcription process can start. So, if we have mutations in these binding sites, then like all this isn't happening. So, the transcription process, it's not going on. Yeah, like strand bias, also what I mean. So, yeah, we know that we have genes can be expressed on transcribed or untranscribed strands. Or untranscribed strands, and also it's known that some specific SBS or like single-base mutations, like C2A mutations in, let's say, in liver, it's known to be on the transcribed strand. So, also, we want to try to find this for EAC, or if we have like somehow like clusters of patients that they have different patterns, this is one. And second, This is one. And second, as I mentioned also, that some genes are known to be not some genes, like genes in general, they can be on untranscribed or transcribed strand. Yeah, as I said, this is like incomplete project because we just started on it. But I will show just like some of the outputs, like the somatic features. Like the somatic features, yeah, I guess the plot plots are not working like figures. Yeah, I wanted to see just to show like a heat map for mutational signatures so you know what is mutational signature, but yeah, it seems it doesn't work here. So I would say. So, I will just go on. So, yeah, luckily here I have numbers, not heat maps. Yeah, so transcriptive strand bias. So, just like to get the feeling of this data, how it's collected. So, for instance, here I have two patients and like we have C to A log2 ratio, which means like it's on transcribed or untranscribed strand. So, for every patient, we have this kind of data. Patient, we have this kind of data. This is an example for transcriptive strand bias. And yeah, this is an example also for the hyper X mutation, which means like comparing to the autosome chromosomes, that the mutation rate on the chromosome X is high or not. Yeah, this is also like for the CTCF cohesion binding sites. Also, we did somehow like we collected them. We collected the mutations or we counted the mutations that they are existing on CTCF cohesing binding sites and also like upstream and downstream regions. Yeah, also for like indents and microsatellite regions, microsatellite regions are like small repetitive DNA sequences from one to six nucleotides. So they are also known to be mutated in cancer. In cancer. So, this is kind of BO marker, and usually endels are located in these microsatellites regions. For this feature, I also like split or I grouped like the endels, the size of the indels, like one base per microsatellite, non-microsatellite, two to five base pairs, microsatellite, non-micro-satellite regions. Yeah, this is how I collected this feature. So, here it should be again the heat. So, here it should be again the heat map. So, the question is: to, I mean, I showed like the general question, but now since like we just got done like the germline, I'm thinking like how to proceed with the somatic. I mean, if we can do something with that, like come up with any association, correlation, whatever it's called. So, one idea was: so, if you see the heat map, then you can see some. See the heat map, then you can see some patients they have like really very unique specific signal in one mutational signature, yeah, that it can be like, let's say, deficient mismatch repair. So I thought it would be interesting to see if these signatures or these patients they have this mutational signature. So to which of these somatic features they are correlated. So for instance, if we have like, let's say, 10. We have like, let's say, 10 patients, they have specific endeless micro endels mutation signature, then we check, okay, maybe they have like really high number of mutations in two to five base per industri in microsatellite regions. Yeah, here I come to the end of my presentation. Yeah, I saw, I tried to show some semi-automation. Semi-automated and automated non-coding RNA curation methods. Yeah, I showed also the germline association that we see that it can help also in understanding the cancer etiology, not EAC only, like in general, the cancer etiology. Yeah, and now I would be happy to get questions and also inputs and comments that would be really helpful for me to continue on. Helpful for me to continue on working. So, yeah, I thank you. Any questions? Thank you so much, Bromini and Michael. I just that many. That many of the germline mutations are really inherited because the epigenetics factors modify the chromatin around the gene. So actually you didn't mutate like a genetic mutation on the target of the genome that is maybe the target of the environmental factor of. Environmental factor of the germline, but also you have this sort of modification. So, when you know that the coccin is included there, it's because coccin is one of the main targets that are modified by epigenetic factors. So, it will be very interesting for you to classify the set of the genes that you would like to include in your work. Include in your work as the ones that are included as in all the epigenetics and chromatin modifications because it's really interesting to see that now the cancer is really thinking more like an environmental outcome, especially these cancers that are not mentally inherited. So, because this is quite, I imagine because the reflux. Because the refluk is something that happened to you with very bad habits for eating, not sleeping, you know, in the slope of 30 degrees and something like that. So it's interesting because all this sort of everyday fact that we have with our incoming of food is also affecting, for instance, to the mother who is in pregnancy, and they, you know, the factors iterate. You know, the factors inner and affect the germline, and then you are going to have the second generation with a high risk to outcome or to develop this sort of cancer. So yeah, it's something that I just thinking because I was teaching genetic of the cancer and epigenetic of cancer to my students, and sometimes I pure these things happen. So, okay. Thank you. I guess, not, I guess, I will consider this. I mean, we didn't look. Consider this. I mean, we didn't look yet at like the epigenetic part, so we still focus now on the whole genome, whole exome sequencing. But yeah, I guess it would be interesting to have kind of like gene list coming from there and then checking it in the somatic or the germline variants. Any other question? Okay, then thank you, Arlia, again.
