So, my talk is towards the steepest descent methods for 2D oscillating integrals. And I'm making this work together with Rafael Pacier and Andrei Karlkov, who are now both in the University of Manchester. What is the subject of the study? Subject of the study. The main subject of the study is a 2D Fourier integral, like this, which is a model integral to a lot of important problems. As you see, this is a typical integral that people in perturbation theory like. So it has the phase function g and it has a transformant function u. Who are assumed? You who are assumed to be known. And lambda is a large parameter. And of course, typically we are focused on asymptotically estimating this integral with lambda growing to infinity. We assume that function g is holomorphic everywhere and the transformant u is analytic. I mean that Analytic, I mean that it can be it is halomorphic almost everywhere. It is halomorphic everywhere except the possible singularities sigma, which are composed of different components. And I forgot to say that the integration is held in the variables variables ψ1 and ψ2. And the integration is held over the surface gamma, which is close to. Which is close to the real plane. I will say a few words about it. Psi are variables along which I integrate, and that is one or several parameters of the problem, which may be also complex. The singularities studied here. Studied here are polar singularities or branch singularities. As it is known from the theory of several complex variables, they are usually analytic sets and their complex dimension is one. So it means that the surfaces, their real dimension is two. We make an additional restriction making our life possible. Making our life possible. So we say that our singularities have real property. We introduce this term by ourselves. Real property, roughly speaking, means that intersection between each component of singularities and the real claim has real dimension too. How I make it back. Two examples of singularities. Of singularities for straight line, so ψ1 is equal to 1. It is here. You see that I draw here the real plane, and in the real plane, the intersection between the singularities, which is a plane actually, is a straight line. And this singularity is a circle, but again, it is a complexified circle. It has some sophisticated topology, but it's intersecting. Topology, but its intersection with the complex plane is a circle. It is not a general case. If we take any two surfaces in a complex space of two complex variables, which is four-dimensional space, the intersection between two surfaces will be generally a point. And it is, you know, not very good. We will not be able to work with it. But fortunately, in our practice, But fortunately, in our practical situations, our singularities do have real properties. I should say that our transformants can be ugly. For example, consider the transformant like this. It has, due to this factor, due to the square root of 1 minus ψ1 minus 2, it has two branch lines here and here. And the second square root gives Second square root gives a circle, but near the integration plane, we see only a half of the circle. Well, you can understand it by studying what branch is taken here and here. Or our transformance can be very ugly. This is a picture from our paper about quarter plane diffraction. In fact, in this case, we don't know. In fact, in this case, we don't know the transformant itself, but we know its singularities. And there are some straight lines, green lines, are polar lines, red lines are branch lines, and you can see a part of a circle. So, in all these cases, we are interested in the estimation of our integral. Let me say a few words about the surface of integration. The surface of integration. I have said that the surface of integration should be close to the real plane just because the origination of our integral is some Fourier integral, and we start from some integration over the real plane. But it should avoid the singularities somehow. It should be indented near the singularities. A realistic bypass is given. Bypass is given to something like this. We take our singular integration surface as a product of slightly shifted real line and real line. This is a typical situation. This shift can occur, for example, if we consider the spectral variables as omega in the time domain and k in the coordinate domain. Then, typically, in time domain, we make Typically, in time domain, we make not Fourier but Laplace transform. And this epsilon comes from the Milin inversion of the Laplace transform. Some of our achievements with Rafael, and I hope that Rafael has told something about it before, is that we introduced graphic notations for indentation of our surface of integration over. Our surface of integration over the singularities. These graphic notations are shown in the right part of the picture. They are bridges. Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, if we have a singularity like this, and if we have an integration surface gamma, which is close to real plane, there are two possible ways to bypass the singularity. Uh, bypass the singularity. Roughly speaking, it is the bypass from above and the bypass from below. Uh, the bridges notation are inspired by the usual 1D analog of the contour integration. As usually, if we draw the contour integration, a contour of integration in the complex plane and we meet some. We need some singularities. We bypass them either from below or from above. And what we draw here are just the bridges. And these bridges are similar to this case. This is a convenient and useful notation, in fact. An example of the identity integral is shown here. You can recognize this integral. This is a representation of This is a representation of the Green's function of 3D space for the Himgoltz equation. And you can see that this integral purely falls into the class of integrals which we have in mind. The spectral, the phase function is here, and the transformant has a singularity, which is a circle. The bridge. Is the circle. The bridge shows the bypass of the circle, and you should know the result of the integration. This integral can be taken exactly. So we introduce the class of integrals that we are working with. Now, what is the current status of this study? We have published a couple of works. Of works that generalize to the 2D case, what is known as stationary phase method. And now we are trying to make this method nicer and go from the stationary phase method to the steeper's descent method. Let me explain the difference between them as I understand it. Consider the internet. It. Consider the integral like this. In this integral, I collected all difficulties that could come to my mind. First of all, its phase function has a saddle point, a saddle point, a stationary phase point, and the so it's pretty known, and it is at zero. And it is at zero. We have a pole and we have a branch point. Branch point is minus one, and the pole is here. So what is the stationary phase method? The stationary phase method is a small deformation of the red contour here. So we stationary phase method is like this. We deform our contour slightly. We know in some places it should be. In some places, it should be deformed from the real line to above, and in some places, to below, to make the integrand function, the exponential factor exponentially decaying almost everywhere. When we make such a deformation, we get some term related to the pole, some term related to the branch line, and some term related to the Term related to the saddle point. This is stationary phase method. And what is the steepest descent method? The steepest descent method is like this. We make the same deformation, but stronger. Here, the deformation is very, very small, and this is enough to make the first estimation of the integrals. And here we deform the initial red contour to the proper contours of the steepest descent. Contours of the steeper's descent. Why the steeper's descent method is better than the stationary phase method? First of all, in some cases, the estimation given by the steeper stationary phase method are not enough. Actually, we can have some wave components which are exponentially small, and we should come to them by developing. Should come to them by deformation of our quantum. So we can miss some wave components if we use only stationary phase method. The steepest descent contours provide the most efficient numerical integration. If we are focused on numerical stuff, it is better to have a deeply deformed quantum and integrate on it. Then the third is the whole integrals become split into terms. It is a philosophical Into terms. It is a philosophical question, actually. If we make the complete deformation of our integral, for example, in the previous case, I can say that my integral is split in this term, this term, and this term. So I will have exactly three wave components, which are not approximations, which are exact parts of the field. And now we have. And now we have built an analog of stationary phase method, and we are trying to build a steepest descent method. So, what do we know from the this is a slide with a crash course on multivariable complex analysis? What do we know? First of all, Cachy theorem works for two variables. Second, to look smarter, one should use notations like this instead of this. Instead of this. And moreover, one should know what is this widge, for example, to implement the integrals numerically. And this widge is a simple stuff. Actually, it is some determinant, but one should not forget to put this determinant into the MATLAB program. Third, singularities are not points, they are surfaces now. And fourth, crossing of singularities are still points. So, maybe this is the whole thing that you should deny. What are our main results of our stationary phase method? If we have some integral with some singularities, we state that there is a locality theorem. So, the estimation of our integral typically can be given by several terms provided by special points. The types of special Points. The types of special points are like this. First of all, this is a saddle point where the gradient of the phase function is zero. This is the most known case, actually. Everybody knows that, well, at least one can take a book by Fidayuk and try to find everything about this. So this is the known part of the science. And two other points are mostly introduced by us. First of all, this is saddle on the singularity. So, some special points can occur on the singularities when the restriction of our phase function to the singularity has zero gradient. So, an example of such a point is here. You can see that it is located on the singularity sigma one. Singularity sigma one. And second, and the third, if there are crossings of singularity components, then one can expect also a special point that can produce a term of integral. For example, a crossing of singularities is studied in the paper about excitation of waves in the In the when there is ice on some lake and air above this ice, and the guy hits ice by a stick, and there is some funny whistle occurring in this case. This is described in paper one, and I put also three other papers that made bias in this direction. So let us start. So, let us start to construct the steepest descent method for a singularity. Our inspiration again goes from the 1D case. Consider the simple integral shown here. The phase function is very simple. The phase function is just xi. There is one variable xi, and this function is xi. This function is ψ. And there is a branch point equal to 1. The initial quantum of integration is shown just in the left. Let us see how we construct our steepest descent quantum. We are trying to elevate our quantor because our phase function provides exponential decay when psi has a positive imaginary part. Has a positive imaginary part. So we elevate our contour, but we should bypass the branch point. So we have a contour like this. Look, it is constructed of a horizontal part, then some vertical parts, and something here. And we elevate our contour higher, higher, and higher until it disappears, until the integral over it becomes Becomes zero. And Andrey Karalkov made a beautiful demonstration of quantum deformation for me. You can see how it happens as a movie. So let us consider it again. What is our quantum? What happens here? We call a root. A root, not like in mathematics, but like in In mathematics, but like in a vegetable or you know, plant, then we have a stem which grows, and finally we have a green remainder. When we build our contour like this, we put the remainder on a line on which imaginary of the phase function is constant and it is equal to a and a goes. To A, and A grows from zero to infinity. And the root is something that comes from the initial quantum of integration. And the stem is built step by step by pairs of points, like this. This pair of point, we call it gamma dependent. Gamma dependent on A. So this each such pair is gamma of A with growing A. Note that when we build our stem, we make the real part of the phase function constant. This is a good choice because in this case we prevent oscillation of integral over this line. Over this line when we compute it numerically. Finally, our resulting contour will be the root plus all such pairs of points. Note that our gamma of A lives at the location, well, location in this situation means point, but next it will not be point. At which phase function. Point at which phase function is C, which is a constant value defined by root, and A, which is which varies from zero to infinity. So this is a very, very deep explanation what happens in 1D. What happens in 2D? Let us consider a similar integral, but in 2D. We have just the same phase function, it depends on a function it depends on a single variable ψ1 and we have some singularity from our previous work we know where will be the root the root is exactly our special point which is called sedence of singularity so here we can expect that something will start to happen and then let us consider the plane psi 1 Consider the plane psi1 equal to 1 plus IA. Psi1 is phase function. And look, in this plane, we have two branch points due to our singularity. And we need to build what was the pair of points in 1D. Now it is not a pair of points, it is a contour. And surprisingly, this contour will be an eight loop. I will explain. I will explain, try to explain later why it is a loop here and different contours in other cases. So, in our case, the root will be somewhere here and the stem will be like this. I tried to draw a nice picture showing what is the root, the stem, and the remainder in this case. The stem is a set of these eight loops, and the remainder is And the remainder is more or less a plane to which we are trying to attach our stem. And the root is attached to the stem from below. Note that here I have drawn the picture exactly G is equal to, well, C plus A. This is a plane. This is a plane. It has two singularities. And we need to build some contour gamma, which is a cross-section of our stem. Notice that the contour is flexible. Actually, unlike in the 1D case, we have a freedom to select our surface. And there is no good way to say where we should put such a surface. Actually, we can choose any contour provided that. Any contour provided that the family of this contour makes a continuous surface. It may be strange, but nothing happens at the branch points. So if we take a straight line just going around the branch points, we gain nothing. We can take any plane and the properties of the integral will be more or less the same. Another case is the Another case is the crossing of singularities. Here is an example integral for the crossing of singularities. There are two branch lines corresponding to square roots here and here. And again, a very simple phase function. Again, we know where will be the root. The root is the crossing of the singularities. And surprisingly, I know how to build a stem. Know how to build a stem. A stem in this case looks like this, and the cross-section of the stem is a Pochgeimer contour by passing the singularities two times here and there. And again, I will make a picture explaining why here it is a Pagamer column. The root in this case is a torus. And here is a short hint why it should be a Taurus because let us consider. Because let us consider a small domain in which we should bypass two singularities. For this, we introduce angles phi 1 and phi 2, and the plane of phi 1 and phi 2 reasonably produce you the torus, gives you the torus. Finally, what is let us consider the saddle point. Now there are no singularities. Now there are no singularities, but there is a complicated function g. And now, when we build this space in which g is equal to a constant, we see that this space has a non-trivial topology. It is not a plane. It has no singularities, but it is not a plane. It is a sort of a tube. And our cross-section of the stem is The stem is a contour on this tube. Again, we have some freedom to choose such a contour. For example, it can be something like this. But the family of such contours should be continuous. So our stem is shown here. The root is a point. The stem is a collection of circles. And now, the most funniest part of the talk: how we construct the root. Again, let's Again, let us return to 1D motivation. How we construct the route. We put our lines horizontally, like this. Like this, this, this. We put a family of lines. And we are trying to start from some minus epsilon and increase the value of A. So we go from these lines to these lines. When we are here, When we are here, we have a trivial cross-section of our quantum. The trivial cross-section means that in the space we can go from one point to another and they will disappear, they will kill each other. But then we cross some topological catastrophe and then we go to the case where the pair of points is not trivial. We cannot travel like this, and the points will not disappear. Will not disappear. Let us try to make something similar in the 2D case. First, let us consider the singularity crossing. If we take a singularity crossing, I carefully study the phase function like this. I take Psi 1, slightly small imaginary, and I have a 3D space, which is an imaginary part of Psi 1. imaginary part of ψ1 equal to minus epsilon. In this space, the singularities are two lines. They are blue and green. And the contour is trivial. I put a trivial loop between the singularities. Then I increase A, and when it is zero, I have a topological catastrophe, catastrophe there. And finally, when I increase A. A, I will have a non-trivial loop. And look, this non-trivial loop can be folded one time and the second time, and it is a Power Gamer quantum. A similar consideration can be done when it is settled on singularity. So I take the singularity like this, and again, I move my cross sections. First, I have T L loop, then I have a catastrophe. Have a catastrophe. And then when the catastrophe ends, I get a non-trivial loop. The last part of the last slide, more or less a couple of slides of the talk, is thanks to Dan Huybrecht, who advised us to consider not only the singularities produced by the transformant, but also to consider the Also, to consider the integrals which go the integrals over bounded domains. He said that we can consider the integral, for example, over a circle limited by this line. And the idea is like this: let us consider the integral limited by, for example, a shortcut. Let us complex. A circle. Let us complexify this circle. So, in fact, the circle is a cross-section of the complexified circle, which is an analytical set. And there is an important notice. If we have a halomorphic function, its integral over the analytic surface will be zero. That's why we can deform our contours on the boundary as well. And we will have something like. Will have something like saddle points on the boundary, crossing of the boundaries with the singularities, and for example, crossing of two boundary components, and they will produce the terms very close to what we studied before. The idea is very same. The conclusions that first we can deform our integral initial surface and build a sum of components. Components of the integral, and we can expect funny topology of our stems, which is not clear from the very beginning, was not clear from the beginning, and it is a sort of our discovering this. So, thank you very much.
