Thank you very much, Elaine. And thank you to Elaine, Karma, and Marielle for giving me this opportunity to talk. And like everybody, I wish we were in bands, but this is a different experience for sure. So I'm going to be talking about lattice models of polymers and nano channels, and I'm going to be focusing And I'm going to be focusing mainly on some work done by Jeremy Ng as part of his sort of final chapter of his PhD thesis. And it's ongoing. And I'm also going to talk about some recent contributions made by Jada Jesse, who's at this conference. And but it's all built on other work that I've done in collaboration with people like Nick Beaton. With people like Nick Beaton, Kai Shahara, Koya Shimakawa, Marielle Vasquez, and Rob Sharine more recently. And as well as my other PhD student, Matthew Schmerler. And other students currently involved are Esne, Arsuaga Vasquez, and Matthew, who are also here. All right, so I'm going to start with some motivations for why I'm looking. For why I'm looking at nano channels and what the connection to biomaterials might be. And similar pictures to what Christian showed in the very first talk in this workshop. So people are interested in modeling DNA. There's DNA experiments for DNA and nano channels and nanopores. And in particular, the experiment. In particular, the experiments usually involve some electrokinetically driven process where the DNA is either forced into a nano channel or forced through a pore. And the Plaza experiments showed that you can use the translocation of a DNA through a pore to identify whether it's knotted or not. Whether it's knotted or not, and even the knot type. And so, but people have been modeling, as Christian showed, these using molecular dynamics. And in particular, there's some, I'm going to focus on linking for the most part in this talk. And there's some recent molecular dynamics work by Caraglio, Orlandini, and Whittington, where they looked at. Where they looked at linked polymers translating through a pore. And so, of course, in order to be able to sense the different link types, the length of time that it translates through the pore matters and also how much damping the molecule makes when it goes through the pore. And so, this is all connected. And so this is all connected to what is the size of the linked part, for example. And Christian talked about this in his talk, and so I stole this slide from his paper. And so what he showed in sort of one kind of confinement that in fact Confinement that in fact the size of the linked part doesn't actually depend on the chain of the link, the polymer. But even in the bulk or even in some other situations where the overlap region might be larger, it still never grows linearly with n. So in the bulk, I think he said that it grows like the length n to 0.36. 0.36. And so that, so essentially, then the linked part is localized in these situations. However, if you look at sort of cat veins that come from replication, or this is an electron micrograph of a replication intermediate, you've got two DNA and DNA and they're sort of interacting over a longer space. And so it's unclear whether you could say the linking here is localized or not. So the DNA experiments point to some open questions about the characteristics of knots and links at equilibrium. So most of the DNA experiments are non-equilibrium. Experiments are non-equilibrium, but there's still some related questions that one can look at using equilibrium models. And so, for example, what's the typical size of a knotted or linked part relative to the length of the polymer? And this leads to mathematical questions. How does one measure the knot or the link size? And then are the knots or links localized and to what extent? And so one sort of definition of localized, say, for example. Definition of localized safer knots is if you have a length n polymer, if the size of the knot is m, then if m goes over n goes to zero, then we say the knot is localized. And if m is basically going like a constant independent of the chain length, we say it's strongly localized. Whereas if m goes like a constant times n to a power less than one, then we say it's weakly localized. And then another And then another type of question comes up is: can we distinguish between different modes of knotting or linking? And I'll say later more what I mean about that. And are some modes more probable than other? But basically by mode, I mean different geometrical configurations that the knot or link can take on and are some more probable than others. And so we've been using lattice polygon models confined to a tubular sublattice with a simple cubic lattice and transfer matrix methods. And transfer matrix methods to address these questions both rigorously and via Monte Carlo simulations. So, just do a sort of a quick overview of we first looked at just single polygon, the single polygon case. And so this is representing a self-avoiding polygon, ZAP for short, in a tube where we allow the polygon to grow in the X direction without banging. In the x direction without bound, but we put a bound on the height and the y width of the polygon. And so this one, in this picture, the height is restricted to one and it can go out in two in the y direction. So this is, we call it a one by two tube or two by one tube, depending on the order that you write that. You write that. And we can measure the size of a polygon. We look at measuring the size of the polygon two different ways. So one, counting the number of edges or counting the span in the x direction. So in this case, the span is six. And so we've also been interested in sort of an extreme case. interested in sort of an extreme case where given a span, every vertex of the polygon occupies every vertex of the lattice within that span. We call those Hamiltonian polygons. And they have been used previously by others to model densed packed proteins. So in the simplest situation, we can just assume, for example, that each polygon For example, that each polygon of the same size is equally likely, and if we measure size by span, then that would mean the probability of a given polygon would be one over the total number of polygons in the tube with span S. And here we're counting, we're assuming that all the polygons start in the leftmost x equals zero plane. So they have a vertex in that. So, they have a vertex in that plane. And then the reason we can use transfer matrices is because basically these are essentially linear objects. So they're only really growing in the x direction. And so we can really think of a polygon as a word where we can consider on, say, the first band, we consider any kind of Consider any kind of configuration of edges and vertices that could occur in some polygons. And those are for each of those configurations, say, we have a row of our matrix. And then if one of those configurations can immediately follow the one that we started with, then we put a non-zero entry in the transfer matrix. Matrix and the entry stores information about how many edges we've added or how much span we've added and that kind of thing. And so you get a transfer matrix and from the transfer matrix you can actually get the you can relate it to what's called in just quantum mechanics knowledge the grand canonical partition function for the polygons or in combinatorics. The polygons, or in combinatorics, it would be a generating function for the counts. So here, this is the number of polygons span S with n edges. And it's related to, it can be related to the powers of the transfer matrix in an equation like this. And then, but because we end up getting an infinite sum of powers of the transfer matrix, Powers of the transfer matrix, we can relate that to the determinant. We can relate that to eigenvalues of the transfer matrix. And in fact, you can get from the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix, you can relate that to the radius of convergence of this generating function. And that's also related to the free energy for the model in statistical mechanics. And we And we consider two different ways of measuring polygon size, either the number of edges or the span. Most of what I'm going to say, practically everything I'm going to say, it doesn't matter which one of those you choose. I'll be able to say something theoretically the same about either situation. And when it comes to the numerical data that I show, I usually focus on measure. I usually focus on measuring by span because that's the case where we get more knots and links. So in terms of polygons, we've done quite a bit. You can show theoretically, you can use a transfer matrix. Actually, you don't even need to use the transfer matrix, but you can get a pattern theorem and you can show that all but exponential. And you can show that all but exponentially few, sufficiently large self-avoiding polygons are knotted. So that's the so-called Frisch, Washterman, and Delbert conjecture. And you can also show that they're highly complex knots as the length grows. Some of the advantages of being in the tube is that you can do not identification more simply because it turns out there's a Turns out there's a you can, you know, there's a density of these places I call two sections where you could break up a polygon into smaller polygons, and these would be connect sums. And so then really I only have to look at the smaller polygons and at least for small spans, the majority of them will be unknots and only a few of them will contain our knotted pattern. Our knotted pattern and also gives us a way to define knotted patterns. We can also say a bit more theoretically in the tube than you can outside the tube for unconstrained. So outside the tube, you can show that the number of polygons, the number of unknotted polygons has an exponential growth rate. And the Frisch-Wasserman-Delbert conjecture proof says that that exponential growth rate is strictly less. Exponential growth rate is strictly less than that for all polygons. But it's conjectured both in the tube and outside the tube that if you want to relate polygons with a fixed knot type to those with unknown, it's believed they have the same exponential growth rate. But there's an extra factor n to the power fk where fk is the number of knot factors in the prime not. In the prime NOT decomposition of the NOT K. And so this is believed to be true in the tube as well as outside the tube, but we actually have strong numerical evidence supporting it in the tube. But also in the one by two tube, so that's the smallest tube that admits knotting, we can actually prove bounds that show that this behavior holds for certain knot types. And so that's the not types. And so that's the only model where such a proof is known. And this kind of scaling is consistent with the kind of thing that Christian mentioned, where the knots are actually localized and you basically have an unknot, a decorated unknot. And in the tube, the knot tends to go sort of like a Poisson model. Model in terms of their appearance. And what we identified is that, and also Christian and his students also identified this: that you can have prime knots occurring in two different modes. This is the trefoil. This we call the two-filament mode. And this would be the single-filament mode. So either you need both strings to create the knot, or you only need one of them. And for the small tube sizes, And for the small tube sizes, we show that we've found numerically that the two-string one is more probable than the single-string one. However, some recent results that we have, and you can't really see from this graph, but this graph is just to say that when we increase the tube size, the fact that the two-filament ones are more probable stays, but they become less probable. it becomes they become less probable than before so the difference in the probabilities decreases okay so that's what we can say about what we've done with tubes with polygons so what about linking so some questions that uh we've looked at uh so related to not you have the fresh washerman delgra delberg conjecture that all but exponentially and exponentially few are um Exponentially few are knotted, is there a model where we can say that about links? And then is linking localized or not? So, and some results have been done for this on the lattice. And I just sort of summarize them here. So, first of all, so this would be a scenario similar to one that Christian talked about. You have You have two polygons in the tube, but in order to talk about linking probabilities, you have to actually force these two polygons to be gathering to be together in some sense. Otherwise, they would just drift apart and you wouldn't have any linking at all. And so, with some mild restrictions on forcing them together, you can. You can show that the exponential growth rate of the linked ones is the same as the unlinked ones. So, in this model, unlinking is not exponentially rare. You can show the exponential growth rates are the same. And the linking is localized in the sense that the links are Are don't grow linearly with the size of the system. All right, so but so we saw in the picture of the replication cat names, you know, that linking might not really be localized. Maybe the Delocalized, maybe the two polygons are together for a while. Or, for example, if we wanted to focus in on what's happening in the overlap region here, then one can look at a model that we've studied quite a bit, which is we call them two-saps. So, pairs of polygons which have the same span in the tube. So, this is a picture of a smallest. Of a smallest span hop link in the two by one tube. So the one polygon is red, the other is blue, and they both have span three. And this one actually happens to be a Hamiltonian one. Every vertex is occupied in that span. And then you can have bigger ones. So this one is a picture in a four by one tube with span 50. So So, as I said, we can think of this as sort of modeling the overlap region of the two polygons, or maybe a situation. I don't really know what the real application of this is to a biomolecule problem, but situation where both polygons are forced to be together for some time. And what did I want to say? Something. All right, so what can we prove about? What can we prove about these? So you can prove, you can get a transfer matrix for these things, and you have a concatenation argument. So here's one two-stop, theoretical two-stop on the left here. Here's another one on the right. And we can find a sequence of edges where we can always join. Where we can always join sort of a leftmost edge of one of these polygons and sorry, a rightmost edge of these two rightmost edges to these two leftmost edges and create a new two-sap. So take two arbitrary two-saps. There is a way to connect them together and get a new two-sap. And so because of that type of argument, you can show that the exponential growth rate of two-steps exists. of two saps exists. And you could use a similar argument to connect pairs of, concatenate pairs of linking number zero two SAPs. You can do this concatenation so that you don't change the linking number. And so you can show that the exponential growth rate of linking number zero two SAPs exists. Or similarly, you could have, if you look at the You could have, if you look at the subset of two-step where the polygons are unlinked, you can preserve that in this concatenation that the two polygons are not unlinked, sorry, unknots. But you cannot preserve the fact that if these two polygons, two tooth halves rather, are unlinked, this concatenation does not preserve the fact that they're unlinked. That they're unlinked. So we don't have a proof that the exponential growth rate of unlinks exists. And this is a picture that Koya Shimakawa, an example Koya Shimakawa gave me. So this is an unlink, and this is a mirror image of it. And if I remove these edges here and try to concatenate those to unlink two-saps to create a new toothap. To create a new two-step, the resulting one is going to be a non-trivial link. So this, this opens one, this is one of the open questions we have is what do these two fat unlinks look like most of the time? So one of the problems with this particular unlink is that if we look at it here, if I keep these two versions. Keep these two vertices and these two vertices fixed, then there's no way for me to apply Riedemeister moves on the left to reduce this to separate those two polygons. They're not separable if I keep these endpoints fixed. And so we can look at a subset where of to unlink two steps where you To unlink two saps where you can separate those. But it's a question of whether they are, they dominate or whether there's enough of these other kinds that can come in still leaving the unlink and to increase the quantity. Okay, so that's one of the open questions that we're looking at. This is just This is just to say that the number exponential growth rate of two SAPs is strictly less than that of polygons. And then from work with Klaus Ernst and using some results of Nakanishi from 1983, you can actually show that there's a pattern that guarantees non-trivial, guarantees linking. Guarantees linking in these two steps. And we can construct such a pattern in the three by one tube. And so, with the pattern theorem that we can get from the transfer matrix for two saps, we can show that all but exponentially few two-saps are linked. And so we do have, in this case, SWD type result for links. All right. All right, and so we can also use the transfer matrix to generate random 2SAP and we can look at various quantities. So I don't know, this picture doesn't show up very well. But so this on the left is a graph of for Hamiltonian two-stops in various tube sizes, two by one. Various tube sizes, 2x1, 3x1, 4x1, 2x2, it's the log of the probability of being unlinked versus the span. And so we see that as the span gets larger, these are getting more negative. And we have the same thing, same kind of behavior if we don't restrict the Hamiltonian 2SAP. And so what we're looking at here. What we're looking at here, the slopes of these lines are the log of the ratio of what would be the exponential growth rate of the unlinked to the exponential growth rate of all two SAPs. And if these two were the same, then the slopes would be zero. But because they're negative, it means the exponential growth rate of unlinks, assuming it exists, is strictly less than that for all two steps. So that's just confirming that all but exponentially few are That all but exponentially few are unlinked. And then this graph is: we believe that if you fix the link type, that the link should have the same exponential growth rate as the unlinked. So the exponential growth rate, if it exists, should not depend on link type. And these graphs are providing numerical evidence for that. So if the slope That. So, if the slopes are going to zero here, then that's an indication that the exponential growth rates are independent of link type. And then we also have numerical evidence for the case if you have a link with a not factor that the not factor increases the exponential growth rates we expect to be the same, but the To be the same, but the extra knot factor adds one to the exponent the way I showed for the knot statistics. And so we have evidence supporting this. The fact that the slope indicates the difference in the end. Oh, the slope indicates the difference in the entropic exponent, and so I believe the slope is close to one here. So this one has an exponent one more than this by this evidence. But we haven't got enough data for higher spans to look at whether, for example, the hot flink has an Has an exponent that's one more than the unlink, although that's a plausible assumption, and that's something that we're looking at further. So, but in order to get back to get back at sort of what happens, you know, for example, for these unlinks, how complicated are they really? Like, how often do Could I connect to unlinks and still get an unlink? So, one way we're looking at this recently, and this is work that Jada Jesse has done, is we start with a two-stop. In this case, this is an unlink. And we find a suitable first four sections, so a section with four edges. And I don't have time to go through what suitable means, but we remove those four edges. Those four edges. So then we get two two-stream tangles, but then we've chosen them so that we can close off them immediately and get two two-steps. So in this case, the two two-saps do end up being unlinked. But we looked at how likely that is. So first of all, the average span of that smaller two-sap goes to roughly a constant. This is in the two by two tube around something between 14. Around something between 14 and 15, a span goes, and we do expect that to be the case. But if you start with the unlink in a two by two tube, then as the spin gets bigger, still the majority are go to unlink, unlink, but it's you know only around 80%. And you do start to see going to the hop link and the hop link. Hop link and the hot link, around 10% of those. And the ones we've seen so far, they all have, they break into two of the same number of crossings, but with different orientations. So that's because the unlink has to have linking number zero, I suspect. But I don't know, probably other things could happen here. So I think I'm out of time, so I better stop. Sorry, thank you. Sorry, thank you. Thank you very much, Chris.
