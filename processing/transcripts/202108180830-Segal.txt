So, hello, everyone. So, this topic is something fairly new to me. I got into it when I met Catherine and Andre Nies a couple of years ago at a meeting. And Andre Nies asked me this question about which, well, he was interested in the question of which groups can be defined up to isomorphism. Up to isomorphism just using first-order logic. So I can move on to the first slide, I think. My vague question is: how much can you say about a group in first-order language? And usually not very much, because most group theoretic properties involve talking about subgroups and subsets and things like that, which don't fit very well with first-order logic. So, Andre's particular question was: which groups are actually determined up to isomorphism by a first-order logic? By a first-order sentence, there's also a more general question which has been studied by quite a lot of people, which is which groups are completely determined by all their first order properties. In other words, what's called their elementary theory? And there are some famous questions about that. For example, Tarski's problem on free groups, which was solved by Selil Sella, who proved that all non-abelian free groups have the same elementary theory, so you can't distinguish them by first order. Theory, so you can't distinguish them by first-order properties. So, how does this go? There we are. We say a group is finitely axiomatizable, or FA for short, in some class of groups, C. If there is a sentence sigma such that G is the unique member of the class that satisfies sigma. Of course, you have to specify the class of groups because general principles of logic tell you. General principles of logic tell you that if some first order theory has an infinite model, then it has infinite models of arbitrarily large cardinalities. So if you have an infinite group which satisfies a sentence, then there will be other even bigger infinite groups which satisfy the same sentence. So you have to specify the class of groups to some extent to make it interesting. In particular, the kind of groups that Andrei Niso. The kind of groups that André Nies was interested in are the finitely generated groups, and he called the group quasi-finitely axiomatizable, if it's finitely axiomatizable in the class of finitely generated groups. And rather surprisingly, quite a lot of non-trivial examples were found of this phenomenon: that a single first-order sentence can actually determine the structure of a group if you assume the group is finitely generated. And a very nice theorem was proved by Augé and Sabin, who actually characterized which finitely generated nilpotent groups have this property of being quasi-finitely axiomatizable. So I won't tell you what their theorem is because we actually produced an analogous result, which I'll come to in a minute. Okay, so the reason Andre asked me this question was Andre asked me this question was because I'm more familiar with profinite groups. Now, a profinite group is in some ways very big. It's uncountable unless it's finite. But in other ways, it's rather like a finite group. And so there's some chance of talking about pro-finite groups using first order language in a way that you can't talk about infinite groups in general. Because a finite group, for example, Because a finite group, for example, is obviously axiomatizable. You can simply express its multiplication table in a first-order logic, in a first-order sentence. Okay, so how do we talk about subgroups? Subgroups are quite difficult to talk about in a first-order way, but what is easy to talk about is sets like this, which I'm about to describe. So if you have a definable sub-set, So, if you have a definable subset X of a group G, for example a finite one, then the subgroup it generates is usually not definable. And if you're in a pro-finite group, you're also interested in the closed subgroup it generates, which is even bigger and even less likely to be definable. However, what is easy to define is the set of all products of n elements from your set. That's kind of obvious, easy to say. To say when element of a group is equal to product of n elements from some definable set x. Okay, so this is interesting in profinite groups because if X is a finite subset of a profinite group G, the subgroup it generates is closed, which I write X. The subgroup generated by X is equal to its closure. By x is equal to its closure, putting a bar on it, if and only if it actually consists of products of bounded length of the generators. That's a fairly elementary observation depending on the bare category theorem, but it's the key to a lot of stuff that we're going to talk about in a minute. So, one says that the subgroup X generated by X has finite width with respect to its generating set X. If every element X, if every element of the subgroup is actually a product of n elements from the subset. Okay, and as I said, that's equivalent to the subgroup being closed in a profinite group. Okay, now the reason we can do good stuff in profinite groups is this wonderful theorem due to Nikolov and Siegel, which says that if you have a finitely generated profinite group, that means it's generated topologically. means it's generated topologically by finitely many elements then each of the power subgroups is closed that this is the subgroup g to the m is the subgroup generated by all mth powers of elements okay so as i said above to say that this subgroup is closed means that every product of nth powers is equal to a product of boundedly many mth powers some number depending on m and the number M and the number of generators of the group you started with, as it happens. That's all you need to know. Okay, so each such subgroup is closed. And then for other reasons, the Burnside problem, it's actually then open, which is important for the next thing. But because of what I said before, being closed, it's definable because of this product of bounded width. Okay. Now the finite quotients of a Now the finite quotients of a profinite group are simply the quotients by open normal subgroups. And every open normal subgroup contains one of these power subgroups. So the upshot of this is that you can describe all the finite quotients of your pro-finite group, if it's finitely generated, using first-order language. And this is the observation which led Alex Zubotsky and Moshe Yardan to this very nice result. They say, a finitely generated They say a finitely generated profinite group is determined up to isomorphism in the class of all profinite groups by its first-order theory. In other words, the set of all first-order sentences which it satisfies. Because the first order theory can be used to describe all the finite quotients, and a profinite group is indeed determined by its finite quotients. Okay, so in a sense, this finishes the subject of axiomatic. Finishes the subject of axiomatizability for finitely generative profinite groups. They're all axiomatizable using infinitely many sentences. So the question that Andre asked me is which ones are axiomatizable using finitely many sentences? And the answer is, or one sentence, which is the same thing. And the answer is mostly they're not. And it's a very general sort of model theory approach to these sort of. Model theory approach to these sort of questions, which gives you situations where, given some structure which satisfies a first-order sentence, very often you can make, you can deform it slightly and it will still satisfy the same sentence. And for example, Van der Schelev did this for abelian groups and Audrey and Saba generalized it to groups in non-abelian groups. But the point is, if you have a group where But the point is: if you have a group where some element of the center has infinite order modulo the derived group, so you've got something like a copy of the adjective group of integers sitting above the derived group and central in the group. Then if G satisfies a sentence phi, then the direct product of G with a cyclic group of order Q also satisfies phi. Also satisfies phi for almost all primes q. So, in particular, if q was a finitely generated profinite group, it will never be isomorphic to itself with a product with another finite cyclic group. So it can't be determined by a first-order sentence. Because if G was determined up to isomorphism by phi, then G cross CQ would have to be isomorphic to G. Isomorphic to G. Right. So groups which have too much stuff in the center basically are never finitely axiomatizable in pro-finite groups. More generally, you can say that being a pro-P group for a particular prime P can't be expressed by a first order sentence. Because if it could, then you could stick in some other prime Q, which would spoil it. That's one of the consequences. Another consequence is that. Consequence is that if you take something like an infinite procyclic group, it can't be finitely axiomatizable because if you take a direct product with another cyclic group, it won't be procyclic anymore. Okay, so they're the negative results. Oh, similarly, being generated by D elements can't be expressed by a first-order sentence in profile groups or in abstract groups, as it happens. So, what kind So, what can we do? Right, we can, if we focus on pro-P groups, everything gets much easier. Because in a pro-P group, just like in a finite group, you can recognize a generating set by looking more the Frittini subgroup. And in a finitely generated pro-P group, this is quite easy to find the Frittini subgroup. It's the product of the derived group. group and the group generated by pth powers. So a pro-P group can be topologically generated by D elements, all right, DG is less than or equal to D, if and only if the index of the Frattini subgroup is at most P to the D. And this subgroup is definable, for example, because of the stuff I mentioned above, but that's also quite easy to see anyway. So this is a first-order property. This is a first-order property. If you assume your group is a pro-P group, having degenerators is the first order property. We're also interested in groups where every closed subgroup can be generated by a bounded number of elements. These are the so-called groups of rank R. So if you have a pro-finite group G, every subgroup, every closed subgroup can be topologically generated by Subgroup can be topologically generated by R elements. We say that G has rank at most R. This is a particular use of the word rank, which is sometimes called proofer rank. It's not to be confused with the number of generators for the whole group. It's a sort of tighter invariant. So, one thing you can show, for example, is that for each positive integer r, there's a sentence rho r, such that for a prop. such that for a pro-P group G, G has rank at most R. If G has rank at most R, then G satisfies rho R and if G satisfies rho R, then G has rank bounded by some small function of R. Whether you can actually express that G has rank exactly R, I don't know. This is an open question. But at least you can specify for a pro-P group that it has finite rank by saying it satisfies. By saying it satisfies one of these sentences. So that tells you that the pro-P groups of finite rank are likely to be quite well behaved from a logical point of view. And these are very nice groups. They're what's called the p-adic analytic pro-P groups. So this is a kind of a popular subject. And so when Andre asked me about which pro-finite groups are finitely axiomatizable, I thought. Groups are finitely axiomatizable. I thought, well, if there's any chance of doing anything, the piadic analytic pro-P groups will be the ones to look at. And indeed, they do work quite nicely. So our first theorem, which is trying to work with Andre Nies and Catherine, is that a periodic analytic pro-P group is finitely axiomatizable in the class of all pro-P groups. But you have to put in some little caveats. You have to assume that it's given in some finite way. So either it must have a finite pro-P presentation using group words, because it's true that a periodic analytic pro-P group is always finitely presented as a pro-P group. But the relators in such a presentation might not be group words, they might be pro-P words. And that's not good enough. You need a finite group presentation. Or else, you could change your language and allow yourself to talk about pro-P groups using p-adic powers as primitive symbols. If you add the language for the operation, you know, g to the lambda, where lambda is a pi-adic number, then you get a richer first-order language. Richer first-order language, and if you allow that, then all these groups are indeed finitely axiomatizable. And my remark, oh, before I do that, I move on. An application of this is to generalize that theorem of Augé and Sabin that I mentioned earlier for nilpotent groups. If you have a finitely generated nilpotent profinite group, then it's finitely axiomatizable in the class of all profinite groups, if and only if it's such a Finite groups, if and only if it satisfies two conditions. One is it must involve only finitely many primes. I'll say why in a minute. And two is that it doesn't satisfy that, or rather, it avoids that obstruction I mentioned earlier. If you take the image of the center of the group in the derived quotient of the group, that image must be finite. Okay, so You have this nice characterization of finitely generated profinite groups which are not potent, the ones which are finitely axiomatizable. And again, we have to assume one of these conditions A or B. It's either finitely presented or the language is enriched to allow, in this case, not just piadic powers, but into what are they called? Well, profinite powers. Why do we need those conditions? Why do we need those conditions? Well, it's kind of obvious you need some conditions because there are uncountably many groups which satisfy the conditions. For example, you could use arbitrary periodic numbers in a presentation and you get uncountably many different groups. But there are only countably many sentences in the ordinary language of groups. So there are only countably many isomorphism types of groups which can be specified by. By a first-order sentence. So we need some condition to make that stuff work. Okay, how are we doing for time? This is kind of a preamble. Here we are. So that tells you about very small groups, periodic analytic groups. You can and finally generated your post. Finitely generated your potent groups, which from some points of view seem rather trivial and straightforward. However, using that information, we can deal with groups like SLD, SLD of the periodic integers. We can prove that this is finitely axiomatizable in the class of all pro-finite groups. And the trick is that inside this group, you have a unitriangular subgroup, which is indeed null-potent and satisfies those nice conditions. So, first of all, So first of all, you can determine what the prime P is, or rather, determine that this is essentially a pro-P group, it's almost a pro-P group, using the structure of that null potent subgroup. And then knowing what P is, you know that this is essentially a pro-P group, and as such, it's a pi-adic analytic group, and therefore it's finitely axiomatizable in the class of pro-P groups. And since we know what Groups and since we know what P is, that fixes the group in profinite groups. I'm sorry if that's not very clear, but it's a fairly straightforward application of the stuff we did above. Okay. Now, the reason we needed only finitely many primes is because of a model-theoretic result called the Pfefferman-Vaught theorem, which I didn't know before. But this is one of the things which sets This is one of the things which sets limits on how much you can axiomatize in group theory. This, the Pfefferman-Vault theorem, describes the first-order properties of a Cartesian product. So if you have something like a nilpotent group or a pro-nilpotent group, it will be the product of all its C-lo pro-P subgroups for all the different primes P. And basically, if there are infinitely many different primes, and any first order property will be determined by Will be determined by looking at finitely many of them at a time. I won't try to go into this in more detail. And as before, you can, if there are infinitely many to start with, you can then mess up finitely many primes without changing the fact that it satisfies that property. So basically, you can't axiomatize infinite products usually by a single sentence. So this would apply to a group like SLD or Z. Apply to a group like SLD of Zπ, for example, where Zπ is the product of the periodic integers for infinitely many primes P. Okay, so that's good. That's the first part of the talk about pro-finite groups. For these, we use basically group theoretic methods. And as I said, because if you know. If you know that if you have a finitely generated pro-finite group, you can talk about the finite quotients of the group. And so it behaves rather like a finite group. And you can talk about finite groups using first order logic. And the other thing you need, the other reason you can talk about finite groups as well, is that they're finite. If you take bits out of it, eventually it gets smaller and smaller and then it stops. And if you have a p-iadic analytic group, And if you have a pi-adic analytic group, in a sense the same thing happens because it has a finite dimension. It's a finite dimensional Lie group, in fact. So if you factor out a closed normal subgroup and iterate after finitely many steps, you run out of space. So you can prove things by induction in p-adic analytic groups. So before I move on, I'd like to say that this gives us lots of examples where you can axiomatize pro-finite groups. Can axiomatize pro-finite groups finitely, and some general principles which say when you can't, but it doesn't really give you any kind of theory. So in particular, it would be nice to know if which finitely generated pro-P groups, or even which finitely presented pro-P groups are finitely axiomatizable. We have examples, and we know about the nilpotent ones, and we know about the Peelic analytic ones. About the PLIC analytic ones, but even something like a free pro-P group on two generators, it's easy to describe in words. Can it be axiomatized? Can it be finitely axiomatized among pro-P groups? Or more generally, if you had a free pro-finite group on two generators, could that be axiomatized among pro-finite groups? People who are familiar with Who are familiar with model theory of groups will say, oh no, free groups, of course, because of Sella's theorem. All non-abelian free groups have the same elementary theory. But the profinite groups are very different. This is the whole point. In a profinite group, you can specify the finite quotients. So you can separate, you know, you can certainly separate the free group on two generators by the free group on three generators because the second one has an elementary abelian group. Has an elementary abelian group of order eight as a quotient, and the first one doesn't. So the intuition you get from abstract free groups is very is misleading. And one should think more of these as more like finite groups. But how one actually deals with things like free pro-P groups or free pro-finite groups, I don't know. So I think there's some interesting work to be done there if anyone wants to go in that direction. Go in that direction. Okay, so that's the profinite part of the talk. There's a different approach which relates groups to rings. This is the other part of the title. If you have a group like Zp, like SLD of ZP, linear group over the periodic integers, you can express group theoretic properties of the group. Properties of the group in terms of ring theoretic properties of the ring. If you can do that in a sufficiently controlled way, then you can axiomatizability of the group can be deduced from axiomatizability of the ring. So the group is supposed to be specified by a sentence in the first order language of groups. The ring is supposed to be specified in the first order language of rings, but that's a much richer language. Rings, but that's a much richer language. For example, the Piadic integers, it's quite easy to specify among pro-finite rings, shall we say, as a ring, because basically you can multiplication by P is not invertible, whereas the additive group of the pedicint integers is certainly not specified. Certainly not specified, it's not axiomatizable in the language of groups because of that stuff I mentioned before. You could do anything, any sentence satisfied by ZP as a group will also be satisfied by ZP cross CQ, cyclic group of prime order Q for some other Q. Okay, so ringing language is more powerful than group language. And if you're lucky enough that your group can be sort of fully described. Can be sort of fully described by a ring, then you can go from the group to the ring and back and back again. And there's a machine for doing this called by interpretation. I don't know the history of this. If anyone's interested, perhaps Katrina could tell them a bit about it later on. But the idea is this. I'll just quickly go through the definition. Okay, a group gamma is bi-interpretable with a ring R if you can find gamma You can find gamma sitting inside some product of copies of the ring R. For example, well, I'll get an example in a minute. This is not exactly the strict definition, but it gives the basic idea. And the ring R is interpreted in gamma if a copy of R can be defined inside some product of copies of gamma. So those two are fairly easy and straightforward to describe. And the subtle thing in the definition. And the subtle thing in the definition is three. You start the group gamma, you embed it in R to the N, product of copies of R, you embed R in gamma to the N, and if you compose those two embeddings, you can embed gamma into gamma to the mn. So now you have two groups and a map from one group to the other. And this map, which is kind of obviously an isomorphism, it's not an isomorphism. An isomorphism, well, it's not isomorphism onto its image because of the way it was set up. It's supposed to be definable in the first-order language of groups. In other words, it's definable without mentioning the ring. If you can do that, and also the same thing in the other way around, which I'll mention in a minute, there we are. Condition 3 base, swapping gamma and R. But that one's not so important for us. It's usually drops out. Then we say that these two structures are. Then we say that these two structures are bi-interpretable. And when this holds, it's quite easy to see that any first-order sentence satisfied by gamma gives rise to a first-order sentence satisfied by R in the language of rings, and vice versa. Any sentence in the language of rings satisfied by R gives rise to a sentence satisfied by gamma. So I put it like this: first order properties of gamma of the group. order properties of gamma of the group gamma correspond to first order properties of the ring R. In particular, if R is finitely axiomatizable in a certain class of rings, then the group gamma is finitely axiomatizable in a corresponding class of groups. Of course, one has to be a bit careful what one means with these classes, but in practice you'll see some examples. Okay, so to illustrate the definition, I think this makes it kind of easy to understand. So suppose you take Understand. So suppose you take gamma to be SLD of R. So it's the special linear group of D by D matrices over the ring R. Okay, so you can embed gamma in D squared copies of the ring, namely as D by D matrices. So that's easy. The fact that the determinant is one is a ring theoretic, it can be expressed as a ring theoretic property. It's just a polynomial condition on the entries of the matrix. And the group operation. And the group operation is defined by matrix multiplication. So perhaps I should emphasize this. The point is that not only is the group sitting as a subset of some power of the ring, the group operation must be definable using ring language. And for the second condition, the ring is sitting inside some product of copies of the group, in this case, one copy of the group. And the ring operations. And the ring operations must be definable using group language only. So, in the case of SLD, you can take, for example, the elementary subgroup of matrices with just one off-diagonal entry, for example, the one-two entry. So that's the root subgroup U12. So you can identify an element of the ring with the one-two entry of that matrix. Okay, and add two elements, you simply multiply the matrices. That's a familiar thing. To define multiplication in the ring, you have to be a bit more clever. But this goes back a long way. I think this is what Malsef originally thought of when he was talking about Nilpoten groups. You can use the commutator between U12 and U23. If you take a little elementary matrix with an entry in the 1,2 place. entry in the 1,2 place and one with an entry in the 2,3 place. You form their commutator, you get an elementary matrix with an entry in the 1,3 place. And the entry you get there is a product of those two entries, that one and that one. So you can identify these three subgroups by conjugating them inside gamma. And so you get three copies of the ring defined inside your group. And you can define ring multiplication using the commutator. So the point is that the So, the point is that the ring structure is completely describable just using group language. Okay, so they're the two things. So, they're the ways of identifying the group in the ring and the ring in the group. Now, the subtle thing, of course, is three. You've got to show that for each pair ij defining a matrix entry, and if you take And if you take the element of the group, what happens to it? You map it to D squared matrix, to D squared ring elements, okay, G I J. And each of those you identify as an element of the group inside U12. I can't actually see this bit of the slide because I've got pictures of U on it. Can I move you? Yes, I can. There we are. Great. For e to G and gamma, the element of U12 that represents the matrix entry Gij. matrix entry gij can be defined group theoretically inside gamma in other words by some using only group property group language okay and to do that one has to do a bit of work it's not obvious so anyway working with catching we we sort of look generalize this to chevrolet groups and so this is our main theorem let G be Let G be an adjoint simple Chevrolet-De Mazur group scheme of rank at least two, and let R be any commutative integral domain. Then the Chevrolet group G R is bi-interpretable with the ring R. And I put brackets almost always because there's a rather special small gap which we couldn't quite prove. So I will tell you what this is in a minute. So what is the Chevalier-De Mazu group scheme, in case you're not too familiar with it? Group scheme, in case you're not too familiar with these. If when R is an integral domain, you don't have to worry about group schemes because you just take the ordinary Chevrolet group over the field of fractions, K, according to G of K, you intersect it with SLNR, whatever R. Let me move it, SLDR, if the Chevrolet group is inside SLD. And GR is then GK intersect SLDR. Okay, however, it was actually quite useful to think of it as a It was actually quite useful to think of it as a scheme because we use that in the proof. The first time I've ever dared to mention the word scheme in a paper, actually. So, this was quite nice to be forced to do that. Okay, I said I would have to admit a slight gap. Almost always means we can't quite prove it when G is one of the exceptional groups other than G2, and when R is a ring without any non-trivial units. So, of course, it's rather a peculiar ring. So, of course, it's rather a peculiar ring. It's got to be something like a polynomial ring over the field of the two elements or something like that. In particular, for every integral domain of characteristic, which is not two, we have the results for all Chevrolet groups. And also for the ring Z, which has two units after all. Okay, so the first step is to identify the ring inside the group and show that it's a definable thing inside the group. Definable thing inside the group. And well, we can define the ring with its points in a root subgroup in the usual way. And we'd like to know that this is definable group theoretically. And in fact, usually, I'll say what that means in a minute. And when I say that G B is above, I'm assuming that G is adjoint, so to have no center. Okay, otherwise you have to put in a bit of center there. If take any non-identity element. Take any non-identity element of u alpha r then u alpha r is the double centralizer in g of r of that element u is the center of the centralizer of u. So this is definable group theoretically. So that means we can define the ring at least as a subset inside the group just using centralizers. So that's nice. We were quite surprised to find that this isn't always true because we asked several experts and they said And they said, is the root subgroup always equal to its double centralizer? And they said, yes, yes, of course, folk law. But actually, when we started doing the calculations, we found an exception. So if G is a symplectic group over the integers, it's actually not true. The double centralizer is no, the root subgroup is slightly bigger than the double centralizer. Is slightly bigger than the double centralizer in that case. For example, when the ring oh, sorry, I can't hear you, Catherine. The double centralizer is big. Could you say that again? Yes, the double centralizer can be too large. It can be too large, that's right. Is it too large or too small? It's always contained in the double centralizer. That's right. But the double centralizer can be too large. If you take SP40. If you take sp4z, for example, this is just not true. But we can identify it easily enough so that the subgroup is always definable anyway, which is what we need to know to interpret the ring inside the group. Okay, then as I suggested in the GDLP have said, you can use commutator relations, Chevrolet commutator relations between the different root subgroups. Between the different root subgroups. Oh, sorry about that. The commutator rations can be used to define ring multiplication inside the group. The commutator between two different root subgroups, which are kind of adjacent in the Dinkin diagram, will give you an element in another root subgroup. Group, which is the sum of the two roots. That's a point. And the value is either going to be the product of the ring elements, or at least you can calculate it. Sometimes it gets a bit complicated, but it works. So we can use the Chevrolet relations to define the ring multiplication. You can define the, so that defines the ring inside the group. As before, you can define the group inside matrices over the ring in the usual way. Matrices over the ring in the usual way. It's an algebraic group, after all. So it's a set of matrices which satisfy some polynomial conditions. Now, where it gets difficult is the definability of that isomorphism, point three. Okay, so I probably shouldn't spend too long explaining this because I originally planned this as a one-hour talk, and apparently it's a 45-minute talk. So I shall maybe skip the details of the. Shall maybe skip the details of the proof, but I thought the most interesting part of the proof, in a sense, is this one. How do we? So we've got this map. So we've identified the ring with the elements of a root subgroup. So little r in the ring goes to r dashed, which is an element of the group. The usual Chevrolet notation, x alpha of r root element. Okay, so you've got to map from gamma, which is g of r, to sl d of r, just by sending to the matrix. Each matrix element. Matrix. Each matrix element gets mapped back into the group like that by because each ring element can be thought of as a group element. So you've got a map theta from gamma to gamma to the d squared, which you could think of as d by d matrices with entries in this thing u, which is sitting inside gamma. Okay, so we need to show that. So we need to show that each of these maps, theta ij, is actually definable in group language. Because you start with gamma, with g in there, you get, choose i and j, g i j dashed is again an element of gamma. We want to define it as a function of g using group language. Okay, how do you do that? Okay, you can define if g is a root element, something of the form x beta r, then it's expressed as a certain polynomial in r, usually a linear polynomial in SLD, for example. Okay, and we fixed x alpha as the root subgroup, which identified. alpha as the root subgroup which identifies the ring. Okay, so if you've got some other root beta, either x beta r is conjugate to x alpha r or you can find it from x alpha r using some stuff with the commutator relations. Anyway, using the structure of Chevrolet groups, you can get a nice map from x beta to x alpha, which enables you to identify the ring using any of these root subgroups. Okay, so that means Okay, so that means that if g is a root element, its ij entry is either going to is going to be mostly zero, it'll be one on the identity, and it'll be something, some kind of matrix, might be r itself or some little quadratic thing, on some particular values of i and j corresponding to the root. Okay, so if g is a root element, we actually know what g dash is. This is what actually the point of this argument is, okay? So Okay, so if g is a product of n root elements, you can define theta on g by saying it's a product of the n values it takes, theta takes on those root elements. So for a natural number n, let E n of R be the set of all products of n elementary root elements. And what I was just saying was supposed to explain that you can define the map theta on this set, E n of R. Right. E n of r. Right, so if the whole of gamma happens to be equal to e n of r for some n, you're in good shape, you're done. In that case, one says the group has finite elementary width. If gr is equal to en of r for some n, gr has finite elementary width. So basically, what we've established so far is that gr has finite elementary width, then gr is bi-interpretable with r. R. There are many cases where this is known to hold. Classically, if R is a field, basically the Brouard decomposition does that. If R is a local ring and G is simply connected, this was done by Abe back in, I think, quite early, early on, maybe early 60s. Of course, you might say, I told you G was adjoint, but we're not assuming G is adjoint. Sometimes we do, sometimes. G is adjoint. Sometimes we do, sometimes we don't. Some of these results we have to assume g is simply connected, but it's okay in the proofs, don't worry about it. Okay, and there's a very beautiful theorem by Tavgen, who proved, again, if G is simply connected and R is a ring of integers in a number field, or even S integers, then G R has finite element G width. He was interested in the question: when does an arithmetic group boundedly generate it, which means that it's a product? Generated, which means that it's a product of finitely many cyclic subgroups. That was a. You need Irank. Sorry? You need Iran. The rank is at least two. No, the rank is at least two. Standing assumption. And if, in fact, for Tavgen, you can have rank one if S is non-empty, if you think about it. Hi, Alex. If I'd seen you before, I'd have been much more careful. Right, anyway, okay, so you do have finite elementary width in a lot of interesting cases, and particularly arithmetic groups over number fields. So we already have the nice result there by interpretation. Okay, to get the general result, you have to use, this is where the scheme comes in. I'm going to skip this because the point is if G is adjoint, that's where we need it to be adjoint. It's enough, you can identify. You can identify an element by determining its action on the group by conjugation, because there is no center. In fact, it's enough to determine its action on root elements. Okay, so theta is a group isomorphism from GR to its image. So to determine theta, it's enough to determine theta on each element of the form x beta 1 to the g. Because if you know what theta of this is, then you know what theta of g conjugates. What theta of G conjugates x beta 1 to. And that determines theta of g. Right. Okay, so how do we do that? Well, I found this lemma in a very nice survey paper by a lot of very useful Russians. Some of them might be here. Plotkin and Vavilov. But this is a lemma due to Stepanov. This is a lemma due to Stepanov. There's a finite number n which depends only on the root system, that's what phi is, such that if you take the elementary root element, x beta 1, conjugated by anything in G of R, then it's a product of boundedly many elementary root elements. This is very surprising, but it says that even though the group itself may not have bounded elementary width, the conjugates of elementary root elements do individually lie in this set of Lie in this set of bounded width. Okay, so I won't do the proof, but the proof depends on a very clever thing just using the fact that the group is a group scheme. And I'll just state, okay, well, before I go to the proof, I'll say this gives you the result now, because when G is an adjoint group, we argue as before that theta is definable. You can define theta on here, on EN of R. I've already said that. So that determines theta on each of these elements, x beta one of tree. So it determines how theta tree acts. So it determines how theta g acts on everything. And because there's a trivial center, it determines theta of g. Okay, so that finishes the proof in the general case. And my time is up. Let me just sketch. I won't give the sketch proof because you can look up these slides, I hope. I've sent them in. But the point is, you look at the sort of generic group, which is basically you take, this is an algebraic group where This is an algebraic group where you have, instead of matrix entries, you just have indeterminants. Okay, and now to this generic group, which is also a Chevrolet group, you use the theorem that the elementary subgroup is actually a normal subgroup. This holds in great generality. And this is the only sort of hard bit of mathematics in this argument. And because it's a normal subgroup, if you take a particular element like x beta 1. element like x beta one to the gamma where gamma is the generic element it's a product of finitely many elementary root elements this is all happening generically and because it's generic it means you can apply it to any ring and this equation still holds and that basically explains that stepanov lemma but as i said i won't spend any more time on that but but you can ponder it when you look at the notes if you want okay so corollaries for finite axiomatizability which was our original motivation Which was our original motivation. So, every finitely generated ring is finitely axiomatizable in the classable finitely generated rings. This is due to Ashenbrenner, Khalif, Nazar, Ziono, and Skandon. So, this tells you about a lot of finitely generated groups. I'll come to the corollary in a minute. A regular unramified complete local ring with finite residue fields is finitely axiomatizable in the class of all profinite. In the class of all pro-finite rings. This is something we did with Andre in our previous paper because we were interested in pro-P groups, which are like, which, for examples, would be matrix groups over rings like FQ of T or Z P of T. A locally compact, a local field is finitely axiomatizable in the class of all locally compact fields. Matthias Aschenbrenner showed us how to prove this. So here's the corollary. To prove this, so here's the corollary because of these ring-theoretic exoticizability results. We can now apply them, construct them to the groups. So, let G be a simple adjoint Chevrolet-Demazu group scheme of rank at least two, and let R be an integral domain. If the group gamma is finitely generated as a group, then it's finitely axiomatizable among finitely generated groups. That's because if gamma is finitely generated, That's because if gamma is finitely generated as a group, in this case it follows that the ring is finitely generated as a ring. So we don't need to assume anything about the ring. It's just a ring assumption. So this gives you a lot of quasi-fact, quasi-QFA groups in the Andre-Ni sense. So that's finitely generated groups. In the category of pro-finite groups, which is the other thing we talked about, you can take these rings, FQT, it's a power series over a finite. FQT is a power series over a finite field or power series in finitely many variables or no variables over what is OQ? OQ is basically a finite extension ring of the periodic integers. So you could take the periodic integers there. Then these groups, gamma, are finitely axiomatizable among pro-finite groups. And of course, I was particularly happy with this because these groups are very, very much bigger than p-iadic analytic groups. Analytic groups. They will be pro-P groups, where P is the prime dividing Q here, but they will be very, very far from, they will be finitely generated, but very, very far from periodic analytic. So that's examples of very large, large pro-finite groups, which are finitely axiomatizable. And finally, very popular subject, and I'm glad to have it because I think this is supposed to be the topic of this meeting, isn't it? Totally disconnected, locally compact. Totally disconnected, locally compact groups. So, this if you have, if R is a local field and gamma is a Chevrolet group, then G of R is one of these TDLC groups, and these are finitely axiomatizable among all locally compact groups. Okay, so that's the end of the talk. There's a couple of references, two papers to appear in PLMS and the Journal of the European Math Slock. And oh, additional remarks. Okay, I will skip the. And oh, additional remarks. Okay, I will skip the additional remarks because my time is up, but people can ask questions. Thank you. Yes, thank you very much. Are there questions or comments? Well, maybe I have many things I'm interested to hear, but maybe I will stick to one or two. One or two, um, by comparison with some work that Meiri and Avni did recently, I understand. So, okay, maybe first question. Um, by this by interpretability, I understand that if the ring is decidable, then the theory of the ring is decidable, then the theory of the group is also decidable, right? Is it known for rings which rings are decidable? I guess this. Are decidable. I guess this then you can deduce a lot of these results for groups, also, right? That's a question for Catherine to answer. Yes, in principle, if one is decidable, then so is the other. But I don't know very well which rings are decidable. You say the ring itself. The pheadic integers are decidable. The ring of feudic integers. Actually, I don't know whether they are decidable. Yes, I'm sorry, I don't know much about this. The p-iadic numbers probably are than the integers. Actually, probably they are, yes. Yeah, it's certainly for the p-iadics, it should be known in any case whether they are. But this is, so to speak, a whole A whole I think that, unlike the story of being defined by finitely many first order languages, decidability can happen for uncountably many groups. So, can we speculate that every paiadic analytic group is decidable? I mean, I just don't know anything about the subject, but just the no, I agree with you. It's a good question, and I think one should probably ask Myersnikov. Well, actually, I think once we know whether the p-adics are decidable, it's a matter of, I mean, might be not. And a related question to this. Now, in your work, it seems that. In your work, it seems that it's crucial to work with the full group GR. For finite point of view, it's very natural to go to finite index subgroup. As far as I remember, in general, being a finite axiomatizable is not invariant under going to finite index subgroup in general, but is it true here? But is it true here that finite index groups are also? It's, I don't know, actually, I don't know the answer in the case of because they're all congruent in some congruent subgroups, yes. A congruence or what is called full congruence, like principal congruence. The principal congruence subgroups for SLDZP, this does work. This does work. I know because that's how the proof works. Actually, I didn't mention it. We do it for the principal congruent subgroup first and then deduce it for the whole group. And then I see. But that's not using which are not principal. Sorry? I hadn't thought about that. But that's an open question as far as I know. Alex, do you have another question? Otherwise, maybe. Do you have another question? Otherwise, maybe let I see that some people are what I have. I have many more questions. Dan, can you do me a favor and send me the slides? Because it was too fast for me. Oh, yes. They'll be posted on the webpage. They are already posted on the web page. Yes. And maybe one more comment. This result by Stepanov is very nice because it's really from the model theoretic point of view, it's just compactness, something that View, it's just compactness, something that happens for all rings, must happen in a bounded way. So it's interesting to see a ring-theoretic proof, so to speak, for this result, which from the logic point of view is a clear result from compactness. But maybe let's see what Yifta, you want, you have a question? I have two questions. The first one is about the first part. The first part. So, Dan, as you probably know, I'm not particularly fond of isomorphism in for finite groups. It's not maybe the most interesting topic. Much more interesting for me at least is conventionability. So, is it useful in any sense? Like, can you
