I don't remember what time zone I'm in right now. I'm based more sounds. All right, well we are happy to start our second day. So reminder to fill out the project survey form that Heather sent out, hopefully by the coffee break or during the coffee break. And so really happy to have our first in-person speaker, Omita Doss, who's coming to us from Rochester Institute of Technology, where she's an associate professor of physics. So thank you. It's, you know, it's a pleasure. It's a pleasure to be back in WEF during the pandemic. One of the things I missed, I guess, most is going to all these conferences, especially conferences near mountains, because outside of doing science, like hiking and being in the mountains is the thing I love most, and that keeps me going. So thank you to the organizers for making this happen and for inviting me. And so today, I'm going to tell you about some ongoing work in my group that has yesterday. Group that has. So, yesterday we heard a lot about rigidity and rigidity percolation in different types of materials, broadly speaking from Kirin. So, today I'm going to focus more on rigidity percolation in biological systems. And the sort of example system I'm going to focus on is this cartilage tissue. So, I think Irina brought up something like, oh, what happens to the tissues in our knees, etc. So, I'm going to focus on. Our knees, etc. So, I'm going to focus on cartilage tissue in our joints, in our knees, and elbows, etc. And the papers or the you know the research I'm going to talk about, two of the things are out, just came out this year earlier. The first part came out in Science Advances, the second part came out in soft matter, and the very last thing I'm going to talk about is under review right now, and this is the archive reprint reference. All right, and also, in terms of asking questions. And also, in terms of asking questions, if you have any clarifying questions, please feel free to stop and ask me right away. If you have medium-length questions still, you know, you can stop and ask me right away. If there are very, very long questions, then maybe we can wait until the end. But anything else, please feel free to stop me right away. Right. So we will see what these, you know, images and movies are are when we get to that point of the talk. That point of the talk. All right, and just briefly, you know, what kind of work we do in my group. So, I am an associate professor in the School of Physics and Astronomy as well as the School of Mathematics at RIT. I'm a theoretical physicist by training, but my work sort of straddles the world of physics, applied math, bioengineering, you know, etc., etc. And so, in my group, we mostly focus on problems where there is an You know, problems where there is an interplay between statistical mechanics, geometry/slash structure, and then sometimes mechanics, sometimes electrostatics, and then so on. And so we are interested in connecting a sort of micro scale structural and constitutive properties to emergent collective behavior at meso and macro scales. And so, I'm here I have some examples of you know systems that we are working on in my group. That we are working on in my group. So, and again, the length scale, it's nice that in this conference, in this workshop, we have people spanning, you know, working on complex systems, but spanning so many different length scales. So, the scales that I mostly work on is, you know, at the level of cells and at the level of tissues. So, at the level of cells, we are looking at networks of polymers in the cell cytoskeleton. So, it's the polymeric scaffolding that gives cells their shape and rigidity. I also work. Rigidity. I also work on mitochondrial networks. So, you know, we all thought of mitochondria as this stable kidney bean-shaped structures, but in reality, they are not like that. They actually are very dynamic and they can fuse to form network-like structures and they can fragment into smaller pieces again. And the cell keeps making them and then taking them away, also, you know, through biogenesis and mitophagy. So, these are very interesting dynamic networks. And then I'm also looking. works and and then I'm also looking at organization of you know bacterial chromosomes because that like you know in our own eukaryotes like our cells you know most organelles are bound by membranes which can sort of protect the contents inside right but bacteria doesn't have membrane bound organelles and you can ask how is bacterial you know DNA or bacterial genomic material protected or sort of kept separate from the rest of the cytoplasm and people And people have been looking at liquid-liquid phase separation a lot in you know in the nucleolus of eukaryotic cells. But in this case, it's not just two liquids because DNA has some structure. So it's more like you can get some liquid-crystalline or crystalline structures as well. And then at the level of tissues, once again, we look, you know, we work on a lot of problems that have to do with networks. I will talk about cartilage tissue today, so I'm not going to go into that in detail. We are also looking into In detail, we are also looking into building artificial tissue by combining biopolymers from cells, like you know, the cytoskeletal polymers, with sort of circadian rhythm proteins from bacteria. So we all have a circadian cycle, right, which tells our metabolism that, oh, now you really need to act fast versus act slowly. Bacteria also have their, they have certain proteins called clock proteins that sort of regulate their circadian cycle. And the bacteria we are going to And the bacteria we are going to focus on, or the bacteria we are using the clock proteins from, are the cyanobacteria. So, we basically, so our experimental collaborators basically take these clock proteins from bacteria, mix them with polymers, or combine them with polymers from, you know, the cytoskeleton to then make networks that can basically cross-link and unlink on the time scale of this Aradian cycle without any external intervention. So, it's like building automatic. Intervention, right? So it's like building artificial tissue-like materials which can sort of flex and then relax like muscles. And then most recently, we are also looking into basically under so this was the last one is basically part of this understanding the rules of life program. So we were trying to build a synthetic nerve cell that can recapitulate the electrophysiology of an actual nerve cell. And the synthetic nerve cell is made up of, you know, vesicles and ion channels using microfluidic channels. Channels using microfluidic shipping, and then sort of make a small, you know, use a small collection of the synthetic nerve cells and synthetic synapses to make a NAND gate, and then sort of maybe a network of NAND gates to see if you can do some logical operation. So that's sort of the last set of projects. But the common theme that runs through most of my work is that there is some network-like structure, you know, or networks sort of form the underpinning of a lot of. Sort of form the underpinning of a lot of the stuff that I do. Alright, so let's get to what I want to talk about today, which is, you know, about percolation or rigidity percolation. We will get to that a little bit later in biological systems. So normally, I guess here everybody knows what is percolation because normally when I'm giving a talk to a more wider audience, it's like, okay, percolation is not, well, people immediately think of coffee filters and how that's percolating. How that's percolating, but again, there, again, you know, yes, you have, you know, if you have things more connected versus less connected, how things will flow through things is different. But here, what I'm showing is that percolation, you know, has wide applications, right? And this is an example of connectivity percolation in cell phone networks. So if you ask that, okay, you have a whole bunch of people in a town and everybody has their cell phones, and you start a rumor at one end. You start a rumor at one edge of the town, right? Will this rumor spread and get to people who live at the other end of the town? And you know, so that depends on how many nodes are there, the connections between these nodes, etc. And that's sort of an example of connectivity percolation. If the system is percolated, then this rumor will be able to get from one end of town to the other end of town through this network of people. And the phase transition basically. And the phase transition basically, so what do we mean by a percolation phase transition? So basically, if you start removing the nodes or the connections, there will come a point where things don't percolate at all, right? So going from when it will percolate to not, right? And so rigidity percolation is a slightly different type. So there you, it's not just you have connections, but also this connected system will have to be able to bear some mechanical stress. Able to bear some mechanical stress, right? We'll have a finite mechanical modulus. And the example I chose, again, this is not my work, it's work from the group of C.P. Heisenberg, who by the way happens to be the grandson of Heisenberg from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. So what they were looking at is they can see, they can use this rigidity percolation theory to sort of understand the solid to fluid transitions in. Fluid transitions in the developing embryos of a zebrafish. And you can see how they do this, right? So they have all these cells, they can sort of draw the connections between cells. And then from this network, they can see that, you know, how many nodes and how many bonds are there, right? And in this case, you can see that this is going to be like a well-connected and sort of rigid system, and this is going to be not a well-connected system. Not a well-connected system and non-rigid, and they're measuring the viscosity. You can measure viscosity or some other kinds of shear properties like shear modulus. And they can see that in this case, you can see there is this big jump in the sort of mechanical response of this network. And in fact, I also wanted to show this title from, you know. To show this title from another paper from their group. So they were, you know, this is sort of the first example of, you know, I don't know, whole organism where you can see this kind of interesting, you know, behavior. And you can use percolation theory to understand that. So, okay, so before I go to my story, so this is again examples of percolation. One is connectivity percolation, the other is rigidity percolation. The other is rigidity percolation. You can imagine in rigidity percolation, you will need more constraints than you, like you, you know, normally you achieve connectivity percolation, but you still may not be connected well enough to be able to sort of resist mechanical stresses. So, the rigidity percolation threshold is usually a little higher than the connectivity percolation threshold. So, I want to give you, and you know, because we are mathematicians and mathematical physicists, we like lattices and graphs and things like that. Like lattices and graphs and things like that. And it's easier to do calculations on lattice-based networks. So I'm going to just briefly talk about, you know, just introduce, okay, what do we mean again by rigidity percolation in these kinds of systems. So here, what I've done is I have started with a network that's based on a Kagome lattice. So and Kagome lattice is basically, it looks like stars of David, and you have two, you know, like crossing, at any node, you have two crossings. At any node, you have two crossing filaments or fibers. So, you have ordination number of four. And I have diluted this lattice so that the fraction of bonds that are occupied in this lattice is 40%. Now, if I try to mechanically load this lattice or shear this lattice, it will not resist that, right? So, we say that this system is very, it's floppy. It means that it doesn't cost any energy to sort of shear this system or, you know, mechanically deform this system. Form in the system. I can add more bonds and go to 45%, and it's still, if I try to measure the rigidity or you know, sort of load this, it will again be floppy and not resist it. You can go to 50%, still not resisting it. 55%, you will start seeing some rigid clusters, right? But the system as a whole still is not fully, like rigidity is not percolating throughout the network, right? But you can start to see the beginning of all. To see the beginning of this, you know, rigid, like local rigid clusters. Yes. How do you measure the rigid cluster? Like, how do you know that at this point, now you see those rigid clusters? So, so there are different things. So, one of the things that, you know, so locally, you can basically look at the stresses and strains that are developed in the network. And then yesterday, Kieran talked about some other ways of doing that, right? Like looking at these Pebblegame algorithms and other kinds of. Algorithms and other kinds of things. And I will talk a little bit more about how do you actually determine that the percolation threat has happened in addition to things that Karen had said. Then you get to 60%. And now it's rigid. It can actually transmit mechanical stresses through the system. And so the rigidity percolation threshold is basically what is the, in terms of, you can define it in terms of coordination number. In terms of coordination number, you can also define it in terms of the probability of occupation of bonds. And in this case, if the probability of occupation of bonds is 60%, it's slightly above 60%. That's where it goes from not being rigid to being rigid, right? So then you can ask, well, and 65%, of course, it's not rigid, it will stay rigid. So now you can ask, okay, so how, if you're an experimentalist, how will you know, or even a theorist, how will you know whether it's rigid or not? How do you calculate? Whether it's rigid or not, how do you calculate the percolation threshold, etc.? So you can do that by the constraint counting procedure that Karen had described. You can do Tebblegame algorithms. But the thing that I would talk about is a little more connected to experiments is you can measure the shear modulus of this material. So you take your material, you put it, you can put it in a rheometer if you're doing macroscopic rheology or in a shear cell. You can also do micro-rheology in which you. Do microwheology in which you basically embed beads in your material and from their motion you can infer the shear modulus. But you measure the shear modulus, and what I'm showing here is the normalized shear modulus, which is why everything, the maximum value is 1. So I've divided out the shear modulus by what would be the shear modulus when the network is completely connected, all the bonds are present. So which is why everything is going to 1, g is going to 1 at your p equals 1. And p is the probability of hockey. And P is the probability of occupation of bonds, right? And you can ask what are these different colors? So the different colors is basically the ratio of the bend, like how easy it is to bend the fibers in the network versus to stretch the fibers in the network. So it's much easier to bend them than stretch them, right? And 10 to the minus 1. So it's basically you are decreasing this ratio. So as you decrease the ratio, the fibers become more and more soft. Fibers become more and more softer, and you can see that the shape of not the shape, but the you know, the actual form of the curve changed. But one of the things you can see is that the percolation threshold is not going to change, you know, if you change the relative bending to stretching stiffness of these fibers. Because this is coming completely from the geometry and the constraints in the system, right? So, by changing how stiff or soft something is, so long as there is a cost. Thing is, so long as there is a cost of bending fibers and there is a cost of stretching fibers, those physical properties would not matter. All that will matter is the geometry or topology and what kind of constraints there are. Do you have two body forces? Do you have three body forces? Things like that, which is why all of these are going from, so basically they are going from rigid, having a finite rigidity, so they will resist mechanical deformation to no rigidity here. So these 55 and 5. So these, 55 and 5, like, you know, both. Like, 50% is here, 50% is here, these are not rigid, and then 60% is, you know. Any questions so far? Right? Okay, so now I'll go to my, you know, our research and we are using rigidity percolation to understand the sort of structural origin of mechanics of cartilage tissue. Of cartilage tissue, you know, why cartilage tissue is robust, you know, also have some insights into its fracture properties and so on. So, first of all, why focus on cartilage tissue and you know, why is this of interest, right? So, cartilage is, I'm talking about articular cartilage, which is this tissue present in our joints, in our knees, and elbows. So, it's a really interesting like biomaterial. And the reason is, so when we were all really, really young. So when we were all really really young, right, you know, our okay, let's start, restart. So cartilage tissue is mainly made up of extracellular matrix, which is matrix that's found outside cells and some cells. Now extracellular matrix has got to be made by cells, right? So cells secrete and make these things and the extracellular matrix themselves can't make themselves right. So when we are all young, So, when we are all young, we have cells that make these, you know, the collagen and proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid, other stuff that, you know, is there in the tissue. But what happens is as we get older and older, especially when we reach our, you know, we cross our 30s, we are in our mid-30s, etc., there are very few of these cells left, right? So, whatever cartilage you have, once you reach your mid-30s, you are going to You are going to need to have that same cartilage for the rest of your lifetime. Cartilage doesn't have very much regenerative capacity, and if your cartilage is damaged, you will make scar tissue, but it's not going to be like your functional cartilage tissue, right? But during the remaining this, you know, like four, five, six decades of our lives, you know, our joints are undergoing several hundred million loading. Several hundred million loading cycles. So, cartilage has to withstand a lot of this kind of you know loading, right? So, it has to withstand this wear and tear and it has to be robust, but it also has to adapt to mechanical response pretty quickly, right? And in fact, it can help us bear like weights or loads that are up to 10 times our body's weight. So, and you know, all the like synthetic sort of mimics of cartilage that we have made so far, they are not really as. They are not really as like, they are not like cartilage, you know. So, then one can ask: okay, so what is the underlying, you know, reason for cartilage having these kinds of properties, right? Because if we understand them, we can make artificial, like it has important application for, you know, regenerative medicine. We can use make replacements for cartilage. So, right now, the replacement for cartilage that's often used is the same thing that's used in breast implants, and you can imagine that. In breast implants, and you can imagine that's not a very good replacement for cartilage. So, you know, so if we understand the underlying signs of this, then we can make better replacements for cartilage if it gets damaged or injured. The other thing is that we can also have make like engineer materials for soft robotics that has cartilage-like properties. And the finally, you know, like when we get older, you know, some of us will end up, or maybe many. Some of us will end up, or maybe many of us, will end up getting arthritis. And the precursors to arthritis, especially osteoarthritis, has to do with like defects or tears in cartilage that can happen because of either biochemical degradation or mechanical wear and tear or some injuries that don't fully heal. So, also understanding those kinds of pathways is also something that's of interest to us because we really lose, like, our quality of life depends a lot. Our quality of life depends a lot, you know, on these things. Right, many of us here like running or hiking, some people like dancing, and you know, cartilage is you know, our joints are important for all of these things. So, I have multiple motivations, you know, both scientific as well as like real life, like other motivations for wanting to study this. And so, I am a theorist, but I work very closely with experimentalists. So, the experiments on this work were done by Itai Cohen, who is a biophysicist at Cornell University, and Lilari Bonassar. University and Larry Bonassar, who is a tissue engineer at Cornell University, and they have further collaborations with the veterinary school. So, you know, so there are like the tissue samples described here came from not from the vet school, those came from cows, right? So they get those samples from slaughterhouses, but they also have access to horses and other animals, right? So we can test our theories, not just on mammals. Just on like you know, mammals over a large scale, right? And I should also, I have to also give credit where credit is due. So the experiments were done by Edai's PhD student, Thomas, who just defended his thesis. And the theory was done by my PhD student, Pin Silwin, who is going to defend next year, and Jonathan Michael, who is a postdoc in my field. Alright, so I'm going to start by telling you guys a little about the structure of cartilage, right? Structure of cartilage, right? So it's mainly made up of this extracellular matrix and which consists of a network-like structure made up of collagen fibers. And these collagen fibers, these guys are quite stiff. And the role of this collagen network is to basically resist tension in the network, right? Tensile forces. And then there is sort of an interconnected network made up of, you know, aggregate. You know, abrican, which is basically a chain of glycans, and for now, you know, you can think of it as a more flexible network and hyaluronic acid, right? So, together, hyaluronic acid and agriculture form a much more flexible network. So, it's like you have a stiff network and a very flexible network. And what happens is, you know, during diseases or as people get older, there can be loss in structure of this tissue. Loss in structure of this tissue, right, because of either biochemical degradation or mechanical wear and tear, right? And one of the things we want to know is that, well, what would the mechanics, how will the mechanics change as either people get older because of this kind of degradation or during disease progression? However, when this is happening, we can't really take a chunk of somebody's cartilage and then put it under a microscope. And then put it under a microscope and see what's happening, right? So it would be nice to have sort of a framework that can help us map from the structure of cartilage to the mechanical function of cartilage. Because then you can get things like MRI images and use that to, you know, understand what the structure looks like. And if you have a map from the structure to this mechanical function, then you can make predictions of mechanical function. And mechanical function of cartilage is actually quite non-trivial and interesting. Non-trivial and interesting, so it depends on the tissue depth. So it's not a two-dimensional thing, right? It's a few millimeters thick, and you know, close to the surface of the tissue. You know, the networks are quite, when I say surface of the tissue, I mean it's close to the joint. And when I say deeper in the tissue, it means it's close to the bone, right? So the concentration of material like collagen or this aggregate is not very high close to the joint and it gets really high as you get close to the bone. You get close to the pole. And the mechanics also changes, but not necessarily linearly. But you have depth-dependent mechanical properties, right? Yes. Is this construction similar to bird nests, having like the rigid structure, which is like a softer material? Is it the same principle? Principle? So, you know, in tissues, you often have this composite network or double network-like structure. That's quite common, but the density of various things can be very different. So, for example, this having cartilage and some kind of proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid. That's true, let's say, for our cartilage tissue. It's also true, let's say, for the vitreous gel in our eyes. But you can assume that the density and concentration of stuff in the vitreous gel of our eye is very different from our cartilage tissue. Is very different from our cartilage tissue, similarly to what you're speaking. The main difference here from some of the other tissues we are familiar with is there are very, very few cells, right? Because we are thinking about adult cartilage here. Because in a lot of other tissues, there are cells. Cells can exert forces that has an important, you know, and can also act as in like stiff inclusions. That's something we don't have here. Okay, so when we started, there was no link to sort of connect structure. No link to sort of connect structure to mechanics, or we need to connect structure to mechanics, and such a link exists for when you have cartilage under compression. So, if you're compressing cartilage tissue, then you know this theory of poroelasticity, which has been here for the last three decades, that sort of is a very good map or provides a very good map or prescription to go from structure to function for compressive properties of cartilage. For compressive properties of cartilage. However, most of the tears that lead to tissue degradation, including as precursors to osteoarthritis, have to do with shear and not just macroscopic shear. Even if the macroscopic thing is compression, what the fibers are undergoing when they tear is actually some kind of shear, right? And for those, you know, even though there is, you know, a map for compressive properties, there is not no map for like or No map for, like, or when we started out, you know, on this project, there wasn't a map for understanding how do we go from tissue structure to tissue function when this tissue is undergoing a shear. So, so, how do we build such a framework? So, and we want to build a framework that's able to make, you know, predictions that are useful for experiments, that are useful for, you know, like predicting tissue mechanical properties. So, the goal, so it's you. So, the goal, so it's you. So, the modeling and the experiments are very interspersed here. So, I'm going to talk about quite a bit about experiments. I may not be able to answer everything, but there will be quite a bit of experiments. So, the way we go about this is, let's say experimentally, we can measure, you know, the composition of cartilage, how much collagen is there, how much of this other stuff, rhodioglycans, etc., is there, right? And we can measure what is the shear modulus at this composition. The shear modulus at this composition? Let's say for healthy cartilage, right? So, for healthy cartilage, we first measure the composition of how much collagen and this other stuff is there, and what is the shear modulus of the tissue. This is what the data looks like, right? And then we want to make these measurements at a different part of phase layers. So, now if you have sort of digested away all of this abricant, right, then you only have the collagen network left. So, for that, again, you can measure the shear. That again, you can measure the shear mottiness. So, now in two different parts of phase space, you have measurements of the tissue mechanics or tissue rigidity. And the goal is basically we want to be able to come up with predictions that can help us generate this whole space, right? So, using this data, we will make sure that we have a model that can predict cartilage mechanics over a wide range of concentrations. Over a wide range of concentrations. And if we have that, then we can predict what will happen along other pathways. So, this is what we are after. And I also wanted to show you a little bit of the experimental setup. So, these are oscillatory. So, the experimental shear cell is, you know, it's subjected to oscillatory strains, 1% strain. So, it's very, very small strain, right? So, only fibers in the tissue will only undergo small deformations. And this is close to the you know surface of the tissue. And as you go here, this is getting close to the bone, like you're getting close to the bones. And these lines are basically etched in the experiment. So these are not physiological lines. These are etched in the experiment so that you can find deformations. Like experimentally, when you make measurements, they want to find out different at different depths how much is the difference. At different depths, how much is the deformation, right? So, you know, at here, how much is the deformation? Here, how much is the deformation? So, it's in their experimental measurement, it's helpful, right? So, the lines are not physiological. Generally, when we apply like shear in our actual bodies, how intense is it if I'm just like bending, like, right? If I do a squat, like, how much is it? I think if you do a squat, if you do a squat, it's going to be a combination of compression and shear, right? For most things, there is a. Shear, right? For most things, there is a combination of compression and shear. And you know, so for this thing, I'm only going to talk about shear, but normally, what will happen for these kinds of measurements, you will, let's say, first apply, you know, let's say 5% or 10% or 20% compression, depending on whether you're just sitting on your butt or you're actually doing something else, you're doing bench press or something, right? Or even more compression. And then you apply some shear on top of it, right? But here we are looking at small shear because we are in the Are looking at small shear because we are in the linear response regime so that we can use you know linear because and non-linear properties are also important, but there was no framework even for linear response for these kinds of things, right? So, so we wanted to go there before. So, now we are looking at non-linear properties, but that's not something I will talk about today. Okay, all right, so okay, so more experiments. And I hope at least Kieran, if she's there, she will appreciate it. Kieran talked a lot about theory. Kara talked a lot about theory, and I guess I am doing the opposite where I'm talking a lot about experiments. But experiments are really important and cool here. So, what Thomas did is he measured the concentration. So, first he wanted to get an idea of concentration versus tissue depth. So, he measured how much collagen there is as a function of tissue depth. And again, zero micrometers means you're very close to the joint, and then you know, 2000. You know, 2500 micrometers means you're very close to the bone. And when you are very close to the joint, again, the concentration of collagen is quite small, right? And okay, and what are the blue and the red things? So the blue is data for healthy cartilage tissue, and the red is data for biochemically degraded cartilage tissue, where they have used the enzyme trypsin to digest away a lot of the agriculture. So trypsin only digests away. So, trips and only digests away aggregate, doesn't really do anything to collagen, and this is sort of proof of principle for that. Right? The collagen concentration for healthy and degraded tissue lie on top of each other. Initially, they're small when you're close to the joint, and then as you get close to the bone, it sort of increases and then plateaus. And then the aggregate concentration for healthy tissue again starts out very small, then sort of increases, and then sort of almost saturates. Now, Churchin is digesting a Now, tryxin is digesting away all of this abregon here, but the enzyme is only going to go down so far before it gets used up. So, it is only digesting away aggregant up till this point and not after this. So, we are going to focus in when we do our modeling mostly to this up till like 1200 microns where the aggregate has been digested already. So, this is what the composition space looks like. So, you have aggregate concentration, collagen concentration, and Aggregant concentration, collagen concentrations. By the way, these are in mixed permel. I forgot to have the units, but these do have the actual units. And then we want, so this is the composition space, right, for healthy cartilage, chemically degraded cartilage. And then, you know, we want to get the shear modulus. So how do we get the shear modulus from experimental data? So you can also measure the shear modulus as a function of tissue depth, right? And you can do this both for the healthy heartless tissue as well. Both for the healthy cartilage tissue as well as the biochemically degraded cartilage tissue. The healthy data is the blue, the biochemically degraded data is the red. And earlier, you had a sort of, you know, we had, you know, the behavior, the graphs, or what the concentration as a function of depth looks like. So now we have concentration as a function of depth and shear modulus as a function of depth. So then using that, we can basically create what is now the shear modulus as a function. Is now the shear modulus as a function of this collagen concentration. We can also do what is the shear modulus as a function of aggregate concentration. And then we can go. So, experimental measurements, everything is measured as a function of depth, but then you can use that data, combine that to then get a shear modulus as a function of collagen and amicial concentration. Does that make sense? Right? So, you know, because directly you cannot measure this as a function of this, right? So, that's okay. Okay. Okay, so then we thought, and I already told you that, well, rigidity percolation has a role to play in this. So, previously, so in my postdoc, I and you know had worked quite a bit and other people have also worked a lot on rigidity percolation, but in in vitro networks of actin and microtubule. So, in vitro networks are essentially not looking at live cells because live cells are very complex. You take the actin or you take the mitrotubule out, you know, those. Microtubule out, you know, those metubulin or you know, G-actin affected. You try to reconstitute these networks, you know, in a controlled manner where not a lot of other stuff is there. And looking at the mechanics of those kinds of networks. And we found that rigidity percolation can explain the mechanical properties of in vitro networks of actin. But now we are not dealing with just network of one thing. We have this composite network made up of different things in life tissue. So you can't really use exactly the same models, but we thought maybe the The same models, but we thought maybe the same framework still might work. So, you know, so we wanted to test this, right? So, what we do, but then again, the tissue is sort of three-dimensional, and in three-dimensional it's not homogeneous in three-dimensional, right? As a function of depth, the density of fibers changes. So, a three-dimensional, just a three-dimensional model, which is homogeneous, is not a good thing. A two-dimensional model is also not good. So, we thought maybe the simplest way to go from experiments to model here From experiments to model, here is basically like in experiments, you know, when they are doing confocal measurements, you can have this series of Z-stats at different depths, right? And you can, at these different depths, so different slices of tissue, you will have different density of collagen and aggregate. And then you can think of a series of two-dimensional networks at different tissue depths. Yes, you are losing out, we are losing out the connection in the Z direction, but that's something we are throwing out. I mean, all physics models are these. I mean, all physics models or these models are toy models. So, this is something we are for now throwing up. So, and then let's say if you're close to the joint, close to the surface, you will get a very sparse network, right? If you're close to the sort of bone, you will get a very dense network. Another approximation we are making in the first version of the model is we are saying that we will think of collagen as a stiff network and we will think of aggregate, hyaluronic acid, etc. Everything as sort of a Etc. Everything as sort of a continuum, soft elastic background, right? But there is interaction still between this network and the background junk. So, and then what we do is, let's say we apply shear or whatever our chosen external deformation is to this system, and we basically calculate how much energy is needed, like what is the deformation energy, right? How much will these different elements in the network resist the shear based on the cost? Resist the shear based on the cost of stretching fibers, right, which comes in here, the cost of bending fibers, and interaction between the network and the gel. Let me explain the terms a little bit. So because this, the strains we are applying are very small, 1% or less, you know, so everything, all the deformations are very small. So we can linearize our, we can already write our terms in a sort of linearized way. So Uij is basically the deformation of a bond, the change in Of a bond, the change in length of a bond, but as a vector, and R hat is the initial direction of that vector or a bond, right? And the Pij is the probability whether the bond is there, Ij bond is there or not. And if you sum up all these bonds over the entire network, the stretching, right, elasticity of these bonds, that will give you the total stretching energy, total cost of stretching, you know, A to D slice, right? And alpha is the basically, you know. The basically, you know, the stretching elastic strength. And similarly, we can do for bending. So, the way we think of one fiber is basically a series of collinear bonds. Now, when you think of bending of a fiber, we have to think of bending at hinges, right? Where we have pairs of bonds along our fiber. So, then we have Pij, Pj, K for a hinge to be there. Both of these bonds have to be present. So, the probabilities, we have two probabilities here, and then you have a Probabilities here. And then you have a cross product which is basically telling you how much the angle is changing from initially it was 180 degrees, but now how much it is going to change. And then we have another term which has to do with you know how much the background material is going to resist deformation as the bonds that are there embedded in the background material are moving. And the strength of that is mu. This is the strength of mu, this bending elasticity. Of this bending elasticity. So, this is sort of my deformation energy of this network for small deformations. I apply a shear and I measure how much is this, what is the minimum energy configuration at given strains, right? And then there are different ways of calculating the shear modulus from this thing. So, the thing is, if you only have shear, if you have only one type of deformation, right, so then the shear modulus is basically just 20. Modulus is basically just going to be two times this energy density divided by strain squared. However, if you had the real-life scenario, you're sitting on your bud, but there is some shear. So there is some compression and there is some shear. So then the shear and compression can be coupled. So in that case, if you want to tease out the shear and not have the compressive part, then you can't just do energy density by strain square. Then you will have to do, like, take the second derivative of the. Like, take the second derivative of the energy density with respect to the strain, and that will shear strain, that will give you sort of the shear part of that. So, depending on whether we have a mixing of shear and compression, and we want to just get the shear modulus or the compression modulus, versus we only have one type of deformation and we want to get that modulus, we use different expressions. By the way, how am I doing on time? Five more minutes before we go back. So, I took up all of the time for just talking about one story, but I Time for just talking about one story, but I guess it's okay to just tell one story well. And so, what we can do, then you know, we find out a modulus from our simulation, right, by that. That is this G simulation. But in addition to that, but that just tells us the modulus of this network, right? It has to do with the resistance of the network. But in addition to that, in addition to, you know, sort of providing like providing constraints to the network, the Constraints to the network, the gel part also has its own contribution to the modulus. So we also have to add this mu and we write mu again, you know, in the simplest sort of approximation as a part that is mu naught. And the mu naught is basically coming from the hyaluronic acid. And even when I'm using the enzyme to digest away things, it's not going to do anything to the hyaluronic acid. So this doesn't depend on anything. And then there is a part that depends on. And then there is a part that depends on collagen. And you can ask, why is there a part that depends on collagen? That's because even when collagen has digested away, like not that digested, collagen is not digested away, sorry. When collagen is not forming a network, you can still have smaller collagen pieces that are in the background gel. So this is all taking into account that. And this is the abregon concentration. So this part is sort of the background gel, which consists of hyaluronic acid, agregan, and parts of collagen that are not long enough to be. Parts of collagen that are not long enough to be part of the network. And so, using this, we found that we can actually make a pretty like, you know, so what we did is we used our model first on the degraded data to find out what these, so most of the things here, and I should also say what are the things that are known, right? How are the various things in the model related to things in the experiment? So the elastic modulus is related to collagen properties. We know this from known prop you know, persistence length and other things. You know, persistence length and other things. Same for the bond bending modulus. These are things we know. The background modulus contribution depends on aggregant concentration, which we know from experimental measurements. The background modulus floor, how much hyaluronic acid there is and how much modulus that contributes is also known. So the and this, these guys depend on collagen concentration, cross-linking, and connectivity is the bond probability of bonds in the collagen network. Bonds in the collagen network, and you know, the contribution of the sort of pieces of collagen, etc. So, what are the things that we don't know? So, the things that we don't know are these expansion parameters, alpha and beta, right? We don't know what these are and also this C, we also have a parameter C going from our theoretical prediction to experiments, right? So, this C, alpha, beta are the quantities that we try to get by, you know. To get by, you know, fitting our data to one set of experiments. And then we try to, so you can do it both ways. You can try to fit the data to one expense, one set of experiments, healthy or degraded, and see if this works for the other. You can also try to fit them together at the same time. And we found that there is not a big difference if we are fitting really well. And so then we were able to sort of generate this whole face space, right? So yes, this degraded and This degraded and healthy, you know, was the one that we used to get our model, like all this, you know, the parameters and everything working. And then you can sort of, it's, you know, you have an expression, I mean, it's a complicated expression, but you can still sort of generate the rest of the phase space. So then, if you ask, oh, if I had different pathways, like this arrow or that arrow or that arrow, what would things look like? And this is what things would look like. And then, you know. And then, you know, so what we have done is using this rigidity percolation framework, we have created a map to go from cartilage composition to cartilage mechanical function. And, you know, we can basically use MRI and then this, you know, T1, T2 measurements will tell us about the concentrations of these various materials. And then we can use these, we can basically create sort of a predictive map to go to basically tell, you know, if you. To basically tell, you know, if you have different disease pathways, you know, you go in this direction, this direction, some other direction, how would the mechanics change? And I am at a long time right now. Okay. Okay, so I will take any questions you guys have at this point, and then I want to tell you maybe not both the other stories I had, but one of the other two stories. Are there any questions? Are there any questions? If not, Any questions? Are there any questions? If not, I can also just go on. None on chat so far. Okay, okay. And folks should feel free to put them in chat in case. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So then maybe the second of the three stories, the third I will not get to. So we also wanted to understand, you know, crack propagation and crack growth in cartilage. Like if you have a tear in your cartilage tissue, right, when you're doing your squats, are those tears going to grow? Like, can you make any predictions about Like, can you make any predictions about that? You know, and this is what crab growth in cartilage looks like, by the way. So, the way people study crab growth in cartilage is they make a notch, so they call it a notch test, like this, and then they apply tensile strain, and then they see what happens. So, you can see that here, this notch has sort of done this, this part has sort of pulled out, etc. Now, you know, for continuum materials like metals, sheets, and other similar materials, you know, and Karen will tell you there is a very well-developed. There is a very well-developed framework for fracture properties and fracture mechanics, especially for brittle fracture. There is this criterion called the Griggs criterion, which gives you, which tells you that, oh, if your critical loading is more than this, then you will have track propagation and less than this, you will not have track propagation. Or if your track length is more than this, critical, not critical loading. So if your load is more than a critical load, you will have tracks propagate, otherwise not. If your track length is more than a certain length, then you have track propagation or not. A certain length, then you have track propagation or not, right? But for soft tissues like cartilage, it's very difficult to use the exact same framework, A, because they are highly composite, they are very heterogeneous, and you can't really, and I'm completely ignoring all of the viscous stuff, by the way, but that also plays a role. I'm completely ignoring the viscous stuff because I was like, okay, we were like, let's start out with the elastic properties and then we'll look at the dynamical response and viscous properties. Then one of the things was, can we come up with a similar predict and can we come up with a similar predict can we come up with similar predictive models for fracture in cartilage and cartilage like materials right so for that what we had to do is our single network in a background gel model didn't really work and I'm not showing those results so what we had to do is we had to take into account the network structure of the hyaluronic acid agregan thing as well so then what we did is again we have a collagen network we don't have that background gel part but now we have a separate network for this agricultan and Network for this agricultan and hyaluronic acid, and that network is a flexible network in the sense that it costs energy to stretch those fibers, but they will freely bend. Bending doesn't cost any edge. And then you can have an interaction term between the two networks. And the interaction is basically, you know, so it's sort of, it's 3D, but we have, it's sort of projected onto 2D. And, you know, when you have the corresponding bonds and the two network, if they are both there, then there is sort of a connection between. Then there is sort of a connection between them. So now, you know, again, you have this PIJ, PJK, and this guy, you know, like, which is the sort of connection between. So this is the first network, this is the second network, it's the connection between them. And this depends on P12J, P1IJ, and P2IJ. Basically, the bonds in both of these networks will have to be present, and then you will have like a Hopian spraying between them. And so, one of the things that we saw that in these kinds of double networks, we call these double networks, you can actually tune the percolation threshold by tuning how much of the second network there is, right? So, and these two lines I've drawn, because this is what you will have close to the surface of the cartilage, close to the joint. And this is what you will have when you are close to the bone, when you have very dense situations. So, one of the things you can Very dense situation. So, one of the things you can see here is that if you change the amount of the second network, right, the aggregate network, you can change the modulus by quite a bit here. But here, the change in modulus is very small as you're changing your other network material, the aggregate material. You also see that the perturbation threshold changes quite a bit as you change how much material there is in this aggregate network, right? But this also tells you one of the things that if you One of the things that if you digest away antigen close to the surface, that's going to have a much bigger effect on your tissue than if you digest away some aggregate close to the bone. Because, you know, the modulus can jump by quite a bit. Here we go. So we've got a question from Zoom. So in cartilage fracture, is ductile fracture repairable by the body compared to the brittle, which isn't? Or are both damages unrecoverable? And another question, a sub-question. Another question, a sub-question, I guess. If ductiles were repaired, do you want to just ask it, Karen? Yeah, yeah. There were no questions in the chat. Can I go to the ductile and brittle fracture part and then you ask that question? Karen? That question is for the end of the talk. Okay, getting started. Okay, okay, so yeah. So how do we study again what's happening here? So basically we create an Here. So basically, we create a network, and I'm showing you something from you know, not the initial point, right? Something that looks like the image I showed you from the experiments where you had an arch, you had the burntting of the crack, and the bottom sort of pulled out. So the way we do the simulations, you create an arch, you apply axial strains, right, at the ends of the network, you apply strains in steps of 1%, 1%, 1%, 1%, and you go all the way to 70%. By the way, the method I'm using here is an energy minimizer. Method I'm using here is an energy minimization, and I'm using conjugate gradient minimization here. And so the thing is, and the two networks, you have a stiff network interacting with a soft network, right? So in the stiff network, the bonds will break if you have stretched them to more than, you know, 120% of their original length. This is for collagen fibers, and they will buckle if they have compressed them to, you know, more than 95%. For the flexible network, there is no buckling because, again, there is no. There is no buckling because, again, there is no cost of bending or anything like that. But these fibers will also break, but now they will break if you have stretched them to more than 200% of the original length of box. So this is sort of the assumptions we are following, informed by the ultimate tensile threshold of collagen, etc. And this is what I'm showing you one particular, you know, the fracture in one particular situation. So we measured the modulus. So, we measured the modulus as a function of strain, and we did that for two cases. When we were in the very dense region of the tissue, so close to the bone, so the collagen concentration is very high. And then when we are close to, you know, like just above the percolation threshold, so we are closer to the surface, and the collagen concentration is not so high. So, the bond occupation probability corresponding to the collagen network here is just above the percolation threshold, it's 62 percent. Threshold, it's 62%, and here it's 80%. So, here you can see that, well, so in both of the graphs, initially, whatever slack there is in the network, as you strain, that slack will stretch out. So, initially, you get some stiffening, some increase in the modulus, but then it hits a point where everything is stretched out. And now, once you start stretching, you might exceed the breaking buckling thresholds, right? And so then you get this softening. Now, close to the bone. Now, close to the bone, when the you know the tissue is very dense, there is a lot of collagen, you can see that these curves all lie on top of each other. But here, you can see that you get several magnitudes of difference in the curves, right? Based on your close to the, to the, you know, like based on basically here you have quite a bit of difference, right? And then it changes, but still, you know, there is a lot of like the second network has a bigger role, and this is a Role and this is a more important and interesting plot. And here we are looking at stress as a function of strain. And so, once again, initially, the stress the system is bearing that is going to increase as you're straining more and more, it will reach a maximum, then the network starts breaking, buckling, and then it starts decreasing. So, you can see that for the very rigid collagen network case, right, as you vary the Right, as you vary the aggregate, these curves will still lie on top of each other, and the strain at which the network starts breaking is roughly the same for all of them. The peaks line up, sort of, more or less. And you will see I'm showing you the strain at maximum stress here. But again, for the case where you have a very sparse collagen network, well, it's dense enough that you're above the percolation threshold, but not any more than that. So it's just marginal. Any more than that, so it's just marginally rigid. And then again, you can see that the amount of stress varies a lot as you vary P2. But also, the peak, the location of the peak, not only the value of the peaks vary, but the location of the peaks also vary. And the location of the peaks basically give us an idea of how extensible a material is, which means that how much can you stretch it before it's going to start breaking, right? So, for the red graph, you can see that this. So for the red graph, you can see that this doesn't really change very much as a function of P2. But in this case, it decreases with P2, right? So then you can ask what is happening. So as you increase more and more material, the Young's nodulus and the rigidity, maximum stress, etc. will go up. But the strain, basically the extensibility, right, it's less than, you know, it's going to this guy, the strains at which it will. The strains at which it will break that is going to go down. So there is sort of a sort of tug of war here, right? So if you add more and more material, you're adding more constraints, more mechanical reinforcement, which will make the material more rigid and more strong in some ways, right? What we mean by strength. However, the main reason why this double network is good at resisting fracture is because you have two networks. Is because you have two networks. One network is sort of mainly focusing on, you know, providing the rigid resistance, etc. The secondary, flexible network, it helps to distribute accumulated stresses over a larger area. Also, because the secondary network is more flexible, right, it can also sort of, you know, release some of the built-up stresses and it can release them better if the network is a little. If the network is a little sparse, where it can undergo deformations that are low, like it can rearrange more easily if it's not all tightly connected. So, if there is less of the secondary network, you still need, you know, enough of the secondary, you will still need some network so that if you really want to make a tissue so that you get rigidity percolation. But if you have less of the secondary network, it can rearrange, etc., more easily and sort of relax some of the components. Sort of relax some of the concentrated stresses. If there is too much of the secondary network, especially if there is also too much of the primary network, then you know often these pipers don't have any other means to sort of relax or release the stress other than breaking them up. Which is why the so if you really want to make this sort of the end point of this thing. So, you know, so the take-home message is: if you want to make a material. Want to make a material that's both sort of strong and rigid but is also extensible and will not break easily. We want to combine a collagen network which is above the percolation threshold so that you know it can transmit stresses maybe somewhat not just above somewhat above the percolation threshold. But we want to combine it with a sort of aggregate network which can help you know which can reorganize and move around easily. Reorganize and move around easily, to distribute stresses. And depending on, well, if we want one property over the other, we can sort of tone the concentrations of various things to get maybe more load bearing versus more extensibility, etc. And what we showed, I guess, is that I showed that, yes, you can get, use rigidity percolation framework to sort of map out tissue mechanical properties, and then you can have this. You can have this, you know, or not better, slightly more, I don't know, microscopic model where the second part is also a network and that can give you insights into rational design of materials that have cartilage-like properties. One quick thing I wanted to say, I will not get into stories. So, the other part that I didn't tell you about was that in real tissues, I assumed that the disorder was distributed uniformly throughout the network. But in real tissues, The network. But in real tissues, disorder is not distributed uniformly. Some regions you have more fibers, some regions you have less fibers. That's because of when things break, a lot of things will break in one region, or things are digested, a lot more digestion in one region. So now what we are doing, in addition to this, you know, how much disorder there is, there is another axis of structural correlations, how much correlation there is, right? So for example, you can keep t fixed at 60%, right? But if you have Right, but if you have more and more correlated regions, then you can have regions like you know of more fibers versus very dilute regions. And what we found is that the percolation threshold, etc., can shift actually as you change this correlation strength. But this shift is sort of not monotonic, but it's kind of a non-monotonic shift like this. All right, so now I will take any questions and I should end because I think I have at the end of the talk. So I'll thank all of you and then we don't. Well, thank you, all of you, and then Guido. And yeah, I'll take any questions. Okay, can we start in chat with some sensibility? Yeah, let's do that again. Karen, do you want to ask a question or if you prefer? Yeah, thanks a lot. That was really chat today. So the first part of my question is.
