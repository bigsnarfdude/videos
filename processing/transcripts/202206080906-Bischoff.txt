Is it okay for me to start now? Yes, please. Go ahead. Okay, great. Thank you. Sorry about the technical difficulties. Okay, so Okay, so what I want to talk about is an ongoing project that I've been working on with this marketable theory, which is about trying to use generalized complex brains to get a kind of a geometric approach to analyzing geometry. So I just want to start by introducing motivation. Motivation, motivating probably, and then say a little bit about generalized complex brains, and then just talk a bit about this time. So I'll start here with the motivation, which is the problem of recording the homogeneous squared ring of a Kayla mantle. So I'm going to start here. So I'm going to start here. Is this ILID work? Yes. Okay, great. Okay, so I'm going to start with a compact KL dramatic and let Kaldranical be a pre-quantization. And I want to think about the geometric quantization of this. And so first, I want to think about it kind of from the perspective of the simplexian geometry. So part of this. Part of the data of a Kaylin manifold is a symplectic structure. And then you can think of Al-Nava as defining a pre-quantization. So it's the unitary line bundle that is a connection whose curvature is the symbolic form. And then from this perspective, the complex structure is playing the role of the polarization, so it satisfies the So it satisfies the following equation here, which one way of reading it is with respect to the PQ decomposition induced by the complex structure, omega is of type 1, 1. But another way of thinking about it is that the 0, 1 tangent bundle, the minus i eigen space, is a Lagrangian with respect to omega. And this allows us to define the geometric form. And this allows us to define the geometric quantization of omega as the space of sections of L that are kind of constant in this zero one direction. So in other words, if we take the zero one part of the connection, which is now flat, and it defines a holomorphic structure and owner, we take the global holomorphic sections. Okay, so from this perspective, From this perspective, the complex structure is kind of playing an auxiliary role because it's really just telling us which subset of the sections it ought to select. And so it's not encoded in the quantization. And in some good cases, the quantization will even be invariant under deformations of the complex structure. So if you want to encode the complex structure, then what you need to do is then what you need to do is quantize not just omega, but all of the integral multiples. So you take, so each of the integral multiples of omega are pre-quantized by the tensor powers of L. So you take all of the quantizations and you add them up together. And now you get the structure of an algebra, which is the homogeneous coordinate rate. And by the Kedara embedding theorem, By the Kedara embedding theorem, this algebra does encode the complex structure because it tells you how to embed your Kayla manifold into a complex rejective space. So, from this perspective, we can think that to be that the complex structure is encoded in the product on the algebra, in the multiplication. On the algebra and the multiplication. Okay, so say we wanted to deform this. So one way of deforming this would be to deform the polarization, so changing the complex structure. And if we're in one of these kind of nice cases where the quantization doesn't depend on the complex structure, then that will, the underlying vector space of the algebra will remain constant, but the product But the product will get deformed, kind of reflecting the way that we deform the complex structure. And so, what I wanted to talk about for today is what if we try to deform the polarization kind of in a towards what I'll kind of heuristically call a generalized complex polarization. By turning on a Poisson structure. So I'll explain this in a few slides. If you have a holomorphic Poisson structure, you can form the polar complex structure kind of in a different direction. And the expectation would be that the product on the algebra will kind of deform along with it to a non-cumulative algebra that will encode the puzzling structure. So, I guess this is probably something that everyone is familiar with. It's kind of sometimes called the deformation quantization. And there's different flavors to it. Of course, there's one way of doing it where you let this kind of deformation parameter H bar be a phonal parameter. And this is the problem that was solved by Kinsevich. Solved by Kinzavich. So if you are just looking at phonal deformation, you can always quantize. But there are several examples that come from non-communitive algebraic geometry where the quantizations are not formal. They actually have an actual parameter. You can kind of set h bar equal to 1 or something. 1 or something. And so there's lots of very interesting examples of these sets of algebras in the work of, say, Art and Tate and Vandenberg and Fegin Erdesky. And so the question, which is behind this project, is can we give a geometric approach to non-cumulative algebraic geometry? So So, I want to explain this, and in order to do this, I first of all want to kind of recast the definition of the homogeneous coordinate ring. But now, whereas before it was kind of from the perspective of the symplectic form, I want to explain it from the perspective of the complex structure. So what I mean is I want to work in the the B model, the the category of uh polymorphic effective models over the complex manifold. Bundles over the complex manifold. And then in this case, if we look at the homogeneous coordinate ring again, you can interpret these spaces of global holomorphic sections as spaces of homomorphisms in the category. So let me just say, what are these? O and phi to the n. So here, O is just a trivial holomorphic line bundle. And phi to the And phi to the n is an audible equivalence of the category, which is given by taking a holomorphic vector bundle and tensoring it with this pre-quantum line bundle, L. So if you look here, then this phi to the n applies to O, this is really the nth tensor power of L. And so we're looking at homeomorphisms from the trivial bundle. From the trivial bundle to L to the N, so that's global sections. And from this perspective, so this gives the vector space kind of purely in terms of the category, but the product is also can be troded in terms of operations in the category. It's given by composition. So you have A and B. The way that you multiply them is that you compose them. The only thing is that A. Uh the only thing is that uh A and B, they both start from from the trivial button or they land to a tenth to the power of L. So in order to actually compose them we should apply the sodible equivalents to A to kind of get the domain to match up with the codomain of B. Okay, are there is this uh are there any questions about this at this point? I have a question. Uh I have a question. Why is it that you expect to have a single Poisson structure when you turn on the generalized complex structure? Why would that be a variant family of Poisson structure? Or is there a condition that you have? Oh, so this is something I'll explain in a moment, but I guess I'm thinking from the other perspective that if I have a perspective that if I have a home structure, it gives me a way of deforming the complex structure as a generalized concept structure. It's an extra data that you impose. Sorry? It's an extra data that you impose, the whole work it does in the structure. Yeah, so there is other ways of deforming the complex structure as a GC manifold, but I'm taking kind of one particular way of doing it that uses holomorphic plus structures. Okay. So, um So from this perspective of kind of viewing the homogeneous coordinate array in the B model, it's kind of clear how you should deform it. When you turn on the Poisson structure, you should deform the category of vector bundles to some other category. And you also need to deform this trivial line bundle to an object of the same category, and you need to deform the other equivalents. Okay, so in order to kind of explain this type of deformation, the kind of the context that I want to do this deformation, I just need to tell you a little bit about generalized complex geometry, which I guess we've seen in several other, or at least in a few other talks. So, just kind of a brief recall: generalized complex structure is Is a complex structure on a generalized tangent bundle. In other words, tangent was cotangent. So it's just an endomorphism that squares to minus one. And it satisfies an integrability condition with respect to the curon bracket. And here you might notice that in general there's an extra term, which is a three-form. Just for simplicity, I'm setting it to zero. I just want everything to be as simple as possible. As possible. So these were first introduced by Ditchin in the early 2000s and the really interesting thing about them is they kind of generalized both symplectic structures and complex structures. So they kind of allowed you to view both of these things in a common framework. So if you have a symplectic structure omega, you can view it as a generalized complex structure like this. Complex structure like this. So I guess I'm writing this kind of in a block form where it should be kind of t to t, t to t star. This one here would be like t to t, this would be t to t star, t star to t t star to t star. So anyways, this is how a symbolic structure gives rise to a GC structure. Gives rise to a GC structure, and a complex structure gives rise to one in the following one. But you can have kind of much more general GC structures which can kind of interpolate between the two cases. So you can have GC structure which looks symplectic in one part of your manifold and then complex in another, or something more general. And a really important source of examples. important source examples of generalized complex structures come from holomorphic Poisson geometry. So if you have a holomorphic Poisson structure, so it's just the same thing as in the real case, it's just a holomorphic bivector that's, if you bracket with itself, with the Skeven bracket zero. Then this can give rise to a GC structure in the following way. So you Following way. So you can decompose sigma to its real and imaginary part, P and Q, and you take the imaginary part Q and you just stick it in this top right-hand corner. And this is something that you can do, you can rescale it. So really this gives you a way of deforming the GC structure of a complex structure to a more general GC structure, which is in general neither complex or symplectic. Complex or symbolizing. And these are, this is the type of deformation that I want to consider with respect to the problem for. Okay, so one of the kind of early questions, I guess, or maybe hopes about generalized complex structures is whether they have a social. Whether they have a so-called category of generalized complex brains. And the idea is that this should be a category of sub-objects of your GC manifold, which should generalize the A model and the B model. So if you have a symplectic structure, in this In this, it has a category of brains, which is called the A-model or the Foucault category. Where the objects, you can think of them as Lagrangians equipped with local systems or some more general brains supported on poison tropic manifolds. So that's the A model. If you have a complex structure, then it also has a category of brains, which is the B model, or in other words, the Is the B model, or in other words, the category of coherent sheaves, which you can think of to a first approximation is that the objects are complex sub-manifolds equipped with holomorphic vector bundles. So the kind of conjecture or hope is that if you have a more general GC structure, it should also have a category of brains, and this definition should specialize to the A model and the B model. V model. So, what are GC brains? So, like I said, they're the natural sub-objects of GC manifolds. And they were first defined in Marguerite's thesis in the early 2000s. And I guess there's kind of varying levels of sophistication of the definition, and I'm going to give kind of a a middle definition. A middle definition. So a brain for me, a brain for a GC structure, J, consists of the following data, S Al Nabla, where first of all, S is a submanifold of M. And Alanabla is a unitary line bundled connection over the submanifold. And there's a condition, which is that if we take the curvature of this connection, If we take the curvature of this connection, it's a 24 F, and we can take its graph here, which is a Dirac structure supported over S, and it should be preserved by the GC structure. So this is the definition, at least, yeah, this is a definition of a GC brain. So let's just look at a couple of examples. So if we have a complex structure, Complex structure. If we work through that definition, then what we find is that the conditions on S and F, so F remembers the curvature, the conditions are that S is a complex submanifule, and F satisfies the following equation. And remember, this is the equation that I showed on the first slide, which was that says that the form F has type 1, 1. 1, 1. And what that means is that the 0, 1 component of nabla defines a holomorphic structure over S and then, well, this connection is then just a turn connection. So we recover, in this case, polymorphic long brambles depended on the complex submanifold. If the GC structure is symphonic, then the submanifold needs to be Some manifold that needs to be coisotropic. And if it's actually Lagrangian, then the condition on the form on curvature f is that it's zero. So what that means is that we get a local system over Lagrangian. So these are the objects that are generally considered in the Foucault category. But the kind of the striking thing here is that actually the sub-manifold does not need to be Lagrangian. Does not need to be Lagrangian. It can be coisotropic. And when it's not Lagrangian, the two-form does not need to be zero. And in this case, what this recovers is so-called coisotropic A-brains. And these were first discovered by Kapustin and Orlov, I think around the same time, in the early 2000s. But they kind of argued from a physics perspective that if the homological If the homological near symmetry conjecture is supposed to hold, if it's going to hold in general, then the Fukaya category should be kind of enhanced to contain these more general objects that are not supported on all agrangians, that's supported on more general coisotropics. So I think it's kind of a striking indication that this definition, this kind of naturally recovers. And this kind of naturally recovers this, so maybe a hint that it's in the right direction. And I want to single out one example of this, which will be important later, so maybe try to remember this definition here, which is what happens if S is supported on the entire manifold? So if we take S to be M, we get what's called the space equilibrium. And the condition on the curvature form is that if we add it to I times the symplectic form, we get a holomorphic symplectic structure. So whenever you see a holomorphic symbolic structure, you can think that this is a space-filling brain in the A model of the imaginary part. Oh, so another thing that's sort of interesting, maybe a hint that this is in the right direction, is that if you look at the deformations of the A and B models, they actually match the deformations of the corresponding GC structures. So for example, GC structures. So, for example, the deformations, the infinitesimal deformations of the B model is given by the following cohomology groups. This is actually equal to the infinitesimal deformations of a complex structure as a GC structure. And here we can see this middle one as these are the deformations that actually come from. These are the deformations that actually come from just varying the complex structure, but these two outer ones, these are the ones that genuinely take you outside of complex, to generalize complex. And just to kind of bring it back to the original motivation, is that the deformations that we're interested in are these ones. These are the holomorphic bifactors. And these are the so-called non-timutative deformations. Okay, so I want to now specialize to this case. So we have a holomorphic Poisson manifold and this, as I explained a few slides ago, gives you a GC structure like this, where remember Q is the imaginary part of sigma. So I want to study now what are the brains for this generalized complex structure. And I'm only going to focus on a special class of brains, the ones that are space-filling, where S is the entire manifold. So remember, now a brain will just be a unique line bundle, which satisfies a condition on the curve on the On the curvature. So here's the definition. So a brain, a space-filled brain, on this GC structure is a unitary line abundant such that the curvature satisfies the following equation. And notice that if we set Q equals to 0, this is the same condition here that says that the form is of type 1, 1. So the Puston structure is kind of default. The Pussman structure is going to be forming this one over one equation. And notice also that there's always a solution to this, which is just given by taking f equals to zero. So we always have kind of a trivial space filling brain, which is a trivial bundle with a trivial flat connection. And I should say that this equation here was studied in a paper in Marco, Brains on Fossil Varieties, which is relevant for the next couple of slides. So let's go back to this problem of deforming the homogeneous coordinate ring. So conjecturally, we have this category of GC. We have this category of GC brains. That D forms the category of holomorphic vector bundles. And now we actually have a family of space-filling brains, which is just given by the trivial bundle, which forms the trivial holomorphic volume bundle. And remember what I said a few moments ago, which is that if we want to deform the homogeneous coordinate ring, we need to deform the category. We need to define the category, this trivial bundle, and this auto-equivalence of tensor and Mappell. And this is actually also possible and was explained in Marco's paper. So it's given by the following theorem. If L nabula is a holomorphic pre-quronization of omega, then if L emits a Poisson module structure, A positive module structure, then this functor of tensoring with L deforms to an auto-equivalence of this category. And by auto-equivalence of the category, what I mean is that it acts on the set of objects. It acts on the set of brains. So it takes a brain and it sends it to another brain. And well, the interesting thing about this is now, since we already have our trivial brain, we can now apply T iteratively, and we get a sequence of GC brains, which deform the tensor products of L. Yeah, and I thought I'd just explain this construction of T because it's quite simple and Quite nice. So remember, L was our polymorphic free quantization of the symplectic form. And remember, it's unitary, so it has a metric H, and NABLA is the term connection. So if we assume that L is equipped with a Poisson module structure, A Poisson module structure, then what that means is that this Poisson structure Q, the imaginary part of sigma, it lifts to a Poisson structure on the total space of L. And so what we can do is we can take the Hamiltonian vector field of log H with respect to this Poisson structure. So this is a Hamiltonian vector field on the total space of L, but it actually descends to Space of L, but it actually descends to a Poisson vector field on M, and that's what I'm calling W. And we can take its flow phi sub T. Then this equivalence is justified in the following way. We're given a brain V, all that we use, we pull it back by the time line flow of this vector field, and then we tensor it with L, equipped with this connection Nablobar. The Nablobar is just. Nambo bar, and Nambo bar is just the average of the turn connection over this bone. Okay, so let's just assume that everything works and we can go ahead. So we now have deformations of the trivial bundle and its auto uh auto equivalence. And so we can now kind of copy the same procedure until we get a deform homogeneous coordinate rate. We get a deform homogeneous coordinate. Okay, but the main problem with this is that so far we don't know how to define the homomorphisms in the category. And I think this has been kind of an open problem since almost the discovery of generalized geometry. So we're kind of stuck. Stuck. And so, yeah, so we'd like to have a definition of the morphisms between brains. So this is what I want to explain. Maybe I'll pause it. Are there any questions so far? You said earlier that a space-filling brain gave you a holomorphic symplectic structure. Holomorphic symplectic structure. A space-flowing brain in a symplectic molecule gives you a holomorphic symplectic structure. So this is a different type of space-filling brain. It's a space-filling brain in this GC structure. But this here, space-filling brain here, this would be a space-filling grain in this GC structure. And so the space-filling grains for this thing, those are the holomorphic symbolic structures. But in fact, it's true that if you have a GC structure, then a space-filling brain gives you, it kind of realizes the GC structure. It kind of realizes the GC structure as one coming from a holomorphic plasma structure. Okay, so yeah, so what I want to now talk about is this project with Marco where we're trying to We're trying to develop an approach towards constructing the category of generalized complex brains, which is based on the use of Libruboids. And so we don't actually manage to solve the general problem of defining homomorphisms between brains, but rather what we do is we reduce or reformulate it to another problem, which is the problem of computing morphisms between the Lagrangian. Morphisms between the Lagrangian and coisentropic gap ring in symplectic manifolds. So, this is also an open problem in symplectic geometry, which is how you compute homomorphisms between brains that are not Lagrange. So, there's some examples where this has been done. For example, I think in the work of Of Aldi and Zaslow and Gukov and Written and Witten and Gaioto. So there's some cases where such morphisms have been computed. Maybe a little bit of an ad hoc method that doesn't kind of suggest a generalization. So this is kind of a genuine open problem still. But we were able to compute these morphisms in a special case and this allows us to kind of implement this procedure here to give the deformation of toric alpha varieties. So this is explained, so this is the paper where we hooked. Okay, so I want to explain this and just to start, I want to explain a simple case, which is how do we view the geometric quantization? So remember that's the homomorphisms from a trivial bundle to L. How do we view this from the perspective of the A model of a symbolic manifold? The idea here is that we're going to encode the Taylor structure as a pair of A-brains in the cotangent number of the manifold. Yeah, so there's a couple of symbolic forms here. So just to make sure we're all on the same page, omega here, this was the Omega here, this was the original Kayla structure, so the symbolic form on M. The cotangent bundle, well, because we have a complex manifold, it's a holomorphic symbolic form. Sorry, it's holomorphic symbolic. It has the canonical symbolic form, which I'm calling capital omega naught. And if we take the imaginary part of this homomorphic symbolic form, we get this little omega naught. And this is the real canonical symplectic form. When we view this now, just as the real cotension bundle. Okay, so there's a, yeah, so several different symplectic forms. It's important to kind of keep them sorted out. Okay, so from this data here, we want to produce two frames in the A model of this omega non. model of this omega naught. The first one is we just take the zero section of the code engine bundle and we just equip it with a trivial flash connection. So let's go with the Groudon brain. But we also, the second one is much more interesting. It's a space filling brain. So remember the definition, a space filling brain in a symbolic manifold. It's a connection such that if you take the curvature and you add it to I times omega, you get a holomorphic symbolic form. So the way that we're going to do it in this case is for the line bundle, we just pull back L, total total space, and we pull back the connection, but then we deform it by adding this term, which is essentially the real part of the total. Of the tautological one form, the holomorphic tautological one form, right? So d alpha naught is capital omega naught, and again it's a real part. And the reason we do this is because if we take the curvature of this connection, which I'm calling f, and add it to i times omega naught, then what we get is omega, like capital omega naught plus the whole background of Kayla form. So this is a magnetic deformation. Of magnetic deformation and it is holomorphic symplectic. It's a twisted photentron bundle. Okay, so these are the two brains associated to the Kalar structure. And they really do encourage the Kalar structure because if we intersect them, we recover the Kalar structure. Here's a picture of what's going on. So we have the manifold on the base, and we take the cotangent monoline, we have these two brains. One of them is Tangent model, we have these two brains. One of them is this purple line, and then the other one is this entire thing in orange. And maybe a couple of comments. So, first of all, this way of encoding a KL structure in terms of a polymer symbolic affine bundle with this sub-manifold L, this was first due to the Donaldson. Robinson. But it has an interesting interpretation in terms of association, which is that this holomorphic symbolic Halfman model, what I was calling the Trithic-Cogang model, is actually a Maury's self-equivalence of the zero plus structure on M, the zero holomorphic plasma structure on M. And so you can think that what the brain is, it's an element of the current group of the holomorphic structure. Of the current group of the holomorphic Poisson structure. So the current group of Poisson manifold in the smooth category was, I believe, first defined by Burst and Weinstein. And they defined it as the group of Mauritius self-equivalences of a posomatical, so, in other words, invertible biomodules. And this was generalized, or I mean at least kind of studied in the Holomer case by myself, Marco, and Zapzine, where it's related to generalized Kale geometry. I guess yesterday we saw two talks that kind of extend this to a more general case. So here what we're seeing kind of in this picture. Here what we're seeing, kind of in this picture, is that we're encoding a holomorphic Lie bundle, L, which is an element of the Picard group of the complex manifold. We're encoding it as a space-filling frame, whose underlying geometry is Holonomic quotas. And this story generalizes to Holonomic plus the modules, where then we'll get more into self-defense. Then we'll get more into self-equivalences of a non-trivial puzzle structure. Okay, Francis? Yeah. Can I ask you one question about why the reason why you are using the zero section is because it's a space filling brain. If it was like not space filling, you will have a coisotropic submanifold and you will take the co-normal bundle to that. Go a normal model to that or isotropic semantic fold instead? Uh sorry, what do you mean? So the you are taking as one of the Lagrangians the zero section of the cotangent M, which is the conormal bundle to the total to M to the conormal bundle to you, because it's the whole manifold. If it was a coisotropic semantic, would you take the conormal bundle to the coisotropic semanifold? If it was not spaceful. No, so I'll explain this. I think I'll explain this later. So maybe wait until I explain the general picture and then ask the question again. Okay, so here we have, okay, so I explained how we coded the chaos structure. We coded the KL structure as a pair of brain, and now I want to say how does the geometric quantization come out of that? And we're just going to define it as the space of homomorphisms in the A model between our two brains. So from the Lagrangian to the space-filling brain. And this is really inspired by some work of Ukaff and Witten, where they similarly view geometric quantization in this way. In this way. Okay, but in order to actually kind of realize this, we have a proposal for how to do this. And it's based on polymorphic geometric quantization. And the idea is the following. So, first of all, this space-filling brain, it has what you might call holomorphic pre-quantization. Might call holomorphic pre-quantization, which is given by the following. If we now pull back the line bundle and pull back the connection, but now we add the whole holomorphic tautological one form, then what we get actually is a holomorphic line bundle with a holomorphic connection whose curvature is the holomorphic symbolic form. So we get really the holomorphic frequentization. Then we need to choose some extra data, which is a holomorphic polarization of this holomorphic symplectic structure. In other words, a holomorphic foliation by Lagrangians. And in this case, there's kind of an obvious choice, which is the fibers of rejection matter. And then finally, what we define to be the space of homomorphism. To be the space of homomorphisms, is the holomorphic sections that are flat along the polarization and that are supported along the leaves along that intersect L. So if we look in the picture, these kind of vertical lines, that's the foliation, and we're just taking essentially holomorphic sections that are constant in the vertical direction. In this case, all of these vertical lines. Case, all of these vertical lines intersect L. And it's pretty clear that if you take things that are constant in the vertical direction, you just recover the holomorphic sections of L. Later on, there will be a different polarization, and in that case, it won't be true that all of them lead to L, and then it will be very crucial that we impose this condition of intersecting L. Okay. Okay, so this is how we view the geometric quantization. Okay, so now for the homogeneous coordinate ring. So remember, we want to take the sum of the geometric quantizations of all the integer multiples of omega, and that thing has an algebra structure. So where does this come from from the AML perspective? So this comes from the fact that This comes from the fact that the cotangent bundle is a symplectic groupoid. So the addition map, you can think of it as a Lagrangian relation from T star across T star to T star. And what this implies is that it endows the A model with a tensor product. So there's a nice paper of Haskell that explores the consequences of this. The consequences of this. And, okay, so we now have a tensor product. We can take tensor products of brains. So there's always a unit, kind of something that if you tensor with it, it does nothing. And that's given by the zero section. And then, well, we started with our original space-filling brain V, and we can tensor itself over and over. And what this will. And over, and what this will give are all of the rescalings of k. And so we can think of the homogeneous coordinate brain as given by this. So this homomorphisms from L to all of the tensor powers of this brain. And then the product on the algebra is induced by the tensor product. Okay, so that's how the homogeneous coordinate ring. The homogeneous coordinate ring comes out of this A-model approach. And this is really, in the case of torque fossil structures, what will deform. But before I go to there, I just want to say a little bit about the general proposal, which is still quite heuristic. So So, if we have a GC structure, I, and we have two GC brains, then how could we compute the space of homomorphisms from B1 to B2? So, here's the kind of growth proposal. So, first of all, a GC structure, it always has an underlying real Puzzle structure Q, which is the top right-hand corner in the expression. In the expression. And so that means that the Poisson structure can be integrated to at least local symplectic couploid, which we can think of as a space of Hamiltonian paths in the manifold up to Hamiltonian homotopies. And so what we want to do is to use the A model of this symbolic manifold. And because And because it's a groupoid, the A model will have a tensor product structure with unit object given by the identity bisection. Okay, so now we have these two brains and we want to produce a brain in G. And we can do this because of this result that follows from some work of Kroinek, which is that, well, if we take the target and the source, that gives a map from G. Source, that gives a map from G to M cross M. It's a groupoid homomorphism. M cross M can be equipped with a G C structure. And G, because it's symplectic, it also has a G C structure. And it turns out that this math is generalized or which means that if we look at the graph with the map, it supports a generalized complex brain. Complex brain. And the upshot of that is that now if we're given these two brains, well, we can take their product to get a brain here. And then we can just pull it back to get a brain in the groupoid. And so the proposal is we define the space of homomorphisms to be the space of homomorphism. To be the space homomorphism in the A-model from the identity by function to this brain. And then the composition of morphisms would be induced by the tensor product. So here you might think that you might want to do something like taking a Lagrangian suburboid associated to To VI and VJ, but this doesn't seem to be the right thing to do. You should do this type of pullback. And the difficulty of this is that often you're going to get genuine coisotropics, not Lagrangians, which means that in general it's still difficult to actually compute the homomorphisms. Okay, but I just want to look at a couple of examples to see if it matches what we would expect. So if we have L1 and L2 all in a combined bundle on a complex manifold, then, well, the Poisson structure is zero, so the croupoid is the cotangent bundle, and then this V1, 2 is exactly pullback of L1, tensor L2, dual, this modified connection. Modified connection, and what I explained earlier with the geometric harmonization is that the homomorphisms will cover homomorphisms from L2 to L1. If you now have a symplectic manifold, let's just assume that M is simply connected, so the Poisson structure is omega inverse, and then the groupoid will just be the pair group void. Be the pair of voids. And then, if you have two Lagrangians, L1 and L2, then B1, 2 is the product. And if you take the homomorphisms from the identity to B1, 2, so that's the intersection of the diagonal copy of M with L1 cross L2. That just agrees with L1 intersect L2, which is what we're supposed to get as amorphisms from L2 to L1. This isn't really a proof that we get the right thing. It's kind of a heuristic argument, and I expect that getting it to actually work out would involve some technicalities, which maybe we can talk about in the discussion session. And I just wanted to mention that, okay, so for this thing that I Okay, so for this thing that I said that when we pull back, in general we'll get polyesotrophic. That means that we're kind of blocked in general. But there is actually some examples where we could get something, which is the case of stable GC structures. So stable GC structures are symplectic on an open net subset of the manifold. And so it follows that they have brains that are supported on things that are at least generically Lagrangian. Are at least generically Lagrangian. And so you can pull them back to get things that are Lagrangian or generically Lagrangian on the symplectic groupoid. And so I guess the question is, can we use this to compute the category of EC brains for stable GC structures? And a special case of that would be holomorphic log symbolic structures. Those defined stable GC structures. And more generally, we could also try to kind of use the same idea. Try to kind of use the same idea to compute categories of log symbols to manifolds. And I think this is what this question here is what Charlotte will talk about in her talk right after this one. I think maybe in the discussion session she'll tell us a bit about trying to use the group void, or at least comparing what you get with the groupoid. What you get with the group-load approach. And I guess an interesting special case of this would be veradical services. Okay, so in the last couple of minutes, I just want to say a bit about what we did for torque muscle structures. Do I have maybe five minutes to kind of take place? So yeah, so I want to consider a case of a toric muscle structure. So we're going to start with the toric K-lois structure. So here's the K-Lois structure Mi omega. It has a Hamiltonian action of a compact torus. And there's an extension as a holomorphic action of a complex torus. So this complex torus. So, this complex storage doesn't act in a Hamiltonian way, but it lifts to a Hamiltonian action on a cotangent bundle, a polymorphic cotangent bundle with a molten mouth that I'm calling J0. We're also assuming that we have an equivariant free quantization, so that means that we have a lift of the action, which I'm calling rho hat. So, I guess I'm calling the action of rho. So, we have a lift of C star to R. Of C star to automatic results of L. And then if we want to define a toric possible structures on this manifold, it turns out that they're always in use by our matuces. So we just take a skew symmetric and find a matrix. Here I'm assuming it's real. That's again, actually for simplicity, it's not necessary, but it makes things a little bit nicer. So we can define a holomorphic plasma structure, and then just by pushing. Structure and end just by pushing it forward with the toric action. And this also gives us a Puzzle module structure. We just use the lift to push forward C to a Puzzle structure on the total space. And basically we can just try to implement steps that I outlined before. So the Puzzle structure deforms I into a GC structure like this. And the Poisson module structure, it allows us to Module structure. It allows us to deform this auto equivalence to an auto equivalence of this category of brains. We also need, so we want to use the group point approach, so we need the symplicate group point of this puzzle structure. And here, well, it's such a nice puzzle structure that the integrating it is actually quite straightforward. There's actually, well, you can do it actually. Well, you can do it actually just using the flow construction. But also, there's a very nice, I think, early paper of Ping Shu, where he explained how to integrate positive structures that come from army over C. In any case, in this case, we get something very nice, which is that the symplectic group point has underlying symplectic manifold, which is the cotangent model. But the structure maps can be formed. Get deformed. What this means is that the A model is unchanged. The only thing that gets changed is the tensor product structure. That gets deformed. So here's a picture of what's happening. So we originally had the cotangent bundle, and these vertical lines were kind of the source antarctic fibers, which are equal, and now you turn on the deformation, and they kind of split with this. Okay, so if we want to construct the deformed homogeneous coordinate ring, we need to construct the family of frames by applying this kind of flow construction. And so the thing that deforms the nth tensor product of L is the nth tensor product. Well, it's the nth tensor product of L, but the connection is deformed. It's kind of an average, but it's an averaged connection. And now, if we want to get the brains on the group board, we just pull them back, like I said. And the thing that happens in this case, and this actually, this part depends on the armation being real, but it's not that much more complicated when it's unreal. More complicated when it's unreal, which is that this brain, the n0 that we get from pulling back, is actually equal to the brain that we had in the original K-ler case. The one that was encoding K times the symplectic form. So when we do this deformation, actually, the A model stays the same, and the brain stays the same. The only thing that changes is the tensor product. The only thing that changes is the tensor product. And so that means that when we express the algebra like this, the underlying vector space will be completely unchanged. The only thing that will change is the product, because that's induced from the tensor product structure. So here I just wanted to say in this slide: what is the geometry underlying these brains, the N0? Bn0. And essentially, the underlying structure are holomorphic, synthetic, Mauritian self-equivalences, so elements of the holomorphic Picardian group. And the tensor product of brains, if you kind of translate that to what it means geometrically, it corresponds to the composition of the Mauritius equivalences. And so kind of what we get is this kind of big. What we get is this kind of big gradient homomorphic sympathetic group OI equipped with a free quantization. And we can use that to define the quantization using the same prescription as before. So remember, in order to calculate the space of amorphisms, we need a holomorphic pre-quantization of the brain, which is just the same one as before, since the brain is unchanged. We then need this. We then need to this polarization, which is the poliation by holomorphic Lagrangian. And here we don't want to use the vertical anymore because those are no longer kind of compatible with the group width structure. So we use something else. What we use is a holomorphic at the moment in that. So And so, what we should take then is the space of holomorphic flat sections along the fibers of J that are supported on the fibers that actually intersect L. And this actually now behaves a lot differently from the vertical foliation. Let me just give a picture. So, here's the cotangent bundle in orange. Engine bundle in orange. These kind of red lines are the fibers of J. And here's the image of this map J, C to the N. And what we find is that, first of all, not all of the fibers emit flat sections. There's a Boris-Hummerfeld condition. And not all of the fibers intersect L. And the conditions you can kind of just use. And the conditions, you can kind of just view them just in terms of the image, is that the fibers need to live or integer points that kind of lie in the Delband polygode corresponding to the Kalar structure. And so what we end up getting is the, as the space of homomorphisms, is kind of naturally the white space decomposition. But I should say, I mean, this is Should say, I mean, this is very this kind of construction is inspired by the work on group width fundization of people like Weinstein and Banecki and Eli Hawkings. But the thing that's maybe different about this is that the quantization is not on some kind of abstract vector space. There is kind of a canonical way of identifying this Palm space with the space of global element. With the space of global holomorphic sections of L. And this, yeah, and this kind of decomposition corresponds to the weight space decomposition. Okay, so yeah, so in this case it actually works, and what we find is that the algebra is canonically isomorphic to the underlying graded vector space of the homogeneous coordinate ring, and under this identification, the product. The product of two sections is given like this. So it's like a quantum force. Okay, so yeah, I'll just end here. Thank you. I'm sorry if you want to. So we have a little time for questions. Hi, Francis, it's Brent. Thanks for the very nice talk. I was wondering if you could just quickly summarize, if you start with a holomorphic Poisson structure, what is the ultimate data that you need to construct in order to run this quantization procedure? If you have a holomorphic button structure, say I have a compact Kayler manifold. Hey, I'm a compact Kayler manifold. The question is what data do you need to construct on the symplectic groupway in order to carry out all the steps of this quantization proof? Right, so first of all, the quantization, the pre-quantization of the K-like form needs to emit a positive module structure because that's in order to deform the outer module. And that's in order to deform the auto equivalence. Where was it? Shown up here. In order to deform this tensor product auto equivalence, we need the tensor. We need the puzzle module structure. Okay, so if you have that, now you can now construct all of this sequence of brains like this. Okay, so then what you would do, let me go somewhere where it's really Let me go somewhere where it's written out. Is that okay, you have these brains and you can pull them back. So now you have a space-filling brain in the groupoid, and you need to calculate this odomorphism. And you need to do this in a way, well, I mean this is the main instruction, is how to do that. Is how to do that. And one way of doing it, which we relied on here, is to use a polarization. And it would have to be a multiplicative polarization. But I think you don't need something so strict. If you had so So if you look at the polarization, these kind of red lines, those are actually kind of like partially defined bisections in the group way. They're kind of mirror morphic bisection. And if you had a good handle on the space of bisections, you could be able to You might be able to run the construction just if you had a good handle on this space, on this kind of modular space of bisections. But that's kind of work in progress that we haven't. Yeah, so does that answer your question? Okay, I think so, yeah. Thank you. Yep. Do we have a question? Yeah, I want to come back to the question I was asking because at some point you said. Is asking because at some point you said that, sorry, that if you pull back, so if you take these brains and if you look at the light range in subgroup words, that that's the incorrect or your words was it seems to be incorrect. Is it that you have some example where you see that that doesn't work? Well, why do you say that? In this example here, where we want to get to the quantization, so okay. The quantization. So if we took the kind of the conomal bundle or whatever to this to this space field brain on the base, we would just get the zero section. And so that would mean that we'd be computing homomorphisms from the zero section to itself, or something like that. And I guess we would
