Thank you to the other organizers, Kostia, Rahul, and Shondritti for inviting me to give this talk and for organizing this nice meeting. So this work that I'm presenting is a collaboration with John Gibbon, and it is a study on the spectrum of turbulent systems that relies heavily on a study that John did. Study that John did with Charlie During exactly 20 years ago. So, of course, all of you know extremely well that the energy spectrum plays an important role in turbulent systems because it describes how energy is distributed across the scales. And you also know extremely well that there can be different ranges where this spectrum displays a power law behavior. Displays a power law behavior and the slope can depend strongly on the nature of the flow, whether it is three-dimensional or two-dimensional, where it is forced, whether there is an external magnetic field, or if there is a rotation, for example. Now, in the physical literature, typically these spectra are estimated by using empirical or dimensional arguments, but also And but also with closure models or techniques like the renormalization group. From a mathematical point of view, it is usually a difficult task to calculate the spectrum directly from the Navistok's equations, because on the one hand, on the side of statistical theories of turbulence, the spectra are statistical. Spectra are statistical quantities, indeed, whereas in the mathematical analysis, one usually deals with estimates for norms of the velocity or their derivatives of different orders. So, I'm not saying this has not been done, but it's a difficult problem to match the two approaches. So, one possible way to do so was proposed, as I said, by Charlie During and John. Charlie Doring and John Gibbon in these two papers. And essentially, they proposed an observable which can be estimated based on empirical arguments, but which also has a counterpart in the mathematical analysis as a ratio of norms of velocity of derivatives. So, what we did with John, so these studies were done. So, these studies were done for three-dimensional turbulence. What we did with John was to extend this study to other hydrodynamic PDEs, which also display a turbulent regime, namely the 2D Navistox equations in the direct and inverse cascade regimes, the Berger's equations, and the Shell model. So, as you will see from a physical point of view, the prediction. Point of view, the predictions are not new at all. They are the predictions which are well known since a long time. And to some extent, also there are mathematical results which have already been discovered. But what I think is interesting in this study is that within the same framework, within the same approach, which is quite natural, we can recover all these predictions together. Predictions together. So, after this, maybe long introductory slide, let me move to the setting that I'm going to consider. It's the usual one, that is the Navistoks equations. Here I'm introducing the definitions in D dimensions, where d equal one would be the Burgess equation and D equal zero would be the shell model, but these definitions apply to all of them. One is just to One is just to simply adjust what is needed. So it's, of course, incompressible and in a periodic domain with a size capital L. Then the forcing is a standard one, time independent, mean zero and divergenceless. And we're assuming it a narrow band, that is, the energy contact in Fourier space is concentrated around a characteristic wave number, which I Characteristic wave number, which I will denote as one over L. And then a parameter which will enter into play is the ratio between the size of the domain and the scale of the forcing. Then one can introduce the RMS of the forcing and the RMS of the velocity, which also involves a long time average. And by using these two, I can define the Grassov number. Two, I can define the Krasov number and the Reynolds number, which here would then be a large-scale Reynolds number. And the two quantities, the two dimensionless numbers, are related through this inequality, well-known inequality, which is due to During and Fouriers. And it enters the proofs, but since I'm not going through the details, I will not use it in this talk. But the thing, the reason. Talk, but the reason why I'm mentioning it is because the Grassov number is the control parameter in this system. And so a way to achieve the turbulent regime, the large Reynolds number regime, is to take the large Grassoff number limit. So the limits that I'm going to consider are limit of infinite Grassoff number, which in turn imply infinite Reynolds number. So let me now introduce the number of the number of Refuge So, let me now introduce the method that was proposed by During and Giebun. So, there are two, as I said, there are two steps. One starts from some empirical assumptions, then one makes some rigorous predictions to constrain these assumptions, if you want. So, as I said, the study was done in 3D terms. Said the study was done in 3D turbulence. The assumption is that there is an inertial range between the forcing scale, which will take of the same order as the large scale of the domain, as the size of the domain, and a dissipation wave number, a cutoff wave number, Kc or Knu, as is usually denoted. And within this range, we assume a constant energy. Energy transfer, but we leave a free slope. We have a slope behavior k to the power law behavior. We assume a power law behavior, but with a slope q that we don't fix. This necessarily brings in the scale of the force in the expression for the energy spectrum. So now the energy spectrum in sorry. Energy spectrum in sorry, the dissipation rate can be expressed in terms of the spectrum in this way. And if I introduce this expression into the integral and I neglect the energy content beyond the dissipation rate, beyond the dissipation wave number, I get this estimate for epsilon. And by using the large scale expression for the dissipation rate, I have this estimate for the dissipation wave number. Dissipation wave number Kc. Now, what Dering and Gibbon proposed is to consider the following observable, which could be described as the two nth moment of the energy spectrum. And by replacing, by using these estimates for the spectrum and for the dissipation weight number. For the dissipation weight number, one can estimate this capital Kn in this way in terms of the dissipation number, and then one can obtain this estimate in terms of the Reynolds number, where the power, of course, the exponent, of course, depends on the slope of the spectrum. And obviously, if we replace Q with the K41 prediction 5 thirds, we recover the Five-thirds, we recovered the usual prediction for the Komogorov scale and for the equivalent prediction for the analogous prediction for this capital Kn. So the idea of doing a bundle was, as I said, not to fix Q, to reach this expression with the free parameter Q, and then find an analysis equivalent. Equivalent which could be estimated rigorously and which could be used to constrain the value of the spectrum, determine Q from the mathematical counterpart of this capital Kn so what would be this analysis counterpart? So what they suggested was what they proposed is to first consider L2 To first consider L2 norms of the nth derivatives of the velocity. Then, for technical reasons, so this is noted as HN, for technical reasons, they also added a term which is always positive. This is because they needed to consider ratios of these norms and they needed to prevent the denominators from becoming from vanishing. Coming from vanishing. So, just a small comment here: this time scale tau n is chosen in such a way that when we take the infinite grass of limit, the forcing term does not overcome the flow term. Otherwise, we wouldn't be studying the flow anymore, but the forcing. So, it is in such a way that the scaling of the forcing doesn't contaminate the one of Hm. The one of Hm. And so, when we study the large grass of limit, we are really studying what the flow does in that case. I can be more specific on this point. I have a slide on it, but I'll keep it at the end for the end if someone is interested of the risk time. So, also these quantities satisfy a hierarchy of inequalities which relate f quantities of different. Quantities of different orders n, so derivatives of different orders. Now, from these quantities, the idea was to construct these other mathematical quantities kappa n, which have the dimensions of an inverse length or a wave number, and which are the ratios of this fn over f0, which is related to the. F0, which is related to the energy. And if we use the Parseval equality on these, on the numerator and denominator of this quantity raised to the power 2n, we see that they are indeed related to the instantaneous spectrum of the velocity. So these ratios are related to the two-engin moments of the spectrum as the observable, in the same way as the observable The observable in the same way as the observables that I mentioned before. And then the idea was: if one is able to estimate the averages of these quantities, then one can end their dependence on Reynolds. One can use this riborous result to say something about the slope of the spectrum. So the results they obtained was the following for the average of kappa n. The average of kappa n, which gives this scaling in terms of Reynolds. Here, there is a small delta correction, which is there for again for technical reasons, but it won't affect the prediction for the slope of the spectrum. So, let me now see what these rigorous results say about the spectrum, and let me summarize then the approach. So, as I said, on the one hand, one On the one hand, one has some assumptions on the spectrums, the construction of these observables, which then scale in this way with the dependence of the power law on Q. On the other hand, one has these ratios of norms for which one can obtain a rigorous estimate and one can compare the two behaviors. And if one does so, one If one does so, one assumes that this exponent cannot be larger than this one, sorry, one obtains this inequality for q, which here still depends on delta on n and n. But if one minimizes the upper bound, one obtains this result, this upper bound of eight-thirds, which was also obtained much earlier by Suleiman Frisch in another. In another mathematical study of the Navy-Stokes equations, where they showed that if the system has to sustain a direct speed of energy, that can happen only if the spectrum has a slope Q, which is less than eight-thirds. So, this is in agreement with this result. One small comment. Um the relation between, I mean, these two quantities are not exactly the same thing, so it's more an identification between the two, or if one wants to use this expression, a moral equivalence between the two. Because you see, for example, here the spectrum is an average quantity, so this capital Kn are ratios of it's a ratio of two averages, whereas here we have an average of a ratio. Of a ratio. So they're slightly different, but the idea of During and Gibbon is that they would behave similarly, scale similarly. And as I'm going to show, this is indeed successful not only in 3D, but also in other systems. One more comment on the result of Düring and Gibbon. They also considered a slightly different version of the Navistox sequence. Slightly different version of the Navistoks equations, which is the following: a Navistoks equation, a 3D Navistoks equation, supplemented with this approximation, where one assumes that the velocity gradient in L infinity scales in the same way as the velocity gradient in Lp. This amounts to considering a suppression of the large fluctuations of the velocity gradient. Large fluctuations of the velocity gradient. And the suppression is stronger and stronger as P decreases, the strongest being for P equals. If one makes this assumption, this additional assumption, the scaling for the kappa n's, their averages, is of course modified. And so when one compares them with the capital Kn with the empirical estimates, one obtains a different. Estimates, one obtains a different bound for the spectrum Q, where of course the upper bound now depends on P. And the range of, interestingly, the range for this upper bound is from 8 thirds when P is equal to infinity down to 5 thirds, the K41 prediction, when P is equal to 2. So when the suppression of fluctuations is the strongest. The strongest. So now, this was a summary of the approach of During Gibbon. And as I mentioned, the idea was to extend it to other systems. So I will detail the case of the two Dina-Vistock's equations, and then I will just simply state the results for the Burgess equations and for the Shell models. So for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations, For the two Dienawist-Dokes equations, as you know, there is a double cascade scenario. I'm going to focus on the two cascades separately. It's just easier. So for the direct cascade, I'm going to consider to describe the direct cascade, I'm going to consider this limit, infinite Grassoff number, which means infinite Reynolds number, and I'll fix the scale. And I'll fix the scale of the forcing at a value comparable to that of the domain so that there is a negligible inverse cascade. So, in this range, I can again use for the empirical step of the approach, I can use the usual estimate for the spectrum. Here now, I have the anstrophy dissipation rate and the free slope Q. Can use the definition of the ancestrophy dissipation rate, its large-scale value, and obtain again an approximate estimate for the dissipation wave number, where of course if I replace Q with the three, the Crichton prediction, I get one half, which is the usual expectation. And once again, I can define the two nth moments of this spectrum, which will Of this spectrum, which will scale with the Reynolds number in this way, a power with an exponent that depends on the slope of the spectrum, and which I would like to bound again by using a rigorous estimate for the kappa n's. So to do this, we can use this theorem by Gibbon and Pavlioptis, which found this estimate for the kappa n's. I remind you that these are rays. These are ratios of norms of the velocity derivatives, which are supposed to be the counterpart of the Kns. And now I can compare the two exponents to obtain this bound for the slope Q, which once minimized gives 11 thirds. It's interesting that this 11 thirds for the spectrum was again Was again predicted by Suleiman Fritsch for 2D-dimensional turbulence as an upper bound, of course. It was observed also by Gilbert and it was again predicted rigorously by Greg in this paper, 96 paper. Now, let me this result though. This result, though, can be further improved or tightened in one situation which is rather common in simulations. Yes, good. So here I'm repeating the result of during of Gibbon Pavliotis, which yielded this 11 third exponent. This 11-third exponent. In the proof, as I mentioned at the beginning, one needs to use this hierarchy of inequalities for the quantities fn, which are related to the derivatives of the velocity. And as I said, what is crucial is how we treat the L infinity norm of the gradient. And the way we treat it will vary according to the system we consider. According to the system we consider. And this is what will give a different slope. So, in their paper, they estimated graduate infinity by using this Gauss-Calou inequality. And as you can see, the main part which needed to be controlled is this H2, which is related to the fourth derivative of the velocity field, and which could be the palimstrophy. Lingstrophy and they used this general bound which goes as Reynolds to the power three. Now, however, there is a result by Alexakis and During, which says that if we consider a forcing with strictly one length scale, or which maintains a constant energy injection rate, which is the usual. Which is the usual, which is a common assumption, a common setting in simulations. If we do this, there is a title bound on the Palinstrophy, which goes as a Reynolds squared. Then, if we take this one and use it in the proof of the theorem, we get a different bound for kappa n compared to the general one. And when we exploited this one in the approached One in the approach I detailed before, this gives for Q an upper bound which is three, which is Kreitland's prediction, except of course for the logarithmic corrections, for the direct cascade of energy. Let me now come to the inverse cascade regime. So once again, I want to focus on the inverse cascade regime and so neglect the direct cascade of anstrophy. A scale of anstrophy. I introduce a small scale velocity at the scale of the forcing, and I define by using this a Reynolds number at the scale of the forcing. So to study the inverse cascade, I will take the situation where the size of the domain goes to infinity while the scale of the compared to the scale of the forcing. And I keep this Reynolds number at the scale of the forcing order one. So that the scale of the forcing. Forcing order one, so that the scale of the forcing and the dissipation number are comparable. And so there is negligible direct scale of an stroke. So if I do this, my empirical part of the approach assumes again a power load behavior of the spectrum. It is known from a result of Smith and Yakot and Tran that the large scale velocity is related to the small scale one through this coefficient. Through this coefficient, which depends on the slope of the spectrum. And so my large-scale Reynolds number is related to the small scale one through this other coefficient. And since I'm taking this order one, Reynolds, the large scale Reynolds number will scale with A L in this way. Once again, I introduce the 2Nth moment of the spectrum, and as usually, I estimated them in this way, which gives me this prediction in terms of A. gives me this prediction in terms of AL. Note that now the relevant parameter is AL, not the Reynolds number. And for reasons that will be clear in a minute, I use this expression to rewrite this estimate in this way. Now I go to the rigorous results for the kappa n's and I get this other estimate. As you can see, I used this rewriting of the expression. Writing of the expression in order to obtain Reynolds to the power one-half in both cases. And now I can compare the exponents for AL. As I said, this is now the relevant parameter in this inverse password regime. And when I compare the two, I obtain a lower bound for the slope of the spectrum, which is a five-thirds. This time is a lower bound, and which Which interestingly coincides with the Kuiknas prediction for the inverse cascade and with another rigorous results by Trump again on the inverse cascade regime. It is also interesting here that the lower bound is, of course, it involves n, but it's the lower bound which is maximized by n equal to one. So by some kind of large-scale quantities. Kind of large-scale quantities, not by the high-order derivatives, which reflects the fact that the inverse cascade regime involves the large scales instead of the small ones. So coming now to the Burgers equations very quickly, as I mentioned, it's how we estimate the velocity gradient in L infinity that modifies our scaling for the kappa n's. For the kappa n's in 1d, we can use this estimate, which then gives a slope of with an upper bound which is 2, which again agrees with the numerical simulations and previous mathematical predictions. And similarly for the shell model, the equivalent of the gradu infinite gradu in In L infinity is this relation, which is even stronger than in 1D. And we can study, define the kappa n's by using the usual parallels between Navi-Stokes and the Shell model. When we do this parallel and we use the approach I detailed throughout this talk, we obtain a slope of five-thirds, which is again the expected predictions. The expected predictions. Interestingly, this graduate infinity, this inequality, is the Navier-Stokes equivalent of this one. So somehow the Shell model is equivalent to the Navier-Stokes equation with this suppression of fluctuations. And this strengthens an analogy with John and I developed. John and I developed in this paper last year between exactly the shell model and the Navistoks equations with this suppression fluctuations. Now, very quickly, I'm concluding by summarizing the results here and by saying that once again, what I said at the beginning, I think this approach was interesting because it allows to recover within the same framework a lot of expectations that were observed in physics. Were observed in physics and in other mathematical contexts. So I'll stop with this. Thank you very much. Thank you, Dario. There's one question by Greg. Okay, I had just a couple of comments and questions. I guess there was an upper bound on the Enstrophy Cascade of three before by myself and also by Tron and Dritzel. So they also derive. So they also derive for the anstrophy cascade the Q less than or equal to three. Yes. So that's just one remark. Thank you. Yes. I guess another point is that there's a significant difference between the argument that Frisch and Sulim used and several other people after it, including myself, which was flux-based, and this argument, which is, as you pointed out, based on dissipation range quantities. Participation range quantities. And I would say that, in particular, in light of what I discussed in my talk, I mean, all of these quantities that you're considering will be very strongly influenced by thermal noise. So in fact, that I think that the calculations that you did here will be fundamentally changed in a real molecular fluid, whereas the arguments that go back to Frisch are unscathed. They remain. And I think that's an important. And I think that's an important distinction between these classes of arguments. Yes, thank you for the comment. Yes. What I would say that being based on the Navier-Dokes equations, they necessarily are not. I mean, Ramian, we don't reach molecular scales. So necessarily. Well, molecular scales are millimeters. So the point is. Scales are millimeters. So the point is that these thermal effects appear already at basically macroscopic scales of order millimeter scale. So they're right around the Kolmogorov scale. And all the quantities that are being considered, these high-order gradients are getting their dominant contribution from below the Kolmogorov scale. Yes. Those things are deep in the dissipation range, where what we find in the simulation with John Bell is that all With John Bell, is that all of those are radically changed from Nabia Stokes? Yeah, yes. What I wanted to say is that it's not a change in the approach, probably, but it's changing the mood. It's changing the mood. Okay. I hope that John would excuse me if I ask you to postpone the questions to the discussion session and move to the next speaker.
