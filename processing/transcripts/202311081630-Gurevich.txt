So I will talk about the automorphic functional on the minimal representation for exceptional groups and groups of type D. So this topic is not related directly to R2 packets, but as we have seen from the lecture of Edmund, minimal representations are very useful. Are very useful, could be useful for constructing certain RTOR packets. So, in a sense, there is a relation. This is a joint work with David Kershda. So, I will start with a classical question. I will remind you about the Poisson summation formula. So, let V be just a quadratic space over a global field, and we consider a space of Schwarz functions. This space This space functions, smooth functions on complex support on a local field. There is a distinguished function called spherical one, which is just the characteristic function of integer points. And we have a known classical Fourier transform, which is the automorphism of this space, which pres for correct choice of data, preserves measures and so on. Measures and so on preserves the spherical function. So, given all this data, we can form a restricted tensor product of those Schwartz spaces. This space is called a Schwartz space of the adyelic functions, functions on the adylic vector space. This restricted product is taken with respect to a family of spherical functions. All right, so. All right, so the classical Poisson summation formula states that when summing over rational points of this vector space of a Fourier transform of a function is the same as summing over rational points of values of function itself. Okay, and this can be reformulated in the following way, the functional, which we call tetevi. Which we call tetavi, summing over rational points of this quadratic space of values of function is invariant under Fourier transform. So let us try to interpret it, give it more representation theory flavor. In fact, the space of Schwarz functions has much more symmetries than just the Fourier transform. On it, On it, and it is known that the big, rather big group, which is the covering group of the symplectic group, acts on this space as P2N, where if V is n-dimensional. And the action is called a Baylor presentation. This is so-called minimal representation for the simply active group. And the action can be written. Can be written explicitly on the Siegel parabolic subgroup. As you see, there is a Siegel parabolic subgroup where N is abelian unipotent radical. There is just one such subgroup. And the elements of the unipotent radical and levy are acting very. Radical and levy are acting very explicitly as written here. Psi here is certain additive character y, chi is a certain character of the Levy subgroup L, while the viral element, which is not connected in P, acts by a Fourier transform. So, in and it is quite And it is quite easy to see that from just first two formula that the theta functional, which is sum of over all rational points, is invariant under rational points of P of F, rational points of this Ziegel parabolic subgroup. But the whole group G, G here is this symplectic group. Is this symplectic group sp2n? It's in fact it's covered, but it splits over rational points. So g of f is generated by the elements of the Ziegel parabolic together with this Weyl element. So if in addition the functional Teta V is invariant under Fourier transform, it can be reformulated that Formulated that it follows from this that the functional above is in fact invariant under all rational points of sp of this double cover sp to n okay which as i said split over sp to n um anyhow we can reformulate that in the following way that the uh the poisson uh summary The Poisson summation formula is equivalent to the fact that theta v is g of f invariant functional on the space of the linear representation, which by Frobenius reciprocity just equivalent to the fact that the V representation is automorphic representation by this functional, it can be embedded into the space of automorphic forms. All right. All right. So this data V gives G of invariant functional. And the question arises, what about other groups? Are minimal representations which are analog of the Vale representation can also do they also have models similar to that model and similar explicit Similar explicitly written automorphic functions. Let me also say one important comment about this theta of V, which is there is a decomposition which at this point maybe looks a little bit artificial. We can decompose the functional into two pieces. One of them is the PFA invariant functional, which Invariant functional, which is just summing over all elements not equal to zero. Okay, it is not g of f invariant, just p of f invariant. While the other piece carries even it is also not g of f invariant, obviously, because only the sum is. But the other term, which is just evaluation at zero, has much more invariance just from the formals. It is possible to see that it. It is possible to see that it is invariant under N of A, M of F, even to be honest, invariant under N of A and the derived group of M of A. Okay, anyhow, the first term will be called the main term of this data, while the phi of zero term will be The phi of zero term will be a boundary term because it carries it is invariant under adylic points of certain unipotent subgroup in this case, unipotent radical. Okay, so we shall see analogues of this decomposition further. So our goal would be to To describe similar functionals for other groups and to look at such a decomposition, which will be more complicated than in this case. Okay, so let me again set the goals. We start with the split simply connected group. Over a global field F of type D or E. Okay, our actual goal will be the E cases, but it's important to incorporate the D and case as a good example. Okay, so I will define and talk about the properties of minimal representations in several next slides, but let me. Several next slides, but while stating the goals, so let me just say that there is a minimal representation of the group G. Not all the groups carry minimal representations, but the groups of type D and E do. So the minimal representation of the Adelic group is automorphic. It can be realized in the space of automorphic forms using Using as a residue of certain degenerate Eisenstein series, meaning Eisenstein series, which are induced from a character from certain maximal parabolic subgroup. And this maximal parabolic subgroup is not unique for every group. So the same representation by can be realized as residues of different point of different. Different point from Eisenstein's series of different probabilities subgroups. Still, as an automorphic space, it will be the same automorphic space, meaning pi has multiplicity one. I will mention that further. It sits inside the discrete spectrum, automorphic square integrable spectrum of G. And in this talk, I will actually in our work, we consider only cases of Cases of Siegel parabolic subgroup or Heisenberg parabolic subgroup. So for types D and E, there is a unique Heisenberg parabolic subgroup. And Siegel means for us that the unipotent radical is a billion. Okay, this one can be not unique, as I will show later. Show later, okay, but and for example, for E8 case, there is no legal parabolic at all. So we consider only the pairs which exist, but just what is important, we do not consider the parabolic which are neither Siegel nor Heisenberg. Okay, so now here are the goals. First of all, to describe fixing such P, to describe a model. To describe a model of the minimal representation, meaning space of functions, I will comment on this in a moment, on which the subgroup P of A acts explicitly by explicit formulas. And second, okay, so yeah, what I should say that the realization The realization of pi as a residue of Eisenstein series can be called the spectral realizations, realization through spectral tools. But then when we can describe a model of functions, this realization by definition gives us a functional on A functional on such functional on the space of X. Okay, and now we want to consider some geometric decomposition of it. We want to decompose this functional as a sum of its main term and successive boundary terms. So the main terms theta of x will be Will be just the sum over irrational points of X. Okay. And when we say boundary terms, the boundary terms are remaining terms which will be always invariant under adylic points of some unipotent subgroups. So I will specify this when we come to the theory. Okay, but what's important? To the theory. Okay, but what's important is that this theta G L I call G L because it is functional, which it is defined on a certain model, which itself depends on P and hence on its levy part L. Okay, so the functional is given by spectral means and, but we want in the second part. But we want in the second part, we want to realize to decompose it in geometric terms. So let me comment on what was done, the work that has been done before. First of all, for description of a model of S of X, there was a long series of works started with Kashdan Savin and then Fyodor. Savin and Rummelhardt, and more results appeared in the papers of Gannon, Salvin, Savin, Woodbury, Kobayashi and Salvin. So, here we have nothing new to add. I will just review the results so that because I need certain notations. And as for decomposition of this invariant functional, Kazdan and Polishuk, some fifteen years ago, Years ago, had the paper on that. So, this work can be viewed as a completion of what has begun in that work. Okay, so now I will start explaining the basics of minimal representation. Of minimal representation. So there are many definitions of equivalent definition of what minimal representations are, and this representation has been well studied. So I will, since we're talking only about on the representation of the split groups and this minimal representation is unramified, I will just describe its attack parameter, which anyhow will be useful. Which anyhow will be useful for future. So, the Sataki parameter of the minimal representation corresponds to the sub-regular unipotent orbit in the dual group. So, every group contains a sub-regular unipotent orbit, the next after the regular one. And by Jacobson-Morozo theorem, all the unipotent orbits are stained. Are stained correspondence with orbits of SL2 triple. So for any unipotent orbits, there is an orbit of distinguished semi-simple elements where t correspond to the triple EFT, where E belongs to this given orbit. Okay, and the values of roots. Roots on this distinguished element are encoded usually on weighted Dinking diagram, and here are the weighted Dinking diagram on corresponding to those orbits. So we occasionally will need also the groups of type A and so here is this is the This is the sub-regular weighted linking diagram for this case, for DN and for E8. So you might ask, what about E7 and E6? And E7 and E6 are sub-diagrams of E8s. And basically, they have the same weighted linking diagram, meaning zero on the branching root and truce on all the rest. Okay? So this element. So this element, distinguished semi-simple element, this distinguished semi-simple element of the dual torus corresponds to the character, unarmified character of the torus, from which you have the induced representation. And the minimal representation is just an unramified constituent of this one. Of this one. Okay. So this is a nice definition. However, it is not very easy to get out of the properties of pi. And I will now, so to compute the models of this minimal representation, as I said already before, we need Before, we need to pick up a parabolic subgroup, okay, which will act explicitly on this model. So, let me now talk about which parabolics we are going to consider and why. So, every parabolic maximum, so I'm talking only about maximal parabolic subgroups, P, say it to be L V. And as I said, it will be. Said it will be only either Ziegel or Heisenberg, and those pairs for short, I will call them S-type pairs and H-type pairs, according to whether V is abelian or is a Heisenberg. So which pair are we going to consider? The pair is called weakly admissible if pi, which is a priori just a constituent of the induced from certain. Of certain induced principal series induced from Borel, it's in fact induced from a much smaller representation, degenerate principal series at certain point. Such p is not in general not unique. And we call gl to be weakly admissible if pi sits inside this number as zero will be called an s parameter of the pair. We'll be using it. We'll be using it later. Okay, so why those pairs are interesting? This is because for weakly admissible pairs. Excuse me, is there a question? For weekly admissible pairs, the representation pi is indeed can be realized as Indeed, it can be realized as a residue from the Eisenstein series. Okay, this will be our main tool, so that's why we are interested in weakly admissible pairs. But we, in fact, among weakly admissible pairs, there are subclass which is even more important called admissible pairs. Okay, so which pairs are admissible? These are These are the pairs if the sub-regular character corresponding to G, when we restrict it to the torus of this maximal levy or rather derived maximal levy, we get the sub-regular character of the maximal levy. It is easy to explain this in terms of diagram. In terms of diagram, look, for example, the pair E seven in E8 is weakly admissible because when we consider the subdiagram of corresponding to E7, we see that it is again the subdiagram corresponding to the unipotent orbit or the The pair dn and dn minus one is also admissible because when we restrict to the sub diagram, we get again the sub-regular diagram. Okay, or say if you are looking at E6, the E6A5. Okay, just ignore this to last. These two last one are is admissible because we see that this is exactly the sub-regular diagram of A5. Okay. Okay, so we talked about I'll explain later why those admissible pairs are. Those admissible pairs are particularly good. Let me just throw a bit more of notation about how the pair GL can be completed to the triple GL and M. So this is pretty simple. The pair any maximal parabolic correspondence. Any maximal parabolic correspond to a choice of one simple root, okay, and say call it beta zero. Take a root, there is unique beta root in all the for all the pairs in question. Actually, this is not true, but there is unique root beta one connected to beta zero, which itself defines a maximal parabolic of uh um L. L. So let us just see a couple of examples. We consider the group E7. If we start with E7, D6 pair, then the completion is just A5. If we start with E7, E6D pair, then the completion filter is Each other is K5 and D5, right? So this is the D5 and this is the K5. Okay. So here there is just a list of the relevant weekly admissible pairs that we look at. So in this table are So in this table are encoded also the triples GLM for admissible pairs and their type and also the parameter as zero. Okay, so you might notice that there are three excuse me, is there a question? I heard some I heard some voices. So there are three pairs of type of Heisenberg type for E6, E7, E8. Note that the pair of DN, there is no pairs of DN of Heisenberg types. And there are the Of Heisenberg types, and the other pairs are of siegel type. Okay, so there are more examples of the pair dn minus 1, dn minus 2, which we have seen before in A6, A5. This is an H pair. This is an example of S pair, and this is an example of H pair. Okay, so after we talked what are the good models that we consider Let us talk about what, not models, what are the good pairs to consider. What is the model related to this pair? So here is what we do. What does it mean to construct a model? We need, first of all, to construct a variety over a space. Here, f continues to be the local field. And we construct a space of functions, certain space of functions on which Space of functions on which on x smooth functions on which g of f acts such that the action of p of f is given by explicit formulas. Okay, this space is contained in the space of smooth functions and contains the space of functions of compact support. So it is needed to determine the asymptotic of the functions at infinity. And this asymptotic is related to the Jacques functor of the K functor of the minimal representation pi. Okay, moreover, it is also important to give the formula for the spherical function in this space. So this also has been done by Kerzdan and Polyshuk for H pairs and by Simon and Woodbury by Ed for S pairs. And when the local model is constant. And when the local model is constructed, we construct the global model as just taking the restricted tensor product of local spaces with respect to defined of this local spherical functions. Okay, so let us specify how we construct those models. Those models for S pairs and for H pairs separately. So, the whole idea is that the idea of construction of the variety X in the model is the fact that minimal representation pi has with respect to this V has a very small spectrum. Okay, I will stress it. I will stress it in a minute. So let us consider what is the, let us, let me recall what is the V spectrum of the representation pi. So first of all, V is abelian, hence all its representations are just characters, and all the characters of V are parameterized by the elements of the opposite unipotent radical, just via. Important radical just via because we have a non-degenerate pairing from v op times on v given by the killing form. So all the characters correspond to the elements, the variety of all the characters of V is basically the variety of the opposite radical and L acts on it and let X be the minimal non-zero orbit. Non-zero orbit. Okay, this is a quasi-affine variety whose affine closure is obtained by just adding a zero point for the op. Okay, so the main result, the result about the spectrum is that of pi that in fact the only the representation pi sees The representation π sees a character x as a V representation only if x belongs to this minimal orbit. And moreover, this home space is one dimension. Okay, otherwise it is zero. And this gives us a structure of linear bundle over X with fibers, those home spaces. And this linear bundle is trivializable, which gives pi. gives pi any vector of pi gives rise to a section of this linear bundle. In fact, since this is trivializable, it gives an embedding into the space of smooth functions of X in a standard way. And the space S is just the image of this embedding. Okay, this doesn't yet give Give a very clear description of what this space, this space S is, but it's possible, not hard to show that it contains the space of compactly supported function. And if we so, and even moreover, it is contained in the space of functions of bounded support. So hence it only remains to understand the behavior of this function toward zero. And this is given again by the formula, the space of germs of functions, is just equal actually to the Jacques functor of pi. Okay, so now So now let me recall the formula, very important formula for the spherical function. This one was obtained by Simon and Woodbury, which says that the so first let me take a qualitative statement. For small elements, x is just a vector in the op, hence the norm is defined as a The norm is defined with respect to given a pinning. Okay, so for vectors near zero, the spherical function is a sum of a constant and a function which is homogeneous of a certain degree minus d zero. This d zero is an integer element for admissible pairs. It is zero. It is a It is zero. It is strictly bigger than zero for weekly, just weekly admissible, but non-admissible. It might be zero, but let me not comment on that at the moment. So, this is a qualitative statement. It's a constant plus homogeneous functions of a certain degree. But it's also important: the quantitative statement that for the spherical function is. Is uh this constant is zeta value at the point minus d zero. Okay, the second constant is not so important. Okay, but so by applying Ivasava decomposition, one can easily see also from the formulas of action of P that any function, so since spherical function changes. Generates the minimal representation, as minimal representation is irreducible, that any function near zero has a form of a constant plus a homogeneous function. Well, homogeneous function of certain degree on this orbit, okay, and it must be noted that the orbit X it's X, it's a homogeneous space with an action. So it's a single orbit of L, where the stabilizer is almost a maximal parabolic subgroup. So homogeneous functions on the orbit correspond to a section of the induced representation on L induced from a maximal parabolic subgroup, which is in fact Q. So from this, So, from this, it follows that the Jacques functor of the minimal representation is a sum of the constant. This constant is exactly correspond to the constant. Like what for phi zero, we have this decomposition. Similarly, the Jacques-Fantra decomposition. The Jacques-Fantra decomposes as a sum of one-dimensional representation and a subspace of certain induced representation, which turns out to be exactly the minimal representation of the Levy subgroup. Okay, which is a very nice structure. So know that this is true only for GL, which are admissible. So here the notion of admissible comes is a necessary one. Is a necessary one. This statement has been proved by Sagin many years back. But pi one being a minimal representation might itself have a, or actually does itself have, has a model, say, x1, okay, realized on functions of a variety x1. On functions of a variety x1. And so we fix a boundary map from pi to pi1, right, which goes through factors through the Jacquet factor, okay, which is normalized sending by the spherical, the normalized spherical function on x to normalized spherical function on x1. In the space of function of x1. Okay, so look again at the blue statements. Okay, they describe the V this is a description of a V spectrum of representation pi, so with respect to non-trivial character and the trivial character, and again, I stress that the fact And again, I stress that the fact that this V spectrum is so small, this gives rise to the model of pi as functions on this x and the description of the behavior of those functions at zero. Okay, let me quickly say what we have for H pairs. So here it's all a little bit. And so here it's all a little bit complicated because V is not abelian, but rather is a Heisenberg group. So it contains a center and in between it contains some maximal abelian subgroup, V plus. So one of the determining properties of pi is that The home space of pi with respect to V plus to every character which is non-trivial when restricted to Z is just one-dimensional. Okay, so by Frobenius reciprocity is the same as home from pi to this. Um, this induced representation, which is basically the Heisenberg representation of the Heisenberg group, what's called Fonston-Neumann theorem. So this is also related to the Fourier-Jacobi functor, which already appeared in the talk of Edmund. And so this means exactly as before, this gives us some linear bundle over V plus, oh sorry, over X. This is the variety of points which were parametrized by parametrizing all those characters. Okay, and again pi can be embedded in. Pi can be embedded in the space of functions on x. But then we have the yet further term corresponding. So now we want to consider a spectrum of characters of V. So these are representations which are trivial on Z. This is very similar to what we had in the abelian. Um abelian case uh inside the abelian group, which is a quotient of this uh opposite uh uh radical by its center, there is a minimal L orbit. Okay, it is again uh its affine closure is again it can be obtained by adding zero. The dimension of this y is one less than the dimension of v plus, which gives us. V plus, which gives us the model. Yeah, and again, the home space is one-dimensional for y in this orbit and is zero. Otherwise, this again gives us a linear bundle, which gives rise to the realization of the Jacques functor of pi on certain functions of y. So there is a Y. So there is a space a map from pi to pi z, which is a projection map. To it corresponds, we can fix a map from functions on x to functions on y. And now we should talk, we should say very briefly about the spherical function. All this is going to be important for formulating our main result. So it is. So, it is a bit difficult to give an explicit formula for phi zero. This has been done by in Kashdan Podishu's paper, but it is rather easy to give a formula for the image of the spherical function, which is very similar to what we had before: a constant plus a homogeneous function. And so, again, we have from this. We have from this, we have a description of the Shaker functions as a one-dimensional space plus the minimal representation of the Levy group L. We again have the boundary map just as before. And just remember that any function in the space of for any function of the minimum representation. Of the minimal representation, when we send it with this yota to functions on y, it has a form of a constant plus a homogeneous function of a given degree. So this constant will be called the regularized value at zero. Okay, in this case and also in the smaller case. We don't have a value, actual value at zero because the function Value at zero because the function goes to infinity through thanks to this term. Okay, this term. But this one is called, they clearly can be taken apart, and this part, the constant part, is called the regularized value. Okay. Okay, so now I come to the main theorem. Okay, here is the main theorem. Let's say we have an admissible pair which can be completed to this triple. And we have the automorphic functional theta on the corresponding model. Theta GL on the corresponding model of X and model of X and that the L M on the model corresponding to the pair L M. Okay, so we properly normalize them. Note that the normalization of each pair depends only on this pair. The normalization of L M knows only on L M doesn't want to know about G and the same about G L. So here is the statement. Okay. Statement. Okay, we have two statements: one for S pair and another for H pair. So for S pair, it claims the following, that the functional can be decomposed as its main term, theta x, which is just summation of or rational points of x, and the boundary term, which is equivariant with respect to VA. It contains of It contains of two pieces. So taking px is just taking this regularized value of functions of f at zero. Okay, remember that for a spherical function, this was zeta of this minus d parameter. The boundary map took us from x of a to xy. x of a to x one of a okay and we apply the further function that okay so you see that this formula is as clean as it can possibly be doesn't have any any nasty coefficients between any of its of its terms so it's just the main term sum over rational Or some of rational points, the regularized value at zero, and whatever comes in the recursively from what we have from the next pair, Lm. Now it's a little bit more complicated for each pair. You have, in this case, you have four pieces. So there is a main term, pet of x, which comes from with some Coefficient which depends on the field only. Here, delta f is a discriminant of the field. And then further, you have theta y, which is just summing over rational points of the orbit y. And further, one, the boundary piece, which is regularized value at zero of the variety y and whatever comes from the further pair L M. L M okay, so this is the main theorem, and we'll from now on I will be talking why how to prove them. Okay, so it all comes our main tool is the Eisenstein series. So I come back to the from what I started, the result of realization of pi with respect to by the residue of Eisenstein. By the residue by Eisenstein series. So the Eisenstein series, now you don't pay much attention on all those primes. We sometimes need to replace P by the parabolic of the same type, okay, just has to do with the action of the longest vial element. So, but the Eisenstein series. The Eisenstein series induced from P has a simple pole at a certain point, and the functions which are residues of this Eisenstein series are square integrable. Their span representation isomorphic to pi. And moreover, this representation has multiplicity one in the discrete spectrum. So, this is a result of many, many people. For many cases, it was a result of Ginsburg-Ralis and Soudry. Kralis and Sudri in 97, who use that to write to convince that the representation, minimal representation can at all be obtained as a residues. And for other pairs, it was completed by other people. Okay, the part three has been proven by Proven by Kashdan Polishuk for H pairs and Kobayashi and Sabin rather recently for S pairs. And now let me write down the Fourier expansion of those functions. So exactly in parallel to the fact that V spectrum is very small, when we look at the Fourier expansion, we see that it has rather We see that it has rather few coefficients, Fourier coefficients. All its Fourier coefficients are parameterized by rational point of x when we are talking about s pair together with the constant term. And for h pair, we have we first decompose along z. We have the constant term along z and the various term corresponding to non-trivial coefficient with respect to z. Here, z is the center of the Heisenberg group. Of the Heisenberg group, and also we have further decomposing the part, Z invariant part with respect to V, we have these terms. So we see that we have, we actually already see the hint of the main terms. Of the main terms here, right? This is these are parts which are summing over variety of X or variety of Y and the constant V will give us bound returns. Okay, so let me define now the functional, the properly normalized functional on S of X. S of X. For this, we just define it to make the following diagram commutative. So basically, the a priori theta G L is defined up to a constant uniquely, okay, using this theta tilde functional on the induced space. And we choose this constant to be And we choose this constant to be the value of the Fourier coefficient at a spherical function. This constant should be computed, and we do compute that. So this is just a choice of a constant. Using this constant, we can in S case, in case of SPR, see very clearly that the in H. In H case, it requires a bit more work that the main term of the theta part is just sum over theta x. That's the reason of the summation. Okay, now let me explain how exactly the constant term The constant term gives us two additional terms. So, for this, we consider a standard computation for the constant term along V. And whoever had to do computations with Eisenstein series knows this formula. So, we sum over shortest. Shortest representative in the double coset of Weil group and get the sum over Eisenstein series applied to the on the levy with respect to different parabolic subgroups precomposed with intertwining operators. So I will not elaborate on all the notation. All the notations. If you haven't seen them before, let me just remind that for spherical, that on spherical vector that the action of the intertwined operator on the spherical vector is given by multiplication by a Gindikin-Karpolevich factor, which is a product of ratio of zeta factor. Ratio of zeta factors. Okay, this is important in the computation. So now I can say what is the contribution to the residue in all this sum. So it turns out that in all the sum, only two elements contribute to the residue. One of them is the longest. And as the corresponding, so the in this case, there is no Eisenstein series at all, meaning the corresponding parabolic subgroup is just. Parabolic subgroup is just the whole L, and the intertwining pole intertwine operator has a simple pole and it contributes the one-dimensional representation. And there is also the second element, which is the second longest element, which we can describe explicitly as written here. Okay, by S beta zero is just a simple reflection. V0 has been defined before, and V zero L. And V0L is the analog of V0 for the group L. Okay, in this case, we have an induction from the corresponding Eisenstein series induced from parabolic isomorphic to of the same type of skew, okay? Of skew, okay, and the intertwine operator is holomorphic, okay, and it takes us from the Satake parameter S0 to S1. So basically, this means that the Eisenstein series has a simple pole and S equals S1. And the other contribution is the Eisenstein series induced. Induced on L induced from Q, which has a simple pole at S equals to S1, and it contributes the minimal representation to the residue. So we see then that in first in the S pair and second in the for H pair, the theta functional excuse me theta functional is a sum of A sum of three and four terms correspondingly. Okay, so now to prove the, but and exactly as in our main theorem, we want to show that the theta functional on S of X will be the sum of three and four pairs, respectively. So for this, we need to show commutativity on certain diagrams. Diagrams, okay. So let me just elaborate on one of them. So, for example, the regular regularized value, okay. By m bar v0, I mean the residue of the intertwined operator. Okay, we want to show that the px part, the most degenerate part, the regularized value of a function. Regularized value of a function composed with Rx gives us the same thing as m bar. So, since all the representations here are generated by the spherical functions, I have two more minutes, right? The spherical functions, it is enough to it is enough to check the value. The values on the spherical function. And this reduces to computation between the Gintigen-Korpelevich factors. So maybe, okay, I'll just mention that because this is basically the core of the result. That we first compute this normalization constant and show that this is a Constant and show that this is a Kindikin-Korpilevich of the longest element, meaning its residue, which is divided by the zeta value of this minus D0, from which immediately we have the commutativity of one of the diagram, and the commutativity of another diagram follows by basically the fact that we know who this other element v1 is. Okay, so I will. Ease. Okay, so I will not elaborate it there, but this is a rather simple computation involving Gintikin-Korpelevich factors, which should not are not made case by case, but I mean uniformly. Okay, so let me say a couple of words about the application. This allows us to, for example, write explicitly the Explicitly the automorphic functional dn. Starting with the pair dn dn minus one, we completed to the pair dn minus two, and so we continue, we can further continue it further and further. In this case, the model is just a cone of non-isotropic vectors in a dimensional in the space of dimension to n minus two. space of dimension to n minus two. Okay, so for dn minus one, dn minus two, it's a cone of non-isotropic vector in a smaller space. And the boundary map, which takes us from this cone omega n to omega n minus one, can be composed several times to get a boundary map from omega n to omega k. Okay, and the eventual formula that we have is some over those theta main terms, which are some over rational terms of cones of smaller and smaller and smaller dimension. This is this part, okay? Together with taking those regularized values. Regularized values at zero of columns of smaller and smaller and smaller dimension, and we can go all the way up to D3, which is which should be treated separately because D3 and D2 is not a weekly admissible pair, but this can be written expressly. Written explicitly since I'm out of time. I will not elaborate on that. Very close-related formula was obtained by Jays Getz, but he used a different approach for the minimal representation. But in his automorphic functional formula, you can also see some of summation over cones of smaller and smaller dimension and regularized and And certain zeta values. Okay, so the same thing you can do for EN case, going up to starting from E8, reducing it all the way to D5, A4, in which case the functionals that correspond to the pair D5A4 can be related to. Can be related to D5D4 using some signal-believed entity. I'll skip on that. And then you further can continue decomposing it. Okay, so then my very last slide is about we are coming back to Poisson summation formula. So after we have constructed the functional, I mean the automorphic functional, the minimal representation. Automorphic functional, the minimal representation. I can ask what is there a Fourier transform? So, at least for the S pairs, the role of Fourier transform is played by operator, just like in the symplectic case, acting the action of certain bile group element, which normalizes L. And for minimal representation, conjecturally, it acts by. Conjecturally texts by generalized Fourier transform on X constructed by Braberman and Kajdan. So in our work for the pair D and D N minus one joint with Kajdan, we have proved that. And there is a work in progress with a gun for the pair E7 and E6. And we plan also to treat other exceptional pairs. So in particular, the functional In particular, the functional that we construct is f-invariant. This would be the Poisson summation formula, but it has many more symmetries. The whole group G of X acts on it invariant, I mean, keep it invariant. And the very last remark would be that in our work, not all the construction are available for Archimedean fields. Thus, we restrict ourselves only for function field. Only for function field, but the for Archimedean field we must see a more complicated formula for the spherical function involving Bessel function. So we believe that the formula answer should be more or less the same for the number field, but there is more work to be done. So our result is formulated for function fields only. Okay, thank you very much. I will stop here.
