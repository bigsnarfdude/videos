Thank you very much, Matt, and thank you very much for this invitation. So, yes, my title was the beginning: Wave Structure Interactions Only. And since it is motivated by wave energies, I thought that it was maybe good to have a small introduction on what these wave energies are. So I will start with this and then I will present you several massive. Several mathematical problems that arise in the study of such interactions, and I will not enter too much into the details. So, okay, yeah. So, this is a typical wave energy converter that we can find. There are actually, there are also many projects. So, you have various kinds of wave energy convectors. So, these are quite large and typically several hundreds of meters. and typically several hundreds of meters and this is typically the kind of system that we have in mind. So when we are speaking about wave energy, maybe it's good to explain what is this energy. And this can be done by starting from the free surface Euler equations that you have seen in many talks so far. So you start with the So you start with the Euler equation in the field domain. So dtu plus u gradu is equal to the pressure force plus the gravity, incompressible field. At this point, it's not necessary to assume that the flow is irrotational. And then you have the two boundary conditions on the surface, the kinematic boundary condition. So dgzeta is the normal component of the velocity and the pressure is constant. It's the atmospheric pressure. And the bottom, we just take. Bottom, we just take an impermeability condition. Okay, so if we have these equations, then we have a local conservation of energy. The energy here is the energy per surface area. So it's the potential energy, one half of 4g zeta squared. Zeta here is the elevation, I should have said it, I'm sorry, of the surface with respect to the back to the to the to the to the rest level and uh this is the the kinetic energy so this is the sum of the horizontal velocity v square plus the vertical velocity w square and integrating integrated from the bottom to the surface okay and then you have as I said the local conservation of energy so you have dt plus a divergence of energy flux F Energy flux F. And this energy flux, just basic computation, is the integral from the bottom to the surface of the horizontal velocity times this quantity, which you can see at the Bernoulli pressure, which is gzeta, plus one over rho p minus the atmospheric pressure, plus one half of the square of the velocity. It's important to see that this the unit of this energy flux. The unit of this energy flux is in kilowatts per meter. And this is the formula for the transfer of wave power that is used by engineers. And if you want to, so essentially what you want to do is you want to see the energy, the power that is transported across some hipper plane, which is orthogonal to the direction of propagation of the wave. So you integrate. Propagation of the wave. So you integrate basically on any pair plane of, if you call x, this direction of propagation. So you integrate over on the pair plane x equal to constant. And you want to know the power that is transported across the c pair plane. And typically, so this can be estimated. So you can find maps. So this is a map for Europe. You can find maps for the world. And what is good to know is, for instance, if you take France, the average For instance, if you take France, the average of wave energy in France over one year is 12.5 kilowatt per meter. And so this means that it corresponds more or less to the electricity consumption of about 35% in the world. So of course, if you are in Europe or North America, it's less. But this gives you the order of magnitude. You, the order of magnitude of what you can expect. So, what does it mean? It means that it's a kilowatt per meter. So, it means that if you are able to block, to absorb all the frequency of the wave in one meter of transverse direction, okay, so the wave propagates has a direction of propagation. And so, if you take the transverse direction and you block the wave, you absorb the energy for one meter, then you have this power. Okay? This power. Okay, so this is the formula that is used. And so, how do you do this? How do you obtain such results? Of course, you have this formula for the energy flux for F. If you have waves, if you're able to simulate the water waves, then you're able to reconstruct V, zeta, P, etc. But of course, you are not going to compute all the waves in a given All the waves in a given country over one year. Okay, that would be completely out of field. So, what you are doing is that you are using, of course, approximate expression, essentially linear theory, is used by engineers. And then you use the statistics of the wave. Okay, so you have wave fields, which means that typically when you in a given day, you have waves that propagate in some direction with some typical amplitude. Some typical amplitude, and you are able to predict this statistical description. So it's quite related to wave turbulence. And then this, using this kind of tools, you are able to do this kind of maps. Okay, so you see that it's good source of energy, of what we could say clean energy, but also it's not, okay, you cannot do everything you with. Do everything you with only this energy. And if you are looking at the typical figures of what is actually doing, so the typical capacity of the main power plant based on wave energy, you see that it's at most a few megawatts. So you cannot rely only on this to solve the energy crisis. But yet, of course, it's worth investigating. Okay, so this is. Okay, so this is done with this introduction, but I just wanted you to have the numbers, the order of magnitude in mind, because you sometimes hear that it will solve the energy crisis. This is, of course, not true. So what are the mathematical difficulties if you want to simulate, to obtain this, to describe this wave structure interactions. Structural interactions. So, this is in the picture numerical computation for the system that I had in my first slide, and which was made by the group of Eskilsen. So you have several specific difficulties if you want to do the CFD approach, which is, of course, maybe the most natural things people would like to do because people in, for instance, in the car industry, in the plane industry, they use really CFD methods, but there are specific difficulties compared to these. Difficulties compared to this situation when you are dealing with this wave structure interaction. The first is that you have a highly separated flow with Reynolds numbers of about 10 to the 7th. You have large scale differences between the hull and the mooring system, the riser system, etc. And you are also, and this may be the main difficulty, that you are in an open ocean environment that requires the computation of a very large Requires the computation of a very large volume of fluids. Moreover, the wave fill is stochastic and it's non-Gaussian statistic, so it adds to the difficulties. We have to do many, many computations. And in practice, the cost of a CFD project for numerical basin for wave energies is comparable to constructing a prototype. So you see that it's really not something which is easy. Which is easy. Okay, so you will do this kind of approach if you are interested in specific aspects, such as the vortex-induced motion of some floaters or the global performance of a floater in extreme wave conditions. Okay, so you have specific range of where this is pertinent to relevant to do, and especially if you are interested in turbulence rates. interested in turbulence-related effects. So then the next a bit more simple is to use, so this was, if you had no object, this was like using the Navier Stokes equation, right? And now you could instead use the water-wheels equation, so incompressible Euler equation, and add an irrotationality condition. In this case, these methods are used in this context. In this context, the fully non-linear potential methods consist in working with the Euder equation, or rather, it's a Bernoulli version. So you work with a velocity potential phi. So the gradient of phi is the velocity, of course. So you have the Bernoulli equation, dtphi plus gz plus one half of the velocity square is equal to minus one over rho times the pressure. The velocity potential is harmonic in the free domain, and you still have the same. Free domain, and you still have the same free surface boundary condition, so the kinematic condition and the constant pressure condition. And at the bottom, so the phi is missing here, you have that the normal derivative of the velocity potential should be at the bottom, should be zero, but when you are in contact with the object, which is a solid surface, it should be equal to the normal component of the velocity of the solid. The velocity of the solid. Okay, so this is quite simple to write, but numerically it remains very difficult. You all know that a numerical simulation of the waterways is already very difficult, especially if you are in 3D. So of course, if you add an object with it, that the object has to move, etc., this is still very complicated. So in the end, okay, you're a bit faster, but but it's still very complicated. But it's still very complicated, and you miss, of course, all the turbulence-related effects. And then actually, the engineers and the commercial codes that are used, essentially, you have one which is very well known, which is called the WAMIT software, which is used to compute the motion of floating objects. So it can be wave-energy converters, but it can be boats, it can be whatever you want. And they are based on a linear pattern. And they are based on a linear potential method. Okay, so the difference with the previous slide is that now when you compute the velocity potential, you will just neglect the variation of the free domain due to the waves. So you assume that the surface is flat to compute the velocity potential. And so in this case, of course, the object will move. In general, they have. Will move. Okay, they in general, they have six degrees of freedom. They have three translations and three rotations. And so here I have taken motion in the translation in the jth direction. So if I have just this motion of the object, the translation in the jth direction, then the velocity potential will be the sum of the velocity of the object, x dot j times. x dot j times psi j, where psi j is the potential for the instantaneous impulsive velocity of the floating object. So, this is the velocity potential created directly by the object at mt. And you also have the integral over all times of the potential which was created. This is the radiating disturbance of the free surface, which is due to the motion of the wave created by the motion of the objects. Okay? Of the objects, okay, and then what they do is that they say, Okay, now for the object, we have the motion, we have the Newton's equation. So, if I have just the translation, it's M, so the mass times segment derivative of the position is equal to mass times the gravity. And you have the integral over the weighted part of the object, which I call which is W for weighted, of the pressure times N. Pressure times n. And if you use the Bernoulli equation that I wrote before, this is, and if you neglect the nonlinear terms, then this last term, you can write it as the atmospheric pressure minus the hydrostatic potential and minus dtphi. Okay? And then what you do, you replace the expression for phi in this expression, and you see that the dt phi will involve Will involve a second derivative of x that we will put with the mass. Okay, so this is called the added mass effects. So, in the end, what you obtain, as I said, you have six degrees of freedom. What you obtain is a system of six integral differential equations for these degrees of freedom. And this is what the engineers use, and actually what they do is that they do not compute all these coefficients. Compute all these coefficients, which are complicated, they will try to determine these coefficients by doing some experiments. They will take an object, they will drop it, see its frequency of oscillation, look at the radiating field, etc., and try to give these parameters. Okay, so with Maiming, we started working on trying to justify this equation. We are also very. This equation. We are also working with Martin Paulson since this year. And all this is based on a mathematical model, which was introduced by Fritz John in 1949, if I'm right. And so it's essentially the linearized Euler equation with an object. Okay, I have added here an emerging button because the difficulties are quite. The difficulties are quite similar. So, I have this, I will consider this picture. Of course, we could add more objects. This configuration is the most difficult in the sense that it has the two kind of singularities, the emerging bottom and the floating object, and it has a bounded connected component for the surface and an unbounded one. Okay, so we have all the difficulties. Have all the difficulties. So, I will. This is in the dimension, horizontal dimension one. Okay, so here we will denote gamma D the part of the boundary of the free domain, which is in contact with the air. So, it's the blue line here. It has two connected components, E1 and E2. And the D is for the eclect because we will impose For directlet, because we will impose direct condition on the velocity potential, and then you have the other component of the boundary, which are this one, which is gamma w for wetted. This is the weighted part of the object, and you have gamma b which is the bottom. Okay, and here, to simplify, I will take the object which is fixed. It doesn't move. Okay, I will just try to solve this linear problem and show you what are the difficulties. Okay, and as I said, Okay, and as I said, it's a linear model, so I have a potential flow u, which is the gradient of a velocity potential phi. The velocity potential phi is harmonic, so Laplace phi is equal to zero in the free domain. And the free domain, since it is a linear model, as I said, we neglect the perturbation of the surface due to the waves, we assume it's flat, okay? And d and phi is equal to zero on gamma l, which is the bottom and the weighted part of the object. The bottom and the weighted part of the object, okay, and therefore, uh, phi, the velocity potential, is determined by its trace on gamma d, as for the water waves equation. Okay, in the water waves equation, we don't have object, we don't have emerging bottom, we have uh we have just the surface and we determine in the Zakharov Craig-Sulan formulation with the system on psi, which is a trace of the velocity potential at the surface. Okay, so here the difference is that the surface So here the difference is that the surface has two connected components. We define the Dirty-Norman operator associated with this problem. The difference here again is that we take the normal derivative. So since the surface is flat, the normal derivative is just dz. And we just take it in the part on gamma d. Okay. Otherwise, it's zero, so it's not interesting. Okay. And so John's problem was to look at this. John's problem was to look at this system, which are the free surface linear Bernoulli equations. This will be familiar to you because it's the linearization if you, or the water wave equation, if you don't have the object. Okay, so it's dt theta, so theta is the surface elevation, minus g zero c is equal to zero, and dt c plus g zeta is equal to zero on gamma t. Okay, so this looks very simple in the case of the water waves equation where the food domain is a strip. This is uh really this is uh this is essentially trivial uh but here you see that there you will see that there are some difficulties which are uh arising the first one is that you want to work in uh the energy space and what's the energy space as i said there is an energy which is conserved by the equations and this is the potential energy so the integral of or gamma d of theta square and the kinematic energy which is kinetic energy which is kinetic excuse me which is the integral of omega of the velocity square so of grad phi square okay so i just wrote this the same equation and the same energy there's nothing new here and we want to work in a functional space for zeta and c which is uh adapted to uh this energy as as we said phi is determined by uh phi is determined by C. So this is something that depends only on C. So can it be a norm? Can it define a norm on C on for C? So the function space will be something like this. For Zeta, of course, there is no ambiguity. The functional space will be L2 or gamma d. For C, it's not clear. Okay, so I will just call it IH dot one half of call it h dot one half of gamma d right because here phi has the homogeneity of h1 and the trace uh is it will be h one half and it's homogeneous so i put the dot but i don't explain for the month what it is and actually this is the the the the first thing that we have to do we have to characterize this space so what is this space this space should be the range of the trust mapping so that this trace mapping is defined as follow Mapping is defined as follow. You take all the phi in H dot one. So what is H dot one? This is all the distribution in the free domain omega such that the gradient of phi is in L2. Okay, it's important to say that phi is not itself in L2. Okay, because you see the G energy here is just the integral of grad phi phi squared. It's not the H dot one norm. It's not the H one norm. Okay, so if you take all these If you take all these functions in h.1, you take the trace on gamma d and you say that h.1 half, if everything goes well, it should be the range of this space. This space should be continuous and it should have a continuous right inverse, which means an extension mapping which is continuous. Okay. And so, okay, this is the question: is the trace space? What is the trace space for? Trace space, what is the trace space for this space, which is which we call a Bépolevis space, H dot one of omega? Okay, of course, if I had H1, the answer would be H1 half. But here I have this dot. So a few things about this characterization. There are a few things that are quite funny. The first one is that you have a screening effect. So what is it? You can see it even for the water waves actually. Consider even for the water waves, actually. Normally, for the waterways, we are cheating and we avoid this problem. But if you take omega, a flat strip in R2, so horizontal is R, and then you have a vertical coordinate between minus one and zero. So you take all the functions in H dot one of this space, and you take their trace at the surface. That is equal to zero. Okay, so I said h dot one half is it should be the. A dot one half is it should be the range of this trace mapping. So, what do we know about a homogeneous space of regularity index one half? You have this one that I call H one half homogeneous, which is defined using Fourier, because in this case you can use Fourier on R. So, all the F such that modulus of D one half of F is in L2. Okay, so this is the Okay, so this is the standard homogeneous space of NX1 half. And actually, you can prove for the flat shift, so it's quite easy because it's based on free analysis, that actually this space is not this one. It's another homogeneous space, which is all the f such that dxf is in h minus one half. Okay, what is the difference if you're looking at only the high frequencies? If you're looking at only the high frequencies, it's exactly the same. The difference is at the low frequency because this one still behaves like G one half, and this one behaved like D at a low frequency. Okay, so this is different. And if you want to characterize this space, so this is nice because we use Fourier, so it's easy. But then we have to use this kind of space on gamma D where we have intervals, half lines, where you have boundaries, so we cannot use Fourier. Okay, so we want another characterization. Okay, so we want another characterization. So, this space, you can, it's quite standard, you can characterize it as this quantity, I mean the d one half f in L2 norm, this is equivalent to the double integral of over y and x in R of the ratio of a y minus fx square divided by y minus x square. And these two spaces are different, and you can see that this space is actually bigger than this one. Is actually bigger than this one strictly, and if you want to characterize like this, then you can see that there is a screening effect. And what is this screening? It is that instead of taking the integral over all over y for all r, you take the integral for y in a ball centered at x and of radius one. I mean, you could take 10 if you wanted, it doesn't change the, but it's constant. Okay. And you see, this is really due to. And you see, this is really due to the homogeneous space, because if, in general, if you look at what happens for y far from x here, then you can control this quantity by the L2 norm of f. And so, when you are in a standard H1 half space, then you have the access to this L2 norm of F. But here you don't have, okay, so it's not the same. And so, this characterization was remarked by in a recent article by Stricards in an other. By Stricards in an other context, and Leoni and Tais have developed a theory for this screened sobo F species. Okay, a second funny effect about this H.1 half norm is that I have several components, connected components for gamma d. And there is a non-local effect that relates these connected components. How can you see this? So the functions. So the function space will be this, as I said, zeta in L2, sinh.1 half, and gamma d is has two connected components in our case. And then, of course, first guess would be to say, okay, h dot one half of gamma d will be h dot one half of e1 plus h dot one half of e2 and okay you have to uh You have to define what is the edge of one half and finite intervals and half lines, but you use this characterization here. Okay, so just this is not the point I want to insist on. What I want to insist on is that if you look at this space, they are all a semi-norm space. And if you look at the adherence of zeros, which is all the functions which have zero summi-norm. So here, this space is How to say, is R, it's a space of all constants. And on the right-hand side, it's R square because it's R for this one and R for this one. Okay, so you see that these two spaces cannot be topologically equivalent. Okay, and so you have to add the non-local effects to define the norm on gamma d. So the norm actually for this H dot one half of gamma d is the norm of C in the first. The norm of C in the first, the recession of C to the first connected component plus the homogeneous norm on the second connected component, and you have to add the difference of the two averages of C over this component. So when C is on E1, which is a finite interval, the average is well defined. On E2, it's not defined because the interval is unbounded. So what you do is that you take the average over any. Do is that you take the average over any finite interval, and you can prove that you can take a different finite interval, it's defined an equivalent term. Okay, so you see that you have these non-local effects related to the two connected components, okay? And this is the norm for this space, okay? So, and in this case, you can prove that this is the characterization of the edge of one half space, okay? So, you have Okay, so you have some quite funny things just to define the space you are going to work. And the last thing that you have to take care of is that this is still homogeneous space. And if you want, we have a linear paradigm, so it looks very easy. So if you want to look semi-group theory, you want to prove that you want to use some abstract results, but you have to work on Hilbert spaces. Here I don't have a Hilbert spaces. Here, I don't have a Hilbert spaces for my system of equation. I have what we could call a semi-Hilbert space. And so this doesn't work. So you have to do something which is called when you work with homogeneous space, you have to work with realization of homogeneous, which means that in the equivalent class of any element, you have to choose a particular element which has good properties. And if you work with this particular element, then you recover the Hilbert property. you recover the hilbert's property and you can you can work so typically if you have if you are in a finite domain here so if you have two emerging bottoms then i could work with c and zeta of zero mean this is propagated by the equation and in this case uh and in this case you see that these two uh average would be essentially zero so in this case if you work in the the in the element of if you choose the element of zero uh average over e1 and two then E1 and E2, then you have it bare-based and you can use standard semiconductor. Now, if you have an unbounded component, this is not possible, and actually, you cannot find a good realization because you won't have these critical scaling. If you know the Schumann space of non-homogeneous homogeneous distribution, excuse me, then it doesn't reach the case one-half. So, it's critical. And actually, what you can do is work with You can do is work with time space function spaces and realize this homogeneous space in time and space. And actually, what is funny is that this realization is equivalent to a good choice of the Bernoulli constant. So it has some physical meaning. Okay? Okay, so another funny thing about this apparently very simple linear problem is, of course, that you have singularities in the free domain. It is in the free domain, and of course, this raises difficulties, in particular, when you are working in a smooth domain, like we do for the water waves, even if the smoothness is limited, but assume that omega is smooth, then if you have, if you are solving the Laplace equation with a Diraclet condition C, which is C infinity on the boundary, then the solution of the Laplace equation. Solution of the Laplace equation phi will be H infinity in the free domain. Okay, so there's the you have very smooth velocity potential, your direct number is well defined, blah blah blah. Now, if you work with corners, this property, which is essential, is wrong, meaning that even if your data C is compactly smooth and compactly supported in E1 and E2, then the In E1 and E2, then the solution of phi will only be in some HS and with S smaller than some critical S0. This zero depends on the angles here. So the smaller the angle, the larger the S0. So it's good to have small angles. And this is why, for instance, in the, I don't know if you know the work of Kibaud Poiferet for emerging bottoms, he assumes smallness. Uh, imagine bottom, she assumes smallness uh condition on the angles. Uh, in her works, he revu also has uh this condition of smallness on the angles for singularities of the free surface. So, it is natural thing. And to show you, so I will not enter into details, I will just prove you a nice theorem to show you that you have to be very careful with this phenomenon. And this theorem is the following one: it is that if you take the extreme stokes wave, which as you know has a hundred Which, as you know, has a 120-degree angle at the crest, I will prove you that this angle is actually not 120-degree, but it is 180. Okay, so it's a nice theorem. And so here is the proof. If you denote by V-bar the horizontal velocity at the surface, then you have this equation, which is an exact equation. Which is an exact equation, okay? So it's a property from the water waves equation. So you have dt v bar plus v dx v bar plus a dx zeta is equal to zero. A is the radiate Taylor coefficient. Now if you take the extreme Stokes wave and you so you know it's a steady wave. Okay. So if you write this equation in the moving frame and if this Stokes wave moves at speed C tox wave move at speed c then uh the equation becomes v minus c dxv plus a dxet is equal to zero you also know that for the issue stokes wave the corner is a stagnation point meaning that v is equal to c so if i take the trace of this equation at the corner this term vanishes and i obtain a g zeta is equal to zero okay and now And now A is the relative coefficient. So normally, if you want to observe singularities, you are in a context where A is equal to zero. So this is, for instance, the case in Siju Wu's works, or Cordoba's works also, and his team. But here you can compute A with complex analysis, and A is not zero. So what you obtain. So what you obtain is that the exeta is equal to zero, which means that the angle at the crest should be 90 plus 90 is equal to 180 degrees. Okay? So this argument was used by Alazar, Burke and Julie to show that when you have a wall, the angle of the contact angle should be 90 degrees. So I'll use this argument in the context of the Stokes wave. Okay, so you see, there is some... Okay, so you see, there is something which is a bit strange in this argument. And the reason why, of course, it is false is that you don't have enough regularity to take the trace here. Okay? And this is why this argument is false. So, and here the typical regularity, critical regularity would be three halves. Okay, so I will not insist, but I think it's convincing. Uh, uh, convincing example to show that there you have to be very careful when you have corner singularities. Okay, so now I will start a very completely different way of addressing a wave structure interaction. So, this was in the okay, the idea here was to understand the model used by engineers, the linear models, and try to see what we can do about it. But if we're interested in non-linear effect and in models which are fast, there is another way we could do is that instead of using the water waves equation, you know that even if you want to describe waves in coastal areas, you often use asymptotic models. So you have the non-linear shallow water equations, the Business equations, the Sergei-Nagy equations. The Sergei-Laggier equation, you have plenty of them, and we could try to do the same thing for wave-structure interaction. So, hopefully, this will be simpler. So, let me, for instance, use the non-inertial water equation because I guess that this is the model that you will all know. So, the non-inertial water equation is this. So, this is theta plus divergence of h v is equal to zero. So, v here is the vertical. Here is the vertically average horizontal velocity. So, this is taking the vertical average, is a way of getting rid of the vertical variables. So, if you have a 3D problem, it is transformed in a 2D problem. If you have a 2D problem, it is transformed in a 1D problem. Okay, so let's look at here for the moment the case of a, it's written in the case of a surface dimension equal to two here. So, h is the total depth of the field, so depth at rest. So, depth at rest plus the surface elevation. And the second equation is the momentum equation, ETV plus V grad V plus G grad zeta. And in general, if you write this model, normally we have zero, but here I'll write it in the following way. Minus one over rho times hard P bar and P bar is the pressure on the water surface. Okay, so I see this system as a system of three unknowns, zeta, V and P bar. And then I will. And then I will consider this equation in what I call the interior domain and the exterior domain. So what is the exterior domain? The exterior domain is the projection on the horizontal axis of the part of the surface which is in contact with the air. And I, which I call integer region, is the projection of the weighted part of the air. Projection of the weighted part of the object on the horizontal axis. So the horizontal plane, excuse me. So the horizontal plane is divided in E and E, and between the two, there is the interface, which I will call gamma. So I will see this system of on zeta V P bar as a constraint system on E and I, but with different constraints. In the exterior region, the constraint is on the pressure, surface pressure P, as I have already said before. This said before, this surface pressure is the atmospheric pressure and it is constant. On the other hand, there is no constraint on zeta, zeta is free, okay, by definition of the exterior region. So you end up with the classical shallow water equation, which is a hyperbolic system with very nice properties. Okay. Now, if you are in the interior region, in the interior region, the constraints are symmetric in the sense that the surface pressure is free. Sense that the surface pressure is free. You don't know what is the pressure on the weighted part of the object. Actually, this is a very important quantity because this is what will drive the motion of this floating object. And on the other hand, you have a constraint on the surface elevation, because by definition of the entire region, the surface of the water in the entire region is equal to zeta w, which is the parametrization of the bottom of the object. Okay? Okay, so the mass conservation equation, which is this one, we see it as a constraint equation. So it will tell us that divergence of Hv is equal to minus dt zeta, and zeta is equal to zeta w. So this is given by this. So if the object is fixed, this is equal to zero. If the object is in vertical motion, so this will be the derivative of the vertical displacement, etc. Okay? displacement etc okay and on the on the the second equation the momentum equation is just the incompressible Euler equation in 20 okay so in the end in the integer region we have a kind of incompressible Euler equation except that the constraint is a bit different but okay it's not that much different so the behavior will be the same as the 2D incompressible Euler equation and of course equation. And of course we need to couple these two systems. And for this we need matching conditions on the interface gamma. Okay, so it's not clear what we have to take for the matching condition. So I will spend this slide to explain this, to give some elements, and I will do it in the case of one-dimensional surface, it will be easier. So the easiest case from the modeling point of view Case from the modeling point of view is if the object has non-vertical sidewalls, like this. In this case, the free domain has an angle here, of course, but the surface parametrization is continuous. It's not C1, but it's continuous. So actually, the matching condition are that when you cross, so in this case, the interface gamma is just a point here, this point. Just a point here, this point. So, when you cross the interface, when you cross from the exterior to the interior region, then you assume that you will have continuity of Q, of zeta, and of P bar. Okay, so from the modeling aspect, it's not too difficult. The problem is that the position of this contact point is not known. So, this is a free boundary problem. And as we will see later, this is a free boundary problem, which is quite difficult, which is a Poland, which is quite difficult, which is quite singular. The other situation is that if you have vertical walls, in this case, you still have continuity of Q. You can easily see this because you don't create mass. On the other hand, you have a discontinuity of zeta and also p. Okay. But But the advantage is that the coordinate of this contact point is constant now. If the object doesn't move, this coordinate is constant. So you don't have a free boundary problem. So in some sense, you need one equation less than for this case, because for this case, you need an equation for the evolution of this point. The problem is that we have two equation less, because we don't have continuity of zeta, we don't have continuity of p, which means that we need some more information. need some more information and this information is that we will impose uh that we uh have conservation of the total energy which means that we have continuity of the energy flux that i mentioned at the very beginning of my talk okay and this implies that you and the continuity condition when you have a vertical wall like this should be on what i will call the bernoude pressure which is p minus p atmospheric plus the half rooting P atmospheric plus the hydrostatic pressure rho g zeta plus rho times one half of the velocity square. Okay, q, excuse me, I should have said it. Q is a discharge, so q is equal to h times v. Sorry, I have forgotten to say it. Okay, and of course, if p and zeta, in this case, you see that it's, of course, this is consistent with this case. Okay, so okay, so in this case, Okay, so in this case, we need more modeling, but it's simpler because we don't have a free boundary. This case, we have a free boundary and we have to understand it. And so on this slide, I will explain somehow the nature of this new free boundary problem. Stephen 1D. So suppose at this point it could be an equation. Just consider this the mass conservation equation. So dth plus dxhv bar is equal to zero. So this is the quantity that I have coded. So this is the quantity that I have called Q, so HV bar is equal to Q. So let us look at the shoreline problem, for instance. The shoreline problem is this. So in this case, the shoreline is defined as the point where the depth vanishes. Okay, so we don't know its coordinates, the free boundary problem, and its coordinate is X-bar of T. So what is the equation for X-bar of T? So this defines the shoreline. The shoreline, okay. This condition. If we time differentiate it, we obtain dth plus x dot dxh is equal to zero. If we use the mass conservation, then we can replace dth by minus dx of hv bar. So in the end, we obtain x dot minus v times dxh minus h dxv bar is equal to zero. By definition, h is equal to zero here. So we remove this term, and therefore, at the shoreline, we at the shoreline, we obtain that x dot minus v times dxh is equal to zero. And I am in a situation here where the contact is transverse, so dxh is non-zero. So we obtain that x dot is equal to v bar. Okay, so it means that the in some sense the boundary condition is kinematic. So Daniel explained in his talk the other day what it means. It means the particles move with the velocity With the velocity, excuse me, the boundary moves with the velocity of the fluid, and this is the case here. Okay, in particular, if you work in Lagrangian coordinate, the boundary is fixed. Okay, now let us look at the contact line problem. The contact line problem, the contact line is defined by the condition that at x bar of t, the surface, the free surface should... The surface, the free surface should match the bottom parameterization of the object, which means that zeta of t x bar t is equal to zeta w of t x bar t. Okay, zeta w is a known function. If you know the position of the object, you know zeta w. You do the same, you will time differentiate this equation. So it's okay, dt zeta plus x dot dx zeta is equal to the same with zeta w. And then you use the mass conservation equation as before. As before, and then you reorganize, and this gives you that x dot is equal to this ugly thing. Okay, so you see that this is completely different from here because on the one side, this is not a kinematic condition. It means that a particle which is at the contact line does not stay on the contact line when you do the time evolution. And moreover, it is Moreover, it is of mathematically different kind. So, I will call, so this is something we call with Tatsuo Iguchi, a free boundary problem of the first kind when the motion of the contact point is not necessarily exactly the kinematic condition, but actually a function of the trace of the unknown of your system. Here, it's of the second kind because it's a function of the Of the trace of the derivative of the solution. So, of course, it's one derivative more single. Okay? Okay, so this is what I wanted to say about this free boundary problem. So now let us consider the simple case where the side walls are vertical. And then the idea is to transform this, we have a coupling of two systems. A coupling of two systems in the interior region, in the exterior region with matching conditions. The idea is that we can transform this in an initial boundary value problem in the exterior region. So, how do you do this? So, in dimension one, I will define the jump of the quantity f, which is the value at this point minus the value at this point, and the bracket will be the average. Okay, so in the exchangeable region, we have your standard shallow water equations, and then as I said, uh And then, as I said, I want to just forget about what happens in the interior region and see if this can be reduced to transmission condition for this shallow water equation between the two connected components. What I know is that if the object is, for instance, allowed to move only vertically, then I have the equation that dx of q in the integer region is equal to minus delta dot. So I can integrate this equation very easily. So I can integrate this equation very easily. So the discharge, so I remind you that Q is Hv. So the discharge in the interior region is given by a constant, which I call bracket of Qi, minus X delta dots. Okay, so this actually, because I know that Q, as I said before, is continuous across the contact line. So this gives me two transmission conditions for Q. You have the jump is equal to minus two. the jump is equal to minus two lambda so lambda is the two lambda is the size of the of the object times delta dot and q uh the average of q is this uh average of qi which is a constant in time okay and then what you do as i said before you use you use uh newton's equation and you use a momentum equation for qi which gives you an odd for qi it's not important to see this what is important is that See this, what is important is that the structure of the equation is that you have a transmission condition, a hyperbolic problem with transmission condition, and this transmission condition involves two functions of time, which are solved by a system of two ODEs. These ODEs are forced by the Bernoulli pressure that I mentioned before. So these are, which is gza plus one half of q square over h square. So this is So, this makes the coupling with the system in the entire equation. Okay, so to solve the transmission problem for this, you need to know delta and q and to know delta n q here, you need to know this quantity. So, it's coupled in both ways. Okay, so this is the structure of the equation. Okay, so since you reduce the problem to initial boundary value problem, the question the typical the question the the the typical mathematical uh issues that we will have is to you to study initial boundary value problem for the different uh asymptotic models that you are you you have in in in coastal dynamics so we have seen that the non-inertial water equation is a hyperbolic system so uh if you have a vertical wall in dimension one this is a standard initial boundary value problem the theory Standard initial boundary value problem, the theory is well known because the boundary conditions are strictly dissipative. This is in the, you have a black box, you can do it. If the vertical wall is not vertical, then I have a free boundary initial boundary problem of the second kind. And this was not done. So we did it with Iguchi. If you want, for those who know, the problem is a bit similar. those who know the problem is a bit similar to if you know the problem of shock stability which was studied by maida mativier and and and others so the the the evolution of the of the position of the shock and the boundary condition is given by the honking gonio condition so here it's a bit similar except that the honking gonio condition instead of involving the trace of the solution at the interface involves the trace of the derivative of the solution so it is one Derivative of the solution. So it is one derivative more singular than the shock stability problem. Okay, then if you want to have a more fancy wave model, you can use the bussiness model, which is a dispersive perturbation of a hyperbolic system. So the dispersive perturbation here is this red term. Okay? So you have a dispersive term. And then the problem is that the theory for dispersive perturbation of hyper For dispersive perturbation of hyperbolic systems, the initial banner value problem is not done. So we could do it with Metivier and with Brecht and also with Jeoprebeck. But the initial boundary value problem, in the case for this system, we did it, is drastically different than for the shallow water equations. In particular, you don't need You don't need compatibility conditions to obtain smooth solution. While for the hyperbolic boundary condition, initial boundary value problem, you need the compatibility condition if you want a smooth solution. So in particular, the question is: what happens when mu goes to zero in the dispersionless limit? Okay, if you don't have boundaries and if you are on a time You are on a time which is before you have wave breaking, the limit from business to shallow water is trivial. If you have a boundary, then you have a very interesting phenomenon that we studied with Bresch and Metivier, is that you have a dispersive boundary layers that appears at the boundary. So this is not like the viscous boundary layers, these dispersive boundary layers, they are oscillating. Okay, so this is a funny thing to think to. Funny things to think to study. And if the wall is not vertical, for the moment there is no result, so we don't know how to handle this free boundary problem in this case. And finally, a nice, more complete model is the Serginagi equation, which is a non-linear dispersion version of hyperbolic system. So this system is nice, actually, this is very used for Very used for applications. The difference is that the dispersive perturbation here is non-linear. You see that it is the dispersive term degenerates when h goes to zero. So in particular, for the shorelines, the problem, this dispersive term degenerates. So with Mativier, we could solve the shoreline problem. Of course, if you will zero, you have the same problem for the shallow water equation. And then this is very similar to the vacuum problem for other. Problem for other compressible Euler equations, and Daniel mentioned this problem in his talk the other day. Okay, but then for the contact line, and even if we don't have the free boundary problem, we don't know how to deal with the initial boundary value problem for the system. So, this is an open problem, and that would be very nice to be solved. I'm running out of time, just to say that if you are looking at 2D configurations, we recently. We recently considered this case with Ziguchi, where the walls are vertical, and we could consider it in the irrotational case. So meaning that the curl of V is equal to zero. In this case, you can also reduce the problem to an initial boundary value problem in the X-ray region, except that the boundary conditions are a bit non-standard because you have that n. You have that n dots hv on the contact line gamma is equal to landab C, where first c is given by solving a PD, a no D excuse me on gamma. DC C is given by this. Now you know this term, this is the Bernoulli pressure. And lambda is the J-Norman operator associated to the elliptic system defined on the integer region, which is divergence of h great physi equal to zero. Grad phi is equal to zero. Why is this grad phi? Because I assume that the flow is irrotational. So in the entire region, I can write v is equal to grad phi. And this is why it's quite easy. If you don't assume this, this is much more complicated. Actually, we don't know how to do it. So the boundary conditions are non-local in time and in space. And the most difficult thing is that, for those who know about initial boundary value problems, is that the normal matrix has sign-changing eigenvalues. So in this case, you don't know how to construct a case. You don't know how to construct a crash symmetric, and it's a really open problem for decades. But what we could show with Iguchi is that actually, if you want to obtain the energy estimate, you don't need the strict dissipativity condition actually is too strong. You can define a notion of weak dissipativity and in this case, construct the symmetrizer, and then you obtain well-positness. So, I will skip this. So I will skip this case. So this should be in a few weeks. We do this case with the free boundary term. So I will skip it. I'm already running out of time. And just to conclude with, just a conclusion as a summary. So you want to study wave structure interactions, then you have CFD, which is very precise but very CPU expensive. So you cannot use it for many applications. It's about the same for the fully. It's about the same for the full linear potential flow methods. And on the other hand, you have the linear potential flow, which is used by engineers, which is, of course, of low precision, which is you don't have, you miss the non-linear effects. And mathematically, it's not so easy. And so the last part that I mentioned is something in between is to use this approach based on the reduced models with. On the reduced models with different constraints in the interior and exterior regions. The problem of these methods is that they have a limited range of validity. They are only valid in shallow water, of course. On the other hand, they are very fast and they capture non-linear effects. And the goal is that we want to couple this with models that we already have and which are operational. For this is a simulation with the UINACO that we developed with the That we developed with the many people and the Bergem. So, Waina means waves in Basque. And so, if we could implement this coupling floating structures in this search code, then we would be able to simulate waveforms of wave energy converters in extreme waves content. Okay, so this is, of course, a long-term project. And also, there are many open mathematical problems and numerical issues. Mathematical problems and numerical issues concerning the initial boundary value problems. And you have several other extensions. And for instance, Emilian will speak about CIS modeling, where then the coupling with the solid structure, the solid is not a rigid solid, but an elastic structure. So he will, I guess, mention this in his talk. And so there are many things to do. And I've been through them. So thank you for attention. And sorry for being. Thank you very much, and I wish I'd just turn out.
