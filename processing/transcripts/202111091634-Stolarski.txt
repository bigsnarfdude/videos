Today is by Maxwell Stadarsky from Arizona State University, and he'll talk about the existence of mean curvature flow singularities with bounded mean curvature. All right, I'll hand it to you, Max. All right, thanks, Richard, for the introduction, and thank you for the organizers for the invitation to speak. So yeah, so today I'm going to talk about mean curvature flow singularities where the second fundamental form blows up, but the mean curvature remains uniformly bounded up to the singular time. Uniformly bounded up to the singular time. So just to kind of establish notation here, we say a family of embeddings moves by mean curvature flow if points move with speed equal to the mean curvature and in the direction of the inner unit normal. So here I'm just going to deal with hypersurfaces in Rn, so codimension one here, though I'll be a little bit sloppy as to Be a little bit sloppy as to whether these are closed or complete non-compact, but by default it'll be closed. So, given that singularities typically form for this flow, the question we want to ask is when exactly do singularities occur? Or in other words, how can we detect these singularities? So, a result of Whuiskin from the 80s says that if I've got Says that if I've got a mean curvature flow of closed hypersurfaces that become singular at this finite time capital T, then the second fundamental form necessarily blows up at that singular time in the sense that this limb soup as we approach the singular time of the L infinity norms of the second fundamental form goes to infinity. They're using sheet type estimates, you can generalize this. Estimates you can generalize this to non-compact hypersurfaces as well. And given Huiskin's results, a natural next question then to ask, well, does the trace of the second fundamental form, that is the mean curvature, always blow up at a finite time singularity? Of course, there are certainly examples, say like shrinking spheres, where the mean curvature does blow up. So the keyword here is always, if it's necessary. If it's necessarily the case, Lib. Equivalently, Huiskin's results, you can interpret it as saying, well, if your second fundamental form remains uniformly bounded, then you can smoothly extend the flow to slightly later times. So analogously, this question is equivalent to asking if your mean curvature remains uniformly bounded, can you smoothly extend the flow to slightly later times? To slightly later times. And this is sometimes referred to as the extension problem for mean curvature flow. So, some earlier results on here gave conditions for when the mean curvature will blow up at the first singular time. So, Huiskin-Sinestrari in the 90s showed that if your initial hypersurface is mean convex, then the mean curvature blows up at the first singular time. This is based on some math. This is based on some maximum principles comparing the mean curvature to the certain fundamental form. And Smachik also generalized this to certain perturbations of mean convex hypersurfaces as well. Then there's some results of Le and Shesham and also Cooper from around 2010, 2011 that say if your second fundamental form doesn't blow up too sharply, then the mean curvature. Then the mean curvature has to blow up as well. Lewis Shesham did the case here of epsilon equals one-half. That's important because it gives you these so-called type one singularities. And then Cooper proved it for smaller epsilon as well. Another result from Lin and Shesham in the mid-2000s says that if your traceless second fundamental form is suitably Form is suitably small in this L2 sense on the initial hypersurface, then the mean curvature has to blow up at the first singular time. And most recently, Li and Bing Wang showed that for two-dimensional surfaces in R3, the mean curvature has to blow up at the first singularity. I should also mention some results on the extension problem done by Li Shesham and Zhu Yu Zhao, among others. And Juyjal, among others. And these are generally of the form that certain integral bounds on curvature suffice to smoothly extend the flow to slightly later times. So the main result I want to talk about today is that in general, the mean curvature need not blow up at a finite time singularity. So the theorem says that at least in these high enough dimensions and at least eight, there are smooth, properly embedded. Are smooth, properly embedded mean curvature flow solutions that become singular in finite time. Second fundamental forms blowing up, but the mean curvature remains uniformly bounded. So in other words, a uniform bound on the mean curvature does not suffice to smoothly extend the flow to slightly later times. So these mean curvature flow solutions that I referred to in this. That I refer to in this theorem, they're actually constructed by Velazquez in the 90s. The part that's new here is that the Velazquez solutions have this bound on the mean curvature. So before kind of getting further into the proof, I just wanted to survey how these Velasquez solutions behave. So Velasquez's result is that for dimensionalization, Is that for dimensions high enough? Here, I'm going to use a little n is kind of controlling the dimension here. He constructs a countable family of mean curvature flow solutions. So each member in this family is indexed by this integer k, which is at least two. So given this high enough dimension and this parameter k, there's a smooth, properly embedded mean curvature flow solution, which satisfies the following properties. Which satisfies the following properties. So it's O n times O n invariant, coming under the usual action of O n on each Rn factor here, becomes singular at the origin in finite time, and the singularity behavior is as follows. So if we take the Velasquez solution and zoom in at the type 1 rate or zoom in by one on root time remain. In by one-on-root time remaining, then in the limit, as we approach the singularity time, we start to see the Simons cone in the limit. In other words, the tangent flow at the origin and at time t is the Simons cone. But then if we zoom in a bit faster, so here I'm going to zoom in by this one-on-time remaining to the sigma plus one-half. So sigma is positive. So I'm Sigma is positive, so I'm kind of zooming in at the origin faster than one on root time remaining. Then, in the limit, what I see is not the Simons cone, but rather a smooth minimal surface that desingularizes the Simons cone in the sense that it's asymptotic to the Simons cone at infinity. Or in other words, if you scale it down, you see the Simons cone and the limit. So, given that Velazquez's solutions, Forn V's single. Form these singularities that are modeled on these minimal surfaces, surfaces with mean curvature zero, that at least informally suggests that the, well, the unrescaled solution should have bounded mean curvature. However, in order to turn this heuristic into an actual proof, or to make this rigorous, you need kind of better estimates on the rate of convergence to these minimal surfaces. In other words, the In other words, these results are giving us the zeroth order behavior, and we need a better control on the next order convergence in order to conclude that the Velasquez solution actually has bounded mean curvature. And Velasquez gets actually really good estimates on that rate of convergence to the minimal Simons cone. That's sort of informally what this good estimates here is supposed to indicate. But those estimates get. But those estimates get coarser and coarser as we look closer to the origin where we see this smooth minimal surface. So, in some sense, showing that the Velasquez mean curvature flow solutions have bounded mean curvature amounts to kind of transferring these good estimates at parabolic scales to better estimates at these smaller scales near the singularity. And the strategy that we're going to use to do that is going to be to combine a vanishing theorem and some rescaling arguments. So this is certainly, I mean, versions of this exist in a lot of places. In the context of geometric flows, specifically Ricci flows, I found a paper by Brendela Kapuleis and Bamler-Kleiner particularly helpful kind of combining these vanishing theorems and rescaling. These vanishing theorems and rescaling arguments to kind of turn bounds at some parabolic scale to better bounds at these smaller scales near the singularity. And then to control the mean curvature elsewhere, that's going to follow from interior estimates due to Ecker-Huiskin, together with some explicit sub and super solutions for the Velasquez solution. So for the talk, So, for the talk, I'm going to focus on this first part up here. I think it's kind of the least intuitive and really where the heart of the proof lies, because it amounts to controlling the behavior of the Velasquez solutions closest to the singularity, where somehow the behavior is worse. Whereas these, well, the behavior for kind of scales further out is maybe more. Of scales further out is maybe more intuitive, and also the proof is a little bit more technical. All right, so let's kind of talk about some of the ingredients that go into these, this vanishing theorem and rescaling arguments. So the vanishing theorems first. So we want to get some estimates on the rate of convergence to those minimal surfaces. So given that, it makes sense to look at the next order behavior or the linearization of the mean curvature flow near the minimal. Of the mean curvature flow near the minimal surfaces. So when we do that, we get the Jacobi operator. And the first vanishing theorem is going to be a vanishing theorem for a kind of parabolic Jacobi operator on that smooth minimal surface that desingularizes the Simons code. So again, if we're in high enough dimensions and we take a smooth solution to this. Smooth solution to this parabolic Jacobi operator, which is ancient, so exists for all prior times. And we have this other condition here, which informally is saying that we have kind of a good enough spatial decay at spatial infinity that's uniform in time. So, having an ancient solution of this parabolic Jacobi operator together with this good spatial Jacobi operator together with this good spatial decay forces, in fact, the function to be zero here. Kind of think the analog from complex analysis: bounded holomorphic functions on all of C have to be zero. Here we have kind of ancient good spatial decay has to be zero instead. I should note too, so I'm writing u here as a function on the distance from the origin. On the distance from the origin. So that's just kind of a shorthand way of saying my functions here are O times O invariant as well. So that's kind of another assumption that's buried in here too. But I expect that's mostly just a technical assumption. So that's for the smooth minimal surface. And then for the Simons cone, if we take that parabolic. If we take that parabolic Jacobi operator and apply it to one of these, again, one of these O times O invariant functions, then we see this parabolic Euler equation in these coordinates. And this is kind of a classically studied object. It's well understood. In particular, there's explicit heat kernel estimates for it. And using these heat kernel estimates, we can cook up a kernel estimates we can cook up a corresponding vanishing theorem but now for the the Simon's cone so in high of high enough dimensions if we have some O n times O n invariant solution of this parabolic Jacobi operator on the Simons cone that's ancient and here we have again suitable spatial decay at spatial infinity that's uniform in time then that forces the function Then that forces the function to be identically zero. So I want to say a little bit about like where this dimension restriction comes in here. And that has to do, as you might expect, with the stability of the Simons cone in higher dimensions, whereas the linear stability fails in lower dimensions. So I mean, formally, if we take a look at this and pretend we had some eigenmode solution here. So then that would give us an ancient solution or really a solution that exists for all times of the form, like so. And so if, you know, information, Informally, like instability of the Simons cone in the low dimensions, you can kind of informally think means having a positive eigenvalue. So something with a positive eigenvalue grows forward in time, but backwards in time is going to decay to zero. So we shouldn't expect a vanishing theorem in these lower dimensions because we kind of have these ancient solutions that Have these ancient solutions that kind of grow out of nothing that have really good boundedness far back in time but are not identically zero. So that's just kind of a heuristic to indicate that this dimension bound here really is essential to getting these vanishing theorems. Okay, so now onto the rescaling argument. So for some So, for simplicity to simplify the notation, I'm going to use a capital lambda here to denote the blow-up rate of the Velazquez mean curvature flow solution. So it's some quantity that depends on those parameters n and k and also time t and is meant to track at least on the same order as the l infinity norm of the second fundamental form. So it's Form. So it's something that's going to infinity at the singularity time, but it's going to infinity faster than that type one rate of one on root time remaining. So kind of a big theorem here. I'll kind of go through this in detail. But this theorem says that for kind of, okay, for these suitable parameters a, k, and n, the Velasquez. The Velazquez solution satisfies this following estimate here, which is that if we take a look at the supremum of this weighted mean curvature and take a look at it, it's supremum in the space-time domain where X is within a distance of root time remaining to the singularity. Then we get something. Then we get something finite. And then, you know, that first, so that's kind of really what this theorem is saying. This first part here simply follows from the fact that this parameter A is positive. So this quantity here is at least one and controls the mean curvature itself. So let me kind of walk through like how to. Like, how to think about this estimate and kind of why it should make sense, where it comes from, etc. So, I think informally you can think of it as kind of a standard maximum principle for parabolic equations, which is that the supremum on a spacetime domain is controlled by its value on the boundary. So in this case, In this case. There we go, for initial time. And so, kind of a standard maximum principle for parabolic equations, like so, at least up to some constant C here. And then it's the Velasquez's good estimates that allow us to show that this quantity is finite. So that comes from Velasquez. Okay, so really the key estimate here is this middle inequality. So why can we expect something like that? Well, let's think about. Well, let's think about maximizing this weighted mean curvature here. So, on the one hand, I want to make the mean curvature as large as possible. And to make the mean curvature as large as possible, it makes sense to go as close to the origin or as close to the singularity as I can. On the other hand, if I want to make this other factor large, then I want to make x large. Make X large, or I want to move further away from the singularity, from the origin. So it's kind of this interplay of these two factors: wanting to move close to the origin, wanting to move away that kind of leads to a balance between them in the end and allows us to get an estimate of this form here. Okay. Okay. But let's kind of go through. Okay, but let's kind of go through now in detail how to actually make this rigorous with this rescaling argument. Okay, so suppose not. Then we can pick out this sequence of space-time points where this weighted mean curvature quantity here is as bad as possible. So kind of, it realizes the supremum, at least among prior times. And now we're going to condition on a couple of cases based on how that sequence is behaving in the limit. So the first case occurs when my space points are going to the origin, like one on the blowup rate of the second fundamental form. And really, so technically for all these cases, this is really like along some sub-sequence, but Along some sub-sequence, but I'll wide those details just for simplicity. So if along some sub-sequence we have these bad points going to the origin, like one on the blow-up rate of the skin fundamental form, we take a look at these parabolically rescaled mean curvature flows where we rescale according to that blow-up rate of the second fundamental form. So I get this, the sequence of mean curvature flows. The sequence of mean curvature flows, and I'm also going to look at the sequence of functions on them as well. So these functions are defined by: I take the mean curvature and I multiply by this constant that depends on I. Okay, so since U is some multiple of the mean curvature, it satisfies this parabolic Jacobi operator. And then the fact that we were that That we were looking at these bad points means that, well, the bad points kind of translate into an estimate, a pointwise estimate on u tilde of the following form that achieve equality at the particular, that the corresponding bad point. So now pass to a subsequential limit here. Pass to a subsequent limit. Passed to a subsequential limit here. In the limit, those rescaled mean curvature flow solutions converge to that smooth minimal surface. We can extract a limit from the functions into a U infinity to get an ancient solution of the parabolic Jacobi operator, but now on the smooth minimal surface sigma bar. And these pointwise bounds. These pointwise bounds now translate into good spatial decay on that limiting function that achieves equality somewhere, contradicting the vanishing theorem for sigma bar. So that rules out this first case. Second case is kind of morally similar. Now, again, we're going to suppose like a long sub-sequence that goes to the That goes to the origin, maybe not quite as fast as one on the blow-up rate of the second fundamental form, but faster than root time remaining. Again, I'm going to take these rescaled mean curvature flows with these different rescaling constants, and I'm going to look at these functions, which are again the mean curvature times some constant that depends on i. And so these functions satisfy a parabolic Jacobi operator, and the fact that we're sort of focused on these bad points translates into a pointwise bound here. Again, pass to the limit, you rescale the flows, converge to the Simons cone, extract the limit from the U infinity, which is an ancient solution of the Parabal-Jacobi operator on the cone that The cone that pointwise bound turns into this good spatial decay of u infinity, which is uniform in time but achieves equality somewhere, again, thereby contradicting the vanishing theorem for the cone. So that rules out the case one and two. And then case three, rather than doing this kind of rescaling argument, we can estimate directly from those good estimates that Velask has got for these parabolic scales where we're at distances root time remaining. Or at distances, root time remaining. So, here, kind of just using Velazquez's estimates, you can get a suitable estimate on the mean curvature like so. Not much to kind of take away from here other than you get this exponent that depends on these parameters a, k, and n. And that assumption on the parameters ensures that this is positive, so that in fact m has to decay. And that gives you the final contradiction. All right. So let me kind of just say a little notes on these constants, these parameters that appear. So let's say we're in high enough dimensions and at least four. enough dimensions and at least four uh so for any a you can always kind of ramp your you can always find some velazque solution in these dimensions uh that give you uh suitable parameters in the range i mean the reason for this maybe without going into detail these uh these lambda k they correspond to some eigenvalues um for the uh the linearization of For the linearization of the flow near the cone, which being a self-adjoint operator, these go to infinity as k goes to infinity. I guess a self-adjoint operator, compact resolve in. So you can always kind of ramp up k large enough to ensure you're in the suitable parameter range. However, if you take a look at the most However, if you take a look at the most generic behavior, so this k equals 2 case, which is corresponding to kind of the lowest eigenmode that's allowable for the Velazquez solutions, then in fact kind of falls outside of the suitable parameter range where the assumptions of the last theorem apply. And indeed, Wo-Shesham considered these Velazquez solutions with k equal to 2 and showed that the mean. And showed that the mean curvature actually does blow up when k is equal to 2 for the Velasquez solutions, albeit at a rate that's, you know, the mean curvature blows up, but at a rate slower than that of the second fundamental form. But nonetheless, in any dimension, we can always pick one of these Velasquez solutions where the last theorem applies, and that gives us these mean curvature bounds at scales near the singularity. Bounds at scales near the singularity. So let me just kind of wrap up with kind of finishing up the proof and looking at some future directions. So we've controlled H near the singularity to control it on the rest of the manifold. Well, first you can use Ecker-Huiskin interior estimates to get uniform curvature estimates at kind of a fixed distance. At kind of a fixed distance from the origin. So, informally, these interior estimates are saying that kind of the singularity forms before your manifold has a lot of time to move away from the singularity. Or the curvature of the initial hypersurface is small enough so that the singularity forms before it's able to move very much. To move very much. So that controls it at some fixed distance from the singularity or from the origin, and then you have to cook up these explicit sub and super solutions to kind of get that remaining region between these pair box scales and this fixed distance. And that really depends on kind of technical barrier construction. Technical barrier constructions near the cone. So these interior estimates plus the sub- and super solutions are then enough to give you that the Velasquez solution has uniformly bounded mean curvature in any dimension at least eight, or 2n at least eight, and k being sufficiently large, completing a proof of the main theorem. The main theorem. All right. So, kind of to wrap up here, I wanted to say a little bit about some applications to weak solutions and future directions. So, on Monday morning, Doska Lopelos talked about her recent work with Angana and Shesham, where they constructed the smooth continuation of the Velazquez solutions past the singularity time. And they managed to show as well that the mean curvature remains uniformly bounded for these times past the singularity. So together with Velasquez's construction and the main theorem from today, these combine to give you a weak mean curvature flow solution in R8, which is smooth everywhere except at the origin. Except at the origin and the singularity time. It's got a type 2 singularity. So the second fundamental form is blowing up, but the mean curvature is remaining uniformly bounded on that space-time track. So kind of an interesting solution of a weak mean curvature flow solution that isn't smooth, but has a super mild singularity. And now, given maybe that this is a talk on new directions and geometric flows, I just wanted to talk about some open questions and maybe some future directions. So as you might have noticed, these Velazquez solutions, they're smooth, properly embedded, but they're actually non-compact. So maybe a natural question is, well, can they be compactified to give you closed mean curvature flow solutions? Curvature flow solutions that again form a finite time singularity with uniformly bounded curvature. I expect the answer to this question is almost certainly yes. And informally, kind of the explanation is you take the initial data for the Velasca solution, move far enough away from the origin, cap it off. And as long as that cap has small enough curvature, you can. You can use those Ecker-Huiskin interior estimates to say that it's not going to move too much or kind of perturb the dynamics of the singularity formation near the origin and allow Velasquez's construction to still go through. There's a related question too for Ricci flow. So in another work, I constructed Ricci flow. Work, I constructed Ricci flow solutions that are analogous to the Velazquez mean curvature flow solutions. So these are Ricci flow solutions that form finite time singularities modeled instead of on minimal cones, modeled on Ricci flat cones. And so a natural question to ask is, do these have uniformly bounded scalar curvature? It's known that at a finite time singularity of the Ricci flow, Of the Ricci flow, that the Riemann curvature and the Ricci curvature have to blow up, but it's unknown if the scalar curvature has to blow up. So these could potentially be counterexamples or give a resolution to that extension problem for Ricci flow here. I should note too, so these Ricci flow solutions are closed, they're compact, boundaryless, and that's part of the reason I expect that these Velasquez mean curvature flow solutions. Loss because mean curvature flow solutions can be compactified. So, given that this works, or given that there are these constructions for Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow, it's maybe natural to then look at analogous constructions for other geometric flows. In fact, Velazquez's construction was based on a result by Herrero Velazquez for a nonlinear heat equation that's also been generalized to harmonic mapping. Also, been generalized to harmonic map heat flow. So it kind of is tempting to think that there could be constructions like this for other geometric flows as well. And to maybe go about that, instead of looking for singularities modeled on minimal cones or reachy flat cones, you'd look for singularities modeled on some stationary solution that's homogeneous as well, or a stationary solution that's also a shrink. or a stationary solution that's also a shrinker. Another kind of course of study might be to remove this O n times O n symmetry assumption and kind of adapt Velazquez's construction without that symmetry or to get singularities modeled on other minimal cones. And I have some forthcoming work on the Ricci flow. Forthcoming work on the Ricci flow that's kind of related to removing this symmetry condition as well. And then finally, what happens for these intermediate dimensions and between three and eight? So if you recall, there's that Li-Wong result that the mean curvature has to blow up for a singularity of two-dimensional surfaces and R3. But their proof relies on Gauss-Binnet and doesn't really seem Relies on Gauss-Binet and doesn't really seem to generalize to these higher dimensions here. On the other hand, Velasquez's construction breaks down for dimensions lower than eight. And in fact, it's even worse than that, at least among O times O symmetric solutions, there's a certain barrier argument that rules out singularities modeled on the Simons cone. So this So, whatever happens in these intermediate dimensions, I think that's kind of the most curious for what could happen here, and where I don't really have many ideas for what might occur. All right. So I know it's a little bit early, but I think that's all I wanted to say here. So I'll wrap it up there and open the floor for questions. Thanks. Thank you very much, Max. Let's give Max a round of applause. Let's give Max a round of applause. Are there any questions? Maybe let's see if there are any questions in band. Can I ask a question? Sure. Very interesting talk. I have one question. Is your solution which blows up, but mean cabbage bounded? It's But the mean carbide bounded is very unstable. Right, yeah. So, I mean, so these Velasquez solutions should be non-generic. Yeah, and that's related to kind of work go here. Right, right. So that's kind of related to having to take this parameter k here at least two. You kind of Here, at least two. You kind of need the lowest, at least, in the asymptotic behavior, you need these kind of leading order eigenmode expansions to vanish and these higher modes to dominate instead. And yeah, and also Kolding-Minikatsi's work on kind of cylinders being the only generic singularities also rules out these Velasca. These Velasquez solutions as being generic solutions or being generic singularity formation. I see. So near the US, so maybe relative to the related question. Near your solution, are there any similar solution like this type? Right. Like, could you, are you saying, like, could you perturb it, get another maybe? Turb it, get another maybe find a time singularity model. Yeah, of course, it's not uh stable, but if you smartly shift it, so there might be chance, no, right. Yeah, I'm not sure. I think there should be something somehow about like I mean, so maybe the O n times O n symmetry is enough to roll that out right there that you just like don't have. That you just like don't have suitable singularity models there. Without that, yeah, without that, right, without that, I'm less sure. Yeah. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Any other questions? Yeah, so for the Reach flow problem, what do you expect is the critical dimension? Right. Right, yeah, good question. So, right, so these Ricci flow solutions, they exist, I think it was dimensions at least 13 for these here. 13 was a little, I mean, I think you can get down to maybe 10. 10 or 11, you know, plus or minus one there. Yeah, so there was like a plus two that came from kind of a technical condition in order to construct barriers that was necessary there. So I think you might be able to, you know, so if these Ricci flow solutions have uniformly bounded scalar curvature, then they should give you Then they should give you, you know, you should be able to adapt the construction to get to get ones in dimensions as low as 10. Going dimensions lower than that is actually going to, you're going to need to kind of like a genuine, a kind of genuinely new construction. Yeah, these Ricci flow solutions, they use this doubly warped product structure. doubly warped product structure. So you get a cone on sp times sq as what's modeling these the parabolic rescalings near the singularity. And kind of much like how the stability of the Simons cone kind of played a role in these Velazquez mean curvature flow solutions, there's some Yeah, there's some kind of conditions on being in high enough dimensions to get this construction to go through for this cone. So if you wanted to get lower dimensions, you would have to get some singularities, but modeled on a different cone. And you'd have to kind of go outside of the kind of symmetry assumptions that were necessary to get these regions. That were necessary to get these Reachy flow solutions. So as kind of a, you know, I have kind of a, I mean, this is very speculative, but I mean, I think maybe you could get this down to n equals four, but I don't want to be quoted on that or anything. Yeah, I looked at this actually a long time ago when I was a PhD student and for this stability inequality. And for this stability inequality over the product of spheres, I think 10 was the critical dimension, but then right, right? Then, if you look, look at CP2 or something like that, then it's unstable over in dimension four. Right, right. Yes, I need right. So you need like not just the cone on there, but also like some smooth Einstein or Ricci flat Einstein manifold that's asymptotic to that cone on C. That's asymptotic to that conon CB2 as well. Yeah. And I mean, kind of the advantage in working here is you can use this W work product structure, which is roughly analogous to the O n times O n symmetry. And so that kind of like simplifies the analysis that you have to look at. You essentially have one spatial dimension. So yeah, I guess that. Yeah, I guess that's all to say. This is sort of related to removing the O n times O n symmetries. I mean, I guess if you find an example in any dimension, it doesn't matter that much what the dimension is. Right, yeah. Yeah, I think, yeah, this would be the starting point to just get, get it for one dimension and then get it optimal later on. I mean, yeah, which is similar for the mean curvature flow case here. The mean curvature flow case here, what happens in these intermediate dimensions. Any other questions? All right, then let's thank Max again, and this is. And this is concluding this day and we'll meet tomorrow again at nine if you're on mountain time and whatever your own time zone is. Yeah. See you, see you tomorrow.
