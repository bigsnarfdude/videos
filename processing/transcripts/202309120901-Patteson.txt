I would remind us that there are three cytostal networks, microtubules, actin, and intermediate filaments, which are expressed kind of a tissue-specific way. I mentioned being a pretty predominant one. And so these networks have mechanical properties described by the persistence lengths of these networks. Microtubules, very long persistence lengths that span the whole cell, and intermediate filaments. And intermediate filaments have very short, persistent lengths and makes them very soft. And they don't interact with any molecular motor, so they're clearly the least interesting ones to study. But we think it's a little more complex. And I like to also note that intermediate filaments evolve much later, right? So even though single-cell organisms have actinated microtubules, intermediate filaments come along and Filaments didn't come along until we get to multicellular organisms. And so there's this notion that intermediate filaments emerge to help with stresses and the diversity of functions that you get in the physical challenges associated with being a multicellular organism. Alright, and so these intermediate filaments have very interesting mechanical properties. And so here I'm showing you a video. So, here I'm showing you a video of Hagfish Slime, which is actually full of these intermediate filament proteins. So, you can see they're these ooey-dooy viscoelastic polymer networks that are soft, but you also maybe notice are very resistant to breakage. All right, so actin and microtubules are much more susceptible to breakage compared to these very soft intermediate filaments. This is due to the molecular structure of the intermediate filaments, which can unwind and unfold as they're stretched. And so Unfold as they're stretched. And so if you reconstitute these polymer networks, you can characterize those mechanical properties in a bulk riometer or other mechanical tool. And so this is shear stress versus strain. And what's highlighted is these breakage points of microtubule and active cytoskeletal networks. And we see intermediate filaments can actually stretch over 100 or 200% of their resting length without breaking. Okay, so there's tremendous ability. Breaking. Okay, so this tremendous ability to stretch without breakage, and you'll also notice a very significant strain-stiffening behavior where they get much stiffer to stretch the more that you pull on that. And so it's been very challenging to look at their role inside the cell for a couple of reasons. One, I would say, is that a lot of traditional cell mechanical tests actually use very kind of small deformations to probe the cell and for a very soft polymer. And for a very soft polymer that only stiffens at very large strains, you're not going to engage that mechanical network. And also, the intermediate filament network is very close to the nucleus. You have to very strongly probe the cell to get a mechanical response from the intermediate filament. So, one way we've been approaching this problem is to kind of let cells do this on their own because they are very good at that. So, fibroblasts and a Fibroblasts and a collagen network really spread out and pull in those cells. You can see large deformations. This is a video from Peter Field's group where you can see also the nucleus gets highly deformed, even though it's quite the most rigid and largest organelle in the cell. And so these blooding cells deform themselves. And I'll just also mention that my menton is thought to be involved in. Is thought to be involved in a cell migration process here because it's seen in many of those physiological contexts. So, during development or wound healing, you see an expression of vimentin when cells often will go from an epithelial cell type to a mesenchymal cell type and adopt that polarized migratory phenotype. And I'll also mention that many cancers my mention is overexpressed and it's a marker for poor prognosis and aggressive tumor growth. Obsess and aggressive tumor growth. So, wanting to understand that role, I'll just have a snapshot of some of the findings. That we looked at some fibroblasts lacking these intermediate filaments and watched them migrate through a collagen network where they're highly deforming themselves. And here is an NLS GFP, so it's the nucleus that's highlighted in a vimentinal cell. And you can see those high deformations, and actually, right there, briefly, you can see there's a rupture of the nuclear. There's a rupture of the nuclear envelope. So the nucleus has become so deformed as the cell tries to push itself through these small pores in the collagen matrix that there's a mechanical rupture of the envelope. And this has lots of consequences for the cell because they're losing things like DNA repair enzymes during that brachiage event and it can accumulate DNA damage and genome variation. So these rupture events were much more frequent with the loss of vimentum. With the loss of imentin, particularly in a 3D context, 2D, they don't undergo these large deformations. Again, kind of highlighting the role of imentin for cells under these extreme deformations. All right, and so when I started my group in Syracuse, we wanted to really understand this role of imentin and cell migration and at different scales. And so these are some of the current projects that we have going on. That we have going on looking at cell polarization and bimetamicrotubule interactions, nuclear shape, and also collective cell migration. I'm going to talk about this one first and try and talk about this, but I'm happy to talk about any of these projects. I'm also talking about largely unpublished work, which is most exciting for me, but also hopefully exchange of ideas. Maybe I might not have answers to all your questions, but hopefully, we will find that. Hopefully, we will find that. Okay, so here in this project, we wanted to look at what happens when we move from single cells to a collective cell, which is a more closer to that real tissue environment, right? It's not just single cells migrating in networks. And so this is one of the models that's used in the field, right? We can take an aggregate of cells, or I'll simply call it a spheroid. These are fibroblasts. Actually, these are cancer cells, but fibroblasts. Actually, these are cancer cells, but fibroblasts do this too. And watch them, you embed them inside a collagen network, and you can watch them invade into that matrix. And you see these threads that emerge after about 24 hours, and also single-cell escape. And so this very simplified picture of what you might get in a tumor microenvironment where there's other cell types, hydrogen cells, fibroblots, and things like vascular. And things like Vasculature get promoted there. Okay, and so also just to quantify, and I'm going to show data from some of the couple of these cancer cell types. There's these well-known breast cancer cells at different stages of cancer. And this was work from Melissa Mendez and the Goldman group showing that actin level C is the same, at least increasing grade of cancer, but this significant increase in the thimentin. Increase in the mimentin expression. And that's associated too with kind of the epithelial to the zanchromal phenotype shift and a much more polarized shape of the cells. Okay, and so to give some context to this experiment, this is what we look like for fibroblasts. We get this spread out here, and I got this slide this morning, so I wanted to show it. This morning, so I wanted to show it. This is some high-resolution and confocal reflectance imaging of that spheroid in the collagen matrix. I don't think the collagen here is probably relaxed because we've fixed the system and done a lot to stain it. But you can definitely see these strands of cells going out and they're full of this dimension network. I think there's probably also dimension here. I think just the antibody hasn't. Here, I think just the antibody hasn't retruded into the system. But now let's look at when we remove those intermediate filaments and look at the same time course. And we get almost nothing. Okay, very little. We have a few strands. And at first, this was surprising to me because we knew that at the single cell level, they were capable of moving and migrating. As I showed you, they were very much pushing their nucleus through small pores and moving. Pores and moving. So they're capable of it, but not at the collective cell level, which we wanted to understand more. Okay, so and one of the ways we've been quantifying this is to, we have a custom algorithm to trace the shape of the main aggregate. We have cell breakups here, which we can quantify more, but I'll be showing data for just this average aggregate shape that has the threads intact. And if we do that, we can quantify this difference. We can quantify this difference. So, a much stronger rate of expansion when you have vimentin. Okay, and so I'm also going to show you these two cancer cell types, the MC10s, which are low vimentin expression, low cancer grade, and high cancer grade 231s with high vimentin expression and low polarization. Actually, this isn't new, but I'm going to show you for context anyway. Very little MC10. Very little MC10 expansion, maybe some cell escape, and after 10-12 hours, much more kind of aggressive invasion of these 231s into that network. Okay, and so the last combination of cells spreading I'm going to show you is actually a co-culture of those cancer cells with the fibroblast. And that's because it's a bit closer to the physiological context where fibroplasts, there's cancer-associated fibroplastics. There's cancer-associated fibroblasts, which we're not using here, but fibroblasts are excellent remodelers of the matrix. And so they're known to be an important component of the expansion of these cells. And so here's just a co-culture picture where our cancer cells are shown, our 231s are shown in green, our fibroblasts in red, and so there's a lot of kind of overlay between those throughout the aggregate. That's a question. I had a question in the slide for the momentum. In the slide with the momentum where you've done the confocal energy. Yes. I was just curious: do you have an idea where the momentum is? Is it going to the leading edge of these cells, of the migrating cells, or is it more throughout the whole spheroid? No, at the cell level, yeah. We just got those pictures last week, so I have to look closer and take a look at them. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Is that from? Yeah. Well, we'll see. Oh, sorry. Okay. All right. So we have this co-culture environment. And here I wanted to know, all right, vimentin and many contacts have been shown for important for fibroblast activity. And so is vimentin in the fiber facilitating the fibroblast function in this expansion? Okay, so we've taken fibroblast with can. With cancer, IL-type fibroblast with the cancer cells, and then we've taken fibroblast lacking vimentin with the cancer cells, this is effect. Okay, and so these are our 231s with our wild-type fibroblast. So this is the video from the start. There's lots of expansion. And if we compare to the same pulp culture conditions, just a subfraction of the cells lacking fibensin and the fibroblast, it almost totally kills. It almost totally kills the expansion. It's a quite strong effect. And when we quantify this data, one thing that's interesting is that this is the cancer cells alone in the green. And when you have fibroblasts, you get better at expanding, right? And here again, you just see this lack of migration with the vimentinol cells. Okay. Alright, so now we want to understand how I mentioned driving this collective behavior. And I can think of a number of things to look at. And, you know, where does one start and focus? And I'm going to play a little game of red, light, green, light to go through these. So single cell dynamics. We know that my mental null cells are capable of moving as fast and they can generate as much traction stress, at least on 2D surfaces. Stress at least on 2D surfaces. So it seems like they're capable of just as much actomycin activity. So we're not going to look there quite yet. Also, cells expressing vimentin and arizengymol lost their cell cell adhesions, right? They lose their cell cell adhesions. So I'm sure it's important here, but it's not going to be the first place we look. Nuclear mechanics are very interested in, right? We've shown that what I meant is helping and Is helping and kind of cushioning the nucleus as cells go through these matrix, but it seems like the vimentin null matrix can't even get into that collagen network to even start deforming their nucleus. So we'll wait on that. Cell polarization, right? While climate change has an impact on that polarized cell. I'm going to try and talk about that a little bit at the end, time remaining. I'm going to start with looking at the collagen remodeling and the ability for this collective. Ability for this collective aggregate to generate forces. Alright, so here's a scan of the collagen network around one of these spheroid aggregates. And let me just do 2D slice here. You can see the accumulation, right? We saw this a little bit with the single cells yesterday with Ming. Here's an aggregate accumulation of the collagen fibers. This is control growth. Fibers. This is from focal reflectance imaging mode. And you can see radial fibers being pulled towards the matrix. And this is not being remodeled in the bimectinal cells. All right, and so to take this a step forward, we wanted to model those placements in the collagen network by traction force microscopy-based techniques. And so these are fluorescent bees, they're trapped in the collagen matrix. In the collagen matrix. This is a 24-hour video sped up very quickly, and you can see this bulk inward motion of the beads, and it's very spatially and temporally varying, right? So we now look at this displacement data. We can take time, this is a time-average snapshot of the displacements, the polling of the ACM network from the aggregate. And one question then is: well, And one question then is: well, sorry, one more thing. Okay, and we can quantify the displacements away from the center of the spheroid. This is the spheroid size here, so it's the maximum displacement close to the spheroid. And it's scaling is approximately r to the minus 2. Okay, now if we want to know what the force is that this contractile unit is developing, right, we need some type of contractile. Developing, right? We need some type of constitutive relation to relate that change in displacement to a force. And this isn't a simple system, so you have to start with perhaps some simple models. And so a few years ago, some work that Ben Fabry took a stab at this. I should also mention that Babek Chanoi's worked on this. And I should talk more with him. He's teaching right now. But, okay, so, and. But, okay, so in Ben Fravery's model, the sphere is just a sphere with a uniform contractile pressure everywhere, and it's bedded in a fiber network, characterized with buckling, a linear regime of strain-stiffening component. And we can measure some of these parameters experimentally. We can measure the mesh size in the network, we can also measure the We can also measure the rheological properties of the collagen networks that the cells are in. And what you can do then is fit is a finite element based model. So knowing the deformations, you can kind of guess what the applied force is. And we have these set these curves over time that we can fit to a contractility. Alright, so there's this. Contractility. So there's this growing contractility of the wild-type cells that isn't produced in the vibramentinal context. We do see a minus two, and Vivic wow says it goes from a minus two to a minus one, I think depending on the properties of the matrix. All right, now what this model lacks, though, is a cell scale resolution. And so this is some work in collaboration currently with Jen Schwartz. Collaboration currently with Jen Schwartz and her colleagues. And so, here the idea is to make a 3D vertex model for this cell spheroid. And so, here's their recently described 3D version of the vertex model. And they can look at things like cell cell rearrangements, which would have to do with the dynamics of the cells. Aline, quick question. Yes. Experimentally, does the volume of the steroid decrease when it pulls? Actually, I think it may. I think it may. We don't have it measured, but if you take a video from the moment you put it in the gel, it does seem to contract in on itself. Yeah. I wonder where the volume is going. So the cells collectively lose volume, per se. But then the third dimension. Well, there's a three-dimensional model. Or I guess the experiment is 2D more. I most of the right now our videos are mostly in 2D, but we do 3D scans at certain time points. There's no At certain time points. There's no evidence that it's not symmetric in the third dimension. The different cell types make different amounts of DCM when you make the steroids? We haven't quantified. Yeah. But it's a, yeah. It's over 24 hours. I don't know if we'd expect more. Yeah, I guess you wouldn't expect very much from 24 hours. Okay. Do you have to worry about how to play in motion then? If this is a three. A plane motion, then if this is a three-dimensional and those traction force microscopy, like those beads are certainly not, they're not all moving at XY, right? Some are moving. Okay, I will say that the contraction does seem to be primarily inward. So you're right that there could be some out-of-plane motion that we're not capturing. I mean, it would just kind of like underestimate your actual Because you're only looking at it in more closer. Yeah, there's definitely this a lot of spatial and temporal heterogeneity here, right, as well. And we're really only kind of taking long-time spatial averages. So we're probably definitely underestimating some of the contraction. They would go out of focus if they disappear and you wouldn't need to track them up. If there was a lot, you would just attract it for a certain amount of time. So you could probably assume they're in the plane that you're looking at. Yeah. That you look at. Yeah. My argument here is it's mostly inward, right? Predominantly inward. I guess we could try and estimate how much out of the plane there is. Okay. All right. I wanted to tell you a slightly different about cell polarization, so I'll try and speed up. But the idea is you put this aggregate GIT as well into a fibrous network, allow cells to pull on the Allow cells to pull on the network, and so this is pretty new work. But with a model like this, you can capture some of the heterogeneous pulling of the fibers. And I'll just say kind of quickly what our thoughts are, and we could still disprove it. But the model is telling us actually that if you have cell shapes and cell dynamics that are more fluid-like, that you get more pulling. And so, at least for this. And so, at least for this version of the model, we have the cells are more fluid, they can create and pull on the network in a more dynamic fashion compared to if they're just solid and they form one contact and hold on it. And so, in that sense, a more fluid spheroid would be able to generate more forces. And so, the idea that by mentin promotes cell polarization or dynamic cell, we may get more pulling forces. Yes. Forces, yes. So for acne microtubules, they're like clearly like mechanical roles. This would do a lot of stuff with like signaling, you could do metabolism and all things like that. Like for the victim, is that true as well? Yes, yes. So I'm going to show you some more work. I think that is more signaling related. We also have some um evidence that bimetin is involved in MMP transport and the degradation. So And the degradation. So, another layer to this is that loss of mimetin impairs MMT degradation, which is very important in this process. But here, you're emphasizing the mechanical aspect of stuff as well. Well, we've made mechanical measurements, right? And we see the ability to generate those contractile forces are different. So, I'm not sure if I answered your question, but you're saying why is it? But you're saying, why is it a mechanical model? We are, I mean, we are looking at different avenues, and I would like to add more biological components to the model. So this is just kind of first iteration. Okay, with the time I have remaining, I want to tell you more about how vimentin impacts cell polarity. And I'll let you, you know, what are it, we know that vimetin impacts cell polarity. We have data to show that. We have data to show that. I'm going to highlight two, I think, of the really important studies in this aspect. So, there's some work again from the Bach-Goldman lab showing that if you remove vimentin, cells generate lamellopodia everywhere. And they pull in every direction, and then they don't have a primary direction to go. So there's an actually in some other ways, an antagonistic relationship between mimentin and actin. And in another study, In another study, there's an idea that mimetins impacting cell polarizations through its interactions with the microtubules. And the idea is that you have mimetins, this mesh work, microtubules are going through that meshwork. And because the turnover of intermediate filaments is so much slower than actin and microtubules, they retain kind of a memory there and they, quote, template where the microtubules will go. So they allow microtubules to stay kind of in polarized directions. Kind of in polarized directions longer than they would have without vimenting. Okay, and so we got interested in this polarity question because we saw some interesting effects in these 3D settings, which we weren't sure if those reasons explain what was happening here, where we watched cells going through microphloidic channels. And what we found was that in these constrictions, or the cell entering the constriction, it's changing its mind, right? It's not keeping to go into the channel, but it's... But it's changing direction and moving. And the vimentinal cells, especially here at the beginning, they love to go in just one direction when they enter these constrictions. These constrictions are about 10 microns the size of the cell. And so we quantified this. About 50% of fibroblasts would change direction. Maybe only 20% of the bimentinal cells would change direction. So we wondered why there was this abnormally persistent migration when you lost bimentanol. Migration, when you lost my mental. And so now when we think about 3D, things can become different, right? Because of the geometric constraints on the cells. Actually, there's many reasons. I don't have time to talk about it. We have changes in adhesion structure and changes in the cytoskeletal structure when you get into 3D. And one, I'd like to highlight is that the cell center's own, which is a microtubule organizing center, which is very important for the polar. Which is very important for the polarizing direction of the cell, seems to be behaving different in 3D settings than in 2D. So, in 2D pictures, you've got the centrosome in front of the nucleus, leading edges here. There's work showing that the centrosome trails the nucleus in 3D settings, okay? And so, and work from Yuli Wang did some precise measurements where the centrosome, if a cell changes direction in a confined environment, that centrosome is moving to. That centrosome is moving to the other side of the nucleus, and that defines kind of a new leading edge. And so we were hypothesizing, we were hypothesizing that loss of imentin is disrupting how the centrosome moves. And you're in a really tight, crowded environment because of the cell and also the geometric effects. So, how does that centrosome move in this very dense cytoskeletal network? Skip this. Okay. So, here's a snapshot of the centrosome So here's a snapshot of the centrosome in the vimentin network. Right, it's just kind of, I mean, there's many things there. I'm just showing two things. But you think, how would it move in the STEM network with and without? And, you know, our goal is ultimately to track these in the microphilic channels. COVID changed our plans a little bit, but we didn't have to go very far before we saw some interesting effects of vimentin in the cell centrosome. So, in these cells lacking vimentin, we found Cells lacking vimentin, we found kind of a striking change in the size of the centrosome. So very small centrosomes and vimentinal cells. You can also see that the microtubules at the centrosome are organized quite differently. So we quantify kind of the amount of microtubules at the centrosome, and there's much less microtubules at the centrosome spots, any cells lacking vimentin. Cells lacking vimentin, and we quantified the size of the centrosome, and we see that the size is much smaller. And you know, can the centrosome really change its size? Yes, they start showing it can, right? Because the centrosome has this very, you know, many proteins that make up the centrosome. It has this PCM matrix material that regulates the distance between the two centrioles. And we've looked at different markers at the centrosome, and it seems that. At the centrosome, and it seems that it's mostly the PCM proteins that are disrupted with loss of vimetin, not the centrioles. You know, this might seem a little crazy, right? Because microtubules, centrioles, microtubule organizing center of the cell, but we've done some expansion microscopy to try and see if there was localization of bimentin at the center zone. So it's expansion microscopy. Now we can see two centrioles, and there's vimentin in this region. And there's vimensin in this region. I'm also kind of, well, I don't know if I should be surprised, but there's vimentin that looks like it's up where the microtubules would be mediating out. And again, we found in this 2003 proteomic characterization of the cell centrosome, you go in and look at the SI materials, vimentin's there. So vimentin is a protein that's been identified to bind at the cell centrosome. Okay, and so given Okay, and so given this altered structure, we thought it may have altered functions. I'm running out of time, so I'll try to be brief. One, we found you can measure microtubule nucleation activity from the cell centrosome with these micotazole washout assays. So we did that, and so the main result was that having bimentin increased the nucleating microtubin nucleating activity of the centrosome. Activity of the centrosome. And when we did these experiments with nicotazole, we also noticed many more stable microtubules in the vimentin cells. So this is supposed to be away after all the microtubules are effectively disassembled. But there's much more remaining in the vimentin cells, suggesting maybe some type of signaling that stabilizes those microtubules. Microtubules can be stabilized in different post-translational modifications. Different post-translational modificative ways. Here we looked at acetylated microtubules and found much more, this is just aptubulin, this is acetylated, and with amino fluorescence, much more acidylated tubulin, which would be more stable. Microtubules, also measured with blot. So these cells have the same amount of total tubulin, but we're finding that there's an increased amount of acetylated tubulin, and then we make them more. That make them more stable. Now, I don't have a lot of time. Very mentioned, but this is still led to this very recent paper showing that centrosome amplification, which could be actually supernumerary centrosomes, which is cancer cells, or perhaps just an enhancement of the centrosome itself, has been shown to increase acetylated tubulin. And that impacts the transport of cargo in the cell, which can impact clinical. In the cell, which can impact the polarization of the cell. So, the acetylated microtubules are known to promote kinesin 1 transport. So, in this kind of tug-of-war between dyne and kinesin transport, you can get more polarized cells with the more acidylated microtubules. And so, you know, we just kind of very quickly wanted to see if we saw modifications of cell polarization and sensors on positioning with and without bimentin. With and without vimentin. So, in some wound healing assays, there we go, closing, of the wound, we wondered how is the centrosome position with and without bimentin. No, and so the wound heads being over here, we can quantify that the centrosome is polarized more towards the cell migration edge when you have vimentin versus when you don't have limentin. Trying to connect acetylated tubulation right, centrosome positioning, and cell polarization with. On positioning and self-polarization with and without my mentor. Okay. One more minute. Okay, I have two public service announcements. One is we are now doing large preps of Imentin with the sort of company I-Corps, and it seems to have nice rheological properties. And we're also working with Beckolai at Bucknell, who is making these nice N-V-German networks, composites with Actin. So, if you are interested in environment, we'd love to. Are you interested in environmental? We'd love to send you some. Also, some great help from Paul in doing this project. And also, PSA, our group has started open access Python code. So, actually, this is running in Google Colab. We had a demo mode available. We're still optimizing it. It's based on the finite element method. But if you're interested in it, please also talk to me. And of course, my group did all the work, and I'll take any questions. Work, then I'll take any questions. So I want to actually continue the question that was already asked about signaling effect of Ryan Mountain. Your data with this expansion could be interpreted as changes, let's say, raw activity. Changes, let's say, the raw activity. Can you say whether variants in plus and minus cell differ in level of raw and so on? Okay, yes. So we've done those measurements in 2D, right? And actually it's a bit complicated because it's context-specific. But these vimentinol cells can generate as much actomyosin activity. Actomycin activity and stress activity. Now, in these soft substrates, in these 3D settings, it's not so clear. And although maybe with single cells, we could get a little bit more information on that. I will also say we have one experiment that helps us with the signaling aspect. We can take cells that have vimentin but can't form filaments. Form filaments, okay? So there are these cells that express only what's called unit-like filament, the smallest stable unit inside the cell. And so the idea is that would retain the chemical signaling component, but not form the network. And those don't expand like the wild type. So it does seem like having a full filamentous network that can support physical stresses is important. Now, maybe there's some signaling processes that depend on it. Processes that depend on it also being the lamentas. Yeah. Actually, to follow up on your question, as you mentioned, by mental health, they generate forces, and it's been shown, you're talking about this, I think, as you've been stress fibers are increased with the mental health. And also, there's a paper that shows that this was mediated through GEFH1. I can't remember which was Lapland and paper. Yeah, yeah. So maybe that is relevant to. Well, so, right, the prediction, maybe the prediction then would be that mental null cells would expand faster, right? More optimized activity. So it's actually paradoxical. Yeah, so that's, that doesn't seem to be at least a clear explanation. Are you sure they have abnormal persistent migration through this fiction? And can you elaborate why the, I mean, you show that the cytosomes have a lot to do with this, right? But then why that But then, why that happened in the constrictions? Yeah, so we haven't done the experiments, but the hypothesis is that there is an impaired polarization mechanism when you don't have mimicin. All right, and also, and you know, I guess it's what details we want to get. I mean, we know we have some hypotheses. That's the question we want to answer, and what we're hoping we. To answer, and we're hoping we can put some of these findings into a model. But right, there's questions about the positioning of the center zone, positioning in the nucleus, right? And then also, you know, kind of just how, I mean, so one thought is, by meant to not only resist forces, but can help generate forces by, you know, enhanced activity and cross-linking with the active myosin network. And are those things important? Network and are those things important for promoting a sustained directional motion of the centrozome? And if you don't have that machinery, right, then you can't properly move your centrozome is a hypothesis thinking about. Yeah. Hopeful. Okay, yeah. Sorry, yeah, sorry, that side of the remotely. Sure, I can't go for that. Sure. Um I you mentioned that intermediate elements and fentanyl payrolls of penzolins. So I'm wondering in the context of what you're learning about the role in centrozole positioning and stuff, like do you have any guesses, theories about why this was important for ozone more than cellular organisms? Well, I would say we are trying to study these problems in the context of 3D cell migration. Of 3D cell migration or migration through a dense tissue, right, that's very confined. So, as I mentioned, right, how do you properly position a centrosome when not only do you have to organize yourself, but you're competing with boundary effects, right? And you might have to adopt these really strange morphologies to do that. So that would be my answer. Do you notice any sort of like feedback? So the m is restructuring the microcupules and like that in the microtubules. Then as the microtubules are restructuring, do you see any sort of feedback on that the mid structure is altered by microtubules? There's work sh showing that, right? If you and I guess we we have some images too, right? When you depolymerize the microtubules of the network collapses. By the network collapses to some extent. I guess it's a time-dependent process. So there is a feedback. Yeah. Yeah, we can talk more about that point. I was wondering about the centrosome story. So centrosomes are also the basis of the primary cilia, right? And they have to do with cellularity and signaling. So they could be sort of a connection. We did look at primary cilia, and those cell types have the same amount. Cell types have the same amount. Maybe there's more details about length and things like that. Because we thought, okay, maybe there's a defect in the primary cilia, but at least at a... But they're there and when they're reoriented or there's lack of reorientation, so they're still there or they can take it down. Because they're quite sensitive, but they disappear very quickly. Maybe we could talk more about a good assay to look at that function. Maybe we should save questions from later. Do we have to do we have to head off?
