Part of the MIDIA, so there are a lot of new faces for me. And today I'll be talking about ongoing work with a network of collaborators centered on Grafa Institute in Amsterdam. So, based on a wealth of observations of its gravitational effects. Of its gravitational effects, we know that dark matter makes up 80% of the matter in the universe and outweighs baryons by a factor of about four. And we know that it's approximately cold, collisionless, and classical. But beyond that, we don't know the details of about the dark matter, like what its fundamental constituents are, or what their mass is or what their non-gravitational interaction. Their non-gravitational interactions with baryonic matter are, if they even exist. So, today I'm going to talk to you about how a particular gravitational wave system called the microphone. Yeah. The micro of your computer. Oh, I see. Then we put a Then we put it. Okay. So I'm going to tell you about how gravitational wave observation is better. Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry, cool. Good. Okay. So today I'm going to tell you about how gravitational wave observations Gravitational wave observations of a particular type of black hole binary called a dark dress could be useful for probing dark matter. So the dark matter's mass can range over about 90 orders of magnitude. There's a huge amount of uncertainty about this. And dark dresses could probe a pretty wide swath of this parameter space, making them a really exciting system to study. So dark dresses are a particular So, dark dresses are a particular type of intermediate mass ratio in spiral. And for anyone who's not familiar with these systems, with MRIs, the kinds I'm talking about consist of a black hole or a neutron star with a mass in the solar mass range and an intermediate mass black hole with mass in the thousand to hundred thousand solar mass range. So, it's still unknown if intermediate mass black mass Known if intermediate mass black holes exist, but there's tentative evidence from X-ray observations that could be due to accreting IMBHs. And they've also been hypothesized to seed the formation of supermassive black holes whose origins at high redshifts aren't understood. So, EMRIs are an ideal target for the planned LISA detector. In this plot, I'm showing on the x-axis. I'm showing on the x-axis frequency and on the y-axis characteristic strain for the Leeson noise curve in red, and then for MRIs that are being observed for five years before coalescence with different masses. And so these fall like pretty much in the middle of the Lisa band and they go through millions of gravitational wave cycles during the Gravitational wave cycles during the five years before they merge. Let me just move this control thing. Okay. So a dark dress is connected to an EMRI because it's just an EMRI with an extremely dense spike or halo of dark matter around the central black hole. And these spikes can be. These spikes can be formed in a couple different ways that I'll explain on the next slide. But by spike, I'm referring to a density profile for dark matter that obeys a power law with some kind of normalization and some kind of slope that falls in this, let me try this, this range I've indicated. And the dark matter densities in these spikes are extreme. Spikes are extreme. They can be 10 to the 24 times the local value. And this means that even if the dark matter's interactions are extremely feeble, then they can have some kind of impact on the density profile of the spike. So for people familiar with dark matter, there's this thermal relic cross-section for weakly interacting massive particles. And if the dark matter self-annihilated with the cross-section 10 to the minus times this thermal value. Minus times this thermal value that would have an impact on the spike. So we're really able to get down to extremely feeble interactions. So how can these systems form? There are several ways. First of all, there are ways they could form around astrophysical IMBHs. Two of the leading mechanisms for how they could form are through this direct collapse model. Are through this direct collapse model, where clouds of pristine gas in the early universe collapse directly to form intermediate mass black holes, or they could form through the collapse of population three stars formed early in the universe. And I've illustrated this with a cartoon here. So, in both cases, the progenitor of the IMDH is expected to form on top of the existing dark. The existing dark matter halo, an existing dark matter over density, and in both scenarios, as the gas collapses slowly to form an IMBH, it drags the dark matter in with it in this time-varying potential. And this process is called adiabatic compression or contraction. And this leads to the dark matter forming this extremely dense spike. Spike around the IMDH. So intermediate mass black holes could also be of primordial origin. And this might sound more exotic, but in some ways it's a really compelling situation. Oh yeah, so this is the power law of the density profile. So in the primordial case, we know that intermediate mass black holes can't make up all of the dark matter because of constraints. Dark matter because of constraints from cosmic microwave background observations. And so that means that if the rest of the dark matter is made up of some kind of particle or light primordial black hole, it will naturally form these spikes around primordial black holes. This is kind of an inevitability. And the way these form is that primordial black holes sitting in a diffuse cloud of Diffuse cloud of dark matter in the early universe will gravitationally bind some of the dark matter to it. And this dark matter will infall radially towards the black hole. And this will set up this very steep density profile within the sphere of gravitational influence. So, in both these cases, you can naturally get these dense dark matter spikes around IMDHs. And the power law is. And the power law is slightly less steep in the primordial case. So, the connection with gravitational waves is through what's called dephasing. So, as the light black hole in the MRI is moving through this dark matter cloud, it will gravitationally scatter the dark matter that is in its vicinity. And that will give the dark matter a bit of a kick and take away some of the energy from the Some of the energy from the small compact object. And this basically means these systems have an additional energy loss mechanism beyond just gravitational wave emission. And so that means that they go through fewer orbital cycles from a given starting point to merger. And this is what we call dephasing. And so just to close the loop, the dephasing depends on the precise details of the The precise details of the dark matter density profile. And the density profile depends on the dark matter's potential interactions with itself. So the dephasing gives us an observational tool to try and map out this density profile and understand the dark matter's properties. And so, in existing work, people have done projections for the kinds of constraints. Spectrums for the kinds of constraints LISA could set on a variety of different dark matter models over this 70 orders of magnitude, I said, could be covered from ultralight bosons all the way up to primordial black hole dark matter. And this is quite promising, but this prior work neglects a really important point, which is that while this compact object is moving through the dark matter cloud, it's stirring up the dark matter and Stirring up the dark matter and impacting its density profile. So the dark matter cloud is evolving over the course of the in spiral, which is going to weaken these constraints. So the question I'm going to talk about for the rest of my talk is whether Lisa could actually observe and measure the properties of these dark dresses when we properly account for this evolution. Okay, so next. Okay, so next I'm going to explain a bit how we account for the evolution of the dark matter halo. And this is a little technical, so I'll go through this slide kind of briefly to just give you a sense of how this works. But we currently, so this is also mostly work by my collaborators. So this is based on making a few key assumptions about the dark matter halo, namely that it's spherically symmetric. Namely, that it's spherically symmetric, has an isotropic velocity distribution, and is in equilibrium over the whole evolution process. And clearly, this system is not spherically symmetric, but this is the best we can do at the moment. And so in this case, we can fully characterize the dark matter distribution using something called the phase space distribution function, f of this energy variable. Of this energy variable E, which is a potential minus kinetic energy. So if we think about the interactions that are kicking these dark matter particles around, these are just gravitational two-body interactions. And so given some initial dark matter particle energy and a distance of the particle from the orbiting compact object, we can compute the final energy it gets scattered into. It gets scattered into. And so this phase-space distribution function f gives us a tool to kind of do this integral over initial and final energies of dark matter particles over the n-spiral and essentially compute the probability that a dark matter particle gets scattered from some initial energy to that energy plus some delta. And so this gives us a tool to evolve the dark. To evolve the dark matter's phase-phase distribution at each step of the n-spiral. And then to evolve the whole system self-consistently, we need to integrate this phase-space distribution function to recover the dark matter density profile, at which point we can apply a prescription for dynamical friction to compute the energy losses for the compact object. So, to translate this into gravitational wave emission, we are modeling the gravitational wave dynamics of the system at Newtonian order. And there's a code that my collaborators have released that implements all of these prescriptions that you can go download on GitHub. It's relatively slow. It takes several hours to a good chunk of a day to model a single. A good chunk of the day to model a single system, but it's pretty cool that you can do this at this point. And so the finding is that the dephasing for these systems, when you take into account the halo's evolution self-consistently, is smaller than was previously thought. So the dephasing in terms of number of cycles is on the order of 0.1% instead of 10% over five years. And so we'd like to understand. And so, we'd like to understand whether this amount of dephasing is detectable. So, I'd like to show you what the evolution of these systems actually looks like. And so, on the x-axis, I have the binary separation. And the light black hole or compact object is indicated by this dashed line. And the ISCO radius of the heavy black hole is Radius of the heavy black hole is here. And the red curve shows the density of slow dark matter that's moving more slowly than the circular velocity of the compact object. So this is the dark matter that exerts dynamical friction on the compact object. And so I'll play this animation, and what you're going to see is that the compact object initially the inspiral is quite slow at large radii, so it substantially disrupts the star. It substantially disrupts this dark matter halo in its vicinity. That's this trough here. And this will change as the end spiral progresses and becomes faster to the point where it doesn't have much impact on the dark matter halo. So there's this initial depletion phase. And then at some point, we And then at some point, we transition into the phase where the dark matter isn't being disrupted very much. Okay, so this is another way of looking at the same kind of statement about dephasing. So on the x-axis, I have frequency and separation up here. And on the y-axis, I'm plotting the difference in the number of cycles. The difference in the number of cycles to merger for the dark dress with the same system with no dark matter. So that's what I mean by dephasing. And this is maybe harder to see here, but this again, I've marked these two regimes where there's substantial depletion of the dark matter halo early on and negligible depletion after a certain time. Depletion after a certain point. And so, for the kinds of observational questions we want to answer, we use these insights to construct a faster approximate model of these systems that doesn't take hours to run and is suitable for statistical analysis. So, this is just to illustrate that, in fact, this dephasing looks like a broken power law approximately. Power law approximately. And we were able to actually derive where the break in the power law and the low frequency behavior of the power law are coming from. And so the break is set by comparing the time scale for the compact object to disrupt the halo with the time scale for it to lose some energy due to gravitational wave mission. So those are equal. So, those are equal at this break frequency. And then the behavior at large separations at low frequencies is set by the fact that nearly all of the dark matter at those positions gets unbound by this dynamical friction effect. And so, we use these as a jumping off point to create a slightly more complicated approximate waveform model with a few parameters that need to. With a few parameters that need to be tuned. And so that's compared with this numerical modeling in blue. The approximate one is in orange. And so this gives us a fast, physically motivated, reasonably accurate waveform model to get a sense of the observational properties of these systems. So that's what I'm going to discuss in the next part of this talk, which is based on a paper that we put out in the past. Paper that we put out in the past couple months. And this paper addresses three key observational questions about dark dresses. So the first question is whether the system's waveform, whether the signal from a dark dress is above the noise level. So this is what we call the detectability question. And then the second question we call the discoverability question, which Discoverability question, which is when can we tell that the system contains dark matter rather than just being a GR and vacuum binary? And the third question is the measurability question. Given a dark dress's signal, how well can we measure its dark matter content as well as its other properties? So to address detectability, we assume that we're doing a standard match filtering. Doing a standard match filtering template-based search, which clearly Lisa won't be doing this quite, but we'll start there. And in this case, the signal-to-noise ratio is the quantity we want to look at, or the optimal SNR, which is just the square root of the match of the signal with itself. And so, the one sort of technical point to note is that the presence of the dark matter doesn't really interact. Matter doesn't really interact affect the SNR much. So it leads to a lot of dephasing, but it still has a sort of small impact on the SNR. So we can neglect that. And in that case, there are only two quantities that come into this calculation. There's the chirp mass of the system and its distance from LISA. And so I've plotted the log base 10 of the SNR in that parameter space. That parameter space. And so, this kind of benchmark system that we're focusing on, consisting of a thousand solar mass IMBH and a 1.4 solar mass compact object, is marked here with this vertical line. And so if this system is within about 80 megaparsecs of Earth, it should be detectable with an SNR of 15, which is roughly what you would need to make a detection with LISA. Make a detection with Lisa. And I had to look this up on Wikipedia, but there are about 100,000 galaxies within that distance of Earth. So maybe this offers ample opportunities for detection. More population modeling is required. Okay, so to assess discoverability of these systems, we want to hypothesize, imagine that we have a signal from a dark dress. We have a signal from a dark dress and then see do a model comparison interpreting this as a dark dress signal versus a GR and vacuum signal. And so for this, we're going to use the Bayes factor for the data under the dark dress model and under the vacuum model. And this is just the integral over the parameters of the model of the likelihood times the prior and the prior. And the parameters for the vacuum system in this case are the chirp mass and the mass, well, not even the mass ratio, actually. And in the dark dress model, we have these additional density profile parameters of the dress, the normalization and the power law of the spike. And so two technical points that I found really interesting while working on this project are they actually a frequent Actually, a frequentist analysis using likelihood ratios is really not any easier than a Bayesian analysis here, since Wilkes' theorem doesn't apply, so it doesn't follow a chi-squared distribution. Another thing I should note is that we actually maximize the likelihood over all of the extrinsic parameters because we didn't want to spend weeks running analyses for every single system. Every single system. For the distance of the system, for that extrinsic parameter, I don't expect this will impact the Bay factor too much since this comes into the amplitude. And the amplitudes for dark dresses and vacuum systems are similar. I'm a little less sure about the other extrinsic parameters, so this would be worth following up on. But anyway, so in this plot, I've fixed the black hole masses to our bench. Black hole masses to our benchmark 101.4 solar mass values. And I've set the system at a distance that gives an SNR of 15. And so these black contours, which are a little pixelated in person, show the Bay factor of 0.1, 100, and 100,000. And this is in the space of the dark matter spike normalization. Spike normalization and slope. So this is where the base factor is 100. That corresponds to decisive evidence for dark dress. And I've plotted the spike parameter values you'd expect if the spike was formed around astrophysical IMBH with this star. With this star and around a PBH, IMBH with this circle. And so, regardless of whether you believe a Bay factor of exactly 100 means decisive evidence, you can see that the Bay factor for these two benchmark systems is huge. So we would clearly be able to distinguish that they have dark matter in them and aren't GR and vacuum binaries if they were close enough to be. We're close enough to be detectable with an SNR of 15. So, the other thing I'm showing in this plot with these colored contours is a measure of the dephasing. And here I've defined this a little differently. So, this is the number of cycles the dark dress takes to go from five years to merger to coalescence, compared with the number of cycles that best fit. Cycles the best fit vacuum binary takes. And so you can see that the dephasing quantified this way is on the order of a few cycles. And so this is just showing that if you have a few cycles of dephasing, the Bay factor is really large. So you can really pick out even if you have one or two cycles of dephasing quite easily. So there are other So, there are other ways to quantify how much, how different dark dresses look from GR and vacuum binaries. So, one way is to say, okay, let's say I search for these systems with a vacuum waveform template. How much SNR am I going to lose? And that's what I'm showing in this plot on the right for the same benchmark system. And you can see that you lose a And you can see that you lose a fairly significant percentage of SNR if you try and do the search with the wrong template. In the white regions on all these plots, the calculations actually become really unstable. So really the SNR's loss is going to fall off a cliff, sort of to the right of where I've plotted. And you can also ask: okay, if I do my analysis with the GRN back. Do my analysis with the Girin vacuum template? How much bias will I have in my measurement of the chirp mass relative to its true value? And so that's what I'm showing here in units of the measurement uncertainty of the chirp mass. So you can see that around here in this plot, you are measuring the chirp mass with a bias at the level of about 100 sigma. So, by all of the metrics that I've shown and by this Bayes factor calculation, these dark dress benchmark systems way to the right of this plot look totally different from GR and vacuum systems, which is pretty interesting. So, last, we assess the measurability of these systems by just computing the posteriors for the four parameters. This is a little This is a little grainy in person, but this is the parallel of the spike, the normalization of the spike, the chirp mass, and the log base 10 of the mass ratio. And so the key takeaways from this part of the analysis are that we can measure the spike parameters with roughly 10% errors, which is giving us a reasonably good measurement of the amount of dark matter in this system. Dark matter in this system. So we can also measure the chirp mass fairly accurately at the level of 0.001% or so. And another really cool thing to note is that even though we're modeling the GW emission at Newtonian order, we can measure the mass ratio of the system, albeit with large error bars. But this is because the feedback on Is because the feedback onto the dark matter halo depends on the mass ratio. It doesn't just depend on the chirp mass. So it helps us break the usual degeneracy. So this last posterior plot was for the astrophysical benchmark. And I just want to make one final point about the measurability by comparing the posteriors for the spike. Posteriors for the spike power law, the spike index, for the PBH benchmark scenario, and the astrophysical benchmark scenario. And the thing to note here is that these postures don't look completely the same. And so this tells us that we can distinguish to some extent the shape of the dark matter profile in the dark. Profile in the dark dress system using the waveform. And so this gives us a window into the properties of dark matter as well as the different possible origins of the intermediate mass black hole in the system. So there are a lot of open questions remaining about dark dresses, and I've listed some of them here. So there are these populations. So, there are these population questions. How many dark dresses exist? What are their orbital parameters? What are the actual initial conditions for the dark matter spike before we evolve it during the end spiral? Do they really look like these perfect power laws? There are waveform modeling questions. Can we relax some of the assumptions about symmetry, equilibrium, et cetera, et cetera, in the evolution of the spike? Evolution of the spike? And can we incorporate post-Newtonian corrections? Though I'll note that the dynamical friction effect comes in at negative PN order, so it would probably look quite different than post-Newtonian corrections, which is nice. Then there are all these analysis questions, which are more pertinent to the topic of the workshop, like how can we search for dark dresses? And I've been doing work for a different project. A for a different project on coming up with new methods for generating template banks for non-standard GPW models with this diff bank project that we could talk about if you'd like. Another question is, does the dephasing from these systems look different than other systems that can dephase M-Rays? And another question is, what might terrestrial detectors see? And so this group of people on the right of this. This group of people on the right of the slide, as well as others, are working in various permutations on trying to answer some of these questions. So with the remaining part of my talk, I just want to give you a preview of one of these, which is looking at what terrestrial detectors, namely Vance Lego, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope might be able to do for dark dresses. So this is ongoing work with Filippo Cole. And work with Felipe O'Cole, who's a postdoc at Grappa, where I previously was, Bradley Kavanaugh, and John Franco Vertone. And just a warning, it's very preliminary, so don't take any numbers too seriously. But here's this plot that I showed at the beginning of the talk of noise curves versus sort of trajectories for M-Rays, except now I've added all of these ground-based detectors. These ground-based detectors, and here's the dark dress benchmark that I've been showing that we all know and love at this point. So, one interesting point, so this is the last five years of this thing's in spiral. So, one interesting point is that multi-band searches might be useful here because we could get a good measurement of the final part of the end spiral with Einstein telescope and a good measurement of the early part of the end spiral. Measurement of the early part of the N spiral with LISA. To another question is: what can ground-based telescopes do completely by themselves without LISA? And so the EMRI or the dark dress modeling framework I've been telling you about, one of the other key assumptions is that there's a relatively significant mass ratio between the two black holes. So under our So, under our current restrictions on modeling dark dresses, we need to be thinking about very light M-rays. So, again, a little hard to see in person, but this trajectory is for a one solar mass black hole and a 10 to the minus 3 solar mass black hole. So, we're talking about light primordial M-rays here being relevant targets for ground-based detectors, given our current modeling constraints. Current modeling constraints. So we've been thinking, and Felipe Cole has in particularly been thinking about whether these kind of crazy sounding systems could actually form in any PBH formation models. And it turns out they can. So this plot is showing the mass of the heavy black hole and the merger rate of that black hole with any black hole that's 10 to the minus 2. Black hole that's 10 to the minus 2.5 times lighter. So, this is roughly the constraint we have on the mass ratio for current modeling. And so the merger rate is actually reasonably substantial for light M1 values. And putting this together with the distance horizon at which Einstein telescope could see such systems. Telescope could see such systems with an SNR of 12. Under this plausible PBH formation model, we can get an event rate of about one event every couple years at Einstein telescope. And so we started to also look into this discoverability question of how different these look from their GR and vacuum counterparts. And actually, if you look at where the sort of trajectories of these Trajectories of these systems fall. The trajectory of the kind of system I'm talking about now falls right in the middle of the Einstein telescope sensitivity band. Whereas the system I was talking about before with LISA is a little to the side. So actually that suggests the prospect should be quite good. And that's kind of borne out by the preliminary plots that we've been making. It show there is a huge amount. Show there is a huge amount of dephasing measured in a number of cycles over the last year of the N-spirals of these systems. We're talking on the order of hundreds of thousands of cycles. And also the SNR loss from using a vacuum template rather than the correct dark dress template is quite large. Again, because your system is in band right in the middle of the band for so long. Middle of the band for so long. So, this looks promising in the sense that it looks like there's a lot of hope for ground-based detectors to tell that such systems have dark matter and to measure their properties precisely, but stay tuned because this is ongoing. So, in conclusion, I've talked about how generally gravitational waves from dark dresses could be a useful new probe for the A useful new probe for the properties of dark matter, which are so far unknown. I spent a lot of the talk explaining how LISA could detect benchmark systems, these benchmark astrophysical or primordial black hole dark dresses, how it could discover that they contain substantial amounts of dark matter and look nothing like GR and vacuum binaries, and that it could measure their properties and particularly their dark matter content. Particularly, their dark matter content reasonably well. I also gave you an overview of some of the open questions and the current work that we're doing studying the prospects for ground-based detectors. And I think I also highlighted that there is a lot of work to be done on the population modeling side, with problems of waveform modeling on the level of individual systems, and with developing. Systems and with developing new searches for these at LISA and potentially ground-based detectors. So, thanks a lot for your attention. I guess we have to be very loud, but they won't hear us. I don't want to have it. I guess I you were using extreme mass ratio and sprawl waveforms? Intermediate mass ratio. Intermediate nostril issue. They don't have very good ones, do we? I guess I'm worried that it's going to be hard to until we get good waveforms. Hard to know. I totally agree. I think we're probably like years away from being able to actually search for. It's the hardest problem to do this. Yeah, I would like to understand more about this, but I don't think so. Like, even in terms of modeling the dark matter halo, we're not modeling this at the accuracy we need to be. So hopefully in the next few years. So hopefully in the next few years the like gr people who understand EMRIs and memories and the dark matter people can kind of collaborate. And would there be any, because if you could see, if you could go through merger, it'd be a beautiful signal in ground-based detectors. Do you think there's any? That's even harder problem, but anyway, is there potential there? Do you think? Yeah, so well, I think so. I don't think that dark matter is really going to matter too much. Really, going to matter too much at that point because you're just like deep in this gr making the black holes bigger, yeah, heavier hormones, I guess. Cool. By the way, are these spinning black holes? No, no, that's another assumption. Non-spinning, quasi-circular orbits. So, yeah. So, two questions. The first one is a confusion I had. You mentioned that at some point that the de-phasing is affected, but Is affected, but the SNR calculation is not affected much, but then you say that there's a huge impact on the SNR by tens of, not 10, but up to 10%, right? Okay, so what I mean, so what I mean there, the first SNR I was talking about. So let me just like, Okay, so this is the first SNR I was talking about. So here I'm in the optimal SNR. So this here, probably be closer to this thing. Okay, so in this slide, what I'm saying is: okay, what happens if we have a perfect template bank full of these dark dress templates and we go out and do a search? That's what this SNR is. That's what this SNR is. So, this is the optimal SNR. Here, what I'm talking about in this right plot is: let's say we only have vacuum binaries in our template bank and go out and do a search. How much lower will our SNR be from using the own template? And the answer is it will be at a certain point along the systematics. Exactly. So, thanks. And the second question was. The second question was: this dephasing that is happening is primarily due to this dynamical friction, right? Yeah, so what is the source of the dynamical friction? Is it the cross-section? So that means even if the base factor is low, you're not basically saying that a platform halo doesn't exist. You are saying that that is not the correct cross-sectional area, right? We're basically just saying, yeah, there could be a halo, but it's not large. Yeah, there could be a halo, but it's not large enough to measure. So, like microscopically, where the dynamical friction is coming from is that you have like a gas of dark matter particles, essentially, and a black hole passes through them, and it's going to kind of slingshot the dark matter particles around to give them a little kick. And in turn, that's going to take energy away from this thing. So, this is, I think, Shendra Sekar worked this out in the 19th. Sekar worked this out in the 1920s or something. So it's like gravitational two-body interactions. And it is possible that you could have a small Bay factor, but a lot of dark matter in the system. It just kind of depends like where the dephasing is relative to the noise curve of the detector. So. So, this dot to the left of this dot shows where most of the dephasing happens. So, imagine that this system, that this black line lay on this part of Lisa's noise curve. Then most of the dephasing would happen at a place where Lisa can't measure much anyway. So, you'd get a low base factor, but you could still have a lot of dark matter in the system. So, yeah. So, what happens? So what happens if instead of a mass ratio of a half, you have a maturation of a hundred? Yeah, so so I don't know what's going on with Zoom, but with regard to your question, we can't really model that yet. So we're not totally sure because some of the assumptions in the modeling break down. Modeling breaks down. There's this kind of gravitational sphere of influence around the compact object, and that gets pretty large compared to the size of the system with these closer to equal mass ratios. My collaborators, again, have studied what happens when we have equal mass ratios. And what happens there is that, well, again, they've studied this for very elliptical orbits. Studied this for very elliptical orbits, but what happens there is that dynamical friction kind of explodes the dark matter halo away pretty quickly. So the sort of what's happening can change a fair amount with the orbital parameters and with the mass ratio. Yeah, because Q of 100 is not too far away from what we can do. Yeah, that's true. But I don't know if we can confidently model that. What about hyperbolic encounters? Yeah, so again, that is something that I believe someone else is looking into this right now, but we haven't really studied it too carefully yet. It's kind of on the laundry list of things to model better. Yeah. Oh, yeah, sure. So, like, quick question: it's like primordial black holes are more like promising to detecting these dark dresses than the astrophysical ones. I don't know, it sort of depends. I mean, with the upcoming detectors like the Einstein. Yeah, so okay, so with ground-based detectors, you basically need the black holes to be primordial to have the right. To have the right mass ratio, at least for us to model right now. The other issue is that let's say that you let the heavier black hole in the system be about 10 solar masses. We don't really have any mechanisms by which a 10 solar mass astrophysical black hole could end up with a really dense dark matter profile because this is like completely different. Because this is like completely different than the astrophysical IMPH scenario was talking about. So, again, if you want the black hole to have this steep density profile, you would need it to be primordial. So, probably you are in this double primordial black hole situation for ground-based detectors. But again, we're not totally sure. If I understood correctly, you are modeling the evolution of the distribution function with like an energetic method, like adding the small changes in energy. How does this relate to the LaSotte equation? I don't know because I don't know what the Oh because since the dark matter is collisionless, you say that I think it should be it will be a reasonable approximation to model it with a Blassov model, a collisionless gas. And the function that describes that system is the Blassov equation. So I was wondering if you were solving that. No, but thanks for the tip. It would be good to look into. So you are you are not kind of using the kinetic theory or uh I mean so what we're doing is we are making these assumptions about spherical symmetry isotropy The dark dress being in equilibrium that let us write everything in terms of this phase space distribution function and then once you have that you can calculate by That you can calculate by integrating over the phase-space distribution the probability of a function scattering gravitationally to have a different energy than it starts out with. So, I don't know if that answers your question a little. Okay, thank you. Thanks. All right. If there are no more questions, okay, cool. Okay.
