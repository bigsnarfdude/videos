So we'll make uh we'll let her all get set up. We start tomorrow now for those on Zoom. We're going to restart momentarily. And I before the Zoom is open for chat, if you have questions come back, anyone in the room here. And we're very happy to have Harold back for the second part of his talk on a module. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Okay. So now that we kind of know what K stability is, and we know that in the canonically polarized case, it gives us KSKA stability. So we know it gives us KSPA stability. I want to talk about K-moduli for fondant varieties. So in the first half, I'll talk about the general theory. In the second half, I'll talk about how to compute it in explicit examples. And explicit examples. So, for the first half, I want to explain this theorem. It says that there is just a productive scheme that parametrizes k polystable, k of final varieties, elemental dimension, and volume. So, this theorem was really in three stages. So, the first stage was heard in dimension two of El Pato surfaces. There was one case done by Nakuchi and Lukai. And the remaining cases by the doctors Bati and Sun, which we'll talk about at the end. End and these all rely on explicitly constructing the moduli spaces using explicit geometry. Then people realize that you can use case stability and results from the proof of the Yaltian Balanson production to handle a smoothable case. So, this is going to be. So this was in the long stream adopted in 2015, 2012. And sentence that really uses differential geometry. So, in particular, the proof that this moduli space is proper essentially relies on this really deep result of Downs and Sun, who says that if you take Alanson Sun, who says that if you take some sequence of Kaler-Einstein-Fano varieties, then you can look at the underlying metric spaces and you can take a Gromov Hausdorff limit after passing to some size. Marianne, I mean, you actually said in the beginning that kind of this metric thinks what makes things work. Can you amplify on that? I mean, kind of like. I mean, the fact that you have a unique mean or something for. Yeah, exactly. So, what they show is that if you take some Gromoff-Hausgraff limit of these Kaler-Einstein-Fano varieties, then the amazing thing is you get something that's not just the metric space, but you get some singular Kaler-Einstein Fano variety. After passing to a certain general, the metric space would be if you're beyond the So, I guess beyond the funnel case, you have some collapsing phenomena. And I don't want to further complicate there. Okay, but the point is that really it relies on this deep differential geometry. And then recently, there's been algebra. Recently, there's been algebraic progress, which has resulted in the above theorem from 2017 to 2021. And this has really relied on the value of the criterion for case stability and all the previous progress that I've talked about. And one thing about this is this approach actually works for not just smooth bullfanos, but any KLT fano varieties and also. Fano varieties and also it just as easily works for a lot of final pairs. Just as easily working for TCP, or I think nothing is known about that. Well, all of this relies on minimal model program. So you could maybe ask if it works for surfaces in characteristic P greater than seven or P greater than five, where the minimal model program is built. Model program is built. But I don't think people have explored this. Still, the singularities are kind of more complicated to deal with in that setting. You need the minimum model program in one higher direction? Yeah. Or yeah, sorry, I said it wrong. Yeah, you need it for three folds. Okay. So let me talk about kind of the steps that go into this and And essentially, I'm going to be talking a lot about stats in this talk. And the reason is that if you look at K-semi-stable final varieties, they're going to have non-discrete automorphism group, and they're going to emit degenerations sometimes from K-semi-stable to K-stable objects. So you're not going to get a Demon Mumford stack, and hence your moduli space is going to look very different from the stack. And that's quite different from the KSPA set. So first, I look at this stack where I have K semi-stable over here rather than K-poly stable. And the way it's defined is I model it on the KSBA setting. I look at plastic projective morphisms X to S, so it's the first the fibers are case I'm unstable. Are the case unstable kltd modulus or dimensional n volume v for all s and s and the second is i impose this polar condition so this means that the reflexive powers of the canonical bundle commute with base change sorry this satisfies the polar condition Which means that these reflexive powers move with base structure. You could ever think of these as really what they should be named stats. Well, in a paper, in a paper I'm working on with many people, Dori has convinced me that I should think about it this way. And I would have been thinking of this for a while. Okay, so this is going to be our stack of K-semi-stable final variables. It's that this reflexive power of the relative canonical commutes with arbitrary phase change. But if S is normal, this just means that the relative canonical divisor is Q Cartier, which is easier to understand. Just easier to understand. But these are also known to some people as Kublernstein deformations. Or if I look at deformations that satisfy this property. Okay, so now that we have a stack, the next step is to look at or to prove some balance for links. So the boundedness from the C-value points of the stack was first shown by Chen Jiang using Virkar's BNB machinery. And then there's a different proof of this due to Xu Dong in 2020, but maybe it should be corrected, which relies on work. Which relies on work of Higgin-McKerman and Schumann. So, one interesting thing is in the second approach that I mentioned, the steps is they show some bound on the index. So, if I have some stable FAMA variety of dimension n and volume v, then if I look at a closed point, I can look at the Cartier index of Kx. And it turns out it's bound by the bone. This is m by the volume by n plus one that n over the volume or anything. This is just b. So this is showing that capability imposes some conditions on singularities, which is going to be useful when we want to do excluded calibrations. Next step is that case stability is in open condition in families that are. In families of varieties, this was done joint work with Lu and Shui independently in 2019. And using these two statements, note that this is a part of the stack. The idea is you write this as a quotient stack of some locus in the Hilbert scheme, and you use the openness to show that it's some locally closed set of the Hilbert scheme. Can you bomb about what they really do are having the mean the test configuration so the or if you like down the special test configuration so it turns out I guess it depends what you're asking so if you just want to look at all of the special test configurations of P2 it was showed in this paper Lu Shu and Zhang that the set of degenerations is unbounded so you can get all of those degenerations that I was writing at the beginning of the first column Writing at the beginning of the first talk. But if you want to, you can actually down the optimally data destabilizations of unstable objects. Oh, well, I understand that. Oh, okay. But you can talk afterwards. Okay. So next kind of step historically is looking at the uniqueness of the generic HRs. Of degenerate L C So this was related to the pathology that I mentioned at the beginning of the first talk, which is not going to show up here. So the first step is done by redoing true and then the next is done with Chenye and Chenye 18. 2018. And this first step says that any K-semi-stable KFT funnel emits uniquely determined regeneration to the K-Pug stable KLT pod via some test integration. You should think about this. You should think about this as what happens when you look at moduli vector bundles. Using the Jordan-Holder filtration, you can generate a semi-stable vector bundle to a polystable vector bundle, meaning a direct sum of stable vector bubbles. And this is the analog. And one thing also to note is that if you're K-poly stable to begin with, or K-stable, then of course this generation is just a trivial one. And the second statement. The second statement is that if I have two families ALT funogrides with some exomorphism from the spethyl fiber, then I impose that this two-star. That this two spectral categories are a poly stable, and this implies that they're actually at least money. So if you look at tapoly stable objects, taking limits are going to be unique. Is the goal here to try and get some sort of separatedness for the core space? Yeah, so the idea is: I guess I'm doing how this was done historically. It was done historically, but the idea is this is saying that if a course space exists, then it's going to be separated. And it can parameterize these things. Yeah, exactly. So what kind of staple answers can you get on these guys? Yeah, so this is a great question. So let me come back to it at the next point because we're going to construct a model at this point and complain if I don't want to come back to it first. Come back to this first. Okay, so now next step that was done is to construct this moduli space. So there exists some separated, this new one has not a coarse moduli space, but a good moduli space. It's going to be a map from our hardened stack to some algebraic space. And this was done Albert Meissner. And link two of 2019. And it also used, I guess, the results of step three and some enhancements of them as well. Maybe I'll abbreviate to the same space, some of the general results of Albert, Halpen, Meister, and trainings. So let me explain what this means over here. So this notion, now let me. Now, the good moduli space is due to Derek Halbert. And what it is, it's a map from a part of the static to an algebraic space. And the definition is really simple, but so simple it's almost unenlightened. So, what if the requirements? So, what the requirement is, is that this map is quasi-compact. Push forward is exact on quasi-coherent sheaves, and the push-borne of the structure sheaf upstairs is the structure sheet downstairs. So if you haven't seen that before, that's not going to help you. But let me tell you some of the properties of these or that give you some simple examples. So the first example is if I take G to be some reductive acting on some reductive variety linearly, then I can look at the map from the stack quotient, the semi-staple locus to the GIP quotient. And this is going to be quintessential example of a natural aspect. Of naturalized space. And similarly, if G is reductive and it acts on some affine variety, then that from the stack quotient to the spec of the random variance, it's again the modulus space. And under some mild conditions, And under some mild conditions that will be true in our setting, good modeling spaces are going to locally be of the score. First example is infinitely branded. Yeah, of course. So some key properties are first, this is going to be initial. Among maps to algebraic spaces, that's one we want. And then, second, I can look at when true points in my stack get identified. T value. These are going to give us. These are going to give time if their closures in the stack intersect. This is going to be equivalent saying that I take these two k-semi-stable funnel varieties and I look at their key polystable degenerations that exist by the work of Yu Mang and Chu and they're the same. So one way that this is yeah. I'm sorry. So if the finite generation of the invariant ring is Generation of the invariant ring is guaranteed, then does the reductivity actually matter? I think it does actually, but let me. What's the question again? The question is, except the finite generation issue, the reductivity of the algebraic group, does it matter or not? Yeah, there's no adequate modular space, I guess. Good model space requires. I mean, one of the things that come out is that the polystable points have I think Andrea was pointing out because I think it follows from the definition that I asked. But definitely I said very quickly. Sorry, so I mean that there exists a test configuration degenerating K poly stable fun over I Kelt Y. Okay, maybe to answer the question from earlier is that Waitlist is Is that the way this is proven or constructed is using this theory of Albert, Halper, and Leisner, and Heimloff that gives us some criterion for when a stack emits a good modulized space. And verifying this criterion essentially relied on the birational geometry arguments in the previous step. And I should say, if you want to see how this is constructed explicitly, locally, or it is a tau locally constructed as these affine GIT quotients by reductive groups. GIT quotients by reductive groups. And a key consequence of this whole theory is that K-polystagal final varieties, which are the closed points in your stack, all have reductive automorphism. So hopefully that's the answer. Is that economy? Your auto variety and your automotive group is reduction. Your automorphism group is reductive. Does that imply your stable? No. So there are even going to be things that are K semi-stable or K unstable that have discrete logomorphism. So that gives you counter examples. But I think originally maybe people thought that was the only obstruction to K stability or to a KLRI standometric. Okay. The next step, and once we have this module S space, the properness of the module Space, which was achieved in this super of Lushu and Jong in 2021 and And I just want to mention that this point is very hard. In some sense, in the smoothable case using complex geometry, this was kind of the hardest step. And this step over here relied on the theory of the existence of optimal destabilizations and showing that when you're unstable, this invariant, the female of A over S is always a minimum function, Lori asked about. And then the last step is the projectivity of modulus space, which was achieved in this same paper over here by kind of filling in some important gap in the literature that K stability, poly stability is equivalent to some other notion, as well as a paper I've shooted. As well as a paper of Xuanzang, and then using the approach of petrochemology. So, the way this is done is that the finance natural Y model on the modulus base family of K S MI stable final varieties. K some stable final varieties, and then I wanted to find some actual line bundle on the base. So you push forward the anti-canonical, look at its powers, as people often do, and then get some commutes and monkey expansion. And then you get this expansion over here where these anions in this setting are going to be QY models. And this CMY model is the dual of the leading term. So the push note is a vector panel and Pushboard is effective now, and oh, sorry, I should be taking the different thank you. What's this thing on the right? Sorry, this tensor product. So the point is you have some analog of the Hilbert polynomial, where the terms in the Hilbert polynomial are going to be Y bundles, or in this setting, a QY bundles. But here, here you take sufficiently be deep tools. Yeah, so maybe I should take. Yeah, so maybe I should take. Yeah, so for m is sufficiently large. And then it's independent of the m, this thing okay. Line button of lambda is independent of the m you show. So when m is sufficiently enlarged, there exists some uniquely determined m on s, such that you have this formula for all m. Okay, and then I get to the theorem. So it turns out this line bundle on the base. Now this is some line bundle on the stack. And this sends some line bundle or QR bundle on the modernized space. What is the answer? Channel Mumford. So this was originally introduced by Paul and Kien, actually. Pollen can't actually. So then the theorem is that this line bundle is ample, hence your mind loss is projective. So when you say descend, it means that ramp is the blue button as? Yeah, so everything here really needs to be a QM bundle. So up to after replacing these things with a high enough power, WAM does. Enough power when does the pullback go to capital L okay, and then maybe one interesting thing to note is that this CMY bundle is defined in a much more general setting for polarized families of varieties, and the CMY bundle is also ample on the KSBA moduli space by result of Patroc Faldean shoe. So this is exact analogs over here. Then, now that we have this modulized space, I just want to make a few couple comments about the Mipple structure. In dimension two, it follows from some deformation through results of hacking program that the stack is smooth and in moduli space. In moduli space, which is going to be locally some affine GIT quotient, it's going to be normal. But in general, you just go up one higher dimension, this can be non-speed with non-registers. This was observed by This was very smoothness. Yeah, so the point is, if you look at smooth file varieties, they're going to have uninstructed deformations. But then the point is that if you look at the closure of the smooth locus of your moduli space or moduli stack, you're going to have. Space or moduli stack, you're going to have some singular funnels where you get these singularities of QR. But I mean, or like they were looking at torque examples because I mean we have nothing anyway, but this example it's not possible. There is one research which has a chorus and chronicle similarities and lies at intersection of the three components of CIE. Thanks. Okay, so now that we have this okay, I want to talk about some explicit examples. So let's discuss these results that we've got because platforms in the sum that handled the El Paso surface case. But of course, if we're looking at some objects, we found the P2, P1. And well about cheat two, add up to eight general points. Okay. So, one thing to note is if we want to handle these examples, the number of these cases. A number of these cases means no moduli, it's called these of these files. So we really need those remaining cases, and that we should be said at the beginning of the talk, not a semi-stable cases, just keep through at one point, and at least the interesting cases are degree one through four. So let's just talk about what these are geometrically. So in degree four, we have the intersection of the two contracts. In the Q4. Then in the Q3, have a qubit surface. And then in the remaining cases, we have two button covers and keep one view on a sexet approach. Of sets that occur. Okay, so in all of these cases, we've been we have natural moduli spaces that come up come out of GFT. And it turned out in the first two cases, we have these K moduli space, it's the same as G I T. In these last two cases, we'll get something more interesting. More interesting. Okay, so let me explain maybe what these or what happens in these two cases. So let's just introduce some ideas in my Right, an A moduli spec of degree two Del Pazzo surfaces, note this way, or sorry, degree three Del Pazzo surfaces. And what I mean by this is I mean the connected component of the locus parameterizing the smooth ones in the dimension two, degree three k-modulized that. Then I have post-party modulized space. Space. And then for GIT, look at this projective space frames cubics. And I can look at HOSP and look at the semi-stable locus module at EGL. I'll jump this by U3U. You have TG and 4. Sorry. Yeah. Okay. And then so you got who is three. Oh. Oh, yes, yes, of course. Of course, my hand is getting uh kind of tired right now. Okay, so then I can look at the GA information as well. Okay, so let me explain how you show that the K-modulized space and stack are the same as the UFT. There's going to be that case to the East is going to be that case stability imposes some non-trivial conditions on the singularities. So the first step is that in general smooth cubic is case somewhat stable. So this can be done by looking at the Fermont cubic and Cubic, and which can be shown to be KSMI steel very easily, and then looking at the using the openness of KSMI stability. Also, in this case, it's not too hard to show using modern technology that all smooth cubics are going to be K-Semi scale. But this is true, I mean dimensional to or yeah, so I guess this approach, this weaker approach works in the higher dimensions of spot so if the general cubic is here. The general cubic is case semi-stable. Yeah, so it turns out all the fauna hypersurfaces are all K-semi-stable using some equivariant oxygen variant computation. And then you can use openness of K-semi-stability. Okay, so using this, we get some rational map from our K moduli stack to the GMT stack. GMT stack. So next step is where the most interesting work comes from. So let's say we have some Q semi-stable final variety in our stack. Then X is a qubit surface. So the key idea in this is to bound the singularities. And then, once we do that, to show it has to be minus kx has to give us an embedding of p3. So what we do is make a singular point to use this inner quality u chen lu says that if I look at the singular Look at this singular point, and I know that I'm KLT. So, in dimension two, this just means that I'm some quotient singular. So, what it turns out is you can bound the order of this group using the volume of P2 and the volume of X. So you have this down by three. You have this bound by three, so you know that you have some cyclic quotient singularity. So, this is telling you either you have some smooth point or you have G is OE2 or it's really the only point. Yeah. And if you look at the list of the smooth wall quotient singularities, then you don't get this example by what Julie wrote on the board. Example by what Julie wrote on the board at the beginning of the day. Okay, so the amazing thing is, then you know that you're smooth or you're a1 or a2 singularity, and hence you're actually going to be more. So you get that reference and And this can be used to argue that the anti-canonical divisor gives you an embedded in P3 as a human surface. Main step three is to relate GIT stability and K-stability for cubic surfaces. So if you take one of these cubic surfaces, So if you take one of these cubic surfaces, then x being semi-stable or polystable, you find is that your GIT is semi-stable, or sorry, GIT semi-stable or polystable. And the idea is to argue that if you take some GIT weight, and this is up to And this is up to some constant multiple that I've been talking in here of how I use the generation. So now, if you combine these tools, the simplest. Essentially, one, two, three is telling you that you get some injected map from your k-modulized stack to your GFP stack. This is going to induce a map of good moduli spaces. Okay, and now the key point that this. Point that this has to be suggestive by the fact that these are both proper. And then, since it sends polystable or k polystable points to GIT polystable points, this is telling you that it sends closed points here to closed points there. So it's actually also objective if you look at the map of good modulized spaces. Hence, you get that they're isomorphic. So, the stats could be different, but the good moduli spaces are isomorphic? So, at the end of the day, the stacks are going to be the same. The AT here doesn't quite get there, does it? I think you have to argue a little bit more. So, I guess you could try, or you could argue that once you know this statement over here, or sorry. Statement over here, or sorry, once you know that every case in my stable final in this stack is, or every point of the stack is a cubic hypersurface, then you could write the stack as some quotient of the parameter space of cubics modulo GGL4. I guess isn't the issue as whether all the automorphisms of the certain graph are induced by automorphisms from Yeah, I think that's going to be automatic here because potentially canonical embedding. Exactly. Okay, but I mean, that was actually my question. I mean, kind of in this example, the punchline is that all of them are complex surfaces. Can you conclude the general ones, you know, that you have this? That this case stable stuff that all things embedded in its project is space, or that was not, I mean, the polystable ones. So not in the qubit case, just in general. Yeah, in general, there exists a bit projective space that. Well, you know you have boundedness of K semi-stable phonics. So the answer is yes, but it's hard to say what that integer means. Yeah, integer means multiple of minus kx here. Does that mean that the case in my stable moduli is like some GIT quotient for an appropriate model or something? So is this true that any projective good moduli space is always some VIT co-filter that you that you have you have these sections of line bundles that you can use there's always a There's always a since you're more or less basically bounded, you have a you have some Gilbert scheme that characterizes everything that you have in mind. So the solid thing is that the CM line model, the CM line model is not ample on the Hilbert scheme, or is not positive on the Hilbert scheme. So it's not the same as GIT for that Hilbert scheme. Question is whether the points are semi-stable or yeah. Can you simplify this project? Yeah, so the key difficulty is step two. So and it proves that all GIT police take a look. I'm not sure how to do that. So it sounds hard because the point is that the generation that shows up in GIT gives you a test configuration. But there are lots of test configurations that aren't things that show up in the GIT, the generation that's hypersurfaces. Keep the generation as hypersurfaces. If you know properness, if you know space or all of them, okay, policy. I guess I don't know how to do this. So, what I should mention is that for cubic threefolds and fourfolds, this whole approach was carried out by Liu Chi Chu and Lu, and essentially the key. And Lu, essentially, the key step of bounding the singularities uses this inequality using the in terms of the volume and Chi Li's normalized volume function. And that is used to down the singularities. And that's a state of art without. Yeah, so that's, I guess, what's known. I talked about this about. Okay, so maybe I'll just mention that I guess the I guess the degree two case is more interesting. You start with a GIT quotient, and you get this kind of bad locus that doesn't parameterize KLC final varieties, and you blow it up, and then you get your K-modulized fix. But since I'm running out of time, I'll stop there. Professor whose question is about if the NGS place is P3 and you consider QP surface, then you can change it P3 to be general regenerative and consider a linear system, anti-linear system. And you ask whether steering has to get, right? Yes, I know. I mean, I was asking for instance. I mean, I was asking, for instance, in the decrease of case, I mean, it might be possible that it's pre-embedded that pets was for something. Did anyone say that? I mean, like GIT for, I mean, I know the story. What you said is true, that's not a GIT, but only kind of like the first instance of GIT. You're saying is it a GIT quotient a more interesting way? It could be possible, but I don't know offhand. This is possible. There should be a theorem that says any of these things is so the internet. So one thing to note is that, like, I guess it depends how you're doing the GIT, but maybe you want to do like child stability where you embed your file in some Embed your file in some projected space using some high multiple of minus kx. And we know in the KSBA case, KSBA stability is not the same as Chow's for a higher enough embedding. It's expected that you could prove an analog of this in the final setting, but it's a little bit more complicated to verify the statement here. Could you say something more about the degree one Del Petro surfaces, you related to double covers, but I assume there's also a story relating them to rational lifting. story relating them to rational elliptic surface moduli of rational elliptic surfaces what's the connection between between um right should the degree one should be give you a rational experience maybe kenny would have better answer than me for this question so i think dory and i were supposed to understand this maybe that well i think we we just like you said so it did need for a rough choke 11 points, 12 points on it. So, in the case of the A7, you can throw the back of them. So, Petros of 313 rationales. And so, and I think you could understand the map from this topic of the sun, but I don't know exactly what the relationship is. Something really explicit, like it's a hybrid surface in the space of, you know, the projective space of 12 points on P1, right? Of 12 points on P1, right? Compactification of that, but it's a compact. Okay, so it's pretty different. It's not just naively the hypersurface. But it does map to M1 GIT. I don't look like a Kiron's law. Much better balance of the singularities than the case for a modular space. Can you, I mean, can you lend us your techniques to get better bounds of your case? So I think the key way to do this is using this normalized volume of a KLT singularity, or this is an invariant due to Q. And there's some inequality on this, letting this to the volume of your fun over I. Of your fano variety. So, as you have a smaller volume fano variety, you get better bounds on those singularities, is what Yu Chen and Yu's thesis shows. And so, this is kind of the key input in a lot of these arguments, as well as some of the arguments in the Law Pairs case of Kenny, Kristen, and Yu Chen. But did anyone know that this normalized volume had higher rationality distance? Higher rational. Oh, that you mean the like, I think the conjecture you talk about. Like, I think the conjecture you're talking about is not known. Or the you're talking about like the second highest normalized volume. I think maybe it's not too surprising that we get better bounds on singularities here. So number one, everything we're looking at is KLT, which makes lane functions nicer. And then if you just think about final hypersurfaces, they're going to be smaller degrees. So the geometric complexity is just certainly going to be by nature is going to be easier than the cases that you're working on, right? Easier than the cases that you're working on, right? That's all hyper surfaces. Sometimes we should thank Carol again for very tall questions.
