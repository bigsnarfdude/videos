Thank you very much. And sorry, I couldn't make this morning, but I've been finding the conference terribly interesting. And this talk is about orgami design, in which between the greases, there are isometric mappings, like this picture, the yellow picture in the background there. And there's not, except for a few examples, there's very little of this. We couldn't find much in the literature. Much in the literature, as I say, except for some interesting examples. So, this is with Juan Liu, who really contributed a lot. And also, I'll draw on some work of Fen Feng and Paul Plushinsky as in fact right at the beginning here. So, it was our main motivation. Oops, let's see. Bang it here. Okay. Our main motivation, or one of our main motivations was an example, actually, one of Paul's examples. Examples of, and this is piecewise linear origami, but it illustrates why you might want to use piecewise isometric origami. So it's a quad mesh. Now, these angles in here are not 90 degrees. I'll tell you how you get them in a second. So it's just this picture just represents the topology, you might say, of the mesh. And here's a result about from piecewise linear origami. So if you assign these angles, they're not 90 degrees, but you assign They're not 90 degrees, but you assign them along this edge. You assign them along this edge. And then you assign a plus or minus one to each one of these nodes. Then there's an algorithm which says that you can march in from these boundaries. It's a little bit like if you're familiar with the Gorsa problem from hyperbolic partial differential equations, it gives a lot of the flavor of that. It gives a lot of the flavor of that. You give this kind of data and you march in and you figure out the crease pattern inside. Incidentally, that's a terminology maybe not everyone knows. These are called tiles and these are called creases. So then you determine the structure. The only thing that could happen is at some point you could get an angle between neighboring creases that's zero or plus or minus pi, and then you have to stop. It's pi, and then you have to stop. So that happens sometimes. But here's the point. Well, or here's a particular example. So now you can see these angles have been assigned, and these angles have been assigned. You can see the angles. You can't see the plus or minus one. That's why I'll tell you about that in a second. And if you make the angles as shown here, then the structure you get by the algorithm. You get by the algorithm I described is this structure. It's actually a periodic structure. And now, but there's the plus or minus ones. And they give rise to lots and lots of structures. So this crease pattern can be folded in many, many ways. The plus or minus ones have to do with the mountain valley assignment on the edges, if you're familiar with that. I won't try to describe it otherwise. Describe it if otherwise. But the point is, and this is just combinatorics of plus and minus one with whatever 16 by 16, is that in fact there are 65,534 ways to fold this crease pattern. Just by varying, the crease pattern is the same. You only vary plus or minus one along these two edges. And they're not the same. I mean, there are all kinds of different patterns you can. Are all kinds of different patterns you can get? And this is a symptom of something we see a lot in origami design: is that you make a design and you actually try to fold it with a piece of paper and you find many, many, many ways to fold it. It's a friend of the recreational designer, this feature. In any case, we were thinking oftentimes you want to bias the structure toward particular states. Particular states. And for that purpose, it would be useful to have elastic energy. And the easiest way, or maybe the most natural way of adding elastic energy is to allow the tiles to undergo isometric mappings. So that's the purpose of this talk, to develop that idea. Curved tile origami is seen in various places. The most prominent place are The most prominent place are designs, buildings designed by Frank Gehry. This is a really nice example: the Walt Disney Concert Hall. You see creases, you see isometric mappings. These are made of sheet metal, so they're isometric mappings. Even if you look closely, you'll notice that the thickness of this tile, or of this tile, perhaps, actually varies. Actually, it varies as you move around the tile. So, when you're adding elastic energy, of course, different tiles can have different thicknesses and different elastic moduli. Each tile can have, but more than that, each tile can have variable thickness, and you still get isometric mappings. And so, and also there's the H cube dependence of the energy on thickness, which gives you really wide range of Really wide range of elastic energy values to design for. So, okay, so the main difference between this building and my talk is in my talk, nearly everything is going to be foldable from a flat sheet, and this is not foldable from a flat sheet. I'll come back to that in a second. So, obviously, our differential geometry plays a main role. Actually, the Actually, the standard approach to differential geometry based on the Erlanger program is you should be only interested in things, objects like Gaussian curvature and things like that, that are invariant under a change of parameterization of the surface. So that's, and what that leads to, if you follow differential geometry, is it leads to an Eulerian approach. You look in the deformed configuration like this, and you develop. And you develop kinematics based on that. And nearly all of mathematical origami design, for example, the books of Robert J. Lange, are also Eulerian. So what that means is you have an origami partly folded, let's say. You look in the deformed configuration. There's some angles, there's some distances. You develop ekinematics based on those objects. We think it would be easier or more advantageous to use the Lagrangian approach. And actually, the mathematical gamma convergence arguments that have been so successful in deriving plate and shell theories are also Lagrangian and they begin from nonlinear elasticity. So that's taught us a lot about which plate and shell theories are the rigorously derivable ones and which ones are the ad hoc ones. Which ones are the ad hoc ones? And what are the scaling regimes? Now, curved tile origami is a strange animal because usually you're doing, from a mathematical point of view, usually you're doing with dealing with kind of piecewise smooth mappings. It's great for if you were doing mathematical results and you needed a test function or an upper bound, but I have no idea how you would use. How you would use this in the standard way mathematics is used in, for example, deriving plate and shell theories. And then there's a, you know, there's the celebrated Nash-Kuiper result, which has to do with rigidity. There's also a concept of physical rigidity of structures, which we know very little about, actually. So here's an example of: this is a crease pattern. A crease pattern. This is an example of curved tile origami. The creases are red and they undergo isometric mappings. This is flat, even though it looks like it's curved. It's actually flat. And now I'll show you the deformation. So this is typical. I'll describe how this is done later. And it fits together perfectly at the bottom. But here's an interesting. But here's an interesting fact: we took a structure which was very floppy, that was this structure, and we made it. If we glue that, that last crease, it's quite a rigid structure, particularly if you make it long and with these isometric mappings. So that's the evidence from making paper toys, you know. It's and the key point. It's and the key point is from a mathematical point of view, went from simply connected to non-simply connected. There was a topological change. And there's some strange things about the boundary. I mean, but anyway, one should be aware that adding holes to a structure can increase the rigidity like this, or, you know, but it's mainly people would think it would decrease the rigidity as in kirigami. But a mechanism for increasing the But a mechanism for increasing the rigidity is changing the number of holes and simple connectedness aspects. Can I ask a clarifying question on that? Yeah. So if it's not glued and you maybe try to compress the top and the bottom, I would imagine it just unfurls. Yes. Okay, so, but it's not like there are other motions which are possible if it's not glued. Well, you could take the flat state, if it's not glued. State, if it's not glued, here's the flat. Oh, you want to you want to restrict attention to just before it's being glued? Yeah, then yeah, then your example is good. Yeah, that's a good point. Here's another example, which of physical rigidity that we don't understand at all, as far as I know. It's a sheet. It's due to Tim White and his colleagues. It's a sheet. Now it's a thin sheet, so it behaves isometrically, but it also has the additional. Symmetrically, but it also has the additional feature that it's a pneumatic elastomer. So the molecules can undergo coordinated deformations, and you can even pattern the molecules. In any case, I may make a long story short. They were patterned so that when you heated up, in fact, there's a phase transformation and they undergo, become a structure like this, nine cones joined together. And if you do this, Together. And if you do this with a weight on it, you know, it's pretty amazing. It's a very rigid structure in the cone form. So you can read this, 147 times heavier than the weight of the actuator with this enormous stroke. That means the amount it lifts divided by its original thickness, something like that. And I think they attributed this to the cost of preventing the emergence of Gaussian curves. The emergence of Gaussian curvature. But I think it's, I mean, certainly must be much more to the story than that. And, you know, we have no idea about that. Okay, now let's go to the methods that we're developing. And the first thing we noticed, if you ever try to do isometric mappings of a domain, you run into the planar regions. So some examples of There, some examples of these are blue are in these blue regions here in the reference domain before the isometric mapping, and they become pieces of planes in the deformed configuration. And the point is that, you know, for a domain like this, the configurations of the planar regions can be exceedingly complicated. It's like microstructure, but not even regular microstructure. And even in a convex domain, it's pretty complicated. A convex domain, it's pretty complicated. So, of course, the planar regions don't add any elastic energy. So, the first thing we did is focus on sufficient conditions for isometric mappings between the creases that don't involve, we don't want to deal with the planar regions. And there are two theorems we developed for that. I'll say one is this one. So, here's the ref. Here's the reference crease x0 of S given in parametric form by this arc length parametrization. And then we want to find the rulings. Those are, if you're familiar with rulings, they're straight lines in the reference domain that become straight lines in the deformed configuration. That's a feature of isometric mappings. So there are some rulings here, and there's some different rulings over here. And there's some different rulings over here. So you give formulas, give the rulings in the reference domain. You make sure they're transversal. I guess I have some guidelines here. Transversality, so they're not parallel to the crease. And then you solve these simple ordinary differential equations. Theta is given, that was in the reference crease here. But you introduce an angle phi, which is your choice. Angle phi, which is your choice. And then once you solve these, the solutions are normalized and they're orthonormal, in fact. And you use this formula to define the deformed crease. There we go. There's the deformed crease. This is the deformed ruling. And the induced mapping between the induced mapping between the reference ruling, which was Ruling, which was over here, and the deformed ruling, which is given by this crease, and the t solving this differential equation is isometric mapping. So that says if you give the reference crease and the reference ruling, you get to choose this phi of s, and you get many deformed creases and their rulings. You can do many things with this with this theorem. You can do many things with this theorem. It's the Lagrangian theorem. If you can continue with the rulings, it can be global. But actually, what is even more useful is if you only give the reference ruling and the deformed, I mean, the reference crease and the deformed crease. So that's the one we use the most. So I only want to assign these two red curves. This is going to be the reference crease x0 of s. Crease x0 of s. This is the deformed crease, y0 of s. Of course, this mapping between creases has to be also isometric. And it's known that isometric mappings, of course, shorten distances. And so this always has this deformed crease always has bigger curvature than the reference crease. So that's an assumption here in the theorem. And now there's some weird thing. Well, we made it, we made it. We made these creases real analytic. It's not essential to do that, but if you don't do that, you'll end up with a theorem that's the statement of which is very, very long. And the reason is the following is if it's real analytic, there are only a finite number of not creases points where points where x double prime where y double prime is zero so um yeah um and and what you do is you take um so so imagine you know you're at one of those points there's the difficulty is that let's suppose this is satisfied and suppose the third derivative is is not zero in that case the principal normal changes The principal normal changes direction at this singular point. And that leads to all kinds of problems in stating the theorem. If the third derivative is zero and the fourth derivative is non-zero, then there's no change in the principal normal. So anyway, that's the principal normal to the curve. In fact, we're using y0 of s here. Anyway, Here, anyway, so there's some issues with these inflection points is the word I was seeing. Can I ask a question? Yeah. So the third derivative is the variation of curvature, I guess? Is it? Yeah, I mean, it's the third derivative of y0, not the third derivative of the curvature. So the first derivative is a tangent, right? Yes. Right. The second derivative is a curvature. Yeah. The third derivative means the derivative of curvature is non-zero. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Then in that case, you can write a formula for the normal to the deformed crease. That's very useful. You can write explicit formulas for the rulings in the deformed configuration. You can write explicit formulas for the rulings in the reference configuration. Everything is determined. Configuration. Everything is determined by the two creases. And there are the rulings. And the induced mapping is isometric. So, you know, maybe it's better to look at pictures than a theorem. This is what the theorem says. We're giving the reference ruling here. And there's the deformed ruling. It shortens distances. So you apply the theorem and you get the reference ruling, which I didn't picture here. And the deformed, and two. And the deformed, and two distinct deformed surfaces. And there's, and you can arrange them in basically two ways. So there are four possibilities technically, but you arrange them in two ways. So that's quite a useful, that's quite a useful theorem. And if you think about it, you can also understand Frank, even though Frank Gary buildings are not flat foldable, you can also understand them from this perspective. perspective. So here's another case. So here's the reference ruling L1. Here's the deformed rule. I mean the reference crease L1. Here's the deformed crease over here. It shortens distances. And you can make, so I could make, you know, I could make L1 goes into the screen and it meets the crease. So I just take one half of the above picture. Now I take a completely different crease. Now I take a completely different crease, L2. So, and I make sure it does curve shortening. And again, I apply the same theorem, or half of the same theorem, you want to say, to this region, the yellow region, and you get this. So that's the structure of all the origami-like structures on Ferencary buildings. Okay, so now I want to describe. So now I want to describe what we use a lot to construct more sophisticated, maybe more, we think more useful in some ways, origami. And we call it the group orbit method. Could also be called the lazy man's approach to group, to origami design. It goes like this. You take an isometry, you know, but not just affine isometry. Affine isometry. So G, and this is the usual way to write group elements for isometry groups with this Q and C. Q is an orthogonal tensor and C is a vector in R3. These group elements can act on points in R3 in the most simple way, Qx plus C. If you have two group elements, G1 and G2, that's how you do the group product. That may look a little strange if you're not used to this game, but that's simply composition. But that's simply composition of mappings where the mappings are given by this. So g1 times g2 of x is g1 of g2 of x. And the identity is that. And there's a special relation between abelian groups and compatibility that I don't completely understand, but it's clearly there. So I want So, I want to illustrate this, and we're going to use this group to construct, make origami constructions. So, I'll start with piecewise linear origami. So, I'll start with the simplest tile. That's the mirror pattern. So, I guess most people will know that if you make a parallelogram, so I'm going to make a parallelogram. You'll see why in a minute. And I'm going to take a point inside the parallelogram and join it to the corners by these dashed lines. There are the creases. There are the creases, and in between the creases, it's going to be piecewise linear origami. Now, I guess many people will also know that this is foldable if and only if the sum of opposite angles is pi. So I've arranged that. In fact, the two red lines are the lines on which x0 can sit and have the property that sum of opposite angles is pi. And though, so that's foldable. And in fact, it can be folded flat. In fact, it can be folded flat, and there's a continuous homotopy between this state and the flat state, and everything's known about that. You can write down the deformation, there's some parameters. You write down the deformation going around the X0, and then you come to the end. You come back to the beginning, and you have to impose compatibility, and it gives a relation between these parameters eta, omega, and xi. And they're listed right here. And they're listed right there. So I'm going to take one of those origamis and I'm going to partly fold it. So take the top one here. So it's partly folded. And now what I'm going to do is it was a parallelogram. So the length of this side edge, this edge or this crease, is the same as the length of this crease right here. This crease right here. And the length of this crease is the same as the length of the crease. So there must be lots of isometric mappings that take this crease to this crease. And so, yeah, there are. You can figure out what they are. And there's also, call one of them G1, and G2 takes this crease into this crease. And there's enough freedom. There were a lot of parameters on the previous slide that you can also make them commute. Also, make them commute. So that's a group. And there's a more explicit form of the G's. There's a little listing of the parameters. The details are not that important. So here's what you do with this. You start with the partly folded tile, and G1 takes this line into this line. But of course, you can apply G1 to the whole tile, and you get that. And similarly, G2. And similarly, G2 takes this line into this line, but you can apply it to the whole tile, and you get that. And then the beauty of abelian groups is G1 times G2 applied to this tile gives you, fits perfectly with the other ones. So, and of course, now you just iterate the group and the group builds the structure for you. You do some very simple calculations and the group builds the structure. Calculations and the group build structure. There's one more aspect of this. So, that structure may or may not be interesting. We don't know if we can deform it. You know, ideally, we might want this to happen. We might want enough parameters so we could actually deform it and then have it close and then get a perfect helical structure. That's something we would really, really like to have. Would really, really like to have. But if you just pick out some parameters and do this, you'll end up with a huge mess on the right. You won't end up with that. And why is that? Well, you know, if you multiply two group elements, of course, you just can move due to fact they commute, you can all move all the G1s to the left and all the G2s to the right. That's the proof it's a group. To the right, that's the proof it's a group. And so that's not a problem. But the point is, it may not be a discrete group. So, what's a discrete group? A discrete group is a group such that you act on a point in R3, and if it's not discrete, it has accumulation points. In other words, there's another point in R3 such that every neighborhood of that point contains. Every neighborhood of that point contains infinitely many points constructed from the orbit. So you go back to the drawing board and in addition to getting the, you know, identifying these free parameters, you make sure you have a discrete group and then you get structures like this. And you can make lots of origamis. These are all piecewise linear origamis, helical style. Helical style. You can make phase diagrams. Lots of fun things with helical origami done in that way. So we would like to do that also for a curved tile origami. And it goes, it's more complicated, but it goes more or less the same way. This is the case. Again, this looks like a bumpy surface, but it's flat. So keep that in mind. And here's a unit cell. And here's a unit cell. And now, to gain flexibility, we actually put a crease across that unit cell as well. And so these are curved creases. And we use that theorem to find isometric mappings in these two triangles and then make sure it's also compatible with its neighbors. Well, in fact, we use exactly the group orbit method. Exactly, the group orbit method, and that's with a two-dimensional translation group in the reference domain. You don't have to use the same group in the reference domain and the deformed group domain, but anyway, this is very similar to what I was just saying about in the piecewise linear case. And so you could say there's a translation group in the reference domain and a helical group in the deformed domain. And these are all flat-foldable. These are all flat foldable, and you get lots of nice designs. It's not hard at all to make structures, very sophisticated structures. And all of these structures are flat foldable that you see. So here's a crease pattern. This is flat. Once again, it's actually flat. And I'm going to show you the homotopy, the continuous deformation that makes it into a helical structure. So you can see there, you can see the isometric deformations between the creases and so forth. So that's a type of example from those. Of course, now you can start to play with lots of groups. For example, you could use a circle group in the deformed configuration and a one-dimensional translation group in the reference. Dimensional translation group in the reference, in the reference configuration, reference domain. Again, you use that theorem I was talking about with the creases, and you have to do some work, but only on the unit cell. And then you let the group take over, and you get structures like these. And also the one I showed earlier that deforms. So it looks like that. You could take the two. You could take the 2D translation group in the reference domain and the 2D translation group in the deformed domain, and then you can do some designs. You get structures that look like this. An example of perfect isometric folding is given here. So we feel that these things could be quite useful. And we're thinking about possibilities. We're thinking about possibilities along those lines. But we also wanted to generalize. You know, isometric isometry groups are fine, but can I ask you a question about the deploy, the fact that they're more rigid when you use curved creases, doesn't that mean it's also harder for them to deploy along the homotopy? Yeah, so yeah, what you're getting to is a very important thing with this kind of stuff is the creases have to undergo isolation. The creases have to undergo isometric mappings as well and be attached to the tiles, you know. So there are designs of creases that do that. We haven't spent any time on that, but somebody like Sergio Pellegrino would know how to do that. It's one way is you take a fairly stiff wire and you put door hinges on it. Put door hinges on it. And yeah, so being fairly stiff, the wire undergoes a deformation. The door hinges attach the tiles. You know, it's not perfect, but so there are some designs, but otherwise, we haven't crossed that bridge. That would have to be crossed if you're going to make a practical origami design of something real yet. So thanks. Does that help? Ian? Yeah, that's fine. Okay, good. We started thinking about whether we could do other groups. We look at conformal groups. At first sight, conformal groups could never work because conformal groups involve dilatations. And so isometries and dilatations are contradict each other. But if there is Each other. But if there is a way to do this, and I'll show you with elasticity scaling, very simple way. You just simply use the same dilatation in the reference domain and the deformed domain. So I'll show how that's done. And that makes use of elasticity scaling. So it's independent of material. It's something you can always do. And so if this is a tile omega, and maybe y of x, or if you want time-dependent Lagrangian description, y of x. Lagrangian description of y of x and t. And now you take the neighboring tile and you make it bigger by lambda x plus t. Maybe there's a crease between them. And for the next tile, you use elasticity scaling, use this formula. This formula preserves the deformation gradient, equilibrium, boundary conditions, I mean, you know, traction boundary condition, just stress, it preserves energy minimization. It preserves every energy minimization, so it's uh, it's sort of um, it's it's you know, it is the basic scaling of elasticity theory. So, now you have to, but you have to make a group. We're going to use a group, a conformal group. You have to figure out what you're going to use for a product. And what we use is the same kind of product as before. So, you just multiply the lambdas, the scale factors, and otherwise you use composition of mappings. Composition of mappings. Now, conformal groups always have accumulation points. And there's a concept of semi-discrete. And that means not too many accumulation points. And for these two group elements, semi-discrete is a restriction on the parameters. And in fact, if this condition is. In fact, if this condition holds and these are the two isometries, I mean, two conformal group elements that we're going to use, then in fact, there's only one accumulation point. And so all the examples I'll show you have one accumulation point. And here are some examples from piecewise linear origami. This Paul and Fan, an undergraduate at Oxford, who's now a graduate student at Oxford, Aaron Suwa. A graduate student at Oxford, Aaron Suhr, made these designs. And so the accumulation point is obviously at the apex of the cone. And here's the building block. And you can see as you go around, they change size by elasticity scaling. And one can do a lot of things with this. Again, make phase diagrams. I'm not showing. You have multistability. So there's the same crease pattern four times, giving rise to these. Giving rise to these four structures. So there's a kind of quad stability in this case. And here's a crease pattern that gives rise to these structures and so forth. So can you do this with, okay, and some of these examples, like the helical case, they can have a homotopy. You could. you you could try to do this with the curved tiles and and and in fact you can and you you you you choose something a bit more special at least that's what we've been choosing and in fact the c equals the c0 here and with the group product that i mentioned that's that's a group and um and it and you can you use that together with um an isometric mapping and you use just use elastic Just use elasticity scaling on the isometric mapping, which is uh preserves again, preserves everything, preserves that it's an isometric mapping, preserves its energy with a factor of lambda cubed, I guess, but everything is known. So here's what you get when you use conformal group in the reference domain and a two-dimensional, or really a one-dimensional, you might say, conformal. Dimensional, you might say, conformal group in the reference domain, and a three-dimensional conformal group in the deformed domain, you get structures that look like this. So, you know, these are just constructed. I mean, I have no idea why they look like sea creatures. Okay, so I'm getting near the end. I hope I'm not running over time. I guess it's a couple minutes. Ideally, there's a very nice method for calculating the energy of this drug. For calculating the energy of these structures, that's Kirchhoff's plate theory. It's geometrically exact. You can do very large rotations and get a really accurate number for the energy. I'm a aficionado of Kirchhoff's plate theory. And the interesting thing is, if you take the theorems that I presented and you write the formula for the energy of a Kirchhoff plate, normally it's a Plate, normally it's a two-dimensional integral. It's a double integral, but in fact, you can write it as a one-dimensional integral. And E, if you remember, was the reference ruling, the reference ruling, this X0 was the reference crease. N is the normal to the surface, to the deformed ruling. And so N prime and this V tilde is an explicit function. So it's very easy in some sense to calculate the energy of even using. The energy of even using Kirchhoff's theory and get the energy landscape of some structures that we've seen. We haven't done much of that, so there's nothing more for me to tell you at this point, but we're trying to make that more efficient. So I think that's the end of my story. So I'll be happy to answer questions. And otherwise, thank you very much.
