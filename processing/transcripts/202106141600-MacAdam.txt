I might be kind of repeating stuff Jeff said, especially when it comes to kind of like the category of smooth manifolds, because differential bundles are really sort of a categorical axiomatization of vector bundles, which in a sense really live in the category of smooth manifolds. So let's just, I'm going to just kind of bring up these category axioms here. Bring up these category axioms here. And I just, you know, these are the structure maps on the left. And on the right, we have the axioms, some of the axioms. So most of the things involving the canonical flip aren't really going to matter for this talk. But so the things that do matter are this sort of additive bundle structure we get. Structure: we get and that this lift map is additive in these two ways. So from p to p dot t and p to t dot p are kind of additive bundle Morsevisms. And I'm kind of just going to use a bit of two categorical notation because there's a lot of this. We also have that this diagram commutes with the lift and And we also are going to be really thinking about this sort of universality of the lift result, where there should be a zero along the bottom here. But that's, you know, the second tangent bundle is really t squared. And, you know, this talk is really going to be a lot of it's about smooth manifolds because, as I said, we're talking. Manifolds, because as I said, we're talking about vector bundles. So I think it's worth just kind of repeating some of the basic things about smooth manifolds in a very maybe hand-wavy way. But, you know, so a smooth manifold, you know, it's, I'm just, I'm not a great artist. So we just have this kind of squiggle here that I'm going to call a topological space. And, you know, we are covered. And you know, we are covered, we have a coverage by charts that are kind of locally isomorphic. So, locally isomorphic to some U in Rn, right? And then we have atlases. So, whenever these sort of charts intersect, we have these local morphisms. We have these local morphisms that kind of tell you how to move between each chart. And these maps between these like Vi or should all be Vi, these are smooth. So that's, you know, C infinity maps. And kind of in the same way, you know, a morphism between these two things is going to be something so that when we do the include, it's Something so that when we do the include it's a continuous map, and it's something when we do this local inclusion and kind of the reverse that it's a smooth map here. Okay, so this is sort of the category we're working in. And you can just kind of think it of it, you know, basically, you know, pasted together open subsets of Rn or, you know, this sort of coverage thing and kind of. And kind of an important thing, if you're really going to dig into technical details, we're going to allow different disconnected components of manifolds to have different dimensions. So if you look at a lot of books, they always kind of fix a global dimension n. And we're not going to really bother with that because then some of the results aren't strictly true. So, you know, we're just going to allow for these sort of disconnected components to be of different dimensions. And that means, you know, if you really wanted to go abstractly, you could use this kind of remark or observation that Le Viere made. And it's that the category of smooth manifolds is this idempotent splitting. And that is sort of Euclidean spaces. So open subsets. So, open subsets of Rn and just smooth morphisms between these topological spaces. And you split all of the item pones in there. So you can kind of, using some sort of tubular neighborhood theorem, kind of regard each smooth manifold as a retract and a section of one of these sets, a smooth one. So, just sort of corollary then. Sort of corollary, then the category of smooth manifolds has these limits. And this is, I think, kind of just worth pointing out, too, because the category of smooth manifolds doesn't have terribly many classes of limits. It has products, but that's it. It doesn't have pullbacks or equalizers or anything like that. So this is kind of a useful thing. Of a useful thing, and so I'm gonna have to make use of this at some point. So, I just so we're all kind of on the same page here for what I mean by the category of smooth manifolds. You can even just work with this side of potent splitting if you want. And just stepping through, so just I guess this is kind of related to a question that was in the chat. So, like, what tangent bundle? What tangent bundle do we mean for the category of smooth manifolds? Well, I mean, convenient manifolds are the one where there's a difference. But, you know, in tangent categories, it's really going to be these equivalence classes of curves, like these kinematic tangent bundles. And the difference between these two different presentations ends up being a bit of a sticking point in the theory of tangent categories sometimes. Categories sometimes. So, you know, when I look at T of M, it's these equivalence classes of curves of R going through M and so that they land at the same point and they have the same derivative. And locally, when I take like, you know, a chart, that's just going to be u cross Rn, like Jeff was saying. And similarly, And similarly, like t squared of m, these are equivalence classes of like curves, surfaces, right? Like two-dimensional kind of planes going through your space, where once again, they have the same kind of point. And I'm just going to like, you know, we're in local coordinates here, so you can just sort of use that second derivative notation from tangent categories. And then locally, you know, for this open subject. Locally, for this open subset U, like this chart, it's u cross Rn and then just Rn cross Rn. So it's kind of like, you know, if you recall what Jeff was saying about these trivializations, you know, this is, you know, the T sub 3, how that sort of happens. And so, like, in these cases, I just want to talk about the structure maps. So, right? So, P. Right? So p sends a curve to its value at zero, precomposed with zero. That's and then zero just sends a point to the constant curve at that point or its equivalence class. Addition, if you just look at it locally, it's kind of the easiest way. It's where you take the two vectors and you just add them together. Oh, and the same thing. You can see P is locally a projection and zero is locally that injection. See, you know. See, you know, not going to spend much time on it, but you can see it's just where we kind of do a twist map beforehand to the curve. And L, which is the one I really want to talk about here, L takes a gamma, and one way of doing it is precomposing with multiplication. And the other one is, I kind of made this a bit too small, but we have, you know, we engage. But we have, you know, we inject zero. So we're going to maybe write this out again. But we send uv to u zero zero v, right? And so that's what the lift kind of classically looks like. But there's another way of getting the lift. Of getting the lift. And that's using kind of what's called the Euler vector field. So you note that, so like the category, you know, the tangent bundles, it's a fibered R module, right? It's an R vector space in the slice. So you have an action by R, which is multiplication. And it's a monoid action. You know, so it, and you know, you can maybe write it. And you can maybe write it as this with the curve. And so what we want to do is the scalar thing. So what we want to do is take the derivative of the scalar action at zero. And this is what's called the Euler vector field of the monoid action. So what we do is we start off. We start off, so we have R. So remember that R is a differential object, so it doesn't just have that zero map from R to T R. We also have kind of a list. So we have zero R to T R which you would think of as sending R maps to R zero. Lambda is the Lambda is the map that sends it to the other coordinate. So it sends r to 0r. So what we can do is we're going to lambda up the r and we zero up tm to t squared of m and we use that the tangent bundle preserves projects, products, so we pull them both under t and then we do t of multiple. And then we do t of multiplication. And this ends up just agreeing with the lift. Actually, whoops, I forgot a map here. One sec. This is. So we're just going to pick it one. 1 id. So we pick out the point 1. So this is the derivative kind of at 0 of 1. And I mean, I guess a funny thing, I didn't choose the name Euler vector field. This is kind of from the literature. But it's kind of easy to see that this is not a vector field on your space. Space, uh, it's well, it's not a vector field on Tm, but that's kind of what this construction is called. Whenever you have one of these monoid actions, you can take the derivative at zero in this way. So that's that's when I think of L sort of in the category of smooth manifolds, usually the Euler vector field is going to kind of be what we think of for how that map is derived. That map is derived. And it seems a bit verbose, but it's very important because it lets you go between this action by R that you have from kind of like a normal smooth categories, smooth manifolds perspective, and the lift from the tangent bundle. So vector bundles. Vector bundles kind of generalize this notion of a fibered vector space of the tangent bundle, right? So, kind of moving on to that. So, the idea is they're generalizing this fibered vector space structure from the tangent bundle. So, if we just start with this topological space again, we're just gluing a vector space to each point in a sort of coherent way. Of coherent way. So, what that ends up meaning is that it actually ends up being a morphism between two spaces where the fiber is always some vector space we'll call Rn. And so, kind of that says kind of like, you know, what is a vector bundle? It is an R module in the category of smooth manifolds over M. The category of smooth manifolds over M. So we have a projection, which is that map going down Q, and we have a zero map, xi, going up to E. So E is our total space and M is our base space. We have an addition map from E sub 2. So kind of following the tangent bundle example, the idea is to stick with calling Calling like E sub 2 for these fiber products. Maybe I'll just write that down here. So E sub 2 is this fiber product over Q. And we have this scalar action by the real numbers. And so this is a fibrid R module. And so this part up here at the beginning is just, you know, this isn't essentially algebra. You know, this isn't an essentially algebraic theory. So you would think you can talk about these things quite easily. But you actually have a bit of a sticking point because you're also requiring that this Q map is locally trivial. And so that means, like, so over each point M, there's a neighborhood that lets you kind of regard it as a fiber product like this. So, you know, it's isomorphic. It's isomorphic to U cross Rn. So the tangent bundle is an example of that. And so is just a trivial bundle, literally, which is where we just take the product of m and a vector space v. And that's like exactly a trivial bundle. So And just to not, once again, we're going to allow for components of vector bundles to have different components, different disconnected components to have different dimensions, right? And this is what a topologist might call a disjoint union of vector bundles. And just from this perspective, it doesn't really make too much sense to distinguish. So this is just what we're going to stick with. So, this is just what we're going to stick with. So, yes, so this is kind of like what we are working with. So the idea now is I just, I kind of want to think about, like, I describe how this structure has been sort of generalized. And there's kind of two different approaches I want to talk about. And the And the first one is going to be, well, Cocken and Crutwell's differential bundles, which is really kind of what this talk is about. But I also, there's a bit of a parallel line of research due to Janice Krabowski that catches something really important. And when you kind of take this into account, when you look at differential bundles, you can see that things can really be simplified. You can see that things can really be simplified. So, I want to start with the definition of a differential bundle. So, and the kind of the intuition, if I were to like look, you know, looking at the original paper on differential bundles by Jeff and Robin, you know, if you look at a vector bundle being like a vector space in that slice category of smooth manifolds. Slice category of smooth manifolds. Well, in tangent categories, that sort of becomes this sentence that a differential bundle should in some sense be a differential object in the slice category. So, kind of starting with this definition, like starting with this idea: well, what do we have? So, what would a differential object be in the slice category? In the slice category. And there's kind of something really interesting you can do. And this is that you can sort of put a tangent structure on a slice category, in a tangent category. So if I just, you know, in the category of smooth manifolds, for example, I can look at this class of maps called submersions. And you know, without even worrying about the idea of like what a smooth submersion is, but just kind of being something that just, you know, it's saying that f m to n, oh, I used q there. I'm going to say such that I'm going to say for every For every M in M T sub M of Q T sub M of M to T sub Q of M of N is a surjective linear map. Linear map. But what this property ends up giving you is that, well, the class of submersions are, well, they're a class of maps that are, you know, the pullback along a submersion always exists and it's preserved by the tangent bundle. This pullback. And This pullback and that pullback is itself a submersion. So when I look at the category of submersions over R, over a manifold M, I can put a tangent bundle on it. And what this tangent bundle does is, well, I start with a Q, a submersion from Q to M, and I take the tangent, you know, I take, apply the tangent functor to it. And then I pull back along. And then I pull back along the zero map, injecting into Tm. And this is what I call T sub m of Q and T sub M of the big space. And if I were going to ask for a differential object, I would have that T sub m of Q is equivalent to the fiber product of Q along Q. And I end up with, well, a With, well, a diagram that looks an awful lot like universality of the vertical lift. And this kind of lines up with what Jeff was saying about how this universality diagram axiom happens. It's kind of for the tangent bundle. So we have, so if it's So we have, so if it's q sub 2, we can kind of decompose it into being this, this sum mu. So now kind of working backwards from this, what do we get? Well, we have a triple. And so we have this triple, it's an additive bundle, and we also And we also have this lift map, L. And this lift map, we kind of require this axiom that t of L, T dot L of L is equal, T dot lambda of lambda is L of lambda. So this is kind of an important axiom. And then, well, we ask that just like L, this lambda is playing the role of the lift from the tangent. The lift from the tangent bundle. We ask that lambda be additive in the same way. So lambda 0 is from q to tq and lambda psi is additive from q to p. And we also ask that this mu map be universal, which I gave it over here kind of already. The map itself isn't so hugely important. And we call that, we say that a linear map is a kind of a bundle morphism that preserves the lift. And it actually, as a result, if you preserve the lift, you preserve addition, you preserve the projection, and you preserve the zero, the zero section as well. The zero section as well. And so this ends up, so it's kind of amazing. So you can kind of actually throw away everything, but you can throw away the base map, and you can just talk about the total map here. And you can prove that there is a functor from the category of vector bundles in the category of smooth manifolds to the category of differential bundles in smooth manifolds. Bundles in smooth manifolds. This was in Jeff and Robin's paper. And you can show that this is a fully faithful functor. And what you do is you take the additive bundle structure from your vector bundle, and then you, for the lift, you do this Euler vector field construction to the scalar action of R on E. And there's kind of this amazing fact that, like, Of this amazing fact that, like, you know, you're a vector bundle homomorphism if and only if you preserve the Euler vector field. And so this is kind of one way of doing it. And yeah, so this, and but there's another way. And the other way is still in the category of smooth manifolds. But there's this observation you can make. You can make kind of in the same vein as that comment about the preserving the vertical lift. And that's if, yeah, so that's if you preserve, you know, you have a linear vector bundle morphism, if and only if the morphism is homogeneous. And that means it preserves the scalar action by R. Action by R. Right? And using that fact, you have this full and faithful embedding from vector bundles into the category of just modules of this monoid here, where we take R plus and just Plus, and just multiplication of r and one. So, whenever you kind of, I'm just going to call that a module, like you would, you know. So, it's a monoid action, and it's a multiplicative monoid action. And there's also, you know, this really, you know, when you notice, like when you do it this way, well, for every kind of module by R like this, we have an item potent on the total space, right? The total space, right? Because we've thrown away the base space now. And we're now looking at just the total space and the scalar action. And then, yeah, so I multiply by zero then. And so what you can kind of think of is it's sort of like, you know, maybe there's for each point, you have sort of like a little range, but then. Range, but then when you multiply by zero, it kind of pulls everything together into a single point like that. And it just kind of collected like that. Probably not a very accurate drawing. But this is an item potent. And when you split it, well, you get a bundle that is at least diffeomorphic to the original base space of the kind of the bundle you started with. And so it. And so it kind of splits, as I say here, as the Xi and Q from the vector bundle. Oh, I have an act. I'm going to get to that in a minute, Martin, actually. So Martin asked, are there examples of differential bundles in S-Man that aren't in the essential image? So I'll get to that in a minute. There aren't any, is the spoiler. So, and then so Grabowski kind of showed that there was this equivalence of categories between vector bundles and what you would call like a regular multiplicative action by R plus. And I'm not going to talk about the regular condition because it's a very geometric sentence and it uses. Sentence and it uses words that I don't quite understand. So I don't want to say it wrong and make a bit of a snafu. But what I can point out is that the regularity condition is once again related to the Euler vector field construction. And it's that and so we have that the regularity condition is kind of about this Euler vector field. Euler vector field, and lambda, and the lambda constructed from the essential image of that functor from vector bundles to differential bundles is the Euler vector field. It seems like this is maybe some evidence that you want to start looking at just these Euler vector fields or whatever one of these things is. So, this is kind of maybe where kind of this. Kind of this sort of joint work. It started as joint work, you know, really helpful conversations with Matthew Burke. It's sort of kind of where we started looking talking about this, and I kind of worked it out parts of it. It was starting from that, like just axiomatizing this structure. So I just So I just, so like, you know, recall like from the axioms of a tangent category that this T and the lift, it's what you might call a weak co-monad. So there's no unit, but we have a co-associative co-multiplication. So I think it's pretty reasonable. I haven't seen so much in the literature on this. You know, you might have a point. You know, you might have a pointed endofunctor and talk about co-algebras. Well, I have an endofunctor with a co-multiplication. So I'm going to talk about co-algebras of that. And I'm going to call them lifts. And it's going to be a lambda e to t of e, and so that l of lambda is equal to t dot l, t dot lambda of lambda. So, and just like And just like with the action by R plus, you have the same sort of item potent on this category. And it comes from taking P of lambda, so post-composing it with lambda. And it actually ends up being just, you know, for any tangent category, this is a natural eidempotent on the category of these lifts. These lifts. And then you note that if you have, oh, so if I have that this natural, that this item potent splits, if I just choose any splitting, I get a triple. And it's a Q e to M, a Xi, and a Lambda. And it satisfies all of the coherences of Q, Xi, and Lambda that a differential bundle would satisfy. And that just is. And that just means like kind of preserving the lifts or preserving the projection. And, you know, there's a whole bunch of things that tumble out of that. So this is sort of, so when I, you can kind of pull these three things together, and I just call a pre-differential bundle a lift with a chosen. With a chose, one of these, a triple where it's a q, xi, and lambda, where lambda is a lift and q and xi are a splitting. And I just give the data q e to m here just because that tells you the names of the two objects that you're talking about. And so, one kind of observation is that Is that there's this universal property from Roziski's original paper on tangent bundles. And it's kind of what they use in synthetic differential geometry when you have negatives. And it's this pullback. And I'm just going to call it maybe like the Rosiski universal property. And I'll call the other one like the cocket cartwell. But it actually, when you just have this data, because When you just have this data, because you don't have addition, it doesn't, you can't really say that original universality condition, like the cockett-kretwell one. But you can still talk about this pullback due to Roziski, just asking for this to be a, you know, and actually, when you have an addition, this pullback is sufficient to give you a differential bundle when you have subtraction. So, kind of. So, kind of instead of looking, you know, adding an additive bundle structure, you know, the first step will just be kind of, well, let's just look at this universal property. Let's look at pre-differential bundles with universal properties. So I'm going to start with this pullback and kind of note that you can rewrite it as a double equalizer. And so I've got on the top right, I have these two projections, tq and p, and it just translates over. But then I've got a lot of extra maps here. So I have zero of p of t dot q and xi of pi of p. So what I do, I can do is I just post-compose by some sections here. And this will kind of keep this diagram, like if it's an equalizer diagram. Like, if it's an equalizer diagram, it will kind of remain an equalizer diagram, or the equalizer of that kind of double fork I'm drawing is unchanged. And then I'm going to remember that I had an E. Let's just call it here lift C. I called this idempotent E. And because T of And because t of e is t of a differential bundle, I kind of have two of them now. So I have t dot e because that's what t xi of tq is. And then over here, I have zero, p0. So I have t dot e, and then I have both of the item pones here. These commute just by whiskering. And then on the other one, I have e dot e. And because everything incites And because everything incites an item potent, I can just pull it down into this equalizer. And this ends up just being like a really simple little way of talking about differential bundles. We're going to see in a bit. This is just the whole thing. So the first thing is there's a very kind of easy little proof now. Let's suppose that I have the Rosiski universal property for a different. For a differential bundle, a pre-differential bundle, then I have an addition map. And so I just take t sub 2 of e, and I just have this, you know, t sub 2 dot e, and I'm just going to call it e sub 2 dot e, just pairing here. So I just get an addition on my bundle and And we end up this kind of satisfies all of the coherences now with lambda that we wanted from an additive bundle. So now for when we want to talk about a differential bundle, there's a new kind of characterization. Well, we have a pre-differential bundle, one of these triples. These triples, and we have that this Rosiski universality condition holds. And then we ask that t pullbacks of q exist. So pullback powers of q exist, I mean to say, and are preserved by t. And then, you know, we have that cockett and crow universal condition. So we're getting closer now to just, you know, this is just sort of a category of basically a Of basically equivalent to a subcategory of sort of these lifts. And then, just a little corollary then is if we have this universal property in smooth manifolds, what this does is it forces a monoid action on E because of just pulling back something that has an action by a monoid. Action by a monoid, and these morphisms both preserve the monoid action, then this E will have a kind of a pulled back or an equalizer monoid action. And we can kind of note, actually, that it forces lambda to be the Euler vector field of that multiplication. So actually, So, actually, all we need to do to sort of prove that differential bundles in smooth manifolds are vector bundles, we just need to show that this induced Q that we have is locally trivial. And then we kind of get that the essential image of that functor from vector bundles into differential bundles is actually an isomorphism of categories. And so, this is actually kind of a different proof than what I had published. So, I don't, this is, it's very possible that the proof is done at this point. I don't think so. So, then there's this notion kind of picking out. So, this is a universality condition that you always have on a differential bundle when your tangent category has no. Your tangent category has negatives. And it's that I have this new map, and it's kind of a different kind of horizontal lift. It's sort of from the other side. And this always holds in a tangent category with negatives. But in case we don't, you might call this a strong differential bundle because it has this extra universality property. Property. And so note that because we are kind of talking about the fiber over Q, over xi in E, and it's over P, instead of having a copy of E and E, we have a copy of T M and E. So this is maybe why it doesn't come up as often in the differential geometry literature, because I've never seen this. Seen this pullback mentioned. And then we can note that the proof kind of follows in a very easy way because we pull back this P and we have that this thing in the pullback, this Q to the E maybe, because this is a vector bundle. That implies That implies that this guy is a vector bundle with the kind of lift that we chose and the kind of monoid action that comes along with it, but then it's also vocally trivial. And then just because this is a fibered byproduct of differential objects, this splits an item potent in the category of differential bundles over M, and we have item potent splittings. So this item potent splittings so this ends up just being um uh this just ends up being uh locally trivial um so then we get as a theorem uh the differential bundles in the category smooth manifolds are exactly vector bundles um but i i think it's worth pointing out there's a bit of a loose thread here Bit of a loose thread here, and that's that there were these kind of three different universal properties discussed, right? These two pullbacks, mu, mu, lambda, and new. And if you kind of drew it naively, well, you'd have both of these imply the Rosiski universal property. And there's the Cockett and Crutwell one, and there's the strong one. And there's the strong one, and then in the middle we have these strong differential bundles. And we know when we have negatives that they all collapse into being the same thing. But, you know, it just seemed like they weren't the same thing when you didn't have negatives. But so the question is: is there anything here? Is you know, is Is there any difference kind of in these? The answer is no. There's just so I have introduced vacuous language into the lexicon now, into the literature. But all you need to know is a very simple lemma: strong differential bundles are closed under limits. Under limits in the category of pre-differential bundles. And the proof just really follows by a commutativity of limits. And the corollary is really just that if E lambda satisfies the Ryziski universality condition, so we have this pullback, then we just note that these, if That these, if I have Te of lambda, so that's a tangent bundle, so it's a strong differential bundle. So E is a linear idempotent, and T dot E is kind of linear just by being a morphism of free co-algebras. And then this lambda being a pullback just forces this thing to be a strong differential bundle. Assuming that certain pullbacks exist in the category. So, actually, you get this interesting theorem then, that the category of differential bundles, when certain pullbacks, certain equalizers exist. And I haven't checked this in the category of smooth manifolds. Manifolds. But literally, you just take t dot e and e dot t. You take that equalizer, that's the equalizer of these two natural item potents that you get on t, this thing, t dot t of e dot lambda. And because this thing commutes here, you'll have this reflector. And notice that because all of this stuff is Because all of this stuff is constructed as limits, if you're in sort of a situation where you have like a vibration and your differential bundle, your differential objects are kind of like differential, your differential bundles are differential objects in the slice is kind of a more concrete thing, then this actually will be an item potent. Will be an item-potent fibered monad. So it'll also play well with your vibration. And so this means that it's actually pretty reasonable, I think, to just take your category of differential bundles to just be these things, to just be a lift where this thing is an equalizer. Is an equalizer, and I think, and you know, or you know, algebras of this idempotent monad on lift, um, but then kind of differential bundles, you know, you've kind of now can see that differential bundles are just a functor category. And, you know, maybe the idea of like a or and Of, like, a um or and vector bundles in particular, as well. And for maybe for some people, um, that geometric description is easier, but I think a lot of the times, you know, it's nice to just be able to say this this thing is just a functor into my category satisfying a kind of a certain limit, or it's a algebra of a co-algebra of a kind of a co-monad kind of thing. Um, yeah, so uh, I included more just because I didn't know if how much of that smooth manifold stuff Jeff would cover. So I think I can, I'm also out of time. So I just want to thank everyone. So I guess kind of the takeaway from Kind of the takeaway for differential bundles, I think, though, is that they're actually, it seems like it's a long list of axioms and a tricky universality property to keep in your head. But up to equivalence, you can just think of it as one of these lifts satisfying this pullback. And I'm hoping maybe that makes life a bit easier. A bit easier for people. So, thank you. Are there any questions? So, I had a question. It was not so much about this talk, but it was mentioned that you. But it was mentioned that you showed that Beck modules give a tangent structure. So, looking at like abelian group objects in slice categories. And since we're not requiring in general negatives for our differential bundles, I was just curious why look at abelian group objects in slice categories instead of commutative monoid objects in slice categories. Or maybe you can do that as well. Oh, yeah, it's actually, I mean, it's the universality of the lift. That seems to kind of be always the hard thing. But it's this condition. So I have t squared of m right. Oh, I have a bit of space down here. So it's there's this. There's this kind of theorem that when you have a finitely complete additive category, the category of Beck modules in C, we'll call it that, is C cross C, right? So kind of what you want here is that the fiber over id M id M, like that, that. It N, like that, that additive bundle, because this is P. You want that fiber to be an additive category. Yeah, a finite additive category. And that includes negatives. So if it makes sense, it's just saying that if I have a double additive bundle of the form D over A. Over A, and then I'm going to call like this. So my base map is the identity. Then this splits as B plus A always, like kind of if and only if negatives. Because of that thing about the Beck modules being C if and only if that makes sense because this would be then an additive bundle in the slice category over M okay yeah but yeah so it's just like if you only ask for monoids you get forced negatives forced on you anyway um yeah like if you only asked for monoids but you were saying Only asked for monoids, but you were saying, like, if I was looking at the case where this held, then it would have to actually be, yeah, it just wouldn't hold if you didn't have if you only had monoids. Yeah. Unless there's something about homological algebra. I don't know a huge amount of homological algebra. Oh, Jeff has a question. Just a quick follow-up to that. I mean, I think this example I mean, I think this example of abelian group objects in a category is itself a tangent category without negatives. Oh, yeah. Related to that question, sort of asking why abelian group objects, well, as Ben said, you need abelian group objects to get this kind of universality. But even when you focus on abelian group objects, the resulting tangent structure itself doesn't have negatives because the addition here is kind of a product thing. It's not an adding thing. Yeah. Oh, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Oh yeah, exactly. So you don't you won't get negatives in that tangent structure. And you know, because your addition is byproduct, fibrid byproduct. You'd, I mean, have to do maybe something weird with super additive bundles. I don't know. Like, I know people do something like that, but I have no idea how it would work to make a, like that, that growth and dec ring construction from K-theory. Construction from K-theory. Hi, Ben. Thanks for your talk. Oh, thank you. A question I had was, what are your morphisms of differential bundles? Oh, sorry. Yeah. Literally, sorry if I skated over that. It's the It's the same as morphisms of just lifts. So everything is basically everything is here, this category of kind of weak co-algebras here. So things, so kind of co-algebramorphisms. The item potent splitting here is just extra data. You don't, you know, it's just it's just there. It's just there. If you have an algebra-preserving homomorphism, you can always just section, map, retract, and get the base map, get a base map that commutes. Okay. Yeah, thanks. Don't hear that very often anymore. Well, our moderator's gone. I was going to say, since Robin, hold on, I'll put my camera on. Since Robin was moderating, maybe I will ask any further questions. And if not, we can thank Ben. Okay. Okay. Thanks for having me. Robin, we're going to thank Ben. Yeah. Oh, and I should, yeah, how do I? How do I get out of this stop share?
