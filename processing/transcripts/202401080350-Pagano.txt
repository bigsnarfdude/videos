Thank you very much to the organizer for giving me the opportunity to talk here. So, today I will talk about robber money and abstraction, and in particular, I will focus the attention on primes of good reduction. And I will start with introducing the objects I will work with. So, today for me, X will be a smooth Smooth, geometrically integral, and proper variety over a number field K. Okay, and the object I'm interested in is so we want to study the set of Russian. The set of rational points on X. And the way we want to study them is by looking at the diagonal embedding of the K points inside the product over all the places of the K new points. So here, this capital omega k is the set of places. And for every place this KNU is the completion. Okay, so the idea is that this field KNU are topological fields, they come with a topology, and you can put a topology compatible with the topology on the field on the set of KNU points on the variety. The variety, and hence you can also put a topology on this product. So, this is a topological space. Okay, so now we are ready to define what weak approximation is. So, we say that x satisfy weak approximation If the image of the K points inside the product over all the completion of the K new points is dense. Okay, so what we want to study is the Brower Manning obstruction to weak approximation. Obstruction to weak approximation. So, in order to define it, I have to tell you something about the Brouwer Manning set. So, in 1917, Manning introduced the use of the Brouwer group in order to study weak approximation on varieties. And the idea is to use the Brouwer group to build an intermediate set between the product over. The product over all the places of the points on the completion and the k points. Now, for our kind of varieties, for proper varieties, one can prove that this is a closed immersion. And therefore, not only the k points are contained in the Brauerman set, but also the closure of the k points is contained in the Brauerman set. And therefore, we say that. And therefore, we say that there is a Brouwer man in obstruction to weak approximation on X. If the Brower Manning set is a proper subset of the product overall, the completion. The completion. So, and we see, in fact, that if this is a proper subset, then the k points cannot be dense inside the product. So, it makes sense to say that there is an abstraction to weak approximation in this case. Okay. So, now I want to briefly tell you a bit more about how the brower management. You a bit more about how the Brauer-Manning set is defined in order then to prove results about the Brauer-Manning set. So let's say. So the idea is the following. Given an element A in the Borough group of X, so the Brower group is defined as the second alcohomology group of the multiple. Of the multiplicative shift. And for any place nu, there is a map called the valuation map that goes from the K nu points on X to the Brouwer group of K nu. So this map comes really just It comes really just from the functoriality of the Brawler group. It's really once you know that the Bravo group is a functor, you can define this map. And for me, today, the evaluation map will always be with value in Q over Z. So for local fields, you can always embed the Brouwer group of K nu inside Q over Z. And to avoid some extra notation for me, I will always think about the image in Q over Z. Okay. Okay, and then this is the crucial ingredient to define the Brouwer mining set. So the Brouwer minus set is defined as the intersection over all the elements in the Brouwer group of the set of points in the product over all the places such that the sum over all the places of the evaluation map is zero. Is zero. So I don't want to go into the technicalities on why this set is well defined and why it contains the K points, but it is the case. So this set is such that it contains the K points and for proper varieties close inside the product over all the places. Okay. So, let me give another definition that I will justify in one second. So, we say that a place omega plays a role in In the rower manning obstruction to weak approximation, if we can find an element in the Brouwer group of the variety x such that the evaluation map on the k omega point is non-constant. So, let me very briefly justify this definition. So, we see that maybe I should here say that from now on, I will assume to have everywhere locally a point so that the product over all the places is non-empty for my variety. For my variety, otherwise, the weak approximation is trivially satisfied. So, I want to avoid this case. So, back to the definition. So, if we take two points in the product over all the places, such that the new component of the point is the same for every place different from omega. And for the place omega, we take the omega component. Omega, we take the omega component such that the evaluation map is different. Then we see that also the sum over all the places of the evaluation maps has to be different. But then at least one of the two has to be also different from zero. So at least one of these two points does not lie in the Brouwer-Manning set. Does not line the Brauer-Mannin set. And therefore, the Brauer-Mannin set is a proper subset. So it's true that if this happens, then there is a Brauerm-Manning obstruction to weak approximation. So okay. So, the results I want to talk about are motivated by the following question. So, assume that the geometric PR group of the variety is torsion-free and finitely generated. Finitely generated. Then the question is: which places can play a role in the sense I just defined in the Brawler Manning obstruction tweak approximation. So we want to. So, we want to understand which places are involved in this Brouwer-Manning obstruction to weak approximation. And let me mention that this question was formulated in a different way from Swinton Dyer. He asked whether under the assumption on the peak, or the risk assumption of the picker group, just primes of places of bud reduction. Places of blood reduction plus Archimedean places can play a role. Okay, but so now we know that the answer to this question is negative in general, and this comes. And this comes from a theorem proved by Brighton Newton in 2020. So they prove the following. They prove that assume that X is such that there is at least one global, one non-trivial global two-form. And there exists a prime of good ordinary reduction. I will come back in one second to the ordinary condition, but let me first. Then, what they prove is that there exists a finite field extension. Extension A prime P prime above P and an element A in the Brauer group of the base change of X to this field extension of order a power of P, where P is the Where P is the residual characteristic of my prime ideal such that the evaluation map attached to a on the k prime p prime point is non-constant okay so so they proved that after up to taking a finite field extension we can always find a prime of good reduction because it's a prime above a prime of good reduction that plays a role in the brauermannin abstraction okay so the before giving the Before giving the definition of ordinary, let me mention the two main questions I want to discuss today. So, the first one is: what can we say about the field extension K prime over K? Do we have some control on it? And the second one is One is let's say how crucial is the ordinary condition. Okay, so before stating some theorems that give a partial answer to this question, let me tell you what does it mean for a variety over a field of characteristic P. Field of characteristic P to be ordinary. So if we start with a smooth and proper variety over a field over a perfect field of characteristic P Then why is ordinary if all the homology group of the sheaf of exact forms on Y vanish. So here this B through Y is the image through the differential map of Map of the Q minus one form. Okay, so let me just say that for abelian varieties, you get back the usual definition of ordinary that maybe you're more familiar with. And okay, let me state the first. The first theorem so let P be a prime of good ordinary Of good ordinary reduction for X again of residual characteristic P and we have to put some assumption on the special fiber. So assume that the special fiber at P That I will denote with Y P is such that there are no global one form and also the H1 of the base change to the algebraic closure Z to P Z is. Z to PZ is trivial. So the theorem says the following. If P minus 1 does not defide the ramification index at P, then P does not play a role in the Brower Manning obstruction. So, we see that in general, the field extension in Brighton-Newton theorem is needed because if this happen, then the prime cannot play a role. So, we need to have a field extension. And we also know that the field extension has to be such that the ramification index at the prime p prime becomes divisible by p minus one. And maybe let me mention that these two conditions are not too strong in the Condition are not too strong in the sense that if we start with a variety with torsion-free and finitely generated Picard group over the number over the directory of the number field, then this is always satisfied. And this is satisfied for all but finitely many primes. It's always satisfied. So once you have the assumption on the picker group, these two conditions are not very strong. Strong. Okay. So this theorem is in the direction of understanding question one. So let me mention a second theorem that partially goes in the direction of question two. So the second theorem is, I will state it for K3 surf. K3 surfaces it holds in a slightly general setting, but it becomes very technical. So, in order to avoid to put all the condition, I just set it for three surfaces. So, I don't know. So, let's be a creek. X be a K3 surfaces and be a prime of good non-ordinary reduction again of residual characteristic P. Of residual characteristic p, then if the ramification index, so we still have a relation between the ramification index and p minus one, but in this case it's if the ramification index is smaller or equal to p minus one, then p does not play a role in the Browermanian obstruction. Too weak approximation. So let me anticipate that in five minutes, let's say we will see an example that proves that this bound is sharp in the sense that I will give you an example in which the ramification index is exactly p. p is a prime of good non-ordinary reduction, and the prime plays a role in the Brauer-Manning abstraction. So potentially also primes of good non-ordinary reduction are involved in. Non-ordinary reductions are involved in the Brauerman obstruction. Okay, so the example I will give will be actually a family of examples of K3 surfaces. So let me spend a few words on K3 surfaces and why there are a good playground for this kind of question and this kind of theorems. So, K3 surfaces are a variety of dimension two such that the first homology group of the structure shift vanish. Vanish and the canonical bundle is trivial. So let me state some facts. So the first one is that the geometric PR group of aquatic surface      Okay, there so we have this family of uh of K tree surfaces. Of K3 surfaces, then what happens is that the class of the quaternion algebra is just an element in the Brouwer group of the function. An element in the Brauer group of the function field of the variety. These are elements in the function field of the variety. So this is k of x alpha. This is an element in the broader group of the variety of the Q3 surfaces. Okay, so we have this element, and I won't prove why. Why it is an element in the Brawler group of the surface. You can use really purity theorem for the Brawler group. Once you have the symbol written down, it just reduces to do some computation and compute some residue. I will spend some time in justifying how I construct this element, how I came up with these two functions defining the element. So, in order to do that, first I I have to restrict myself to so let per se, let P be a prime above two and O P the ring of integer of the completion of K at P, then if alpha square, which is an integer by assumption, is not By assumption, is not 0.8. What happened is that the question star defines a smooth model curly x alpha over the ring of integer of p. So, this is another way to say that the variety has good reduction. That the variety has good reduction at p. And okay, so from now on, we will restrict to this case, to the case in which we have good reduction at prime above two. And this condition just implies that all the coefficients there lies in the ring of integer, and then one can check that the special fiber is smooth. Then the theorem I want to talk about is the following: so the evaluation map. The evaluation map attached to A on the KP point is non-constant if and only if alpha square is not congruent to zero mod four. To zero mod four. So before telling you something about the proof, let me remark something. So the first thing is that if alpha square is congruent to one mod two, then the prime p is ordinary and if alpha square And if alpha square is 2 mod 4, then the prime P is not ordinary. And the ramification index at P is 2. So this proves that there are examples of varieties for which prime of good non-ordinary reduction. Prime of would non-ordinary reduction play a role? And we see that we have that the ramification index is equal to p so okay, yes, okay. Maybe I want to keep this. Okay, let me start to give some explanation about how these things work. So, since we are focusing really the attention on the model at a specific prime, from now At a specific prime. From now on, I will focus the attention on variety over a periodic field. So I take an extension of Qp, then OL is the ring of integer with uniformizer. Pi and small L is the residue field. And we are in the following situation. So we have a smooth model over the ring of integers, and we have the generic fiber X over our field L and the special fiber Y over the residue field. Okay, so this is two. Okay, so this is to avoid to have a too heavy notation from now on. Okay, so the Bright and Newton, in their paper, they define the following filter. The following filtration on the Brower group, the evaluation filtration in the following way. So define the N piece of the evaluation filtration to consist of those elements in the Brouwer group such that for every finite field extension Extension and for every point P over L prime the evaluation map is constant on disk on the disk center in P and of radius so E L prime L so this this consists of all the points that reduce to P modulo pi to this number okay so this this this becomes smaller and smaller when n grows this is the idea so this is for every n bigger or equal than one and then the defined evaluation zero part part to be those elements such that for every field extent, no, sorry, minus one. So this is such that for every field extension, the evaluation map is constant. And they define also the minus two piece of the filtration to be those elements such that the evaluation map is constant. Such that the evolution map is constant and zero. Okay, so one of their main results gives a way to compare this filtration with another filtration that comes from Carto's definition of Swan conductor. I won't define it. I will just tell you that there is this other filtration and that we have some maps on this. That we have some maps on this filtration that are crucial in order to understand the relationship with this evaluation filtration. So let me still have some space here. So there is a filtration. A filtration that I will denote by field N such that so we have a map, a residual map, delta, that goes from the zero piece of defiltration to the following commodity group of the special fiber. The special fiber, and for every n bigger or equal to one, there are some map called the refined swan conductor that goes from the n piece, n-graded piece of the filtration injectively in the direct sum of the global two form together with the global one form on y. Okay, so this filtration comes with these maps that allow you to study the filtration to detect whether an element lies in a given piece of the filtration or not. And so Brighton Newton proved the following. So The evaluation, you mean filtration? No, filter, I will state everything now, but it will be the same as F0. So this is due to write and Newton. So they prove that first field zero coincide with the evaluation zero part of the filtration. Evaluation zero part of the filtration. The second thing to prove is that the evaluation minus one part of the filtration, so the elements that have constant evaluation map, these are the elements in field zero such that the residue lies in the homology of the base field of our special. Special fiber. And then evaluation minus two will be those elements for which the residue is zero, but I won't write it down because I don't need it later. So the third thing I want to tell you is that evaluation n for n bigger than one consists of those elements in field n plus one such that the refine swan conductor does Does not have an omega one component. So it lies in the omega two global form. So this is for n bigger or equal than one. Okay, so we see that if we start with an element in the Brouwer group and we are able to see in which piece of the filtration Catos filtration is, and we are able to compute the refined smoke conductor, then we can also get. Then we can also get the behavior of the evaluation map attached to this element. Okay, so let me point out something. So if the special fiber is such that So, this cohomology group vanishes for all n. Then we have that the h1 of z over n z over the variety is the same as the h1 over the base field. But then this condition here is trivially satisfied always, which means that the evaluation zero part. 0 part, which is equal to field 0, is also equal to the evaluation minus 1 part. So if we are able to show that an elements lie in field 0, we know that it has constant evaluation. And again, remember that this is satisfied when the picker group is torsion-free and finitely generated. So for us, this condition is satisfied. This file. Okay, so let me give you an idea on how to compute this refined swan conductor map. So let's start with an element A in field N with n bigger or equal than one, and assume that the refines one conductor is equal to some other. Is equal to some alpha beta that lies. So alpha is a two form and beta is a global one form. Okay, so some facts. So the first one is that we always have that alpha is a closed form and the differential of beta is equal to minus one to the n times n times alpha. The n times n times alpha. So, in particular, we see that two things. So, let's say 1A, if p does not divide n, then alpha beta is equal to 0, 0 if and only if beta is equal to 0, right? beta is equal to zero, right? Because alpha beta, if beta is zero, then also alpha is zero if n is invertible in my field. And maybe like this, and let me with this say that for K3 surface, we have that there are no global one. That there are no global one forms on the special fiber, and therefore, if p does not divide n, then the refined swine conductor is always equal to zero, zero, because beta is always zero. Okay, so all the piece of the we this is telling us that we can forget about all the piece of the filtration for which p does not divide n. Okay, so many pieces of the filtration collapse. Collapse okay, and then the second thing is about the p-tortion of the Brouwer group. So let E prime be the following number. Then what happened is that the p-tortion of the Brouwer group is all contained in the fill E prime part of the Brouwer group. So this. Brouwer group. So this filtration is finite and it ends exactly at e prime. And moreover, here it is 2a. So if n is smaller than e prime, then we can prove that alpha beta actually lies in the exact form. So in the h0 of y b2y direct sum. So, we already see here that if the variety is ordinary, then these two objects are zero by definition. So, many other pieces of defiltration will collapse. And if n is exactly prime, then what happens is that there exists a constant on our base field such that if we multiply alpha beta by this constant, then we get logarithmic forms. So, forms that can be. Forms. So forms that can be written as df over f, wedge dg over g. Okay, so again, let me say something about what happened for K3 surfaces. So here. So, for K3, what we have is that if y is ordinary, then okay, this is true not just for K3 surfaces, but in Tree surfaces, but in general, this is zero, and the global section of the two forms is a one-dimensional FP vector space. This is telling us that if we hope to find something with non-zero refine some conductor, then we have to look at. Then we have to look at the E' piece of the filtration, and we should hope that the refined swan conductor is strictly related to a global logarithmic two-form. Okay, and if y is non-ordinary, then something orthogonal happen. So the global section of the sheaf of exits form coincide. Of Excel form coincides with the global section of the shift of two form. So this is a one-dimensional vector space over the residue field, and there are no global two-form. So okay, so we are ready to go back to the example and conclude.  So, there are three different cases. So, the first case is if alpha square is one mod two. Then, I already told you that the special fiber is ordinary. And what happened is that this the refined swan conductor of A is equal to alpha. equal to alpha zero, one can show that is equal to alpha zero with alpha such that with alpha such that a multiple of it is logarithmic. So let me say that the way I constructed the quaternion algebra was starting from this point. So I started by writing down the logarithmic form, then I look for element in the brower. I look for element in the browser. Sorry? Not no, you're right. It's a bit. Yes, no, no, it's omega. Yes, yes, yes. So I first wrote down the element. So once you have equation, you really can write down the logarithmic form on the special fiber. And then I knew what to look for in the Brauer group. Because I can, once I have a quaternion algebra and I have the symbol, Quaternion algebra, and I have the symbol, it's possible to really compute explicitly this refined swan conductor. So, this gives a way to have a guess at least on which kind of element you expect to find and play a role. Okay, so something very similar happened if alpha square is two mod four. In that case, what happened is that the special fiber is non-ordinary and And the refined swan conductor. So, in this case, the ramification index is two and the refined swan conductor. So, the element A lies in field two and the refines one conductor. Where omega is a is of the form differential of something of some beta and beta is and this is in the okay and um Finally, what happens if alpha square is zero mod four? So, in the case where we have that evaluation map is constant. So, how can we prove this? So, also in this case, y alpha is non-ordinary. So, first of all, we know that the element has order two, so it always lies in the E prime part of the filtration because this is where the Filtration because this is where the filtration ends on the two torsion. But now, since it's ordinary, it's non-ordinary, we have by 2B that the refines one conductor, the E prime refines one conductor has to be zero because we don't have logarithmic form. So this license field E prime minus one. And now one can check that E prime minus one. One can check that E prime minus one is not divisible by two. So let's say by this license field P prime minus two. And now if the ramification index, so two k two more cases, I'm almost done. So if the ramification index is one, then index is one, then the C prime is equal to two. And then we proved already that this lies in field zero, but by the remark, this is enough. By the remark I wrote before, this implies that A lies in the evaluation minus one part, so it has constant evaluation map. While if the lamification index is two, then there is an extra computation you have to do because this is four and then this lies in field two. But then you can do But then you can do an actual computation. So here there are some computations to show that the refine 1 conductor is zero, so it lies in field one. And then you're done by the same argument as above. So we see that this facts gives us That this fact gives us a way to have an expectation on what the refined sweat conductor should be and a way to have an idea of how this quaternion algebra should look like. Okay, I think that's everything I wanted to say. Thanks. Thank you, Margarita. Are there any questions? Are there any questions, comments? No, then let's thank Margaret again.
