Thanks for the organizers. Lang Wu was my first initial contact, and of course, Peter and Leila, who's done so much organization. Thank you to have me here. And this is probably the first talk at this workshop without Surrogate in the title. And so, but I like what Leia said. But I like what Leia said at the beginning: everything is surrogacy. And I should mention my collaborators: Andrew Ying, who was a former student with us, now did a postdoc at Penn and will be on job market this year. He just won the Devin Meyer Young Investigator Award from the biometrics section. Tina is my main collaborator, epidemiologist, and Ken Jones is chief. And Ken Jones is chief of that division, you'll see, of teratology and dysmorphology. He is one of the two co-authors who discovered the fetal alcohol syndrome. So yeah, I don't have to mention since I kind of feel like I need to justify myself being up here, but I just want to mention the first thing really quickly. And I was glad to hear Geert mention the art school. Geert mentioned the R-square type of measure as a possible quantification of treatment effect in the surrogacy kind of context. So I was doing a PhD in finishing up 96, 97. That's one following the apprentice paper, Lane, Fleming, and Grutter for the Cox model, the proportion of treatment effect explained. And then back then, my advisor, John O'Quickly, was John O'Quickly was telling me, you know, you could, because my half of my thesis, as Layla knows probably, was on our square measures for survival models. And now they are for non-parametric estimates too. So I'm biased in this way, but indeed it's nicely scaled between zero and one. So I'll make it a good comparison. So we didn't write the paper. The paper eventually The paper, the paper eventually happened as this reader reaction to the Alonso paper in biometrics. So, I'm going to skip the cancer experience I talked about yesterday. So this is something that I started 15, 16 years ago to collaborate with that division in pediatrics department at UCSD. So the precursor was Caucasus, California Territory. California teratology information specialist started by Dr. Ken Jones. And of so pregnancy is not a disease, but if you're expecting a baby, then you very much hope to have a healthy one. So you wonder what you should, shouldn't eat or drink or whatever exposed to. Now, quite often, pregnant women might also need some medication, for example, for asthma control. For example, for asthma control, etc. But clinical trials, even though there's been discussion of having pregnancy during clinical trials, but the fact is mostly we only have data from observational studies. And this is the research center is one. So now it covers the whole North America. And Europe has the equivalent antis starting, I mean, maybe a decade ago, I could be a little off on there. Found there to follow pregnant women. So, I'm not going to go through the details. They have a way of following and very successfully pregnant women during pregnancy, invite them to participate in the research studies that we are having. So, at any given time, it's way more than a dozen studies on different medication vaccine. Right now, we are doing the Pfizer vaccine during pregnancy study. So, just to get to the data I want to look at, this is the example. It's a good example because it caused a lot of attention. Is this a pointer? Oops, no, it's not. Okay. Hold on. What? This one? Hold it down. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Sorry. Thank you. Sorry. Thank you. So, as you can see, so there are several issues here that I mentioned in the abstract. So, FDA, so these are FDA mandates study for post-marketing drugs. First of all, look at among live births, how much birth defect is. So, here you have these two groups about twice in size, exposed versus unexposed, but you have six times. Six times, yes, major birth defects compared to the unexposed. So, even after adjust for confounding and so on, I'm going to skip the details. You still have an odds ratio about three. That's actually significant at 0.05 level. To cite it. Okay, now, all the possible pregnancy outcomes are five categories: live birth, or spontaneous abortion, or stillbirth, which is Still birth, which is technically the difference between these two are whether they are before 20 weeks of gestation or not. And then therapeutic abortion or elective abortion, which we don't have many in Europe, there are a lot more. A lot to follow up, which are very low in our studies. That's all the possible outcomes for the pregnancy. So what you notice is for spontaneous abortion, because often, right, that's Because often, right, that's early during pregnancy, the women might just have bleeding and so on. So often the fetus was not captured to examine whether there is birth defect or not. So they are missing a lot. So one reviewer commented on our paper was like, okay, you have 500 sample size, you have 25 missing or 27. So what? Why do such a complicated analysis? But the thing is, when you have a binary outcome and the smaller cat. Outcome and the smaller category is your effective sample size. So you are having here 30 something under 40 or around 40 yeses and you have 27 missings. How do you handle that? So the default in database and I won't say why is coded at zero as no. Now, however, so the title has this word. So the title has this word, pterothanasia. Pera means monster, I guess. Thanasia is death. That's by monster. So this is from an old medical textbook. What happened is spontaneous abortion is a body mechanism of getting rid of the bad eggs, as it says on the page. Basically, a lot could go on during the conception, each step of development. So the mechanism, so start. So the mechanism, so starting from 100% at term live birth, nine and a half months later, out of the 100%, 30% will be born roughly as normal babies. 1% with malformation or birth defect that mean the same thing. The other about 70%, almost 69, are lost. And among them, a very high portion are something's wrong. So if they had been. Wrong. So, if they had been born, they would have had some kind of birth defect. So, as you can see, now treating all the missing as no is probably not the right thing to do. And if you do a quick and dirty thing by treating all the missing as yes, immediately you can see the difference between the two group is not significant anymore. So, how you treat these missing is a big question. Thing is a big question. Okay, so this study is being done, FDA labeling, everything has been changed. So it acknowledges a difference between exposed and unexposed, but they couldn't explain the mechanism because typically, traditionally, you have to be able to identify like thalidomide, a specific defect, like missing limbs. This has kind of a pot pour of all sorts of defects. So the suspect was due to this. Was due to this pterothenasia, sorry, mechanism. I'm a very good with the buttons. As you can see, the spontaneous abortion rate is actually low in the exposed group. This is normally it's about over 10% spontaneous abortion in the population. We have left truncation that I'll mention in a moment, but this is about more like 5%. This is about more like 5%. So it's extremely low spontaneous abortion rate in the exposed arm. So the suspicion is that those malformed fetus that would have been aborted. And this is autoimmune disease drug. So there might be some mechanism that's not letting the abortion happen. I mean, we discussed this for a long, long time, of course, to relate to FDA labeling and all that. But just to, because I have a limited amount of time. Because I have a limited amount of time just to say this is what we are looking at. Okay, so there are many, many challenges. I'm glad I'm now giving the talk that people have got certain things, principal strata, and so I'm familiar with. But of the pregnancy study, so missing at random, I already mentioned, we have left truncation because the time scale is start of pregnancy is time zero. Start of pregnancy is time zero. Because the way the women are recruited, it's always after recognition of pregnancy, which is usually five weeks or later. And that's the database. And we don't have women before five weeks of gestation. So we lose those with early abortion, spontaneous abortion. So that's the issue to deal with. Selection bias, basically. We don't have a lot of loss to follow up. I mentioned this is not randomized, but also the But also, the thing I don't know if people had noticed, I said live birth is what FDA reports first. The first sentence is among live births. But if you think about what I just said, spontaneous abortion seem to be impacted by the exposure, then this is exactly your post-treatment or post-exposure variable that you are stratifying on. That I think in the That I think in the previous day and a half, people have heard all sorts of reasons why you shouldn't do that, but that's not being brought up with the regulatory agency. And anyhow, so this is our paper still trying to get published. And then we have a rare events case because birth defects are rare. So I was glad also Geert mentioned rare or long waiting for the outcome are the main reasons. Outcome are the main reasons people like Cicero get to see. Anyhow, so just to draw a relation among these things a little bit. So we have the exposure, we have birth defects, usually happening early during pregnancy. There are different stages, but and then spontaneous abortion could happen. And I already mentioned the mechanism, birth defect could increase. Mechanism birth defect could increase the likelihood of spontaneous abortion, and spontaneous abortion leads to missing in our outcome of birth defects. So, we are interested in, of course, the causal effect of exposure on both these outcomes. So, I'm going to go through fairly quickly D is the treatment, Y is yes-no birth defect, and some are missing, O is indicator whether Y is observed. Weather-wise observed. Q is the left truncation time, and that is at study enrollment. T is time to the event, which is either spontaneous abortion or stillbirths. We are treating them as the same type of event. Censoring time C, which could be elective or therapeutic abortion, which strictly speaking is competing risk, but we have few, so we are going to pretend they are just sensory. Lost to follow up or live birth. Lost to follow up or live births, that's just a kind of a notation thing, and then you have some covariates or confounders. I'll come back to M later. So using the right sensory notation, X is the right sensor event time, delta is the indicator, event indicator. So the assumptions, I'm going to go pretty quickly. These are standard causal inference assumptions. Standard causal inference assumption: if you are trying to use IPW and so on, we do a lot of sensitivity analysis. I'm just not going to talk about it here. We actually have packages for doing sensitivity analysis for survival models due to unmeasured confounding. The assumptions on sensoring and truncation are dictated by the model we can afford to fit with the sparse data. So here The sparse data. So, here, for example, sensoring is independent of event given the birth defect. That's the main mechanism we try to model due to terestinasia because defect increase the chance of spontaneous abortion. And then also the exposure indicator. Somewhat similarly for truncation, I'm going to skip because of the interest of time. And then the missing. And then the missing assumption here is key is to say missingness given spontaneous abortion. So I'm going to basically look at a selection model for modeling the missing data mechanism. So it's independent of the outcome given my spontaneous abortion information. It's a strong assumption, and we do a sensitivity analysis at the end. We just cannot afford a much bigger model, basically. Model basically. Okay, so fairly quickly, the causal ox ratio: this is a saturated for binary exposure and binary outcome. The logistic regression is saturated. So, this is not really imposing any model. We do model, so selection model, right? Given the complete data, why I pretend I know whether there's birth defect or not for each pregnancy, I model the I model the chance of spontaneous abortion. This is Cox's model written as its risk function, survival probability. So like I said before, we can only afford basically two predictors. One is exposure, one is whether or not birth defect, which has missing in it. But that's the whole data generating mechanism you can model here. And So, in order to account for the observational nature of the exposure as well as the truncation, we use inverse probability of weighting. So, you model these weights. So, I'm going to skip the detail. You can estimate them under assumptions. They should be consistent. And then it's not difficult to write down the whole likelihood for complete data, meaning pretend I observe all. Meaning, pretend I observe all the birth defects. So I have a binary likelihood here, pi is probability of defect. I have a survival likelihood here, which will be the cost model that go in. And because some of the Ys are not observed, so a EM type of algorithm can be used on this weighted complete data likelihood. So there's consistency and simple normality and so on. So, just to okay, skip the simulation, which early days helped us discover some mistake in our approach. So, that was important. I'm just going to get to the result here. So, remember, alpha for the logistic regression model. So, here's the intercept, and this says the birth defect rate in terms of the estimate, the counterfactual one is about. The counterfactual one is about 11% in the control arm, okay, which is actually quite reasonable. And then the treatment or exposure effect, it's positive, but it's not significant. So that's the main thing you want to look at is the causal odds ratio is 1.75. Not significant, like previously. Like previously, odds ratio of three significant. The causal effect on spontaneous abortion, this I read it as marginally significant because the data, again, is very sparse. It reduces the risk of spontaneous abortion, as we saw, because there are much fewer in the exposed group. Now, this one is curious, actually, not surprising. So, the effect of birth defect. Effect of birth defect on spontaneous abortion in terms of hazard ratio or log hazard ratio, you can see has a huge confidence interval because there's just not so much data. So initially, I actually envisioned a Baying setup for this, but of course, no expert I solicited could give me a reasonable number. So what we end up doing really is with regard to this effect of terothinasia, do a sensitive. Terrace and nasure do a sensitivity analysis. So, range between zero to four, four is like infinity on the log hazard ratio scale to run this and then see. So, as you can imagine, if it's zero, that means first effect has no effect on spontaneous abortion, then you are looking at a significant causal effect of the drug exposure. Of the drug exposure on birth defect. But as this effect of teratanasia becomes stronger, right, think about the table, I have those missing. If they all become yes, then I'm looking at this end, that the effect of exposure on birth defect goes away because it's all taken up by the spontaneous abortion. And this is the other end. So when you So, when you take the time to think about it, this direction totally makes sense. This is for the alpha d, and then this is for the beta d, which kind of, I mean, it fluctuates, but the upper bound is pretty close to zero for all the range of this beta y. One can also get the posterior probability of each missing birth defect. Effect, what's the posterior probability of that being a yes, which changes? So here it's on the grid of 0.05, so 0, 0.05, 1, 1.05, so on and so forth. Here it goes from the bottom to the top, how these posterior probability changes. So again, if you take time to think about it, it all makes sense. And the red line is at the point estimate I showed you before. Point estimate I showed you before with a huge confidence interval. So, this is the first part, and I'm just going to move up to the second part to deal with live births being post-exposure, and we stratify on it. So, what I want to pay attention is this M. Now, it's the indicator whether it's a spontaneous abortion or stillbirth versus live births. Now, it could be missing if Be missing if we have loss to follow-up or elective abortion, but those are small in numbers. Okay, so again, I'm just glad that I don't have to go through this in a lot of detail. So you have the four possibilities of always survivors, you know, depending on your exposure, they always are live births, so 0, 0. Or you have treatment survivors, which is kind of the terrorist nature of telling. kind of the pterosinature are telling us the treatment or exposure is helping the fetus to survive to term. So that's your one, zero group. We, because we're using parametric or semi-parametric models, so identifiability is not an issue. So monotonicity here is only used to reduce the number of parameters we have to estimate. So we are going to assume this strata is not there according to our observation of the data and the study. Of the data and the study, and then you have the never survivors. Okay, so it's interesting, and I don't have the time to go through in detail, but to do the exercise, the correspondence between the observed groups, depending on exposure, yes, no, and then the strata, yes, no, except we have some missing. So instead of four combinations, we have six combinations, and you can correspond to what are the latest. Correspond to what had a latent strata, the mixture that could possibly give each group. And I'll come back to this a little bit later. So similar model as before, but now I have three strata, so a multinomial distribution with two parameters, and I still have now the principal effect within each strata. I have the survival model, which I won't go into details. Details. Just notice that now the effect of exposure on spontaneous abortion, which is basically the stratification variable, is also represented by this overall membership in each strata. So you get the odds ratio of yes-no live births versus spontaneous abortion from the membership gammas. And not going to the detail about the likelihood. Into the detail about the likelihood and not the optimization. Just want to say that if you look at, this is the same table I showed you before, the AN strata has very few data points associated, as well as the NS strata, with lots of missing birth defects actually from the combination of these two. The combination of these two. So, what we end up focused on, and I should have mentioned that the optimization algorithm allows to just track the parameters of interest. So you don't have to wait for all the parameters to converge. I think that's been done in Beijing literature as well. So, we end up just focus on the always survivor strata, which has most data, as well as the strata membership. As the strata membership. So here, the estimate again, the intercept, the causal effect within the strata, again, so p-value is similar to the previous one. You can call it ATE if you like, of the whole population. So we don't have the point estimates are different. So the odds ratio is close to four, but again, quite confidence interval. Again, wide confidence interval. So we really don't have a lot of data to do this kind of analysis on a single study. And they reduces the chance of spontaneous abortion the same direction as before, but the p-value has gone up a bit to 0.2 from 0.07. So I'm going to stop here. I mean, mention a few things that are important in terms. Few things that are important in terms of regulatory that we deal with FDA for these post-marketing mandates for drug companies, that major birth defect is the primary outcome. And there are typically two strata for live birth and all pregnancy. Live birth itself is problematic to stratify on. I guess I don't have problem convincing you, but how to have that. You, but how to have that conversation with the rest of the group and sponsors, and so on is a separate thing because, you know, if you've always done things one way, now you try to change. So, and also the missing, how to deal with the missingness. Like, basically, the coding is no by default. So, I will stop here basically. Um thank you, Lily, for this very interesting talk. Are there any questions in the audience? Yes. Thanks. I thought that was a really good talk. Thanks. I thought that was a really good talk. It's a really complex problem. I was wondering a little bit about, it seems like the outcomes are basically dichotomized. Is that right? Is there any, I don't know, reason to think about spontaneous abortion as like time to event or I don't know. It made me think a little bit about competing risks. Is that relevant at all in this problem? Yes. So birth defect is clearly yes, no. Birth defect is clearly yes, no. Spontaneous abortion initially was also yes and no, to be honest. The timing is of secondary interest, but it's the left truncation that's causing the problem. And we know how to deal with that because you kind of have to look at when things are happening with left truncation. So that push it to be a survival endpoint. Competing risk is for, well, I have more slide actually, truncation by death, basically. There's a lot. By death, basically, there's a lot of similarity, but also it's not the same. We don't have like quality of life after death, which is not well defined, etc. Birth defect, the simplified version is they occurred early. So it's always there, whether you observe it or not is the issue. Yeah, so I think that's what you meant by competing risk. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, thanks, Lily, for the great talk. So, you mentioned about speaking with FDA. So, my question is: have you had a chance to talk to someone about this type of work and what was the response? Not quite yet. At the time of this workshop being organized, was when we started to look at this data, do the analysis. So, I thought immediately, okay, it's very much parallel with the workshop is about. Workshop is about. We have not. I mean, the PI, of course, is co-author on the study. So I think we need to talk internally first and then proceed, you know, with the sponsor. But it's a methodological issue. It's not specific to this study. It's just this one happened to have a signal, so it makes it more noticeable. But it's on our studies. Yeah. You mentioned that the simulation study helped you find that you had some error. Can you explain about what that thought was previously? Yeah, so we ended it's not the first time I trip over left truncation. I keep making mistake. So, yes, we properly handled left truncation in the survival part, but not on the birth defect part. But they are biased. Defect part, but they are binary outcomes. So, if you don't handle some, I mean, it's a stupid mistake, but that's how we discovered it. So, this may be exactly what you said, but it took me a minute to catch up to you. But the way you described it made me think of like, I think it's actually flipped maybe from the surrogate you said, but it's like putting it. Like putting it in a surrogate setting. You know, the exposure is our like treatment. And then it felt to me like the FDA and whomever else were, they were thinking of looking at like birth defect rates among live births as basically the surrogate outcome. Like that's the outcome they were using. But really the true outcome you care about is birth defects among like all Birth defects among like all potential births, but that's like not measurable. And so it seems like you're telling me it's kind of the opposite of what you said, but it seems like you're telling me, like, yeah, just looking at birth defects among live births is not a good surrogate for birth defect rate among all potential births because all this stuff is missing. Like that's how, that's kind of the flip of what you said, but that's how I pictured it in my head. Yeah, I think you just added one more. Yeah, I think you just added one more layer to my problem. Yeah, so when I was thinking about surrogacy, why I should be talking about it here, it's really more missing birth defect, which are rare. And I'm thinking of SAB spontaneous abortion as some kind of surrogacy for birth defect, knowing the teratinasia mechanism. So that's my first issue. The second one is stratifying on live births, which is post-sex. On live birth, which is post-exposure. That for somehow, people just think they care more if you know if it's live birth. And so you can calculate dollar amount, how much going to cost that kid, lifetime, and so on. But scientifically, so we are secondarily interested in the birth defect rate among all pregnancies just to understand the drug mechanism. As well, for the woman who lost the baby, last miscarriage, you know, they usually feel very. You know, they usually feel very bad about it to know it's not their fault, but you know, there's something wrong with the fetus and so on. So, that, according to Dr. Jones, is also extremely important. Your question is a third layer that I didn't even think about. But yeah, it's complex. Okay, thank you very much. In the interest of time, we're going to move to the next speaker. Next speaker
