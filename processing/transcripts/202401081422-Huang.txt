Here is a simple procedure that I can compute promotion of this tableau. Sometimes people do it the other way, but this is the way I would like to do it. So if the largest entry in this tableau is equal to this n, I do the following. I delete n from this tableau, and that will leave me two blank spaces. And then I will perform reverse juice hackan on this tableau. And then after I perform the reverse juice hackan, Perform the reverse to Taken, the empty spots will migrate towards the northwest corner of the Tableau. And then I'll treat them as zeros, and then I add one to everybody. So this is a simple operation I can perform on Tableau divided by Jekan. And secondly, okay, what if the largest entry in the Tableau is less than n, in which case this Tableau is not, right? But if the largest Tableau But if the largest tableau, sorry, if the largest entry is less than and I just add one to everybody and then I'm done. So this is promotion on some SM tableau. Here's one example that I, if you trust me, my computing process, this is I compute the promotion on this input tableau, like compute, compute, compute, and I realize that I land back to my original tableau. This always happens for semi-centered tableau of Semi-stander tableau of rectangular shape. And in general, the promotion period of any semi-stander tableau is divisible by this allowable entry. If you would like to learn more about the promotion, I would recommend you to talk to Jessica Stryker, who is an expert on the subject matter. Okay? Alright, so now we've learned about promotion, let's switch here to positive variety, which is one of the terms in my title. So there are many different So, there are many different ways to define positive varieties, and I'm not going to do it in a careful way, although this way is rigorous, to define positive varieties. So, this way I'm defining positive variety here requires a lot of work on the geometry of positive varieties. So, my definition for post-real variety, pi f, so f is if you define it as If you define it the usual way, F could be what's called a pository. So these could be many different kinds of indexing sets. The famous ones are fun-defin permutation, decorative permutations, fit graphs, lithiagrams, what blah, blah, blah. But I'm not going to worry about any of that today. So for me, today, my post-product variety is an irreducible sub variety Le Grassevanien obtained by imposing a Obtained by imposing a collection of cyclic rank conditions. Okay, so first of all, it needs to be irreducible. And second of all, I need to be able to construct this variety by imposing a bunch of cyclic rank conditions. Now, if I just impose a bunch of cyclic rank conditions, my variety might not be irreducible. It might be a reducible variety. Here's how I can decompose them, and then the irreducible pieces would still be defined by. Would still be defined by these bunch of single-rank conditions. So here's a simple example. If I take Rustmannian 3,5 and any matrix of full rank of dimension 3, 5, would define an element of the Grassmannian by taking the row span of this matrix. And let me explain what cyclic rank condition means. So here I can have So, I can have two kinds of rank conditions. First kind is a regular interval rank condition. And in my example, rank of 2, 3, 4 means I'm taking, yeah, sometimes I write 2, 4 without the 3, I consider this as an interval of the column indices. So rank of 2, 3, 4, less than or equal to 2, means that I take these columns, the rank of these bis matrix less than or equal to 2. So these are the regular interval. So, these are the regular interval rank conditions. And so, for positive varieties, we're also allowing these cyclic rank conditions. It means that the rank conditions are allowed to wrap around. So, for example, I can take the cyclic interval 5, 1. So, you can imagine your column indices being infinite and periodic. What is ritual 5? What is ritual 5? So, rank of 51, circ, my notation for signifying this click, means that here the rank of 5 and The rank of 5 and column 5 and column 1 together, this matrix has rank lesser than 1. Are there any clarifying questions? Okay. Alright. And if my pository variety is defined by a single rank condition, whether it's cyclic or regular, I call it a basic pository variety. So it turns out, again, by geometry of pository varieties, every positive variety can be built by imposing. Can be built by imposing a bunch of these basic ones. And a thing I want to mention right now, which will show up again later, is that sometimes I don't really want to deal with these cyclic rank conditions because they're slightly difficult to deal with, but my way of getting around that is by invoking this Grassmannian duality. So on the geometry side, I can take the Grassmannian, the K-plane interface, and there is a natural isomorphism with There is a natural isomorphism with the Rasmannian of n minus k planes in space, and the stratification of the Rasmannian by posture varieties also like go through under this isomorphism. So, and if you agree with that there is isomorphism, my cyclic rank condition uniquely corresponds, um, Ger Kn uniquely corresponds to a regular rank condition of Gern minus Kn. Right, so maybe take a mental note. Right, so maybe take a mental note and we'll come back to this um in a little bit. Right, so and um okay, so now let's combine the I guess here. Yeah, so let's me, let me now define what it means for a semi-stand tableau of shape k times d to have a generalized antidiagonal for the interval for an interval rank condition. For an interval rank condition. This is for the regular interval, not instead of the cyclic interval. So here's a simple condition: this K by N semi-center tableau. So my input is the semi-center tableau and the regular interval rank condition. And I say that a generalized NP diagonal for this interval rank condition in this tableau is the following. So it's a vertical strip. The following: so it's a vertical strip of numbers. I'm asking my numbers in this vertical strip to lie in that entry, and it reads from northwest to southeast. The entries must be strictly increasing. So there are a bunch of conditions on this, how the generalized anti-diagonal could be. That given a semi-sentence tableau and interval rank condition, I can say that whether I can. I can say that whether I can ask whether this semi-stand-type log contains a generalized ND diagonal. Good? Okay. So, yeah. Sorry. And then I also, yeah, forgot. I also require that the length of my generalized antidiagonal to be r plus one. Here, the rank is less than or equal to r, so the length of this antidiagonal must be r plus one. So in my example, the rank of this river is a river. The rank of this interval is less than or equal to 3, so I need 4 entries. 3, 4, 5, 6 go from northeast to southwest. It forms a vertical strip, and the entries are in 3 to 7. Okay, so theorem by Hodge, the standard monomials to the Grassmannian are exactly the set of all semi-star tableau. Of k rows and d columns, where d is just a positive integer. So if you now heard about semi-standard monomials before this notion comes from computer algebra and algebraic geometry, if you know that rate, if you don't know that, this is a definition for today. Right, so with Aiyan Chiliang, we proved that given an interval positroid variety defined by a single rank condition. Defined by a single rank collision. The set of standard monomials that correspond to such positroid variety correspond to the set of all semi-standard tableau that does not contain anti-generalized anti-diagonal diagonal. So if you just have the entire Gauss mania, there's no condition. You have one single interval condition, you have a condition on whether this, you do not allow such a general. You do not allow such a generalized antidiagonal to appear. Okay? And our theorem is that promotion on rectangular-shaped semi-standard tableau gives a bijection between the set of semi-standard monomials of any positive variety and its cyclic shapes. So let me show you an example to illustrate. Show you an example to illustrate what this means. Okay, so here's the promotion procedure from what I showed you in the beginning. Right? And let's look at the first tableau. The first tableau, let's say that if I consider this simple interval rank condition, rank 1, 3 less than or equal to 2, so the first tableau does contain a generalized antidiagonal for this interpolator, 4 is not a standard model. Not a standard monomial for this rank condition. But yeah, so we're considering the complements of the standard monomial. Okay? So if I, on the Graph Mannian, I have a natural cyclic shift, so I can consider rank of 1, 3 less than or equal to 2. And if I cyclic shift that, I get this new interval rank condition. And then Right? And then the generalized antidiagenal for this interval red condition can be a 2, 3, 4 over there. And it does appear. Right? And I can keep doing that. 3, 4, 5 also appears. Yeah, so here I mentioned this Graphman duality. So if I take the complement If I take the complement of this rank, so this is the rank condition in girl 3, 5. So here is a rank condition in girl 2, 5. And so the tableau, I get this tableau by taking complements of each column over there. And then I need to reverse the order. So 3, 4, 5 becomes 1, 2, 2, 4, 5 becomes 1, 3. I guess mapped to 1, 3, like 1, 3, 5 gets mapped to 2, 4, and 1, 2, 5 gets mapped to 3, 4. Right? And you can And you can see that on this tableau, I get this rank condition by taking geometric dual from this rank condition. And I notice that that tableau, so this complement tableau contains a general value for this rank condition. So this is where I need, I need this to deal with the cyclic rank case. So yeah, so sorry, rank 358. Yeah, so sorry, right 3.5, I didn't need to put a circle there, but yeah, so okay, ignore this circle. But here, 4, 1, there's a circle here because now it's cyclic. And I take the complement again of each column, and by geometric dual, this rank condition corresponds to this rank condition. So again, the 4, 1 means 4, 5, 1. 3 things. Okay, so here, So here I see that 2,3 appears for this, for the signal grand condition. And I can keep doing that. And then I can keep doing that and eventually I land back to my original tableau. And then if I look at the complement, the antidiagonal also appears for this equal branch. Appear for this agreement. Right, and that's the end of my talk. Are there any questions? Can we please journalize to other classical groups? We haven't thought about that yet. Yeah, maybe I mean there is a notion of I mean, there is a notion of possible choice varieties. Well, you can think about these as projected Richardson varieties. So there's Richardson varieties in general types, and you could project them. And this is also the original point of view of Action Bay and France. So, we're gonna set up pretty quickly. Thank you.
