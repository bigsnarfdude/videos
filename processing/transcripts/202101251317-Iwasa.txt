Mathematics of human environmental systems, and I hope that we can enjoy exchange of ideas in spite that we cannot meet each other in person at Banff. Let me start my slides. Let me see. Oh, it's okay. Yeah. Yeah, now I'm going to speak about illegal loggings in tropical forest. Now, as you know, that almost all ecosystem has been formed and maintained under very strong influence of human activities. If you go to the forest and asking why this forest is dominated by beech trees, answer often lies that how people has been using the forest last 200. Uh, last 200 or 300 years because uh, higher frequency has a very strong effect on the species composition. Now, if you go to the lake and they're asking why this lake is very productive, but it smells sometimes bad, it contains phosphorus. And the answer is surrounding areas are agricultural land and they, you know, people supply a lot of fertilizers and that come down to the lake water. And that comes down to the lake water. Tomorrow morning, not maybe, not morning, but Frank Hilke will speak about the lake water pollution problems. Now, so to understand and also control the ecosystems, we have to know people's decision makings. But on the other hand, change of the ecosystem sometimes causes dramatic Sometimes cause dramatic effects the local human society. So these two sometimes tightly coupled with each other, but traditionally this has been, the two has been studied separately. Ecosystems have studied natural sciences, such as nutrient cycling and food waste, but social scientists focusing on how we reach the consensus, you know, or what is the institution which What is the institution which is effectively control the system? But sometimes studying both of them together or coupled system is very useful. Now I will focus today on the illegal logging. You can see this photo. This is from the National Forest in Indonesia. But there is a regulation, no tree should cut without permission. No tree should be cut without permission. But you can see that the big tree were cut and stolen. And this is an example of the illegal logging. But next slide is illegal logging in much larger spatial scale in the middle of the beautiful tropical forest, large area in the Cambodia, large area of creat. And subsequent months, they established the big Kagino. Kagino. Now, now this project is high, the officers in high rank in the government is involved. So, there is an element of the illegal logging is very closely tied with corruption. Now, there has been attempts to estimate the importance of corruption, and according to this report, like Bolivia and Cambodia, you see. Cambodia, you see Ecuador, Indonesia, and they show very high fraction of the loggings done illegally, especially those countries in located tropical areas. Now, as I said, there is an element of corruption, and there has been attempts to define the corruption index, and the vertical axis indicating the importance of the corruption. You know, the importance of the corruption of the people's everyday life, and horizontal axis is prevalence of the illegal loggings. And there is a strong correlation between these two. Today, I'm going to speak on two separate models, both of them formalized in terms of evolutionary game theory. And the first one is LADA in the Is ladder in the line with a traditional game theory adopted in theoretical economics. And we consider the multiple players, each one tried to maximize her own utility, and we can calculate equilibrium and we can compare the equilibrium with observation. The second model is different. It's more of the Less traditional because a stable equilibrium might exist, but that is often unstable. So the whole system will show perpetual cyclation or maybe sometimes stochastic jumping transition between different states. So this other irregular behavior should be compared with observation. With observation. Let me start with the first one. The work was done in collaboration with Professor Fujiwala, who has been working for many years in Indonesian forest. So some of the collaborators, co-authors, are Indonesian researchers. Now, as you know, that Indonesia is located on the equator. So about 40 or 35 years ago, it is the country is covered. The country is covered with a beautiful tropical forest. But last 35 years, this has been exploited or cultivated. And then the government started worrying about the loss of the natural forest. This is caused partly because of the rapid population growth. Now, especially illegal logging is a big problem. Illegal logging is a big problem, biggest threat to the plantation. You see, this photo is a teak forest. Teak is a wood that is a very expensive wood. That can be used after 50 years or 70 years, that can be used for making expensive furniture. But other woods can make for wood chips and that can be used for making papers. But teak is very expensive. Is very expensive. But it is very difficult to watch the tick trees for 50 years and 70 years. So there are attempts to stealing it. You see, that is a sort of the evidence for illegal logging. Now, this is really a problem. So the Indonesian government introduced many policies to control the illegal loggings. And one of them seemed to be very successful according to Very successful according to Indonesian government. Less than 10 years, no management should dramatically reduced according to their reports. What is this successful policy, which is a profit sharing? Now, so this is a national forest, so it is managed by the forest manager who will take care of that and successfully sell the goods and receive the Woods and receive the income or profit. And say 25% of this profit will be given to the local community. That is profit sharing. How this works to suppress the illegal loggings? Now, there are trees, and then it was managed by Forest Manager, and then he will sell successfully. And then he will sell successfully. And after that, they will hire local people to replanting young trees. Now, there are people attempts to steal these trees, illegal loggings. Now, then forest manager will send rangers to suppress these attempts. But it's very difficult. You see, forest is very large, and then they can't watch, they can't watch all the time. So it is a very difficult. So it is very difficult to stop. How about the local people? Local people, you know, it's not their benefit to stop the irrigal loggings because after any reason, trees are cleared by maybe physical disturbances, such as forest fire or maybe storms, or can be illegal loggings or clearance organized by the manager for any reason. Manager, for any reason, they will be hired. So even if they spot the attempts of the illegal loggings, they will not kind of report. Now, with profit sharing, the things has been different. You see, local people find it profitable if the trees will be sold at a high price. So it is their benefit to stop the illegal logging. Now, because they live very close to the forest, they know the forest very well, and also use the forest for other purposes. So, it is a rather easy to spot the illegal logging attempts. So, they will report it. Then, a forest manager will send the language to control illegal logging. So, that is a scenario. Now, let me explain the very simple mathematical model to describe this situation. Okay, suppose. Situation. Suppose the forest is composed of the large number of the patches. Each patch is a cohort of trees. The trees of the same age. Say this is age T. Now, there are two players. The first player is a forest manager and economic value of dispatch to the first player manager. We denote by V of T. Now we decompose this. Now we decompose this V of t according to the events happening within the year. Sigma of T is a variable controlled decided by the manager. If a sigma t is equal to one, that manager decided to cut the tree and sell it. Now we assume that the price of a tree is proportional to the volume and then say he will hire local people for replanting young trees. Replanting young trees, and then what remained is that patch with a very young tree, so V zero. Now, even if he decided not to cut the tree of that year, sigma equals zero, but there are chance that the trees will be removed by either by physical disturbance, you know, or by illegal loggings. And when trees are able to Trees are able to survive or escape from this risk, then all tree becomes bigger and the age becomes t plus one, and that is a larger than v of t. Now, we can think of the similar things for the second player. So, the value of the patch to the second player, second player is at the local people. The local people. This is we denote that is by U of T. Now, sigma is a variable decided by the first player managers, so therefore they can't control it. But the second player will choose the level of surveillance activity. If they spend more effort for surveillance, they can stop or reduce the risk of the illegal loggings. Now, Now, you can see that combining the last two equations, these equations, and it's a dynamic optimization. And so, from the end, and then we can calculate optimization backward and then to the current year. Now, we found out this model is unstable. It's very difficult to converge to the national equilibrium. So, we replace this maximum. Maximum operations by the logisto dynamics. You see, if the real maximum, the second player, the second player indicates the local people, is really all known reactions. Horizontal axis is a difference of the utility when they indicate all committed surveillance activity and then minus utility. Minus utility of not commit surveillance activities. So, if the one is a positive, that means engaging surveillance activity is more beneficial, then 100% of people will engage this activity. If slightly lower, then this is a negative, then none of them will engage in this one. But this is a sort of perfectly rational behavior. If you study people's behavior, People's behavior in economics. Of course, people are not going to show this clear-cut jump from 0% to 100%. Instead, fraction of people who adopt that behavior gradually increases as a function of differential utility. And this kind of assumption is called stochastic best response by some of the theoretical economists, but sometimes called logic dynamics. Logic dynamics. Okay, if you replace the maximum symbol by this, then we can calculate the solution. Now, the solution will critically depend on the fraction of profit sharing. If the profit sharing rate is small, like ten percent or five percent, then local people find it not very enthusiastic about engaging in the surveillance activities. The save activities, especially when the trees are young. And so they are just will not neglect the case. But if the profit sharing rate is high, like 40%, then they are very much involved in this stopping illegal logging attempts. So let me see. Now we can talk about. Talk about what is the profit-sharing rate that's optimal to the managers, alpha. And that all depends on the parameter values. And in this particular case, you know, so very low rate of profit sharing, like 10%, then you're not able to suppress the illegal logging. But no, probably sharing rate is 30 or 40% is too much. So in this particular case, 25% seem to be optimal. Now, if the variables are different, like this forest is a more stable environment. So the forest fire or storms. Or you know, storms are less involved. So, in that case, it turned out to be lower prop sharing is optimal. So, 20% is optimal instead of 25%. So, by this kind of attempts, we can tell that if the forest is more stable, national disturbance rate is smaller, or people are not close to the Russian. You know, rational switch behavior instead of the, you know, their response is gradual. That means sensitivity to utility difference is small. Or we assume that future discounting and because income in the later will be regarded as a smaller value compared to income current. And that rate that discount is smaller. Well, with these cases, Is smaller. Well, with these cases, we found out profit sharing fraction optimal to the manager is smaller. But anyway, this kind of modeling attempts show that the policy adopted by Indonesia government and shown to be very successful is sort of justified by this kind of attempts. That's a very simple first story. Improve fast story. Okay. Now I like to proceed the second modeling. As I explained already, illegal logging is strongly tied with corruption. Now, corruption seems to be very important in economic growth. This book, Fisman and Gordon, is a very nice book. It was written about three and a half years ago, and it was very informative. Years ago, and it was very informative for me. Now, one of the figures in this book is like this. People study the freedom from corruption. That is a horizontal axis. Now, it is a high value of the freedom from corruption, Z hundred, indicates that in society, people will not feel the need of the, you know. not feel the need of the you know uh existence corruption but as a low value indicates that the almost everyday life uh people must consider the corruptions now uh vertical axis is uh simply saying that the speed of the economic growth so this implies that there is a very strong correlation between economic growth rate and freedom from corruption now i'm going to Now, I'm going to explain some of this paper. We have written a couple of papers before in which we really stated that our motivation is about illegal logging in topics. But in this particular one, Carl Zing wanted to be general. So he removed all this word of illegal logging in topics, but when he talked about the general problem of corruption. Problem of corruption. But I have to say that this model is, we studied this model because of our concern of the eagle loggings in tropical forests. I think that is a biggest threat to the forest ecosystem in tropics. Now, the model is a little abstract, but we consider the two groups of people. The first group is we call First group is we call players, which is harvesters, you can say. Now, among harvesters, there are cooperators. They will work as promised, but there are some defector who will commit illegal loggings, so that they will sell the tree and then gain the money. Now, we consider situation in which the multiple harvesters or multiple players. Harvesters or multiple players work together in the same sites. I illustrate for simplicity the case with only two harvesters, but in general it can be n harvesters. Now, there are umpires. Umpire is a rule imposer, and among umpires, there are honest umpire who try to discover the attempts of defectors, defectors, illegal logging attempts, and they will punish. Punish, charge the fine. Now, unfortunately, there are corrupt umpires who will collect bribes. So they will form, you know, multiple harvesters and a single umpire, form the group and interact. Let me explain the essence of the payoffs for them. Now, without umpire, the payoff structure is similar to the Similar to the prisoner's dilemma game. You see, whatever the behavior of your opponent, it is your benefit to play defection. That means you should better at least get higher payoff by committing the illegal loggings. So, in that situation, everyone plays the defections. So, illegal logging must prevail. So, if we copulate, if So if we copulate, if they cooperate, then they can gain the higher payoff, but this is unstable. And this, you know, DD is a stable state. Now, if the umpire exists, then umpire will charge a fine whenever it discovered attempts of the defection, so illegal loggings. So therefore, playing defection is not profitable for each player. Profitable for each player. So now, as a result, everyone plays a cooperation. So that achieves higher payoff. If is a, you see, a fee, they pay for the work to the umpire. That's fine, but unfortunately, umpire can be corrupt. Okay, if umpire is corrupt, they will not charge a fine to the defector, instead, they will corrupt. To the defector, instead, they will collect a bribe B. Okay, so as a result, if the corrupt umpire is prevalent, then again, the defection prevail. So this seems to be a situation very pessimistic. How can we get out of this one? Very simple model. But we consider a cooperator who is a little more sort of wise, food and cooperator. Sort of wise, prudent cooperator. Now, prudence seems to be a word for wise. And prudent cooperator will like to know the type of the umpire. If the umpire is honest, then the prudent cooperator is willing to play the game. But if he knows that the umpire is corrupt, prudent cooperator drops out of the game. He will refuse to play the game. He will refuse to play the game. So by that way, he will not be exploited by the corruption. But to obtain this information about the type of empire, prudent cooperator must pay the cost. Now, compare the optimistic empire, who are not going to pay the cost of getting information and instead Getting information, and instead, he will just hope the umpire is honest. Now, this is a cheaper way because he doesn't have to pay the cost of getting information. But, you know, this has a problem because if the umpire is corrupt, yeah, but the prudent cooperator has to pay the cost, but can't escape this. Can escape this problem. Now, similarly, we can define the defector. Optimistic defector, we just hope that the umpire is corrupt, but if not corrupt, then optimistic defector will have a problem because he will be, you know, has to pay that fine. But a prudent defector tries to collect the information about the type of umpires. And if the umpire is And if the umpire is honest, then prudent detector refuses to play the game. So we consider the four types of the harvesters, OC, PC, OD, PD. Okay, now the model is that we consider the two population replicator dynamics. Now there are, as I explained, there are population of the There are population of the player or harvesters. There are four types I explained. Then umpire has another population, including two types, honest and corrupt. And I explained they form a sort of group, multiple harvesters, indicator two, and then one umpire forms a group and they interact each other as I described. Each other, as I described, and then they each gain or lose the payoff, and then they go back to the player population and umpire population. And then within this population, there is a process of sort of adaptation. And then agent will change their behavior to that improve the, you know, You know, average payoff because they will imitate and adopt the behavior who achieved the higher payoff. Okay, so this is this process occurring within each population, and that is described in terms of the replicator dynamics. Okay, now let me repeat: payoff matrix. I just described the case of the two harvesters. This is four types: OC, PD, four types, U, and then opponents. And then your payoff is like this. But at the case, umpire is honest. But if umpire is corrupt, then we have the different payoff matrix. And in general, mixture between the corrupt and honest. So things should be some intermediate. That is a That is a uh you know four types umpire gives uh you know received the payoff. Now, uh, there are umpires. Umpire has two types, honest or corrupt. The honest umpire receives a fee, except one of the player is prudent defector. Because prudent defector examine the type of umpire. If the umpire is honest, then he drops out of game. He drops out of the game. So, therefore, honest umpire is not able to receive the fee if one of the umpire is a prudent defector. Now, corrupt umpire is very similar. He can receive the fee if the neither player is prudent cooperator. Okay, and one of them is prudent cooperator, he can't receive the fee. In addition to the fee, corrupt umpire received a bribe. See the blind. Now we run this model. You can see this is equivalent to the population genetic model. And of two interacting species. One species is a harvester, the other species empire. Now, natural selection term within population genetics is equivalent to that, is imitation dynamics or replicated dynamics. Duplicated dynamics. Now, mutation term in the population genetics is equivalent to that, is an exploration rate. It's a changing the randomly changed to the type. And then in addition, there is always a stochasticity caused by the finiteness of the number of individuals. This is called random genetic drift in the population genetics. So you know that You know that in population genetics, the evolution proceeds in a very different manner in very small population size and low exploration rate, and very large population size and high exploration rate. Now, small population limit, populations always close to the one type. Now, one type dominates, and then other types try to invade or mutate. And almost all of them fail because. And almost all of them fail because of the high stochasticity, very strong stochasticity, while the number is small. But some of them are lucky, they take over. So the whole population will jump into the different states. So one state dominated particular type, jump to the defined states in which the divine type dominates, and then jump again. Okay, that is a stochastic situation. Now, opposite extreme, all the types are mixed. All the types are mixed, you know, exist, and then fraction will change over time. This is an example. You see, you can see that the red portion is dominated by the corrupt umpire and jump to the state blue, that is an honest umpire, and jump back to the red and then blue. Now, if you that is a limit of the small population size and small exploration rate, now opposite is this one, okay? Opposite is this one. Okay, very large population, then all the types exist and they will change slowly. We can that can be described well by differential equation. So we can perform some analysis. I don't have time to explain that today, but please look at the supplemental information of the original paper. And in two limits, I will just summarize this way: in population, small population limit, evolution. Evolution, you know, population is almost always monomorphic and jumps between different states. Now, this is example in small population limits. You can see these five vertex here, honest umpire dominates. Okay, now if umpire honest, then cooperation, cooperation will be more beneficial. Of course, defectors will be punished. Defectors will be punished. Now, among these two cooperators, sorry, optimistic and prudent cooperators, optimistic cooperators finally win because prudent cooperator must pay the cost for examining the type of, you know, to know the type of the umpire. But the type of the umpire is, you know, honest. So this optimist cooperator will win within this. And they will stay there. And they will stay there, assuming that this sort of cooperation lasts forever. Unfortunately, it's not true. Because this is optimistic, corrupt umpire can sneak in and take over. Once corrupt umpire dominates, then all sorts of defection, no, or defectors is sort of equivalent to the people who committed illegal loggings. And they will prevail. So, therefore, cooperator finds it needed to pay the cost and know the types. So, prudent cooperator eventually increase in number. So, then once that happens, then corrupt umpire will be replaced quickly by honest umpire. And then things go back to the original. So, there will be Markopian jump, stochastic jump, but is a no, no, no. But is a no, no, roughly speaking, they were always moving like this. Now, in the other extreme. Joe, you have about four minutes. Thank you. In the very large population with high exploration rate, this is like this. It's a typical situation. Most of the time, optimistic copies dominates. And then they just simply assume that there's a corruption, sorry. Corruption, sorry, corruption is absent, and you see corporations last forever. Unfortunately, while this happens, corrupt empire increase smoothly and becomes very large fraction. Once this happens, then all sorts of the defectors coming in. So, you know, corporation breakdown. And then cooperators become aware of need to pay the cost. Aware we need to pay the cost. So prudent cooperator increase. Once prudent cooperator increase, then corrupt umpire is replaced quickly by honest umpire and go back to blue and things go back to this. So this will perpetuate. So we can plot like this. There's a limit cycle, you see, and then this size of limit cycle depends on the exploration late exploration data. Exploration rate. Exploration rate is the same as a mutation. So if exploration is very high, then the size of this cycle becomes smaller, but it's extremely high, then they converge to the single equilibrium, which is stable. Now, if penalty is larger than certain threshold value and like this, lower than threshold value, we have a different path, you know, trajectory, but basically the same. But basically, the same. You see, if the exploration rate is large, then they will shrink and then finally combines to the equilibrium. Now, what is the conclusion of this? Unfortunately, corruption will not disappear. Corruption in this model stays forever. But corruption can exist at high abundance, see, in a very stable manner. And of course, Stable manner, and of course, the defection is prevailing. That is a state like this. Alternatively, like this, most of the time, it looks as if the cooperation dominates, but then suddenly breakdown of the cooperation occurs together with the prevalence of the corruptions. So corruption occasionally come back. Occasionally come back. So I think that I have to say that Dre explained the two models for eager logging syntropics. But you see that single phenomena has multiple aspects and they can be modeled by different mathematical models. And human environmental systems will provide us a good opportunity to develop new ways of the mathematical modeling. Thank you. Thank you very much, Joan, and thank you for. Thank you very much, Joe, and thank you for keeping right on schedule. And we have a lot of questions in the chat. Rebecca, you had the first one. You want to ask the question that you put in there? Okay, sure. Hi, Yo. So I put my question in before you started talking about corruption. So I said the community doesn't get the profit until the trees are cut. Is that correct? That's right. Yeah, okay. So they would have to trust the government to make good on its promise to give them their share of the profit. So I imagine that matters, the trust level? Probably, yes, that matters, yeah. Okay. But at least local government, sorry, Indonesian government claimed that was successful, and the people studying on the system seem to agree with that. So we would. Simply agree with that, so we would trust that one. Okay, I have myself will not go to the Java Island. Yes. And then what happens if the crop is destroyed through a natural disturbance? Who takes the loss? So they has to replanting the no no, the whole whole area is a national forest. So that belongs to the government, okay? So manager will arrange the replanting young trees. Replanting young trees and they wait for it becomes larger. That is structure. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Very good. Eli, you were next. Yeah, so Rebecca kind of followed up with what I was thinking about, which is natural variation disturbances creating risk, which would act like having another defector or multiple defectors in the system, regardless of what the empire can do. But also. But also, following up on Rebecca's question, is in order for them to trust the government payout, it seems like there also has to be well-functioning capital markets and risk markets in this setting. And so if you had corruption in the risk markets or the capital markets, that would there's a lot of other filters between what the umpire or the government can do and what the payoffs people are going to get actually is. And I was just curious if you've thought about those at all. You thought about those at all. Now, are you talking about the first talk from me, right? You can logging in Java. Yeah, no, what I was saying was following Rebecca asked my question about variation. And then I was thinking about Rebecca's question and thinking about not just that they have to be able to trust the government to make the payoff, but they actually have to be able to smooth consumption over time and be able to see it because they're getting punctuated. They're getting punctuated, like income isn't coming in at a regular scale, and they don't control when income comes, and they can't hedge risk. And so, it seems like there's more than there's more players in this system. And so, I'm just kind of curious about like, I guess, I guess it all boils down to noisy filters between the, like, it's not a matter of whether the umpire is corrupt or not. It's about whether or not there is a clear signal about the level of corruption. Signal about the level of corruption that the umpire has, right? The models I talk about is very simplistic. I agree, perfectly agree. But the first model also simplification, for example, you see, I talk as if the manager freely choose the alpha, that's a fraction of the profit sharing. You see, but in fact, it's not true. See, but in fact, it's not true. It's it's the outcome of discussion between local people and government. And so they can't change to the you know 25% to 20%. It's difficult. They must negotiate. But it's a poor simplicity of the modelings. I talk as if this is chosen by that player, this is chosen by that player. Once we start talking about the negotiation process, it's much more difficult. And then, you know, the other. And then, you know, reality is much more complex all the time, but we should focus on certain aspects, and then that can shed light on certain aspects. But that's, of course, I think that we can learn from the study of the theoretical biology. Of course, biology, reality is very complex, but we can sort of simplify certain aspects and how much we can understand the. Much we can understand the biological system, and we could accumulate these things, then we feel that we know what is happening, you know. And it's the same thing for the social, you know, human environment systems as well. Reality is very complex. Did you want to make your point about Erwin Bolte's work also? Oh, sure. I just put that in there so that you all had it. But there's a really nice paper from 1999 by. From 1999 by Erwin Bolte and Case Van Kooten that looks at elephant poaching and the incentives for regulators to control elephant poaching. And I think it has some nice connections and complementarities to what you've been doing. So you might just want to look at it for. Thank you very much. Mark, will someone be saving the chat at the end? It would be good to give it to the speakers. Let me ask Linda how to do that. Let me ask Linda how to do that. And yeah, I'll do that right now while you continue. Very good. Alan, you had a question about ITQs that maybe Nina answered, but I don't know if you want to raise that point. Alan, if you're speaking, we can't hear you. Is Alan still on? Maybe Nina, you want to summarize what Alan's point and your response to it was. Sure. So I think Alan was just asking whether or not some of the similar analyses were done with quota transfers in fisheries management. And so I put a link to, there's a recent book on game theory and fisheries economics. On game theory and fisheries economics that incorporated some of the idea of enforcement. So it doesn't explicitly deal with corruption in the same way, but it does have some elegant ways of incorporating responses against the potential for corruption by enforcement in the games. I think that might have been what Alan was getting at. That's the link that I put in is where I recall seeing things like that treated well. Thank you. We have time for one more. Thank you. We have time for one more question. And Friedoff, I see you've put something in the chat window. Do you want to raise your point? I was just surprised by how the government had set the rate of 25% and your analysis showed that the 25% was optimal. I was wondering if you know how the government came up with the 25%. Did they have their own modelers to look at that? To look at that? No, I think it's a negotiation, not so much a model. Of course, it can be estimated, you know, some profit and so on, but it's a negotiation process determines. It's not a result of the calculation, I think. But we try to understand some basic aspects of this one, you see. And so And also, there are uncertainties of some of the parameters. So, someone else can do a better job. Very good. Thank you very much. Thanks, everybody. Oh, Hans, we have time for you to ask your question. Okay, you want me to read it? Yeah, please. So, in the second part of your talk, you assumed that the bribes that were paid by these illegal types harvested. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Types harvesters, yeah, yeah, yeah, constant in time. But wouldn't it be more reasonable to build in some feedback mechanism that the bribe depends on the amount of risk that the illegal person takes? Yeah, possibly, yeah, yeah. So this very simple model, so just assume B, but so then we can get what kind of situations in which the bribe is controlled and not controlled and some inequality. And some inequalities, and so on. So, that's, of course, reality is complex. So, we can develop all sorts of ways and just the first step. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. So, there's a very short break built into the schedule, which we have three minutes for. I'm going to assume that break's put there for a purpose, not just a buffer, but in case people have things they have to do. Uh, things they have to do so.
