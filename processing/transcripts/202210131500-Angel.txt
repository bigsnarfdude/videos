As speaker this afternoon is Andres Angel from the Universidad Los Andes in Colombia, and he will talk about Mauritian variants of equivalent Lucy Michinaman category. Thank you, Miguel. First of all, I want to thank the organizers for the opportunity to be here. I want to apologize because I changed my talk. I changed my talk. Since Bernardo already talked most of the nice things about our work, I decided that a good opportunity to talk about something else. I think not cobalt is a morton spectra appear. Maybe some strings on group points can be seen behind. And that's a motivation, but I think I will let that until the end. So I'm going to talk about a generalization of Generalization of LS category. LS category was defined by Julie this week. So I'm going to talk about the Cubarian LS category and familiar versions. And what I want to show today is a proof of the Morita invariance of that notion. I'm not going to define what a Morita equivalent is until the end, but I'm going to show that for the basic blocks of a Morita equivalent. Of a Morita equivalence, we have the invariance. So wait until the end for the definition of Morita equivalence, but I think this way is easier to digest. One thing is that I follow a different tradition from Julie, and for me, the LS category of space is one more than his. So for me, it's really the number of open space. The number of open sets that you need to cover the space such that each open set is contractible inside X, the minimum number of that. You redefine it like one less than this. So we have seen in his talk that this is a very old invariant, very interesting, difficult to calculate. So I'm going to put a G and make it more difficult to even calculate, but I will prove some. But I will prove some properties of it. So one thing that is also important and it follows from our work is that we can take a relative version. So we take a subset of X and we ask for the minimum number of open sets that cover the space and each open set can be compressed. There is a homotopy from the inclusion to a map that has image inside that A. That has image inside that a, you know, like before we want to compress into points, you know, contractible inside x. And the main example that has appeared for a couple of decades now is the topological complexity of a space. So if I take x cross x and I take the diagonal inside, the relative Bustrange-Newman category of x cross x with respect to the diagonal is the topological complexity. Diagonal is the topological complexity. How many open sets do I need to cover x such that each open set can be compressed the form into the diagonal? This is not the way that normally it is defined. And normally you see this definition, this Michael Farber, early 2000s. So it's the minimum number of open sets for which you can find a section of this five. Of this vibration. You take maps from the interval to x, and you take the map that evaluates at zero and one, and you get into x cross x. So the relation between those two things can be seen in a picture, you know, like when you take a pair of points in UI and you apply a local section, a section defined that open set, then you get a map between those two points because that is a commuter. Those two points because that is a commutative diagram. If you shrink that path, that interval to the middle point, you get one point. And if you do that for all the sections, what you're doing is a homotopy from the inclusion of ui into the diagonal. Another way to think about it is what I'm doing is the replacement of the inclusion of the diagonal into x cross x by a vibration. So this L. Vibration. So this evaluation at zero, cross-evaluation at one is the replacement of the inclusion of the diagonal into x cross x. So when you see it like this, it's clear why if you take a disconnected space like S zero, I don't know what it is. Whatever. If you take a disconnected space like S zero, well, the topological complexity is infinite because you cannot cover those two points that can be connected. The two points that can be connected. If you take a space with a topological complexity of one, then actually any two points can be joined. But if you fix one, then you can contract the space. You know, topological complexity one is precisely when the space is contracting. And here we see something different from the Lusternik-Schneiderman category. We saw that for all the spheres is the same number, but the topological complexity for spheres here. The logical complexity for spheres here depends on the parity. If n is odd, then you need two. And if n is even, you need three. And the reason is because for n odd, you can find a non-zero vector field. So I'm just going to kind of explain it in the n equals one case. So the circle. So if you take two points that are non-antipodal, you can Are not antipodal, you can go from one to the other one by the shortest geodesic. Yeah, that's kind of one open set. And if you have the antipodal points, then you have two possibilities. So you cannot pick, but that's where you use the non-zero vector field. Like in the circle, you just say go to the left or go to the right. So you do that in bigger dimensions, and you see why for odd dimensions, the topological complexity is two. For spheres of even dimensions, Spheres of even dimensions, you also use a vector field, but now it's non-zero, not everywhere. But you can find one that in one point is zero, and then you have to cover like that point and not that point. So you have an extra open set. That's why it's three. So anyway, that's non-equivariant notions of category and relative category. This talk is about equivariant notions of LS category. So let's make some. So let's make some definitions to talk faster. So we say that a G-invariant subset is compressible if the inclusion map is G-homotopic to a map that lands into an orbit or in general an invariant subset A, G-compressible into A. And we say that is G-categorically. We can G compress it, homotope the identity to a map that lands in an orbit. That lands in an orbit, yeah. But see that I'm doing into an orbit, not into a point. I would need a global fixed point to you know talk about that, but in general, it's an orbit, so G categorical is not necessarily contract. Some definitions from equivarian homotopy: a G space is G connected if all the fixed points are path connected. This is like a very strong requirement, and many of the examples that And many of the examples that I care are not G-connected. But the good thing about G-connected spaces is that we have this lemma. And it's like if I have a G-connected space and I have two points and one has isotropy smaller than the other one. I don't know. I don't know. I see. If I have a isotropy smaller than the other. Isotropy smaller than the other one, then I actually compress you know one orbit to the to the other one, yeah. Just from the definition of a G-connected applied to GX. And from that, it follows that if I have a G-connected G space with a global fixed point, then every G categorical subset is G compressible to X. So actually, in Equal to x. So actually, in that case, g-connected with a global fixed point, the question about compressing into an orbit is the same as compressing into a global fixed point. But I'm going to be interested in spaces that do not necessarily satisfy this condition. Okay, so definition of the equivalent category is what you think is just the minimum number of open sets that are invariant, each one G categorical. The inclusion can be homotope, G equivalent. And the inclusion can be homotope G equivalently to a map that lands into an orbit. As before, this number is a lower bound for the number of critical points of invariant differentiable functions. So you can say that this is a number that is important to study critical points of equivalent functions. Some easy properties, like if we have two spaces that are G-homotopy equivalent, then these numbers are equal. Numbers are equal. That's an invariant of the G homotopy type. And one thing is that since we're talking about G invariant sets, G homotopies, you can restrict to fixed points and you have homotopies. And so you have this inequality and you can go to the quotient and have this inequality. And this last one, the category of the quotient less or equal than the equivalent category is the main, you know. Main, you know, subject of this talk and work. So, when do you have equality here? So, the and in the paper of Marcantovich in 1989, where he introduced this notion of equivalent category, he proved that when you have a compactly group acting freely on some nice space, then the equivalent category Then the equivarianlla category of X is the category of the quotient. So getting the other inequality. So actually, he proves more. He proves that when the action of G on X has only one orbit type, then we have this equality. Only one orbit type means that all isotropic groups are conjugate. And the main driving force of the talk is to try to generalize. Is try to generalize this equality to more general Morita equivalences and trying to explain that even though when you have one orbit type, you don't have a Morita equivalence, why this equality is true. So I will generalize this theorem and then use some observations of Borel about actions with one isotropy type to reprove this theorem. But what I'm trying to do is generalize it and understand it from a bigger perspective. A from a bigger perspective, okay. So, how can you prove this? I'm not going to do like the proof of Masantowicz, but it's kind of similar, but it will explain the tools, the simple tools that we'll use later. So when I have a free action, well, I have a principal bond, X to X mod G is a principal bond. And when you have a principal bundle, it's a vibration, so you can lift things. If I take If I take open sets in X mod J that can be compressed into a point, there is no action there, I can take the homotopy and consider this diagram and do the pullback. So here I have a principal G bundle. If I do the pullback, I have a principal G bundle, but I have a principal G bundle over something cross the interval. And because of the homotopy invariance of principal bundle. Of principal bundles, this pullback is of the form a principal G bundle cross I. This top map here is equivariant. So I have an equivariant map here on the top. I have something that is like u cross I, and that's the equivariant homotopy that compresses U into an orbit. You have to check some things, but that's basically the idea, like the. The idea, no, like the. How is the imitatorizable using that already? No, no, no. This is so this is Marcantovich's hypothesis for his use of the next zero. Okay? What I was going to say is that, yeah, you have to check that since the homotopy is from an inclusion, then this U is actually the restriction of the principal bundle to V, so it's an invariant of NZ. Is an invariant open set and the end of the homotopy lands in an orbit. And now, like, why do I have this extra hypothesis? It's because Marcantovich didn't do this proof. He used Palet theorem about lifting homotopies for actions that have one isotropy type. So that theorem needs the extra hypothesis. So I'm going to mention Palais covering homotopy theorem as stated in Bredon's book. As stated in Bredon's book on transformation groups. So you have a compactly group acting on a space such that all open sets are paracompact, that's the metrizable hypothesis to have that. You have an equivariant map and the induced map on the quotients. If I have a homotopy on the quotients that preserves the orbit structure, then you can lift it to an equivariant homotopy. So here I start with a homotopy. I start with a homotopy that needs to satisfy something that preserves the orbit structure, then you can lift it to an equivariant homotopy. If on the bottom I have three actions, well, everything preserves the orbit structure. If I have only one isotopy type, everything preserves the orbit structure. So that's how Marcin Tovis uses that proof. So in some sense, first I thought like, oh, I want to generalize a Palais covering homotopy theorem to a Cubarian case. Equivarian case, but I ended up doing something different that I think is better than I want to explain. Okay, so that was like the equivalent LS category in 1989. Helen Coleman and Mark Grant in 2012 defined equivariant topological complexity just by taking the definition of topological complexity and putting a G. So now X, a G acts on X, so G acts diagonally on X. So g acts diagonally on x cross x, g acts on maps from the interval to x, and you require everything to be equivariant. So in terms of relative equivalent category, this is this, the equivalent category of x plus x with respect to g relative to delta x. But it turns out that this notion does not satisfy that you have a free action, then the equivalent topological complexity is the topological. Equivalent topological complexity is the topological complexity of the quotient. So, this follows from some examples, but for some properties, like again, if I have two G spaces that are G homotopy equivalent, then the equivariant topological complexity is the same. Since everything in the definition is equivariant, I can restrict to fixed points. So, if it is not G-connected, then it's infinity. And the good thing is, like, I can't restrict. And the good thing is, like, I can restrict to subgroups, no, and I can restrict to fixed points of other subgroups. In particular, I have a bound, Tcg of X is greater or equal than Tc of X. And with that bound, we see, for example, that if I take S1 acting on itself by multiplication, Tc of S1 equivalent is at least two. But S1 acting on S1 is a free action. One acting on S1 is a free action, the quotient is one point. So it cannot satisfy that when I have a free action, the equivariant topological complexity of X is the topological complexity of the quotient. So this does not satisfy what LS category did. Turns out that two years later, Marcantovich again with Dubowski defines something that does satisfy that property. And here, where are the strings on the Here, where are the strings on a group start to appear? So the main thing is like, if I have g acting on x and I consider x cross x, then maybe the diagonal action is not the correct one for this purpose. Is g cross g acting on x? The problem is that if I consider g cross g acting on x cross x, then how can I put g cross g to act on maps from the interval? act on maps from the interval to x. So what Marcantos did was to consider broken path spaces. X to the i cross x to the i, but you know, it's fire product of the over the map to x mod g. So this is our like paths, then a jump to an element in the orbit and a path. So our broken paths where in the middle you have like two points that are in the same orbit. This can be expressed in terms of equivalent. Express in terms of relative equivariant LS category, and it is the G cross G L S category of X cross X relative to the saturation of the diagonal with respect to the G cross G action. They call it Dalet, Dalet of X. And it turns out that it is a G homotopy invariant. So two G spaces are G homotopy equivalent, and this gives the same number. You actually can. Number you actually can restrict to the quotient and to fixed points, but just for g not for all the other subgroups. So here we have one of the inequalities that we need to prove the equality. And in his paper, Marcantovich, again with the Palais-Homotopy covering theorem, proved that the invariant topological complexity of a free action is the topological complexity of the quotient. So we have these two notions: equivariantless category and the invariant topological complexity, and they both satisfy that if you have a free action, then it's actually the non-equivariant notion of the quotient. And I want to explain how to generalize that. So, also, he proved it for the one orbit, only one orbit type. I'll explain that later. This is the example. This is the example. Well, S1 and S1 gives you one because the quotient is one point. But the space itself has topological complexity two. So there is no inequality between the Tc of X and the invariant topological complexity of X. So you cannot restrict to any subgroup, just the bigger one. Okay, so we proved with Helen Coleman, Margran, and John Opria that if G compactly If G compactly grouped acts on a metrizable space and you have a collection of G invariant subsets, then this more general notion of relative equivalent LS category is more invariant. So like for LS category, I'm compressing into orbits. So the A is the collection of orbits. So we just put any collection of invariant subsets. I'm not going to say in this moment what is more it invariant, but I'm going to say first, the first examples of First, the first examples of Morita equivalence is when I have a normal closed subgroup that acts freely, then Maurita invariance will mean that the equivariant category of X is the equivariant category G mod X of X mod X. And we also prove, well, following from this theorem follows that the invariant topological complexity of Lubowski Mazantovich satisfies the same idea. So I'm going to try to explain the proof of this. Of these of these, uh, of these two, or the in this case, the main theorem. So, again, we have one inequality that just follows from passing to the quotient from g to g mod k. For the other one, we again take this bundle. X acts freely, so X to X mod K is a principal K bundle, but it's more than that, it's actually a G. More than that, it's actually a G equivariant principle K bond. So the proof that I gave at the beginning, I'm going to try to follow it using G equivariant principle bond. So even for this example, taking the quotient by a normal subgroup, I have to talk about equivariant principle bundles with an alpha, with a twist. So let me give you the definition. So we have a homomorphic. We have a homomorphism from a group gamma to the automorphism of G, and then a gamma and gamma equivariant principal G bundle is a principal G bundle where gamma acts on the total space and on the base. This is equivariant, and we have some compatibility between the action of gamma on the left and G on the right. Here appears the Here appears the homomorphism. So, if you think about it, what really I'm saying is that there is a semi-direct product, and that semi-direct product acts here. That's one way to say. And the thing is, like when I have a normal closed subgroup that acts freely, I have this G equivariant principle button. And the action, I mean, the homomorphism from in this case. In the homomorphism from in this case, G to the automorphism of K is given by the conjugation. So you just check the action here is what you think in K from the right. So you write the equations and you realize that this is. And there are some point set topology conditions that are needed, metrizable para-compactness, is to have this, the homotopy invariance of G equivalent principal bundles. G equivari principle bundles and a conclusion from that that basically G vibration that I have a G vibration. So it's the same as I did before. Like if I have an equivariant principle bundle over something cross I, then actually it's a G equivariant principle bundle cross I. And from that, I could do the same proof as before, but actually it's easier to just from this fact prove that a G equivariant principle bundle is a G vibration. But I need some conditions, numerable matrices. Conditions, numerable metric, and para compactness. So, the same proof that I showed before works, like if I take in X mod K, a G mod K categorical set, so open set with a homotopy that ends in an orbit. Then I can take, I have this B inside here, so I take the pre. This B inside here. So I take the pre-image, and that gives an open set here in X. And I consider the composition of the homotopy and the projection cross-identity. So I have a homotopy here. I take the identity cross-inclusion from zero to the interval and inclusion here. And because I have here a G vibration, then I can find a lift. So I take that lift because I have a G vibration and I change. Because I have a G vibration and I check that actually the lift ends in a G orbit, proving the other inequality. You can do it also with the homotopy invariance, but it was just show both. So actually, this proof works with a relative equivalent category and with family. So I just take a class of invariant subsets of X and I consider the quotient by K, just checking the. Quotient by k just checking the quotient of each element, then the same proof you just check gives that the equivariant LS category respect to A is the equivariant with respect to G mod K of relative to A mod K of X mod K. No, here K acts freely. That's the only thing. What difference K? What is the K is a closed normal subgroup that acts freely. It could be the trivial group. Yeah. But then Yeah, but then this equality is trivial too. And if it is the whole group, it gives Marcantovich well special case for free action. And here we see why invariant topological complexity also satisfies this kind of equalities because the length of x, the saturation of the diagonal, when you mod out by k cross k gives you the length of the quotient. So it actually fits. The quotient. So it actually fits everything and gives you that generalization of Marcantovich theorem. Yeah. So I take Gx and HX. So that's the first type of modita equivalence, taking the quotient by a closed normal subgroup. A closed normal subgroup that acts freely. The second type of Mauriti equivalence are inductions. So, induction is just you take a closed subgroup H of G, H acting on X, then I can consider G acting on G cross X mod H. And it turns out that L S equivariant category and invariant topological complexity satisfy that they are invariant under inductions. So, H. So H equivalent LS category of X is the G L S category of G cross X mod H and the same for invariant of all complexity and it works for family. So if I take a family B of H equivalent subsets, I take the induction and I have this theorem. Actually, the proof can be given following the same ideas as before, because there is a principal H bundle that is J equivariant. H bundle that is j equivariant. So g cross x to the induction is an H bundle that is G equivariant. So you can try to follow the same proof, but actually you can use the previous proof to prove this. And I find it very nice. So that's what I'm going to show. So it's two applications of the previous proof that will give you this. So if you prove it for the first part of Morita equivalences, then you have it for the second one. I find it interesting. I find it interesting. So for here, I consider the g cross H action on G cross X, G on the left acting here, and H on the right and on X. So this gives me an action of G cross H and G cross X. G cross H has two natural normal subgroups, G and H. And it turns out that they act freely. So we can apply this theorem twice. So we can apply this theorem twice. So I can take g cross h category of g cross x quotient by h. So here I get the induction and here I get the g category and with some family. And I can take the quotient by g so we can take the quotient by g here I have h and here I have x. So if we put together this and check that for in the families it gives what it needs to give. Families, it gives what it needs to give. Then I have that the G category of the induction with relative to families is the H category of X. So that proves actually the second type of Mauriti equivalence, the invariance under those, and it will give an extension of Mars and Tovich's theorems, except for the part of one isotropy type. Part of one isotropy type. This equivalence here really not cannot exist in general when you have actions with subgroups that don't do anything. Like with when you have like one isotropy tribe, there are really no natural morita equivalence. So there is something else. And then that's what I want to explain now. So one isotropy type action. So again, when you have a free action, X to A free action x to x mod g is a principal g bundle. Now, if I have one isotropy type, not free action, but all the stabilizers are conjugate to g mod H, actually this quotient from X to X mod G is not a principal G bundle, but it's a fiber bundle. The fiber now is G mod H and has structure group, the normalizer of H inside G mod H. So before we H. So before we had a principal G bundle, so we and here we just have a fiber bundle. But there are more bundles when you have actions with one isotropy type. So it's Ledon says that it's an observation of Borel that there is another vibration when you have one isotropic type. So it turns out that when you have one isotropic type, X mod G is homeomorphic to is homeomorphic to taking the space of fixed points by h of x and moding out by the normalizer of h. And actually, the normalizer of h, mod h, acts freely on this space. So really, here you have to do some identifications, but really you have here a principal bundle from the fixed points of x to the quotient x mod g, and the group is the normalizer of h mod h. Yeah, so this is another. Mod H, yeah. So this is another bundle different from the previous one, but there is a relation between the two ones. So actually, it turns out that this principal bundle, when you change the fiber to G mod H, gives you this one. So this is the associated bundle. So what I'm saying is that there is a G homomorphism between G mod H cross and H mod H X H to X. And I'm close to an induction here. I'm close to an induction here, but it's not an induction because G mod H is not a group. Yeah, so it's almost ready to apply one of the theorems that I had before, but it's not an induction in the sense that I was considering. But I'm taking mod H here, mod H here, so you can just ignore them. Actually, check that the natural map from the induction from the normalizer of H to G of X H gives you. Of XH gives you a space that is G homeomorphic to X. So, really, when you have one isotropic type, the space X is the induction of the fixed points that has an action of the normalizer of H. And then I can put my previous theorems. So, suppose that I have a compact Lie group acting with only one isotropy type, then as I said before, X is G homeomorphic. X is G homeomorphic to the induction. So, by one of the theorems, the NH category of XH is the G category of the induction. But because of this G homeomorphism, this is the G category of X. The same for invariant topological complexity. So we are almost there, but it turns out that there is something special about There is something special about LS category or invariant TC that we do not see in other invariants that satisfy Morita invariance. So what other topological invariants that we work with satisfy this type of isomorphism? That when you have a free action, the G equivariant thing of X is the same as the G mod K of X mod K. So K equivariant K theory. So, equivalent K-theory, and for example, equivariant cohomology. So, equivariant cohomology and equivalent K-theory also satisfy Mauritio invariance, but they do not satisfy that if I have a trivial subgroup of the whole group is acting trivially, then it doesn't matter. We know that in equivalent K-theory, if the group acts trivially, then you have the representation group there. We know in equivalent cohomology that if the Equivariant cohomology: that if the group acts trivially, then the group cohomology of the group appears here. In equivariant LS category and the relative family versions, it's irrelevant, because we are talking about homotopy of G things. And if a subgroup does not do anything, it doesn't matter. I can go from G to G mode, the subgroup if the subgroup is normal. So something that is special about equivalent category is that, well, H Is that, well, H acts trivially on XH and H is normal in NH. So I can pass from the NH category of XH to the NH mod H category of XH. And the same thing for invariant topological complexity. And as we said before, I said before, NH mod H acts really on the fixed points, and this quotient is the same as X mod G. So now using Morita invariance for. So, using Morita invariance for free actions, we have that this nh mod H category of XH is the category of the quotient. And if we put together the things here, we recover Mars-Antomi's theorem. So, what I was trying to show here, and I was trying to do is generalize Mars and Thomas' theorem to more general equivalences, the more equivalences, but also I realized that you can explain even the fact for actual The fact for actions with one isotropy type using this, well, the structure of spaces with one isotropy type. So I think now I can give the definition of Morita equivalence. What I did is what I think is more important. I showed you two types of Morita equivalences, and I will explain to you now what is a Morita equivalence and explain why those two generate all of them. Generate all of them. So, this we're talking about actions of groups on space. If I take g acting on x, then I can consider a topological group point where the objects are just the points of x. So, x is the space of objects. And the space of morphisms is g cross x. And I use the action to get the morphisms. And the composition of the hours is just the multiplication of the group. Just the multiplication of the group. That's a topological group point. And I can consider continuous functors, you know, between those types of group points. These group points are called translation group points. And we use this notation. G think X is the translation groupoid associated to the action of G on X. And when you have two of those things, G acting on X and H acting on J on Y, then On y, then an equivariant map, maybe not the not the best name, is a pair of things, no, the functor. At the level of objects, you have a map, bar epsilon, from x to y. And at the level of morphisms, what actually we require is we have a homomorphism from g to h, and we require that is equivariant with respect to that homomorphism. So it's like g spaces, but now we. G spaces, but now we are allowing homomorphism between the groups. And now we want to say when two of these translation groups should be considered equivalent to give the same, as Ernesto would say, C infinity, Artin stack, or beefa. Anyway, I'm not going to use those names, or maybe, but I'm just going to say now when two of them are equivalent. Of them are equivalent, and the equivalents are generated by essential equivalence. So, let me first define an essential equivalent. So, it's one of these equivariant maps that satisfy, that are essentially surjective and fully faithful. You know, like we know that in categories, what is essentially surjective is every object on the target is connected by an arrow to the real image. So, now we want to say it in a topological setting, and here is like. A topological setting, and here is like we take a pullback and we add some map to be an open surjection. And when we are grouping, when we're working with smooth things, we actually require to have some local sections of this map. And fully faithful means that the functor at the level of morphisms induces a bijection between the home sets. Here we say that in a topological setting, and it's like we take a pullback and we want a homeomorphism from that. And we want a homeomorphism from that pullback to something, like some continuity of behind the isomorphism between the homes. So this is an essential equivalence. And with the essential equivalence, we can finally define what is a Morita equivalence. So we say two of these translation group points are Morita equivalent. If there is a span, group, zigzag, I think many words. I think many words are used for this of essential equivalence. So, essential equivalence and essential equivalence. The thing is, like, since we put like topological conditions on essentially subjectiveness and fully faithfulness, then we cannot invert like in the category. So, really, we have a roof or sea stacks of things. But this is kind of difficult to manage, but. Manage, but there are ways to define this using principled by bundles and stuff. But Pronc and Skull realize that an essential equivalence can be factored into two type of more essential equivalents. So, every essential equivalence between translation group points is a composite of taking a quotient by a closed normal subgroup acting freely. Those normal subgroups acting freely and an induction. So for those two types of essential equivalence, I showed that L S category relative and with families is invariant. So by this result, then it falls for any Morita equivalence. So actually, this theorem or proposition is very useful to check that something is invariant under Morita equivalence. On their Morita equivalence, but actually, it's very natural when you take an essential equivalence. The factorization is kind of a generalization of the isomorphism theorems from group theory. It's like you take G, then G, and a homomorphism, then G mod the kernel is isomorphic to the image, and then the image is contained in the other group. So it is like. Group. So it is like a version of that into translation group. It's like first you take the quotient by the kernel of the homomorphism that is at the level of morphisms. So then you take that kernel actually you show acts freely on X. So you go from G acting on X to G mod the kernel of V, X mod the kernel of V. Then G mod the kernel of V is isomorphic to the image. That is a subgroup. Isomorphic to the image that is a subgroup of H. And that's like first isomorphism theory of group theory. But at the level of spaces, you also realize that X mod the kernel of P is homeomorphic to the real, to the actual image of the functor at the level of objects. So you have a subset of Y. And then you do the induction from the image subgroup acting on the image subset to the actual group. Set to the actual group. So it's very, I don't know, natural. And how with time? Okay, so okay, I think I went fast. So this is one example to show that you can use this to calculate something. So actually someone classified uh someone classified all five dimensional all five dimensional closed manifolds with what with actions of su2 and one isotropy type this is a phd thesis of fabio luis vorges from impa i found it online and the possible subgroups and normalizers are in this list you know some some are finite and some others are not and the good thing is that he actually thing is that he actually constructed these manifolds calculated all the subgroups normalizers quotients and the quotient so actually what i just did was to to take this classification and calculate the category so actually one funny thing is that these five-dimensional manifolds if you see the definition here they look like inductions so it's like induction from So it's like induction from S1 to SU2 of S3. But actually the action of S1, this set, has some exponents here. So actually it's not an induction by a subgroup H into G, but there are two homomorphisms, the power to the minus L, well, to the L and to the M. So actually, even though this is a generalized induction, it's not the induction from a subgroup. The induction from a subgroup, so you cannot apply directly our theorems. But anyway, you define it like that, and you construct some of the examples. The good thing is that Fabio actually used theory from five-dimensional manifolds to show that these are actually different market to S3 cross S2 and the quotient is S2. This is what I really care. So actually, I can just say, you know, like the So actually, I can just say, you know, like the LS category, invariant TC, and some other things that are called higher invariant TC are just the category and TC of this S2. And this, and that we know how to calculate, it gives you two and three. So it's a little bit artificial, but it shows that actually, if you try to use this example and calculate equivariant K-theory, then you have a little problem. So, because in the last part, I said that equivariant category is ignored. Is ignores the fact that a subgroup acts trivially, but K-theory does not. So, in fact, with Bernardo Uribe and Jose Manuel and Mario Elázquez and Orbecera, and before Bernardo and Jose Manuel, studied the compositions of equivalent K-theory when there is a closed normal subgroup that acts trivial. And in that decomposition, some terms of twisted K-theory appear. Of twisted case theory appear. So if you compare this result, I don't have it here, but if you compare the result for equivariantless category or invariant TC with the result with equivalent K-theory, you see like the benefit of these theorems. I think I'm going to stop here if it is okay. Thank you. Are there any questions for Andres here in the room in Oaxaca? We only have one microphone, so. Andres will come to you. Camera, come here. Andres, so, and what are the relations whenever you simply take a subgroup and but leave the space as it is? And what is the relation between? The space as it is, and what is the relation between the cat g x and cat h the same x? This is this is getting away with the morita equivalence class. This is just there is an inequality, not equality with the portion. No, no, no, no. So, there is no specific relation whatsoever. If you don't require that the action is free or the action has one isotropy type, I don't think you have. But nothing, just an inequality. Inequality and maybe the inequality comes because you have a definition where everything is g invariant and then you restrict to h and everything works. But even with the P C, when you restrict to H, your broken path space changes. So even for invariant T C, you don't have, but as a relative version. But even in the absolute case, you just have an inequality. But no, like if the groups are just finite. The groups are just finite, yeah, and so one wouldn't expect that it's just g mod h times the other one or something like that. No, no, no, I don't think so. Okay, okay, awkward, but yeah. Any other questions? Well, I wanted to ask one. So you gave us the definition of Morida equivalences. Morida equivalences for translation group points. Is it true that there's morida equivalence? Is there a marida equivalence between two translation group points if and only if, in the sense of this definition, where the thing in the middle is a translation group point? Is that equivalent to allowing it to be any topological group point? Yeah, in Prongen's call, they actually consider like the translation group points inside topological group points. Inside topological group points and prove that you can consider only translation groups. Okay. So somehow you just need to consider the by category of translation group points when you invert these things to get the same thing as the by category of topological group weights when you invert the generalized definition. So we saw a talk by Ernesto where he proved that every orbifer can be presented. Every orbit can be presented by a translation group. So, by the machinery of progress code, any presentation of those two should be equivalent by also translation group with Noah. Are there any other questions? Maybe questions from the Zoom audience? If so, just unmute your microphone and ask. Ask keep turning to look at Andy in the corner of the screen. Yep. So, well, if there are no further questions for Andres, let's thank him again.
