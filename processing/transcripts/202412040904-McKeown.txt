Compact Einstein. So everything so far is conformally compact. The Einstein part is that it also satisfies re g of V plus is equal to negative N G plus. So of course this has been an incredibly deeply studied problem over the last 40 years, the Feckerman-Graham program and all the ADS-CFT stuff. A CFT stuff, and many people in this room have contributed important things to the study of this problem. And of course, we're also often willing to settle for a formally Einstein metric. So something that satisfies, say, reg plus equals negative ng plus plus something that manages to high order of the boundary pipe. So it follows, if you have such a metric, it follows Such a metric, it follows from the Einstein equations fairly straightforwardly that, well, actually, first, sorry, before I do that, let me introduce brand new normal form. So given any h in the conformal infinity, there exists, let's say. Let's say an epsilon greater than zero is sufficiently small. There exists a unique etheomorphism psi from zero epsilon log in the r variable cross m into x, the caller neighborhood of the boundary, such that Such that the metric G plus pulls back as DR squared plus GR over R squared with G sub R a one parameter family of tensors. Of tensors on M and G0 equals H. So we get this nice normal form that is slightly reminiscent of the upper half-space model of hyperbolic space, except g sub r may not be as simple as the Euclidean metric, of course. And these normal forms are exactly parametrized by the different elements of formal infinity. Different elements of conformal infinity, the g sub zero becomes when you go all the way out to the boundary. So if you and this is extremely useful, this normal form for studying sort of the conformal the relationship between the conformal geometry of the boundary and the interior. Now, if you assume the metric is in this form and you plug this into the Einstein equation, you very quickly can deduce some consequences for G sub R, which is kind of the only three. For G sub R, which is kind of the only three-part in the normal form. So this normal form, I should say, exists just for conformally compact, or technically that's sometimes a hyperbolic compatriot. It doesn't have to be Einstein. It is. So if B plus is Einstein, then one can show G sub R is G sub r is equal to h plus r squared times g2 plus r to the fourth g4 plus even powers plus and we get up to let's say r to the n log r times. log r times o plus r to the n g n plus dot dot dot where the dot dot dot is no longer necessarily even. But there are some additional things I can say where O is equal to zero if n is odd and that's the trace of the normal normal. Let's see trace with respect to H of Gn equals zero. So you have evenness up to order n and one beyond if n is even, and you have this basic expansion. Now g n is always, so everything is formally determined by h. So if you know h, you can completely explicitly compute g2, d4, and so on, up to gn. And so on. Up to Gn, sorry, including O, is locally determined. Gn is not locally determined. That's the so-called globally determined term. The global term in the expansion. If you know H and G, N, then everything after that is globally determined. Okay, so the renormalized, so these metrics fairly obviously have infinite volume because the metric flows up to second. Because metric flows out to second-order boundary. So, just like hyperbolic space itself, they all have a volume. But one can renormalize the volume in a procedure that I think was first alluded to by Witten and carried out by Henningsen and Skanderis and almost at the same time by Graham. So, I'll follow Graham's exposition. So, consider The volume with respect to G plus of the set where R is greater than epsilon. So this has the expansion. This is followed by the asymptotic symmetric very easily. It's C0 epsilon to the negative n plus C2 epsilon to the 2 minus n. epsilon to the 2 minus n plus dot dot dot actually let me just write them all in c1 epsilon to the 1 minus n plus dot dot dot plus n epsilon to the negative 1 plus we will call it e log of 1 over epsilon plus v plus little o of 1. Of one. So the theorem, goes back to again Hemmings and Skandera's 99-ish, 98, 99, is CJ is equal to 0 if J is odd. So if n is odd, n is odd, then E is equal to zero and V is conformally invariant. Now, what do I mean by conformally invariant? Well, this volume is always taken with respect to the same metric G plus, but the set. Plus. But the set is the set where r is greater than epsilon, and there are a bunch of these different geodesic defining functions, r. In fact, they're in one-to-one correspondence with the form of kineticity. And so a priori, one should expect that the volume would depend on the choice of which r, which h we chose. But it does not, if n is odd. If n is even Even then that's not true, but then E is conformally invariant in the same sense. Now, the proof of this really depends, it just goes down to this parody in this expansion of G sub R. If you look at the volume form and write it. And write it a little cleverly, then it has an even expansion. And when you look, if you look at, say, the volume, the set where the volume, volume of the set where R is greater than epsilon, the volume of the set where, say, R hat is greater than epsilon, where R hat corresponds to some other metric, H hat. Look at the difference, then that's a sum of integrals in powers of epsilon, and because of this parity phenomenon, there's just no. There's just no zeroth order contribution to that in the case to end. Okay, next I want to talk about Anderson's variation result. Michael Anderson, I think I should have these dates better memorized. I think this was only three, plus or minus one, let's say. So one might want to ask, how does this change if you change the asymptotic hyperbolic ionsy metric, or maybe change the conformal infinity? So Suppose G plus T is a family of formally compact Einstein metrics on X inducing Conformal class H sub T. So suppose, I don't know, let's say chi is d h d t at t equals 0, where you've chosen some h and I'm waving my hand over some details. And roughly speaking, the derivative of volume with respect to t. With respect to t is some constant times the integral over m of the integral of the inner product of g n. Here we're assuming n is odd. In fact, in Anderson's case, we're assuming n is 3, I should say. G n inner product is high dv. So roughly speaking, this non-local term is exactly the variation. Is exactly the variation of the volume with respect to changes of the metric. And I'm again waving my hands over some details here. Okay, so that's a very concise, I hope, or fear, introduction to renormalized volume on asymptotic hyperbolic Einstein metrics. It's been very deeply studied problem. Lots have been done with it. Problem lots have been done with it. It can be related to scattering theory because the Gauss-Benet theorem, in fact, in the same paper by Anderson, that's how he proved its gradation formula in four dimensions. And so on. But I want to now sort of jump all the way forward to 2017 when both Graham and Gover Waldron considered this same problem, but for singular Mabi metrics instead. So let me just remind Remind about what those are in this setting. So let's say we have now just a Riemannian manifold xn plus 1g. This is a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary. Okay? Nothing's blowing up. And it has a boundary m and a boundary of x. Okay, so the singular Mauvi problem. Going back to Liam Nirenberg, in the case of domains in Rn and the model as McCohen for compact manifolds with boundary, asks one to find u greater than zero, u greater than or equal to zero. A defining function for m, meaning the same thing it did before, it vanishes exactly on m, exactly the first order, such that g plus equals u to the negative 2g satisfies scalar curvature of v plus, which is negative n. Which is negative n times n plus 1. Now, the existence problem for the Einstein metrics I'm just talking about is extremely hairy and fraught to this day. And there are relatively few cases where we can know that there exists a funky Einstein metric and stuff. The picture for the singular modding problem is as nice as it could possibly be. For any compact manifold, there exists a unique such U. So, and there are no additional hypotheses. There are no additional hypotheses on anything, which always exists one. Okay, so now you itself, so Matteo, so Abeles McCohen, so Abeles McCohen existence and uniqueness. Matzeo showed that U is positive. Matzeo showed that U is polymorphogeneous. This is in 1991. Meaning it can be expanded in powers of distance to the boundary and logs. So we're now going to let r of little x be the distance with respect to g from little x to boundary. Boundary. So, this is a change in the meaning of R. And having chosen such an R, U can be expanded in the following form. So U is always of the form R plus R squared U2 plus dot dot dot plus R to the n plus 1 Un plus 1 plus R to the n plus 2 log R. log r times, let's say, L plus R to the N plus 2 U to the N plus 2 plus I over L. So there is no parity behavior in general here, n even n odd or the same. None of these terms generically vanishes. And you get a lot of term at order n plus 2 in general. term at order n plus 2 in general and in every both parities. Everything is formally determined once again up until they include an L, but n plus 2 is not. So once again the term at the log order is not formally determined which is a pretty general behavior of these things. Okay, so one can consider once again the volume with The volume with respect to g plus of the set r is greater than epsilon. r now being the distance to the boundary measured with respect to our original compact metric. And once again, we get c0 epsilon to the negative n plus c1 epsilon to the 1 minus n plus dot dot dot plus c n epsilon to the n. Cn epsilon to the negative 1 plus E log of 1 over epsilon plus V plus little O1. Well, we don't have any nice looking parity behavior here, so it's not a surprise that we don't have parity changes in the result. So the theorem here, and again due to Graham and Gober-Waldron, I'm stating the form, there's very slight differences in stating the form as Graham did, but they're essentially the same theorem, is that E is always. A conformal invariant. Now that this means a slightly different thing, this time we're not using the normal form. What it means this time is if I make a conformal change to the whole thing, to g, so I replace g hat by, or g by e to the 2 omega g globally on x, well that, of course, well, okay, first of all, because by uniqueness of the singular Yamabi metric, it might Singular Yamabi metric, if I make that conformal change and then solve for the singular Yamabi metric for that function, I will get the same constant scalar curvature metric. If I didn't, then there would have to be two such metrics in the conformal class, which there aren't. So I am measuring both volumes with respect to the same metric, but I'm using completely different distance functions. And so the theorem is the log term is nevertheless the same. Something I should have said, by the way, even in the Einstein. I should have said, by the way, even in the Einstein case, the log in the, when n is even and it's the log term that's invariant, that is an integral over the boundary of a local curvature quantity. Whereas the volume itself, when it's invariant in the n equals odd case, that's not the integral of the local invariant. Well, this, similar to the Einstein case, this is the integral of, so it is the integral. Integral of the local extrinsic in this case extrinsic invariant in fact. In fact, in the lowest, in the n equals 2 case, this is the Wilmore energy. And so this E is often taken to be a generalization to higher dimensions of Wilmore energy. One of a few ways of doing that. Okay, well, one can also consider the variation problem here. Okay, so uh this time we keep g fixed and we suppose that we vary the boundary in x. So we move it in or out. Suppose we vary m in x, so maybe we have So maybe we have some embedding, negative epsilon, epsilon cross m into x. I guess technically you want to make it into some slight extension of x because it's going to go out, but that hurt. And then, so this thing will have some variation field, so let n be d dt at equals zero. equals zero. I'm actually going to call it S for consistency later with the talk. So d ds at s equals zero of f of s dot. So this is a normal vector field on m, and this can be written as some f times mu, where this is the, say, Say unit normal on M. So then the derivative with respect to s at s equals 0 of E is the integral over m of M of F times exactly L H, and we're going to call H just U refers to M. So L is this log coefficient in the expansion of U and so the variation of the energy term is just exactly the Exactly, the log coefficient that was matching two. Which is a little bit analogous to what happened in the Einstein case, although in the Einstein case, it was a non-local term on the left and a non-local term that appeared on the right. Okay, so that is. So the L is also extrinsic conditions or just intrinsic? Which is extrinsic? The AL. L is also extrinsic, thank you. Yes. So L is locally determined but extrinsic, by which I mean it may have, you know. I mean, it may have second fundamental form, then higher conformal second fundamental form, and all kinds of stuff. I guess, and Andrew or Sam or tell you everything about all the things that go into Maybole. Okay, so that's all background. So the setting we want to consider is now we have a manifold, and I've been bad. I'm sorry, I should have thought ahead. But I'm going to switch now and m is going to be the ambient manifold. Or I guess maybe I'll try to be consistent. I'm not focused on it. I'll stick with X being the ambient manifold. Okay? And, but. And but let's use sigma now for a closed so I want now x to be a closed manifold, compact without boundary, and sigma is going to be an embedded sub-manifold of codimension, prior codimension, in general. So n here is the dimension of sigma, and k is the codimension of sigma, right? And the one restriction I want to put for most of the I wanted to put for most of the talk is that k, the codimension, should be less than n is 2. So that means sigma should be about half the dimension or a little bit less, but not too much more than that. Okay? So the reason, so Connor and I wanted to study this problem where, because Abel S. McCohen actually also studied this problem. Also, studied this problem in the singular model setting. So it is the case that there exists a unique u greater than zero such that v plus equals u to the negative, u greater than zero, I should say. Smooth on x takeout sigma. This is going to be m if you read the paper. I'm sorry about this. Confusing you now or confuse you later. Okay, on x takeout sigma such that g plus equals u to the negative 2g has scalar curvature R sub G plus equals negative n plus 2 minus K times N plus K minus 1. This constant just works out better than the other constants. You'll see this is still negative curvature because this guy we stipulated was positive. And so this is again really and So this is again really and plus is complete, we should say. So this is really nice. Again, you have, so u goes to zero at sigma. So sigma is set off to we have existence and uniqueness. So it's natural to want to study the extrinsic geometry of sigma using this problem. This has been done. Problem, this has been done for putimental one case. And so we were interested in considering the renormalized volume in this setting. So Maseo in the same paper actually considered polyhomogeneity of this setting. So Maseo 91 U as the expansion. Expansion. So we're going to now let t be the distance from a point to sigma. So y t not r, well, call it, we want to, it's not smooth, right? r is smooth. We want to keep it uppermost in mind that we're working with a function that's no longer smooth and sigma because it's higher co-dimension, right? If you have a function that vanishes on a higher co-dimension, so manifold is not smooth. Okay, so. That's good. Okay, so u is equal to t plus t squared u2 plus dot dot dot plus p to the n plus 1 u n plus 1 plus t to the n plus 2 log t times L plus plus e to the n plus 2 u2 plus uh u n plus 2 rather. Actually, this is not quite right. Sorry. Me. So there's a T V n plus 1 plus delta u sub m plus 1 plus delta, where delta is strictly between, I'll write that down in a second, plus t to the n. plus t to the n plus 2 log t l plus t to the n plus 2 u n plus 2 plus dot dot dot. Okay. So what Mateo actually showed is that the thing is polyhomogeneous. We're writing down the consequences of that specifically in this particular presentation. Okay, so where, first of all, delta Delta is between 0 and 1. So you have a strictly non-integral power appearing between n plus 1 and n plus 2. And then each coefficient is a function on S and sigma, the sphere normal bundle over sigma. So if you want to, you can think of blowing up sigma and replacing it with like a cylinder around itself, which is your normal bundle. And that's where all of these functions use. That's where all of these functions, u2, u3, delta u m plus 1, m plus delta l, and all of these things live, right? Yeah, L is local, but yes, thank you. So, that's right. So, T, all of these are local. Okay, so all of them are local through U n plus one and also L. And also L but Un plus 1 plus delta and U n plus 2 are not the deltas that are locally determined. Delta is locally determined. Delta is dimensionally determined. Delta here is rational or not necessarily? It's not rational. Okay. Yeah. It's a non-injurial solution of a quadratic. Okay, so um right so We can consider, once again, the volume of this with respect to g plus of the set where t now is bigger than epsilon. And not too surprisingly at this point, this looks like c0 epsilon to the negative n C1 epsilon to the negative 1 minus n. negative 1 minus n plus dot dot dot plus c n epsilon to the negative 1 plus e log of 1 over epsilon plus e plus little o 1. Now you'll notice there's no apparent parity here in the expansion, just as in the boundary singular module case. So we were very surprised by this result, which is CJ is equal to zero if j is odd, if n is odd, then e is equal to zero. E is equal to zero and v is a conformal invariant. If n is even, then e is a conformal invariant. And the integral of a local quantity, extrinsic. So the result is exactly the same one you get in the Einstein case, which I anyway had thought was because I, anyway, had thought was because of the very clearly the expansion, the vanishing of all of the odd terms in the Einset expansion. So, what's going on here? Sorry, so that is it obvious that the UI post-monopostate? Um, let's see. Well, I suppose it will consider it's contributed in some sense to the number. Uh number, but do you mean to the change? I don't think it's I don't think it's all the same. Oh, oh, oh, oh, I see, I see, I see, I see. Uh yeah, I think we should use it higher order. But you that's a good question. Hunter should be here. All right, sure. I believe that's correct. But um But um but something I should know, so thanks. So I actually want to leave this expansion here, so I didn't think we had enough, but I'm going to leave this expansion here and sort of try to work around it. Maybe so sorry, so the T the T is. So the T is the distance a sub manifold? That's right. Assigned distance or a distance? Distance. It's a higher co-dimension manifold, so there isn't really a sign distance. Although that will, in the code dimension one case, it is signed. In the co-dimensional one case, it's not. But I'll come back to that point. I mean, there are a couple ways of looking at it. This is for k ought equal to one. It is, but I'm going to come back and talk about the k. It is, but I'm going to come back and talk about the K equals 1 case, because it's kind of true in the K equals 1 case as well, it turns out. Well, it is true in the K equals 1 case. But so by conformal invariance, by the way, I mean the same thing I meant in the singularity case. If I make a global conformal change of g, then the distance function changes, although the singularity metric does not. And so one could expect there to be a change. Change. So the basic phenomenon that's going on here is just, I just want to go back to, say, Rn, draw the highest n that I, actually this is one dimension higher than I can draw, but okay. Just suppose that we're working in spherical coordinates on our n, right? And we have a smooth function of Rn. R smooth. Smooth and we use ordinary spherical coordinates. Rho, and we expand it like f equals f0 plus rho f1 plus rho squared f2 plus dot dot dot. Then it turns out that so each of these functions is a function on the Of these functions is a function on the unit sphere, right? So fi is a function on Sn minus one of parity i. So, what I mean is if you if you reflect, then depending whether i is odd or even. Then, depending whether i is odd or even, f changes sign or doesn't change sign. And that follows just by smoothness of f. What this means is that although it looks like f doesn't have any particular parity in this extension, if you integrate, half of these guys are going to disappear on the units when you integrate over this here. So, we have this extension in U, and it looks like it doesn't have any parity, but when we go and we do the computation of how the volume changes, The computation of how the volume changes when you change t. Well, we were computing volumes, we're going to integrate, and half of these coefficients are going to, half of the coefficients of what you're integrating, which is some power of this, are going to vanish. Because, okay, so here's an important point. That's true if u is smooth. Well, u is obviously not smooth. It starts with t, which is not smooth. But you could hope that u is t times something smooth. And that turns out to be true up to the order where this makes it not. Up to the order where this makes it not a true end. And so that does not follow immediately from Maseo's work. Maseo works says it's polyhomogeneous, but you can then show from the equation and some analysis that, in fact, the thing is actually smooth downstairs, not on the blow up, but as a function. It's t times a smooth function on M, or on X, I should say. So that's basically the essence of the proof. Of the proof. So we also computed the variation. But before saying too much about that, I should say a bit more. Okay, so these guys, as I said, are functions on the spherical normal bundle, right? So L, one can show. So L, one can show is the restriction to the spherical normal bundle of a linear function on the entire normal bundle, which is to say it defines a one form on the normal bundle. Also, so u n plus two is a little more complicated. So un plus 2 is a little more complicated. Un plus 2 is not, but it has a well-defined and conformally invariant linear part, if I can debate. If I can be vague. So, what I'm claiming is that u n plus 2 determines a one-form on the normal level, even if it's not quite as straightforwardly as L does. So sorry, when you say that E is a piece of local on the P side, sigma. Sigma. Over sigma, yes. Actually, before I continue any further, I just need to talk about the cable of one case. Yes. Just a quick question. Maybe I was missing something. So u is very clearly a function. Yes. L is a coefficient in a function. Yes. How is L a one form? Well, okay, it determines a one form. So L is a coefficient in a function, so it is a function on the sphere normal bundle. Right? The sphere normal bundle The paranormal bundle, among other things, sits inside the paranormal bundle, and we can show that the particular function that L is the restricted of a linear function on the whole normal bundle. So it determines one form. We probably shouldn't use the same notation, but we're good. Although, we're submitting the final draft, hopefully, of this in a week and a half or so. So if anybody has strong opinions about annotation, now would be the time to grab me by the lapels. Okay, yeah, I should, before I continue. Okay, yeah, I should, before I continue, I should say something about the k equals one case, because this is true for even for the k equals one case. If you're not in the one situation that had been considered before, which is that the thing is a boundary and you're only considering one side, okay, it had been considered where it wasn't a boundary, but people still have one side. If you actually consider the two-sided volume, so here you take the, there are two ways of looking at it. You take the non-smooth, therefore unsigned positive distance function still, and you do exactly. Functions still, and you do exactly this problem. Then the anomaly, informal anomaly is in some sense odd in the change in normal vector, and therefore the two sides cancel out, and you get a well-defined global invariant in vertical dimension one case. Which is just taking, I mean, it's the same reason, it's just that this here normal bundle in the code mentioned one case is two points, right? The normal way is off. Okay. So I was just mentioning, by the way, this is, you get the same result as far as invariance of the neural norm in the Einstein case. One thing that's cool is this is always defined. Because in the Einstein case, you have a conformal manifold. You usually don't have a functory Einstein field, so you don't actually, there isn't actually a volume compute. But here you actually do always have a singular hymnometric constant. Always have a singular remonetary concept. You always can. I was human control. Okay, so finally, suppose we consider a variation f from negative epsilon, epsilon cross sigma into x. So let's let. So let's let X be the variation field d ds of F at s equals 0, which is a normal vector field along sigma. Then we have this is second theorem. The paper is on the archive with the first theorem. The second theorem will be added in the one that we post in the week and a half. Then, if n is odd, the derivative with respect to s of volume at s equals zero is some dimensional constant times an integral over sigma. over sigma of u sub n plus 2 of x dv, let's call it h. h is just telling me my metric restricted to sigma. And if n is even, I'll talk a minute about what I mean here in a second, then the derivative of the energy at s equals 0 is c sub n of k times the energy. k times the integral over sigma of l of x dh. And in both of these notations, I'm referring to the one forms that are defined, as I mentioned over here. Now, interestingly and appropriately, here we have the global completely non-local term, and the one form that we have to apply is this non-locally determined one form. And then on the other hand, here we have a global invariant that is the integral of a local thing, and each variation is also the. Local thing, and variation is also the intruple thing. Incidentally, I will say I think it's interesting in itself. I don't know, I mean, it just follows directly from Mancero's work, but once you notice this fact, it means that you, in this setting, you always have a locally determined and non-locally determined, well, locally determined or non-locally determined, depending on the carryout, I should say, one form along your submit folder, which, of course, you. Of course, you can raise an index vector and well-defined informative variant normal vector. So that's the variation formula, and I'll stop there. Thank you. Do we have any questions?
