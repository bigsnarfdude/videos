I want to start by thanking the organizers for this opportunity to come here to this night setting and to talk to you about hydrogel mechanics. I also felt lucky to be speaking right after Dr. Long because he alluded to the importance of hydrogel in organ on chip devices. So that's essentially my own interest. So my outline in the stock here, my motivation. Line in the stock here, my motivation is essentially to say the same thing. Hydrogels are very important, and its mechanics matters to the behavior or the performance of those devices. And for my purpose, I divide those devices into shear-dominated and normal flow-dominated geometries. I'll illustrate what I mean by that. And to understand the hydrogel mechanics in those geometries, we found that we have to build a mathematical model and a numerical algorithm. And a numerical algorithm to solve those problems. So I'll describe the models in my second part. Finally, I'll show you case studies, one for the shear and the other for the normal flow geometries. So I used kind of somewhat old examples just because the geometry lends itself very well to what I want to do in my simulations. So in this particular essay, the authors were interested in tumor cell migration. So the pink area. Migration. So the pink area here is the hydrogel, and they're held in place by those rigid or solid at least white hosts. And on the left and the right, you have two different channels having different pressure. So therefore, you can have a pressure-driven flow that's going through the hydrogel. And then you ask yourself, certainly there will be interstitial flow in the hydrogel. That's obvious. And it's shown there, the green arrows. But a harder question is if you induce. Harder question is: if you induce if you seed the gel with tumor cells, how would they migrate? It turns out, depending on the conditions, those authors have found upstream as well as downstream migrations for different mechanisms. The downstream might be through an autocrine signaling mechanism where the tumor cells give off cytokines that are carried by the convection downstream, thereby setting. Downstream, thereby setting up a gradient in the cytokine gradient, and that would induce chemotaxis. And the outward migration, those authors hypothesized, might be through mechanical stretching, just like the discussion, the hypothesis that Professor Long put forth. There might be an integrine-based stretching mechanism for the tumor cells to go the other way. So it's suffice. Tumor cells go the other way. So it's suffice it to say that those things do happen in a hydrogel-based model. And this is another normal flow type of geometry. And in those rhombus-shaped chambers, you have the grease stuff, which is hydrogel, and you seed it with endosidal cells to grow a vasculature, which is grain in this case. And then you can insert tumor cells, which are the blue ones, and you can perfuse this by This is by a medium which goes through the blood vessels as well as through the matrix, the ECM itself. Once again, you set up a situation where the flow goes through the cell and goes through the gel and impacts the cell that's contained or embedded in the gel. So that's my second example for the so-called normal flow geometry. Here's a shared geometry. You have this chamber here containing, in this case, fibrogen. Containing, in this case, fibrogen that gels, just like in blood clotting, in the presence of thrombin and fibrinogen. And then you have the gel here, and then the perfusion goes through this channel. Therefore, there's a shear flow here, which could induce interstitial flow in there as well. But that's a shear-based geometry. And another share one, so I should have used Dr. Long's example if I had known. Long's example, if I had known. So I quoted another example, which is quite similar, right? So you have a collagen gel that serves as the scaffold for hepatocytes and the other cells, and you perfuse this on top, and you set up a flow situation where nutrients and oxygen and whatever growth factors can be pumped in. And they can have a special distribution, which will eventually determine the fate of the cells and the performance. The fate of the cells and the performance of the whole device, right? So basically, looking at this very quick survey of such devices, I asked myself, what are the important questions? There are at least two. Number one is mechanal transduction. If you flow a fluid, the perfusate, next to a hydrogel-based culture, you induce stresses and forces inside the gel, and that gets transmitted. Inside the gel, and that gets transmitted to the cell, right? And that can have downstream effects, as once again, Professor Long has pointed out, right? That's one thing. And the other thing is you can also transmit material. Those can be oxygen, whatever materials that can go into the cell, right? This is an advection diffusion problem. So, in my talk today, I will be focusing on the first question: the transmission of forces through the gel to the Through the gel to the cell. So that's what I want to do. So to do that, I realize I need a hydrogel mechanics model, which I will describe momentarily. And you realize that to do that, you have to content with a few issues, not necessarily difficulties, they're surmountable, but you have to take care to address them. Number one, there's a length scale disparity here. So going from the pore, which can be as small as tens of nanometers. As small as tens of nanometers in a hydrogel to the large-scale device scale, which is quite large. And then inside the hydrogel, you can have a, you always have, well, a deformable polymer network that involves elastic deformation, right? So the flow is always coupled with the elastic deformation of this skeleton inside the gel. So that's another issue. And finally, we found that we also have to deal with the boundary. Have to deal with the boundary condition on the interface between a gel domain, a blob of gel, and the fluid that goes around it or through it. So I'll get to that as well. Good. Very quickly, into the setup of the model. If you look at the gel under a microscope, you see the pore structure out there. And we don't want to model that for obvious reasons. So we want to take a continuum view. Continuum view. So we see the gel as this continuum, the density or the pore size can be varying spatially, but nevertheless, it's a continuum in the sense that you pick any point in space. It's made up of fluid and solid of a certain percentage. Let's say 99% water and 1% solid, and they add up to one. For each phase, you define a velocity for the fluid, a velocity for the solid, their stress tensors, and you write out. And you write out a momentum and momentum equations and continuity equations for each phase. You do that. And then, of course, on the boundary, as I mentioned, you have to pose proper boundary condition. So that's the basic idea. And we will add also cells inside, which will be modeled as hyperelastic bodies. We'll do that. Good. So now onto this oral elasticity. To this poro elasticity model, which is not at all a new thing, it's quite an old thing. So, what you say is you have your gel domain outside, you have Stokes flow, which is simple, stress tensor for the viscous flow, the velocity. So, that's just Stokes flow. Inside, for those of you who liked your continuum mechanics, this is essentially a mixture theory. So, you have the two phases that are interpenetrating continua, essentially. Penetrating continua, essentially, and each having its own momentum and continuity equation. So you define your stress tensor inside the fluid, inside the solid, and they're coupled by this Darcy drag, which I will specify later. It's a linear drag law. And then you have volume or mass conservation for each phase. You notice that the face average, the velocity itself is not solenoidal, it's not divergence-free. But if you add those two, you will end. Add those two, you will end up with a mixture velocity that is solenoidal. And then I'll specify the continuum, the constituent equations later on, as I said. The boundary conditions, those are the obvious ones. So on the surface, there's a kinematic condition on the surface, and then there's volume conservation. So the fluid going through the pores into the gel has to be carried away by the flow, the interstitial flow inside the gel, right? So that's obvious. And also, So that's obvious. And also on the surface, there's a traction balance condition: the stress outside and the stress from the two phases on the inside. So that's those are obvious. You always use this. But they're not sufficient. They're not sufficient because now we have adopted this formulation. We have two different or separate momentum equations. We need additional boundary conditions because the solid is also deforming and it needs its own boundary condition. It needs its own boundary condition. To do that, we realize that we are now kind of going back decades in thinking, in scientific modeling. So, this touches on a very long-standing question in porous media mechanics, dealing mostly with rigid porous medium, where you ask yourself whether, say, this is water and this is like a sandy region, whether across the water you should enforce. Across the border, you should enforce continuity in velocity and stress or not? So that's the basic question. And there have been dozens, to say the least, proposals in the past. So some say you should enforce velocity continuity. Some say no. You can make the velocity jump proportional to the stress. Some say you should have traction balance. Some say no. So there are many such things. And that's for rigid force medium. If you have Force medium, if you have deformable force medium, like what I'm dealing with now, it's even more complex. Now you need additional conditions for the solid stress, as I mentioned. So here's one example of a scheme for getting over this obstacle. You can assume a partition scheme. You say, huh, this is your overall production balance. Force from the outside. This is just for the simple shear geometry. This is the force from the stress from the outside. Stress from the outside. This is from the inside. And you make the liquid contribution and the solid contribution both equal to the total stress outside. It's kind of a partition scheme. It sounds arbitrary, but that's one way of doing it. There are different ways. We tried the partition scheme for our calculations. It didn't work very well in simple calculations. And also, we didn't like this kind of phenomenological way of doing that, of postulating. Way of doing that, of posture leading things. So, we wanted to do it. We wanted to do it slightly differently. We went back to something that I never enjoyed starting from grad school. That's irreversible thermodynamics. But I will question. So we have similar thoughts on that probably. So essentially, we say, let's follow this formalism to postulate boundary conditions, as people have done over decades in postulating. Case in postulating constitutive equations. How does this work? So it works by writing out an energy statement. You say there's the total energy dissipation. You can do this for a viscous fluid very easily. You write rho dv dt equals the divergence of the Cauchy stress tensor. You multiply by that product the velocity on both sides. You integrate over the whole domain. You integrate by parts on the right-hand side. You integrate by pars on the right-hand side, you realize that your rate of change for your kinetic energy is equal to minus the integral of the stress tensor. The stress tensor double dotted into your velocity gradient. Then you say, ah, let me make the stress linearly proportional to the velocity gradient. There, you have a quadratic form. So that's the basic idea. It carries over to my case as well. So basically, I want to formulate an energy statement. Uh, formulate an energy statement, and that can be done by multiplying the equations by the first one by velocity, the second by pressure, outside, inside, velocity, pressure, and then you add it all up and integrate over the whole domain. You have a energy equation for your whole system, right? Then you rearrange it. You see, it looks kind of ugly, but it's not really complex. This group of integrals, they're on the outer boundary. They're on the outer boundary, far from my gel domain. I'm not interested in this. I say far from my gel domain, I say the stress is zero or whatever. Maybe there's no displacement. So there's no work done there. So I put that to zero right away. And then inside this term, this group of terms are important for me. Those are the interfacial dissipation. And then the other terms are familiar. You see, there's viscous dissipation outside, viscous dissipation. Outside, viscous dissipation inside your gel, and the elastic energy relaxation. Finally, there's the Darcy drag, which is, if you have a linear law, this term can also be made into a quadratic. Okay, good. So you see the idea, and then you rearrange things. You say, now I want the elastic energy to be always dissipating if it's relaxing in a viscous medium, right? It should. To do that, you see each term is non-positive, and then the non-positive and then the only thing that's kind of standing out is this interfacial dissipation so you want this term to be non-negative uh non-positive you want that to do that you can play the game by uh introducing velocity components and this will break this thing into down into many pairs of force dotted into fluxes and you make the force proportional to the flux and there you have your boundary conditions and those boundary Your boundary conditions, and those boundary conditions and you have non-negative coefficients. They obviously, this procedure is not sufficient, but not necessary, right? To ensure the second law of thermodynamics, right? To obey the law. So, to do that, you end up with a boundary condition. So, this is what we call BC2 because we checked the different options, and this turned out to be the best. And it's not at all crazy. Look at that. So, this is the velocity that goes into the geopolitical. Goes into the gel and is proportional to the jump in the normal stresses outside and inside with a permeability coefficient there. So that seems to make sense, right? Similar. And then if you look at the tangential direction, that's even more familiar. So you have the flip velocity proportional to the stress, the shear stress on the outside, an obvious lift condition, right? And then you need an additional tangential condition because you have the solid stress as well. A solid stress as well. So now you have the permeability and slip coefficients, and you have the boundary conditions that you were missing. And then together with the boundary conditions I already had before, and also on the cell surface, I do not allow permeation on the time scale of the experiments in those devices. This is questionable, but that's okay. With that, I can have a kind of a system. Kind of a system. And I have to also tell you about the constitutive relations I promised earlier. So Newtonian fluids outside, inside, skeleton, new Hooken, embedded cells, Neo-Hukian with the Lame constants being different or equal, depending on your choice. And then the drag law would be a linear Darcy drag, which implies a certain bulk permeability inside, as usual. As usual. So that's the basic setup for the theory. And now I have the theory. I have to build a numerical scheme for solving it in non-trivial flow geometries. To do that, we used finite elements, Galurkin formulation. We have to take care to properly impose or incorporate the boundary conditions, including essential as well as the stress conditions. Essential as well as the stress conditions that I mentioned earlier, they have to be included in surface intervals, which is kind of a hassle, but if you're careful and patient, you can do it. And we built the code on a finite element library that's known as DL2. I think it's coming out of Germany, Heidelberg. It's widely used amongst other platforms. Okay, another little bit of technical. Okay, another little bit of technical issue is how to handle the interfacial deformation. So you have your gel domain here, and the flow is around it, and this interface is not stationary, right? It's a moving boundary problem. You have to content with that in computing moving boundary problems. So we use arbitrary Lagrangian Olerin, not with a moving grid, which you could do, but with a coordinate transformation scheme, just because in our problems, the gel surfaces don't deform. Gel surfaces don't deform that much. They don't really break up and fly around as you would in particulate flows, for instance, right? So, in this case, we just used coordinate transformation. Good. Now, those are the two kind of prototypical geometries that I mentioned earlier. So, the first one is a shear-based flow, and the other one is a normal flow. So, let me just go into the shear flow geometry first to show you how the perfusion of The perfusion of the fluid induces stresses inside the gel, and that gets transmitted to the cells as well. Okay, so this is our simplified setup for the geometry. This bowl here contains the hydrogel and the fluid goes through this channel here. And we use proper discretization to make sure that the spatial resolution is adequate, all that. Okay, good. Now, before I show you the proper solution. You, the proper solution. Let me show you an exaggerated solution just because if you use the right level of gel and cell rigidity and the right level of fluid flow, the amount of deformation is very hard to see. They're quite small, which is not surprising, right? You're just running water over gel, like toothpaste. If you don't run it very hard, it doesn't deform that much, right? So in this case, I lowered the rigidity of the gel and the cell by a thousand fold. Out by a thousand fold. So you can see it better. So now I'm going to run the fluid through this channel. It's a Pozoic flu coming in. It's going to go through. And of course, it's going to drag the surface of the gel to the right. What does it do to the vertical displacement of the gel? So you can imagine what's going to happen. So I'll just run this more quickly. So you will see some sort of flow, let me stop this for the moment. You will see some sort of flow now. See some sort of flow now into the gel. I will show the gel momentarily, and then it's going to come out here. So, that would create a depression on the upstream portion of the gel surface and a bump, a bulging on the lower or downstream portion of the interface. I'll just run this through manually very quickly, and you will see that you will end up with a steady state flow like that. Now, what's happening inside the gel? Inside the gel, Inside the gel, you will see that the flow will be pushing the gel down a little and also pushing it downstream. And it's also going to deform the gel, deform the cell. It's going to deform the cell. As you see, if I run this quickly, you will see it like that, right? So this is an exaggerated case where you can see the deformation more visually, more clearly. But if you use proper moduli for the gel, Uh, moduli for the gel and the cell, the deformation, the amount of strength or deformation much smaller. So, in here, so you see that the flow will be dragging the gel forward to the right, and this shows the displacement that's along the flow direction. You will see that if there's no cell, so this red dashed line shows the horizontal displacement. If there's no cell, it's more or less symmetric upstream and downstream. Uh, symmetric upstream and downstream. But once you have the cell, there's kind of an acceleration effect upstream, and that pushes the cell, the gel, to the right. And then downstream, there's a bit of a deficit. That's the horizontal part, which is not terribly interesting. But if you look at the vertical part, it's more interesting. So they're generally speaking, the cell. I don't know if this is intuitive to you, but it was a surprise to us. So essentially, the cell causes a general depression. Causes a general depression of the gel surface. Oh, well, I showed you on the previous slide, but why should that be? Why should that be, right? So, this is showing you the displacement. So, this is once again the case without the cell. With the cell, there's a general depression of the surface. And then we track the motion of the cell, of course. And it's mostly moving downward and to the right. And if you look at the deformation around the cell, we see that it's being pushed upstream. Being pushed upstream, no surprise, and downstream, the amount of displacement is a lot smaller. So, therefore, the cell is being squeezed horizontally by the flow. And also top and bottom is also being squeezed. Overall, the cell is being compressed from all over. So, that's what's happening here. And that, of course, does something to the gel as well. So, you ask yourself, what's the stress distribution inside the gel that's doing this to the cell? You have pressure, no surprise. You have pressure, no surprise. This is the region surrounding the cell. You look at the viscous flow, the magnitude is order magnitude lower. So it's not very important. The viscous flow, not important. And then you look at the elastic stress, it's important and the total stress. So basically, my way of visualizing or rationalizing this result is as follows. So the gel is porous and permeable, and the cell is not. Therefore, when the flow encounters the cell, it will The cell will exert a force on the cell to move it. And in the meantime, the flow and the pressure is also deforming the gel, right? So, depending on how the cell and the gel deformation differs, you might have elastic stress that's induced in the gel. So, that's my way of seeing that. So, with that, you can also examine the distribution of the Van Meese strain and stress, which is defined. Strain and stress, which is defined. Oops, I thought I had a call up here. It's the formula for the Vemes formula. You probably know. It's an invariant, the third invariant of the stress or strength tensor, okay? A local magnitude. You will see that there's a compression that's more on the front or the upstream part than the downstream part. And we estimated the dimensional stress that's being imposed on the cell, not very large at all. Not very large at all. Four milli Pascal. You said that's negligible. I'm not sure if Dr. Lund agrees. Those kinds of low-level stresses can have interesting outcomes or effects downstream. You can induce endothelial cell proliferation, et cetera. You can induce liver region. I don't know. Does it? This level of stresses, it could, right? So there can be interesting downstream ramifications for this. However, you ask yourself, is the cell in danger? Is the cell in danger of being damaged by the stresses? Ah, not quite. So there's data in the literature. If you want to cause damage in cells, you have to use stresses up to tens of Pascals. And if you try to really damage the inside the cell, you need a strain that's quite large. So we're nowhere near that level. And we have tested, of course, the relative rigidity between the cell and the gel. If you have a more rigid gel, it protects. More rigid gel, it protects the cell. No surprise, right? Protects the cell from higher stresses and deformation. Okay, now, coming, I'm monitoring my time. Now, coming to the normal flow geometry, so I'm taking maybe a region that's more or less in the middle, and then I simplify this into the symmetric geometry. So, there are symmetry conditions on top, and at the bottom as well, those are rigid posts. Bottom as well. Those are rigid posts on the surface of which the gel adheres. And then you would see the cells inside. We are interested in multiple cells in the normal flow geometry. And you see what happens. You compute the flow field. No surprise. They look just like Stokes flows. Not interesting. You say, oh, I know my low Reynolds number of fluid mechanics, so I can probably extrapolate my knowledge to anticipate the behavior. To anticipate the behavior of the cell. No, it doesn't work like that because the viscous stress itself is a very minor player. It's not the viscous flow that really matters. What matters is the relative motion between the cell and the gel that's mediated through the elastic stress in the gel, as you will see. You even have like the Stokes flow of vertices, as you would expect in Stokes flows. So I have in this case two horizontal cells that forms a doublet. You can have A doublet, you can have triplets, etc. So now, as I was saying, this is just to repeat myself. It turns out what's important is the pressure and the salt stress, and the viscous stress is an order of magnitude lower, so it doesn't really matter much. If you compare this to the shear flow geometry, once again, as you anticipated, the effect is much stronger here, right? The flow goes right through the gel. The other one is, you know, you're glancing by shear over the gel. By share over the gel, right? So you end up with stresses that are somewhat bigger. But one thing that I really want to highlight is the stress concentration between the cells. We place the cells at different separations. As they become closer, this concentration becomes greater. There's a large amount of stress in between. So then we ask ourselves, why is that? What's happening to the gel between the cells? It turned out it's under tension. We were surprised. Endered tension. We were surprised initially, then we thought, oh, okay, it's not surprising after all. So, this is showing the strength in the x direction. So, you see strong stretching in front, strong stretching behind. If for the moment, this is not surprising, we realize after some thinking, if you ignore the second cell for the moment, just consider one cell as being pushed by the flow, right? It has to, because it's embedded in this solid network, it has to be network, it has to be dragging the network of the elastic network in front and also pressing on the network that's downstream, right? So that would create stretching upstream and compression downstream always, right? So if the two cells are far apart, surely you would expect stretching here and stretching in front of the second cell as well. So the question is, how much of a shielding effect does the leading cell have over the treating cell, right? So it turns out if they are rather Out if they are rather far apart, the shielding effect is not very large. So, what I'm showing you here is the displacement profile along this white dotted line. So, this A is upstream, downstream, upstream, downstream. So, you see the displacement going up. So, the gel is being stretched right in front of the first cell. And this is inside the cell. This is the solid part. So, it's more or less uniform compression. As you get to point B, B has moved downstream. B has moved downstream a lot less than A, right? So B has moved a lot less. Now, coming to C, C does essentially the same, C to D. The second cell does essentially the same as the first cell, but the key thing here is the displacement at C is greater than B. Therefore, the gel in here is being stretched. And that's the origin of this appearance of strong stress between the cells. And then you ask, oh, what's this doing to the inside? What's this doing to the inside of the cells? Well, here it is. So, if they're far apart, the distribution of the stresses is as you expect, and they're similar. But if you move them closer, you realize that the stress concentration inside would have the effect of reversing the cell distribution in the sense that now the maximum amount of compression happens downstream. So, that happens. And if you go to even closer ones, so you have a localization. ones. So you have a localization of the stresses in the cell. So that's the effect of the outside gel deformation. Good. For the vertical triplet, again, if you move them closer to each other, you have strongly localized stress levels inside. I think my own explanation is rather naive, but I think it works. In this particular setup, the flow is pushing the cells apart, right? The cells apart, right? That causes the stretching of the cell, of the gel between the cells, I think. That's what's happened. Good. With that, I think I can conclude. What I told you is in the past half an hour or so is we have a theoretical model. It's essentially a poro-elastic model for gel-fluid to phase flows. There's fluid-solid interaction in the gel itself, but also. And the gel itself, but also between the gel and the cell inside. And one kind of novelty of this is that we have to go through some gyrations, so to speak, to drive boundary conditions for the gel cell interface. Sorry, for the fluid and gel interface. And then we use the finite element scheme for solving those. And we found that, indeed, if you have cells in a cluster inside gels. Inside gels, the perfusing flow could have a profound effect on the forces that the cells will experience, not so much to the level of damaging the cells, but up to a strong enough level that you can expect interesting downstream ramifications through mechanical transduction. So, with that, I'll thank my collaborators as well as our funding agencies. Though there are two PhD students, near and PhD students near completion. Our collaborators are Jiaqi. He was a student of Pen Taoyu's at Virginia Tech. He's now teaching in Druhai University, sorry, the United International College there. And Yuan Na Yan is a professor of mathematics at NGIT. And I thank you for listening to me.
