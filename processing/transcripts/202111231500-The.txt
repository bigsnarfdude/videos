Opportunity to speak. So before I get started actually, an interesting thing happened to me coming to this conference. On the night before my flight to Calgary, I was in Frankfurt and I checked into my Frankfurt hotel and the following happened. So this is the first time I'm giving a talk about 235 and it just so happens that the room that I checked into in Frankfurt was 235. So this is hitting the jackpot. So just, I did not plan this. I did not plan this. I didn't send them my title and abstract or anything like that. Just an amazing serendipity. Of course, when you hit the jackpot, you try to hit another jackpot. And these are my numbers, 235, 7, 14, and 35. We'll see what happens. You didn't get room 235 up bam. I didn't get room 235 of PAMP. No, unfortunately. Alright, so let's start talking about 235 distributions. Okay, so consider a 5-manifold and a rank 2 distribution on it. A rank 2 distribution on it with rank growth 235. So take B, take iterated lead brackets of vector fields, so generating the so-called weak derived flag. So here this is rank 2, this is rank 3, this is rank 5, filling up the entire tangent space. Okay, so this is a classical topic. First of all, what's our notion of equivalence? Local diffeomorphisms, so sending one 235 to another under push forward. So this is an image. So, this is an infinite-dimensional Lie pseudo-group of transformations. What's our notion of symmetry? It's a vector field that Lie preserves our distribution. So, the origins of this go back a long way to Cartel's 1910 paper given right here. And in this paper, Cartel established remarkable equivalences between certain classes of PD and 235 distributions. So, I'm not going to talk about that aspect in my talk here. I'll focus on this 235 aspect. He gave a total. He gave it to the first application of his equivalence method to 2,35 distributions and classified almost all complex multiple transitive structures. What do I mean by multiply transitive? Transitive, but having positive dimensional isotropy at each point. So these have symmetry dimensions, 14, 7, turns out that there's this big symmetry gap, and then 6. We're on a 5-manifold. We're talking about multiple transit guys. Okay, so maximum symmetry. Case of maximal symmetry is significant. We get a geometric realization of the 14-dimensional exceptional simple Lie algebra of type G2. So let me spend the first, I guess, 10 minutes or so just kind of familiarizing you with this structure and just kind of outlining my motivations for revisiting this classical topic. So given AM235, you could always introduce local coordinates, x, q, p, q, z, and a function of five variables will come into play. Come into play that's suitably non-degenerate, such that the given distribution can be written in this form right here. So these one-forms, you think about p as like u prime, q as like u double prime, and then so you can think of this as some sort of context system sitting in some sort of jet space pulled back to z prime is equal to f. Take the annihilator of that, you get it in terms of the vector fields given right here. It's often encoded as this underscore. It's often encoded as this underdetermined ODE, but be careful not to confuse the notion of equivalence. It's what I said previously. Whereas here, if you write it in this form, maybe you'll think about contact symmetries. But yeah, so let's focus on the notion of equivalence that I introduced in the previous slide. Here are some examples. So I won't explain what these letters mean right now, but let's focus on these dimensions. Focus on these dimensions. So, the most famous one is the Q squared example. So, this corresponds to the underdetermined ODE Z prime is equal to U double prime squared, the so-called Hilbert-Cartel equation. And there's some other models over here. And this particular model was missed from Cartel's classification. It came up in 2013. It's due to Dubrov and Kovarov. Just a warning, there are some redundancies in this list. So there is a maximally symmetric. There is a maximally symmetric, there is a unique maximally symmetric model. So all these four guys are equivalent. For the type 7 guys, for example, the XQ model is equivalent to the Q to the half model. And there's other redundancies amongst the Q to the M models. So these were described in this paper by Dubois and Kriviklov in 2014. A famous example is this rolling example. So consider a two-sphere rolling on another without twisting or slipping. The configuration Twisting or slipping. The configuration space is five-dimensional because, so what do you need to describe these two spheres being in contact? You need this point, so an S2's worth of possibilities there. And then how is this rotated with respect to the first sphere? So SO3, total being five-dimensional. There's a no-twisting, no slipping condition that we're going to impose, and it turns out that puts some constraints on the velocity space, and it cuts it down to a rank 2 distribution. Down to a rank 2 distribution of allowable directions that you could proceed in this configuration space. So, given this rank 2 distribution, one can ask how much symmetry it has. So let rho be the ratio of the radii. If rho is equal to 1, then it turns out this distribution is Frobenius' integral. If rho is not equal to 1, you get a 2,35 geometry. So how much symmetry does it have? Of course, you have SO3, SO3, that's the object. That's the obvious amount of symmetry. And it turns out that's exactly equal to the amount of symmetry that this distribution has when rho is not equal to 3. But if rho is equal to 3, then it jumps up. And this is G2 symmetry. So this has been addressed in several works, Brian Solenko, Bourne Montgomery, and Bai's Huerta. Okay, but so that's a bit about concrete structure, but what I want to promote is What I want to promote is this Cartel viewpoint. Namely, the equivalence problem has been solved, and it's so this broad theorem of Tanaka, Morimoto, Chapshiko, that rephrases this in the language of cartel geometries. So this says there's an equivalence of categories between 2, 3, 5s and regular normal cartel geometries of type G2P1. And I'll make these notions precise later. But the moral here is that one has a canonical upstairs. One has a canonical upstairs perspective on this downstairs structure. This omega is a Carton connection. It's a special type of co-framing. You have a model here, namely a homogeneous quotient of G2. In Cartel 1910, G2 appears only related to maximal symmetry, whereas here, it's the model for this Cartel geometry, and it really influences what's happening even in the curve cases. So my aim was to. So, my aim was starting with this solution to the equivalence problem, phrased in terms of Cartel geometries, plus using some G2 structure theory, efficiently derive the homogeneous 235 classification. I really just want to understand how do we do classification efficiently. P1 is parabolic? Yeah. So, and I'll give you more details about that at parabolic later. Just a warning. So, Narovsky has So Nirovsky had this observation unpublished, which I paraphrase here: the Carton connection of 1910 is not a Carton connection in the precise sense that I will explain later. So the 1910 connection, this co-framing, is not fully equivariant. But this is not at all obvious from Carton's paper because Carton didn't actually give full structure equations for his co-frame. There were two forms, the structure equations were missing, and you really have to look at those last two forms to observe this. Last two forms to observe this. In 2013, Norowski discussed with Bryant, while visiting the ANU, about modifying Carton's co-framing to obtain a Cartel connection. And in an illuminating circulated email, Bryant exhibited such a modification. So a brief extract from there that I wanted to share is the following. My conclusion is that Carton, at the time that he wrote his five variables paper, was more interested in practical calculation and exposition than he was in the theoretical development of what later became Carton connection. Of what later became Cartel connections. And he chose this co-framing solving his equivalence problem so that the formulae that he needed to write down to explain his results would be as simple as possible. Not everybody was impressed with the Turkish course. Let me temper that nice comment with Lafon. In Tanaka, he does write in his 1970 paper, Carton has really carried out such reductions in a messy and complicated manner. Okay, so my viewpoint really is, I know about this equivalence of categories, I know about Carton connections, can I use that? Connections, can I use that as my starting point? So if such a description exists, let's use it. But moreover, how should we present this homogeneous classification? Let me emphasize this, because it's one of the main takeaways from the talk. So there are three, the following are equivalent. So you could present it in terms of a coordinate model. So we did that earlier, for example. You have this distribution, some function f, and then you could express the symmetries as coordinate vectors. In some as coordinate vector fields. And for instance, Zetomirsky this year, he published this classification. He gave a talk based on normal form methods to arrive at a 235 classification. Alternatively, we could go more abstractly and discuss it Lie theoretically. So present a Lie algebra of symmetries, F, and then an isotropy, F0. And then on this quotient, you specify an F0 invariant, 23. An F0 invariant 235 filtration. But what I want to explain to you today is this other viewpoint, this Cartel theoretic viewpoint. This is not in Cartel 1910 for the reasons that I mentioned before, there wasn't a Cartel connection there. So the main point of my talk is how do you formulate this? What's the definition? Give some examples. I'll also emphasize these are all equivalent, but it's not easy to pass from coordinate and theoretic up to Carton theoretic. On the other hand, given Cartel, On the other hand, given Carton-theoretic description, the Lie-theoretic description is basically immediate. And of course, you could go from Lie-theoretic to coordinate descriptions via integrated structure equations. So how do you arrive at this? First of all, what is it? Why would you want to be interested in this? So one thing that you could ask for all of these homogeneous models is: what is the curvature? What is the holomy of these models? These are basic invariants. So, for example, in Wilson 2005. Example in Wilson 2018, this N6 model has full G2 holomen. Okay, these are natural variants. What are they good for? One thing I'll briefly mention, any 235 admits a canonical conformal structure on the same manifold, and it's covariant in the sense that any automorphism of the 235 induces a conformal symmetry of this conformal structure. Okay, so a natural question for this conformal structure is, do Einstein metrics exist in there? Metrics exist in there, and this can be inferred from the homonym, especially in the homogeneous case. This can be computed very efficiently from this Cartan-theoretic description. So one can use this to solve some PDEs. There's ultimately a PDE governing this, but using this description to solve these PDEs in an algebraic manner, essentially. Okay? Okay, so a little bit of background. I'm cartel geometry. I didn't want to assume this really. I didn't want to assume this for the top here. Okay, so starting with Euclidean geometry, there's two natural generalizations of Euclidean geometry. One focusing on the symmetries, so Euclidean group, mod orthogonal group, but in general I could consider a GP pair, P being a closed subgroup. So this is very homogeneous. Every point looks like every other point. On the other hand, the other generalization is Riemannian geometry. So this is modeled on each tangent space. This is modeled on each tangent space, is modeled on this data, but this can in general have no symmetries. So, Cartel geometry is a common generalization. So, it's a curved version, it's often said to be a curved version of a homogeneous space. Let's make that precise. So, a Carton geometry of type GP is a right principal bundle with a Carton connection. This is a one-form valued in the Lie algebra that, first of all, it's a linear isomorphism. It's a linear isomorphism on each tangent space. So it's a g-valued co-framing. And then second and third axioms are well-known axioms from principal bundle theory. So it's equivariant along fibers, and it reproduces the generators of the fundamental vertical vector fields. But whereas with principal connections, you have a trivialization of the vertical distribution. Here you have a trivialization of the full tangent volume. Of the full tangent button. What's the symmetry of such a structure? It's a p-invariant vector field that Lie preserves the Carton connection. Notion of curvature, this is standard. So it's this familiar formula. It's a two-form on total space with values in frac G. And this is horizontal and equivariant. And so this is a complete obstruction to flatness. So when k is equal to zero, you're locally equivalent to this homogeneous model. Omega G. Omega G being my notation for the Mara-Cartel form. Okay, so what's our model in this case? So it's often encoded on a Dinkin diagram with just this single cross. This encodes a parabolic subalgebra given right here. P is given in red. This is a root diagram of G2. So you have the Cartel subalgebra at the center here with two dimensions. And then you have 12 arrows on the outside. These are the so-called root spaces for Spaces for this Lie algebra with respect to this Kartansav algebra. These are eigenspaces for the Kartansav algebra. So these are all one-dimensional, and that adds up to 14. Alpha 1 and alpha 2, these are the simple roots, and I'll let Z1 and Z2 be dual to them. So Z1 and Z2, these live in the Cartel sub-algebra right here. I've indicated a grading that would be relevant to us. So there's a grading element. So corresponding to this cross, I'm going to use Z1 as my grading element. Z1 as my grading element. What does that do? So whenever I pair it with any one of these roots, it basically just picks off the coefficient of alpha 1. Okay, so this gets grading 1. Over here would be alpha 1 plus alpha 2, so the coefficient in front of alpha 1 is also 1, so it's grading level 1. Alpha 2, this is grading level 0. This top one is 3 alpha 1 plus 2 alpha 2, so this gets grading level 3. Note that the red part here, Note that the red part here, the non-negative part of the, with regard to this grading, is the parabolic, this red part. The reductive part is what's sitting right here in level 0. That's a copy of GL2. You have the roots of the root diagram SL2, but then here it's two-dimensional. You have this extra central element, and that's exactly this grading element. There's also a filtration on this Liao's row, namely, The algebra. Namely, g superscript k is everything at level k and then higher than it. So for example, p is g0. Whenever I have a filtration, I can take its associated graded, but that just recovers this grading that I have over here. So this associated graded as a G0 module is the same thing as G with its graded. So where's 235? It's on the tangent space here. So this G mod P has a filtration, natural Has a filtration, natural filtration, with respect to P, namely, here's this rank 2 subspace, and this is a rank 2 distribution on the homogeneous space. When I take brackets, so brackets are reflected in this read diagram by vector addition, so these two add to this one, so this is another filter and then you fill up the entire thing. So you have a filtration of 235 type. An important thing for semi-simples is that you have the killing form, which is not. Simples is that you have the killing form, which is non-degenerate, and this gives an identification of the positive part of G as a P module with G mod P star. I could break that symmetry down to G0, and then G mod P is the same thing as G minus, so I could have this identification as well. But this distinction between filtration and grading is important. Just keep in mind, filtration stuff is natural, okay? It's namely natural with respect to the isotropy. Grading is not, okay, it's broken down. Is not. It's broken down. It's equivariant, or invariant rather, with respect to G0 only. Just keep that in mind. That's important. Okay, these normalization conditions on the Carton geometry that I mentioned, regular normal. What does that mean? Let's take our curvature 2 form and insert these constant vector fields. So x here is an element of g, y as well. I take the inverse with respect to the Cartel connection, so this gives me a vector field. Connection. So this gives me a vector field. And then I'll insert these two into the curvature. And so this defines the curvature function. So this is a function valued from, taking values from the total space into wedge 2 g star tensor g, I factored out by p because this guy is horizontal. K was horizontal, so it kills vertical stuff. So it's valued in this space. By that killing form identification, this is wedge. Killing form identification, this is wedge 2G. So this looks like two chains on G plus. Okay, so what's regular? Regular means for this curvature function, if I insert this Gi filtran in Gj, then I land in Gi plus J plus Y. What's normal? It means I'm in the kernel of del star, this del star being the Lie algebra homology differential, okay, given right here. Formula is not so important right now. Okay, if Okay, equivalently, let me just introduce this short notation. So, kappa is in the kernel of the L star and then the first fill trend. So, this is telling me, alternatively, that if I use Z, this grading element, and I let it act, it's the positive Z eigenvalue subspace. So that's just a reformulation of gradient model. Okay, so Carton geometry is of type G2P1 with With curvature living in here, those are equivalent to 2,35. A theorem, so this is all algebraic conditions on the curvature. This is a consequence of these, but here you're actually using some Bianchi identities to get this result. But kappa turns out to be torsion-free. It's valued not just in G, but it's valued in P over here. Okay, so Okay, so curvature is a complicated object. The fundamental part of the curvature is very important. So given a regular normal parabolic geometry, then you could define harmonic curvature by quotienting the output by the image of del star. Here, del star goes from three chains to two chains. Why is this important? Because just like kappa or curvature is a complete destruction to flatness, in terms of harmonic curvature, it's also a In terms of harmonic curvature, this is also a complete restriction to flatness, but this is a much simpler object. And one can compute where you're going. This codomain space, which is a p-module, one can compute the structure of this efficiently via Costance theorem. So G plus, for instance, acts trivially on this space. So we only need to understand the G0 module structure and an explicit lowest weight vector, V0. Okay, so what's the output that we have for 235? That we have for 235. For 235, it turns out this is a sim4 of this G1 level. So this is Cartel's binary quartic invariant from 1910. What's the lowest weight? Turns out to be 4 alpha 1. And you have this lowest weight vector, expressed as a 2 chain. It's a subspace, it's a module of dimension 5, it's this space of binary coordinates. Binary coordinates. Okay, so if I want to generate that entire module, I can just apply G0 raising operators to this lowest weight. And here I just use this shorthand notation. EIJ is living in this root space right here. That's my raising operators, and these are my lowering operators. So how do you actually get what curvature looks like from this data? It turns out that it's sufficient to just generate the entire P module from this, a P module. From this, a p module from this data. So just take all those raising operators from P, just start hitting it on this 2 chain. So this is good enough because there's a result of Chuck that uses this torsion freeness, and it establishes that this curvature is valued in this module. So from this, so this is a complicated module, but we could organize it based on this representation theory and eigenvalues. Theory, eigenvalues, theory of weights. So you get an explicit description of E, and from this, you take a basis there, introduce functions in front of those, and you get what the curvature looks like. And so this allows you to give explicit structure equations via just the definition of curvature. Okay, so this is what it looks like. So here's G2, here's this lowest weight, and then if I just apply G0, Then, if I just apply G0, then I just ladder up in this direction. But if I start applying something from G positive, then I start going to these higher levels. Okay, so what I have in the dots, so this was emphasized quite a bit in Cartel's paper. This generates the, so beyond this binary quartic, you have this ternary quartic, he denoted it by G, and it was stratified into certain levels, A, B, C, D, and E. C D and E. There are these other levels, other spaces over here, labeled by primes, that are also part of the full curvature module. Okay, so what can we do with this? Okay, so let's describe these. What is this Cartel theoretical description that I was talking about? So let's take that notion of Cartel geometry, but now specialize into the homogeneous setting. So on the base, you have this action by a Lie group. It's homogeneous. Group, it's homogeneous. And then we have some lifted action to the bundle. So we have this equivalence of categories that symmetries lift. So you have this left action, lifted left action by F to G, and then you have this right action by P. So it turns out it's an associated bundle that can be described like dots. And any F invariant connection, carton connection, is determined by its data at point. So this leads to the following description. Leads to the following description. Okay, so what are these algebraic models? So it's the data FGP. It's a Lie algebra. Okay, I'll use bracket F over here, such that I have an embedding as a subspace, a subspace into G. It's a filtered subspace because I can take that filtration on G and just restrict it to F. Caution, it's not necessarily going to be a filtered sub-out. Necessarily going to be a filtered sub-algebra, but it's a filtered subspace. I can take its associated graded, and I want to make sure that the negative part is full, because I'm dealing with a homogeneous model. But this being the case, this quotient, f mod F0, that's isomorphic to G mod P. Second axiom is that the isotropic inserts trivially into curvature. What is curvature? It's the difference between the ambient bracket and this F bracket. Okay, so F0 inserts into this, kappa takes as arguments stuff from F. So kappa can be viewed as this element in this space, but by this isomorphism, it lives in this space. But as soon as we know that it lives in this space, then we have a notion of what regular normal was from those algebraic conditions that I mentioned earlier. Okay, so this is the Carton theoretic description. So, and for 235, we had this curve. This curvature module that was calculated earlier. Just to emphasize, I mean, this was a 24-dimensional space stratified as on the previous slide. If you just impose this kernel of del star 1, this space is actually huge. So you don't really want to work with this one. So this one is much more reasonable. Okay, so how do you actually find such Cartel theoretic descriptions, and how do you use it to calculate the Hall of Man? And how do you use it to calculate holoming and full curvature and all these things? Okay, so given the data of G and P, let M be the set of all algebraic models. Okay, so first, two points about it. M is partially ordered. Okay, so if you have two algebraic models, F and F prime, then we say that one is less than or equal to the other if you have a Lie algebra injection from one to the other. And so just morally, you can think of this as: this is describing some geometric structure, but maybe the description. But maybe the description is not optimal. Maybe you're describing it with just a five-dimensional Lie algebra, but in fact, the geometric structure has seven-dimensional symmetry. Okay, so we're really looking for maximal elements with respect to this partial ordering. More importantly, as far as trying to find such models, it's important to remember that everything comes from determining this data of an F and invariant connection at a point. And that as I move. Points, and that as I move up and down the fiber, things transform in a nice equivariant manner. So the set of algebraic models naturally inherits a p-action, because I can choose which point I want to extract that data at, coming from over here. Okay, so we're going to use this to classify. So we have a p-action on a set, carry out some normalizations. But of course, yeah, we also want to impose the fact. We also want to impose the fact invertible conditions. Just that data is, we want to bring in this harmonic curvature, because that's really essential information. Where does that come in? So first of all, I'll establish some necessary constraints. So given an algebraic model, then this guy is actually a filtered Lie algebra. Filtered Lie algebra in the sense that fi bracket Fj lands in Fi plus J. J. This F bracket respects the filtration. And secondly, that S being the associated graded is a graded subalgebra. This, however, again, I'll emphasize, it's not necessarily a subalgebra. Second point, the isotropy acts nicely on curvature. This is one means in full detail. And before we saw that, F0 inserts trigly into curvature. That's another important point. That's another important point. So, the right F0, when you insert here, these insertions, the bracket involving those, there's no difference between the ambient bracket and this F bracket. Most importantly is this statement right here. Let me define this object first, actually. Okay, so I'm going to get a graded approximation, basically, to the symmetry algebra. Okay, so what is this? So, let g be a graded Lie algebra with G minus 1 generating the entire negative part. Generating the entire negative part. Let phi live in a G0 representation, so namely this homology space. Then I'm going to let A be the graded least subalgebra with negative part prescribed, and then I'm just going to iteratively generate the positive part, such that I get a graded subalgebra. Okay, so at level k, it's the stuff in gk that brackets with everything in g minus 1 to be in the previously. To be in the previously prescribed level. So this is where harmonic curvature is going to come in. I'm going to feed that into this prolongation. And it turns out that this S, the associated gradient of F, is constrained by it. It has to be a sub-algebra, a graded sub-algebra up here. So this is obviously called that this F, this filter of the algebra, is a filtered sub-deformation of this guy. It might not be equal. Okay, so concretely, what should we do here? Okay, so we have this thing that was calculated from Costland's theorem, this S4G1, this Cartel-Portic. Here's the lowest weight for alpha 1. And here's how I think about it abstractly in terms of an SL2 basis. So y to the fourth, and then these powers up to x to the fourth. Z is equal to Z1. It's acting, this grading element is just acting y plus 4. Element is just acting by plus 4 on the entire module. Okay, so we want to be able to calculate these constraints in a graded fashion in order to get some sort of approximation to these symmetry algebras. So if harmonic curvature is turned on, so this is something in this homology space, turns out there's never any positive prolongation. Okay, so this is a property that we've referred to as prolongation rigidity in this paper with Forrest in 2014. Force in 2014. And so to get an idea of how much symmetry you could have, so let's look at the different types, normalize them up to the G0 action. Okay, so here are normal forms. Calculate the annihilators at the zero level. And then there's nothing at the positive levels. So you have a two-dimensional annihilator here. You have a five-dimensional G minus, so that gives you seven. One-dimensional over here, six over here. One dimensional over here, six. Okay, so these give you. Here, six. Okay, so these give you the maximums for each of these types. This is based on the multiplicity types of the quartic. Are these bounds realized? In all cases, except for this type 3, they are realized and will exhibit the ones that are realized. I should mention, yeah, so this for non-flat homogeneous 235s, this guy, yes, overall, so it implies this gap that symmetry is bounded by 7. More on gaps in this. More on gaps in this paper with Boris. But the conclusion from all this is that for the multiply transitive cases, you're in type N or type D. Okay, so how do we, let me give you some examples of such parts of theoretic models. So let's focus on the fourth power case, the type N case. So all multiple transitive guys in this branch are either six or seven sub trees. Okay, so these are, this is the trees. Okay, so these are. This is the list over here. There's redundancies. I probably should have put that in here, but. So we're going to focus on the N7 case. N6 has also been done in this Cartel theoretic fashion, but it's more complicated, so I won't be describing it here. But via his reduction method, Carton arrives at the following structure equations. And it's quite complicated structure equations. You have this invariant, this one parameter appearing in several places. And, you know, And from this Lie theoretic description, if you try to ask the question, what is curvature in this case, or what's the embedding of this F into G, it's not at all obvious. So let me just write it on the next page. Okay, so you start with this harmonic curvature data and the especially important weights here for alpha 1. Here's the negative part in terms of In terms of root vectors. And then here's that two-dimensional annihilator. So any n algebraic model is equivalent to one of those given below for some invariant C, classified by the following essential invariant. It's actually a very simple description in terms of algebraic models. It's this leading part being the standard root vectors, but then you have some deformation, some tail that's appearing over here, but it's only appearing in one place. Appearing one place. Curvature is just harmonic curvature given over here. Okay, so just to locate all these on the root diagram, so these black ones are the negative part given right here. E1, 0 is over here, z2 over there. And you arrive at this really by first doing some normalization with respect to the group. You have this freedom with respect to this group action by P. And you really want to focus on this semi-simple. Really want to focus on this semi-simple element. So, in general, when you start out, you have Z2 plus these higher tails, but then you can normalize by P to eventually get to here. It's a little bit more complicated, but yeah, basically you can get to here without too much fuss. So once you have this semi-simple element then, you let it act everywhere. And it has to annihilate curvature. And beyond that, if you think of these tails as basically, you're specifying a function that takes input. That takes input F10 and spits you out E10, that function should be invariant. It should be annihilated by the Z2 as well. What's the weight? Z2 annihilates 4 alpha 1. It also annihilates any multiple of alpha 1. So what we're looking for in this space of deformations here are eigenspaces, yeah, weight spaces that are multiples of alpha 1. For curvature, For curvature, same thing. We're looking for weight spaces that are multiples of alpha 1. So let me just go back to this picture that we had over here, this conceptual picture. There's only one weight space that has dimension one over here. And that's exactly the lowest weight of this harmonic curvature part. It's exactly this guy right here. So this guy is. Exactly this curvature that's appearing. Dennis? Can you tell why curvature would harmonic curvature here? It's exactly what I just pointed to because there's nothing else in higher gradings that's a multiple of alpha 1. Z2 has to annihilate. Okay, so you get that very, very quickly from this weight picture. Okay, so this is a nice way of viewing the embedding into Viewing the embedding into the ambient G2 and the brackets to get the L-theoretic structure, this is the definition of the bracket I F. It's the ambient bracket deformed by curvature. And you can match this data, this Lieutenant Lie-theoretic structure to the one that Curtin had. And his invariant nice, well rather the actual essential invariant. If you're in Zoom meeting, I'm just gonna suggest that you watch the live stream here temporarily. Live stream here temporarily. You can see the link in the chat. You should be able to tune in. Is everything okay? I can see it clearly over there. That's fine. Jean rolls that she cannot hear you. Yeah, no, it's move to the red. Oh, it turned by itself. Hi, can you hear me? Yes, we can now. Okay, perfect. Okay, so you can get the lead. Okay, so you could get the lithium structure just by evaluating all of these guys on the ambient bracket, G2 bracket, deformed by curvature. Taking cartel's invariant, well the essential invariant is I squared, it's a multiple of this C squared that I mentioned. What about type D? So all complex D6 models, these were classified by Cartel in 1910. A list over R was looked at. A list over R was looked at recently by Travis Wolsey in 2019, and Judy Minsky did it via normal forms. The list contains interesting distributions, including those describing rolling without twisting or slipping, involving surfaces of constant curvature, two-square Euclidean hyperbolic planes. Okay, so this was the theorem that I alluded to earlier, exceptionality of the 3-to-1 ratio. The symmetry jumps up to G2 when rho is equal to 3. I'm going to use this notation. Is low 3. I'm going to use this notation dρ. This is not an F in a Mons form. This is just the ratio, the radii. Okay, otherwise it's SO3, SO3 when rho is not equal to 3. Okay, so as I mentioned, the origins are due to Bryant, who first observed that, well, it wasn't stated like this in Carton. He phrased it in terms of certain curves, certain special curves, but he was able to. Certain special curves, but he was able to match this data with what was in Cartel in order to prove this theorem. So Leiden used this theory of abnormal extremals in order to basically show that this, in this case, rho zoo 3, the distribution is cartel flat, the harmonic curvature, by other bandits. Board Montgomery, they found an embedding into G2 in the Rho sigla3. In the Rose equal 3 case. So let's actually look at theirs, the Lithioretic description. So it's given right here. Okay, so let's take SO3, so R3 with cross product. Here, that's the commutators. And then I'll define the Lie algebra SO3, SO3, and that isotropy being just KK. So on the quotient F mod F0, I'm the quotient f mod f0, I want to define an F0 invariant subspace, or equivalently up in F, I want to define a three-dimensional subspace that's F0 invariant. So this is the data. From there, I take brackets and get the weak derived flag, and it's of 235 type. I've specified that rho is greater than 1. Let's start out with an adaptive basis, just a Basis, just a naive choice, right, given right here. This tilde basis. Just notice how this isotropy element, how does it act on the minus one level? So this x1, x2, tilde. And when I let it act, x1 will go to x2, and then x2 will go to minus x1. So it's acting via rotation. It brackets with this x3 to be 0, and then it will do another rotation over here. Rotation over here. 2020 is 2. Okay, so we use these facts. Let's outline the Cartel theoretical proof of this exceptionality of rho is equal to 3. Okay, so first let's get that data at the harmonic level. So remember the lowest one was 4 alpha 1, so that was corresponding to y to the power of 4. The one for type D, corresponding to x squared, y squared, you have to raise by 2. Okay, so apply, so add 2 alpha 2 there. So this is the weight. Alpha 2 there. So this is the weight. Any D6 algebraic model is P equivalent to one given below. Yeah, so it's a bit of a complicated thing, but the point here is that everything is quite organized in terms of the weights. There are three levels over here. Complicated expressions, but again, this comes from this curvature module. And let's just look back to that. Look back to that picture. So 4 alpha 1 plus 2 alpha 2 is a multiple of this one right here, 2 alpha 1 plus alpha 2. But in general, what can appear in the curvature and the beta rather, are multiples of this weight. And it's constrained to be in this, well, you have a double, you have multiplicity here. So it's constrained to be in this dimension for a subspace. Dimension for subspace whose formulas are calculated because this, yeah, via this process of generating all this from this lowest C. Okay, so back to this. So if you look at this isotropy element, you'll see that it annihilates all these guys. Moreover, if you look at these leading parts and the higher tail, Parts and the higher tails, the difference is always a multiple of one of these multiples. So 2 alpha 1 plus alpha 2, for instance, that gives you a shift from there to there. You can add it again, you get to the next level. But of course, to get these exact expressions, you have to compute Jacobi identities. But this is what you get. So you have this Cartel theoretic model. This is the Lie theoretic model derived from that. Theoretic model derived from that. So, what we want to do is match that Lie-theoretic description that Bourne Montgomery had to this data right here. So, take the tilde basis and match it up to this one. And the clue to doing this is focusing on this isotropic. How does it act? So, here, notice that you have eigenvalues 0 and 0 and 1 and 1 and minus 1, minus 1. Okay, so we're going to take this, yeah, what Okay, so we're going to take this, yeah, what they have, this was their lithium description, complexify it, and match it to this D6 equations that we have here. Okay, at these double eigenvalues, but the t tilde has eigenvalues, this double eigenvalues, 0 and plus or minus i. So we have to change that, multiply by i to get the eigenvalues to match. And then, well, we're working in the category of filter things, right? So we should allow for the general filtration adapted. The general filtration-adapted anti-eigenspace. So you could create an ensance here for what these x's, these until it x's, should look like. Now you impose those brackets from the previous page, and then you could get what these si and tj's look like, as well as some parameter relations. So you have this b that has this complicated formula, and notice what's in the numerator over here. Be the numerator over here. Two cases. If b is not equal to zero, then you can normalize to one. Let's just go back over here. B is appearing over here in curvature. So this guy is not zero in that case. So you're not going to get some maximal symmetry in that case. You could always normalize to b is equal one by scaling. And when I set one here, then I could solve for a squared in terms of the rest of the stuff. And you get this special knowledge. These special numbers appear in the denominator model. But when b is equal to zero, well, that's not appearing in this classification for d6, right? Because curvature is zero in that case. But those formulas still work. They give you a description of an algebraic model, but it's just non-maximal. This F is six-dimensional, but it's non-maximal. The curvature is zero, and so you can find an embedding of that F into GT. F into G2 in that case. So namely, oh wait, so B is equal to zero, so we're over here. We want to just establish that A is non-zero, and then you get the result. This I'm not displaying explicitly here, but it's coming from how these Si's are expressed in terms of the B's and the B and A. And what you could show is that if Si is non-zero, well, SI has to be non-zero, I mean framing. Framing, then this will imply that A is non-zero. Okay, so therefore, from zero equals something non-zero, and then all this, you get the exceptionality of these ratios. We restrict it to rho being greater than one. So kappa is equal to zero. Here, you embed into G2, and so therefore, the corresponding radial form embeds into the split form of G2. Finally, a bit about Holo, and then I'll conclude. So once you have a cartel-theoretic model, So once you have a cartel-theoretic model, define this holonomy sequence as the following. Evaluate kappa on f insertions, and then start bracketing this iteratively with f as a subspace of g. Just keep adding that. You get an increasing sequence. This stabilizes eventually. And this is going to be the infinitesimal holonomy of the associated F-invariant quartz-like connection. Okay, so you can do this very efficiently from this using these algebraic models. And so you get the following results: five-dimensional Heisenberg for N7, full holonomy for N6 and D6 generically, some special holonomy SL3 in the I is equal to zero case. Okay, and so this is very much related to the study of finding Einstein metrics for the corresponding Neurovsky conformal structure. In the case that, yeah, basically you view G2 as Basically, you view G2 as 7 by 7 matrices acting in the standard representation. And in this case, it doesn't annihilate any vector in the standard representation. So that's going to be indicating there are no Einstein scales, there are no Einstein metrics in the conformal class, whereas in these cases, there are going to be some Einstein metrics in corresponding neuroscientific class. Okay, so let me just conclude with some perspectives. Canonical cartel, canonical canonical, no, canonical cartel cannot be. No, a canonical cartel connection is the goal of many articles. It's the solution in the sense of et de cartel. If a cartel connection exists for a geometric structure, use it. Symmetric classification emphasized here is merely one application among many. In the parabolic setting, particularly 235, Constance theorem is crucial. Tanaka prolongation gives a graded constraint on the symmetry algebra. And I contrasted this coordinate and Lie-theoretic presentations of homogeneous models versus. Presentations of homogeneous models versus a cartel theoretical presentation. And this really is highly lacking in the literature. Even for many classically known structures, even for, for instance, second-order ODs, these descriptions just haven't been computed. Holomody hasn't been computed in these cases. I'll just conclude with this one quote about the 1910 paper from Robert in Sharpe's book. In Shrupp's book. So you read the introduction to a paper of Cartel and you understand nothing. Then you read the rest of the paper and you still, and still you understand nothing. Then you go back and read the introduction again and there begins to be the faint glimmer of something very interesting. Okay, so I'll end there. Thanks very much. Any questions? Any questions for Dennis? Yes. So once again, I'm not holding me. Once again, holonomy, so as you said, and seven has Heisenberg. Is it for all cases also exceptional parameters like one-half? All Heisenberg, right? Yep. And you have two vectors in the standard representation. Two-dimensional space that's annihilated by that holonomy. But otherwise, the only case amongst those homogeneous models is just this special D6. This special D6 case, which is not one of the rolling cases, actually. If you, yeah, I should put the formula over here. So, this case i for this invariant i, what is this, i? Yeah, right there. So, rho has to be plus or minus i. It doesn't appear in the rule classification. Um, not for rolling balls, but uh I I should double check with the other rolling surfaces which ones it corresponds to. Thanks for your very nice talk. This is Nikki talking. I wanted to ask you. Yes, so voice from the past. I was uh intrigued by your remark regarding Einstein metrics in the conformal Morovsky class. Can you elaborate on this a bit, please? Can you generally disabled, please? Yeah, sure. So, I mean, so it's governed by a certain equation, a PD called the almost Einstein equation. So it's a PD on a certain factor, often denoted sigma. So given a G in there, can I do a conformal rescaling such that this is an Einstein metric? So there's a second-order PD that governs this. But the theory. That governs this. But the theory that's been established, I mean, it's corresponding, it can be reformulated as trying to find parallel sections of a certain tractor bundle. Okay, so it's a certain vector bundle that's associated to the Cartone bundle with fiber being the standard representation of G2. So necessary constraints for this non-trivial For this non-trivial parallel section to exist, is that it should be annihilated by the holonomy. So when I have full holonomy, then there's nothing annihilated. So there are not going to be any Einstein scales. Whereas in these cases over here, so this one, when you view G2 inside 7 by 7 matrices and you examine, okay, how many annihilated objects do I have? It's a two-dimensional subspace of A two-dimensional subspace of almost Einstein scales. There are Einstein metrics in this corresponding Neurovsky-conformal class, whereas in this case, there's a one-dimensional space of almost Einstein scales. But your freedom is just in the choice of conformal samples, is that correct? Uh yes, yes, yes. Yeah, you're working within the conformal class, so you're asking, so are there Einstein metrics in that conformal class? Metrics in that conformal class. But intuitively, I find it maybe I'm not understanding what's going on, but I find it a bit confusing, right? Because you have so I see, so I should think of this like some kind of an integrability condition for this highly overdetermined system that's governing the conformance. Be annihilated by the holomy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yep. Okay, very good. Text is nice. That's really good. But also, like, for this. But also like for these scales, right? They have no degeneracy condition. Yeah, so that's why it's often called almost Einstein scales. It's a linear PDE, so this almost is to allow for the zero solution or singularities potentially. But I mean, yeah, you want non-trivial solutions and working off of the singular set wherever this vanishes, then those can be used as defining appropriate conformal rescalings. Appropriate conformal scalings to get to Einstein metrics. So for SL3, it is this non-degenerate scale? I mean, yes, yes. I mean, you just have to work off of the single set. Hey, Dennis. Hey. Hey, question for you, man? Yeah. So this is one of the simpler distributions where the automorphism group is finite dimensional, right? Finite dimensional, right? 235, yeah, it's 14. Yeah, it's the maximum. What's that? 14 is the maximum, yeah. Right, but it's one of the simpler ones, though, eh? I don't know. You want to call it 235 simple? As you wish. Well, I mean, you know, differential structures where you have a finite dimensional automorphism. It is one of the smallest dimensional places you can find in general. So what's, have you had any success on any other? Have you had any success on any other simpler, simple cases, easy cases, small-dimensional cases, to do any classifying? So, like homogeneous classification? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, so I mean, so a more, well, I guess you could call it a more complicated case because there's more branches. So, for five-dimensional Legendre and contact, so that's a contact-five-manifold, and then on the contact. A contact 5 manifold, and then on the contact distribution, you have a splitting into isotropic subspaces. Equivalent, you could formulate that as a complete second-order PD system on one scalar dependent variable and two independent variables. Considered up to point transformation. So, there, the analogous question of classification has been done. Also, for five-dimensional CR, that's also been done. CR, that's also been done. But there, the Carton theoretic description hasn't really been described. For five-dimensional integrable Legendre contact, it's basically there, but it wasn't really formulated in this language that I mentioned. So let's thank Dennis one more time. So Dennis, you should also stop the importance of the. Danielson should also stop the
