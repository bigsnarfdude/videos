Okay, so thank you very much for the kind introduction. And I also would like to thank the organizers for the invitation. And it's my great pleasure to present my work here. Yeah, actually, I really wanted to go there, but I couldn't because of teach, because of the teaching. So I hope that I have a chance to. I have a chance to visit there in the near future. So, today I'd like to talk about whereputen is and finite time singularity formation for the so-called class of laser system. And this is a joint work with Yinzi Zhong from Seoul National University in Korea. And I think all of you are familiar with Of you are familiar with kinetic theory, so I'd like to directly start it with my main equation today. So, this is my main equation. So we have a plus of type equation and here f is the particle one particle distribution function on R d cross R D. D and here the D denotes the dimension which is greater than or equal to one. So here we have a free transport part and here we have a force build and on the right hand side we have a linear Pok√©Planck operator. So this consists of linear diffusion. Linear diffusion in velocity and linear damping in velocity. Okay, and then here we have some non-negative constant. So if the sigma is strictly positive, then we have a linear Fokker-Planck operator on the right-hand side. And if the sigma equals zero, then we just have the plus-off iteration. And in the first field, we have the situation. Fourth spirit, we have a function v, and the v function is given by this. And here, the lambda is the zigzag operator. So, here we have the negative power. So, actually, this is the inverse of the fractional Lafression. And here, we have the kappa. Kappa is here, and depending on the sign, Depending on the sign, it describes the attractive or repressive interactions. And here we have the rule, and then rule is the local particle density. So the rule is just the integral of f with respect to velocity. So for this system, we are interested in the case where the beta is between 0 and 2. And there are several examples of this type of kinetic equation. And maybe the most classical example is the Poisson Popper Planck equations that corresponds to the case beta equals two. So in this case, the phi function is given by this. And then here the constant. And then here the constant kappa can be chosen according to the applications in plasma physics or the astrophysics. And there is another equation called plus of Dirac Venny equations. And that corresponds to the case beta equals zero. So in this case, and then we choose the kappa equals. We choose the kappa equals minus one, then we have the b equals the minus low. And then there is other type of the equation, which is so called the plus Manip system. And then in this case, the p function is given by this. And this function is proposed by Manip to describe the To describe the anomalous precession of the perihelion of Mercury, because as you know, the orbit of Mercury doesn't behave as required by Newton's equation. So the Malev modified the classical Newton's gravitational law by adding this additional term. So he wants to describe that the behavior of mercury. Behavior of Mercury by using the non-relativistic gravitational law. And this, the potential, I mean, this term is called the pure minute or manate correction. So actually, in this case, in this case, if we use this rotation, Use this notation for a potential function. And in 3D of the constant, in the Crascal, the Coulomb case, we have one over R. I'm talking about the three-dimensional case. On the other hand, in this case, we have this class for ground potential and plus the one over. And plus the one over are squared in 3D. So in this system, we have this additional term, which is more singular than the coulombs. And then in this project, we want to generalize the idea. So basically, we want to consider this the function p and then where the beta. Here the beta is between 0 and 2. So in this case, the potential function is given by something like the t minus 3. So this is a leader potential. Okay, and then there are some work on this type of the system. Bridge system and for the plus of Poisson or the Plus of Poisson Poker Planck equations, there are the many results. In particular, if the D equals two or three, then we can have global classical solutions. And if the beta equals one, then as I said, that system can be called a plus of MALEB system. And then for this system, as I know, there is. For this system, as I know, there is only one theoretical or the mathematical paper on the local existence theory. So actually, in this paper, they obtained the local in time unique classical solution to the Vlasov Malef system. And for the Vlassov-Dirac-Bene equation, there is a papers on the Looker in time analytic. For in time analytic solutions. And it's also known that this equation is imposed in this so-level space. Actually, I'm not familiar with the repository theory, but it seems that the research says that in this case, we cannot obtain the local repository theory in some weighted sovereign. Some weighted sub-level space. So, in this case, we have to consider the analytic solutions because the force field is too singular. So, we cannot have the solutions in the solar spaces. So, actually, here the weight means that we expect the velocity, because in this work, they concern the phiotic domain. This work they concern the phenotypic domain. So, this weight is for the velocity. So, yeah. So, in this case, we cannot obtain the solution in some weighted sub-liquid space agents. And then about the global in time existence of solutions, of course, again, there are many papers on the plus of Um, on the plastopozan or plastopozong cocoa plant systems, and then listening in my joint work with uh indigenous, we are able to construct the global weak solutions for the plus of manate or plus of married plant system. But actually, in this work, we need to assume some similar conditions on the initial data. This condition on the initial data, precisely we need to assume that the initial mass is small enough to get the global in time existence of the solution. But actually, our idea can be extended to the case where the beta is between one and two. Then, actually, in this case, we don't need to assume any similar. Assume many similar conditions on the initial data. And there are also several works on the finite time singularity deformation. So for the blusso and attractive Poisson system, if the dimension is greater than or equal to four, then we can construct some integer later leading to a finite time singular deformation. Finite time similarity dimension. And for the velocity and pure LALEB system, even if in three dimensions, we can construct some integer later leading to finite time singularity condition. Yeah, but in this works, as I know, yeah, but the folder, this finite time singularity. This finite time singularity formation, there is no result if there exists, I mean, if there is the linear Poker-Planck operator. So, if there is a diffusion in velocity, then there is no result on the finite time singular deformation. So, actually, motivated by those words, our goal is to study or some develop some theory on the finite time singularity formation. The finite time singularity formation, even if there will be just the linear Poker-Planck operator. And here, as I said, if the beta equals one, then we can have some solution in the sub-lapse spaces. But if beta equals zero, then we have the ill positive in the sub-lapse space. So our question is that The question is: Can you obtain some lookuring time working is in the weighted sublime space HS for some beta between zero and one? So, in my talk, I will discuss these two things. Okay, so I will talk about the local in time variables in theory and based. This theory, and basically, we are considering this weighted stop-lep norm, and we want to construct our solution in this weighted sub-lep space. So, actually, here we consider some weight in velocity. So, there is the weight in velocity, and if the n here, the n equals zero, can actually recover the user sublips. For the user sub-left space HX. Yeah, because we are also considering the linear Poker-Planck operator and there is the diffusion in velocity. So even if we assume some, I mean, even if we assume that initial layer is compactly supported, but we cannot control the size of the support of solution in Vela C. So yeah, so we. Yeah, so we need to consider some weighting plastic. And this is our first theorem. So actually we are able to consider some beta, which is less than one. So actually the our beta is between three cores and one. And for any sigma, so for any sigma, the Cauchy problem The Cauchy problem for our last of release system is locally well pushed in this weighted sublime space. And of course, we need some condition on the S and the M. Yeah, but we are able to have this local time we're putting theory. And if the sigma equals zero, that means we don't have the diffusion in velocity. Diffusion in velocity. Then we can assume, I mean, we can control the support by assuming that the initial data is compactly supported in V. And in this case, actually, we can have our local solution in this user sobless space HS. Yeah, here we only consider the beta. Consider the beta less than one, but surely our argument can be easily extended to the case beta greater than equal to one. And here we only consider one signal to operator, but we can also consider the linear combination of the sigma operators. Okay, then let me give you the idea of group. So after tedious computations, we can arrive at this differential inequality for the various of the left norm F. And here the U is given by this. So for simplicity, if we ignore the linear pole component cooperator, then yeah. greater than yeah the sigma equals sigma so we can obtain that this is found by hs null of u times uh this okay but the problem is here uh here is that as you see the u is equal to um in terms of regularity uh is equal to like the grad one minus row Minus plant row. Okay. So if we estimate the HS norm of u, okay, then we have we have that this HS norm of u is bounded by hs plus one minus beta below. And actually, by using our the weighted space, The weighted space, we can also control the HS law by this weighted sobleth norm of F. But as you see, so if we combine these two observations, then surely this bound is by F H S plus one minus beta and two n x v. Okay, so here the problem of torque is the beta. The problem of torque if the beta is less than one because if beta is greater than or equal to one, then actually this s plus one minus beta is less than s. Okay, so this means that actually this can be bounded by this weighted norm of f. Okay, so we can include this argument that we can have some recalling time estimate. But if the beta is less than one, then actually this s plus one minus beta is strictly greater than s. So this means that we need some better regularity for low compared to F to close this estimate. So, in this case, it's not so obvious. So, to have the better for low compared with F, we use this velocity averaging lemma. So, basically, this lemma says that this kinetic transport operator. So, yes, this kinetic transport. Kinetic transport operator improves the regularity of this quantity compared with H for this kinetic duration. So actually in our case, H equals F, and then we need to the control, we need to have the better regulatory for this quantity. That is our rule, right? That is our rule, right? Yeah, but we cannot directly apply this velocity leveling lemma because this FUCI functions should be compactly separate. Yeah, so we need to do some work. But anyway, as you see here, H is just in the N2, but actually this integral is in the HS. Okay, and S is given by this. Okay, and S given by this. So we are applying this lemma with m equals one. So we have equals one quarter. Okay. So that's why we have this condition. Beta is between three quarter and one. So to apply this dilemma, we need to consider the sumos and linear bump function. And we apply the abolition lemma for each j to this quantity. Okay, so now this v function is completely separate, so we can apply the velocity abolition lemma. So we can have this inequality by using the velocity averaging lemma. And then here, let's see if the n this is a This is a power in our weighted impulse T. So, if the n is large enough, then the sequence is sum of. So, precisely if the n is greater than d over 4, then the sequence on the right-hand side is some of it. So, actually, we can control this guy, this quantity by our weighted sub-lepnum f. Sub-lepnum f and then here again we use the interpolation inequality yeah and then we can uh close the argument okay yeah blah blah blah yeah but uh because of the time limit yeah i uh yeah i'd like to skip this part so uh basically yeah we need to control this guy but the main idea uh is to use the uh velocity opposition lemma to get the opposite lemma to get the better regularity for low compared with f so actually this quantity can be bounded by our desired uh weighted solar eponym of f okay so yeah so we can close this uh the estimate and this is uh this is just for the a priori estimate and to get the existence of solutions we need to regularize We need to regularize the system. Then we need to obtain some uniform bound estimate with respect to the regularization parameters. And then we need to pass the limit. And then we also need to show the uniqueness of solutions. Yeah, and then let's move into the second part on the finite time singular deformation. So as I said, if the four bit the bit The between zero and two, we can rewrite this quantity as the convolution of the k and rho, and where the k is given by this singular potential. Yeah, but actually for the analysis of finite time singularity formation, we want to have some general, we want to develop some general theory. So we replace this. So, we replace this phi function with a k-convolution law, and the k has this form. So, k is the linear combination of this singular potentials. And then the coefficient is positive. So, in this part, we consider the attractive interactions. And the alpha is between the zero and d. Is between the zero and d. Okay, and then actually the alpha equals the d minus two corresponds to the Coulomb case and alpha is between d minus two and d then that corresponds to least potential case and alpha is less than d minus two then that corresponds the subcloudic potentials. Yeah, and then for the analysis we are going to use this We are going to use this total energy function E and the momentum of inertia I. So we have the kinetic energy and the entropy and interaction energy. And here we are considering the attractive interaction. So here we have the minus sign. And then the momentum of inertia is given by this. And this is our Fecon theorem. So yeah. Theorem. So, yeah, the condition looks very complicated, but the interesting point is that even if we have a diffusion in velocity, we can have a fine-time singular dimension under certain conditions on the initial data. So, if the initial data satisfy those conditions, then the lip span T of a solution should be finite. Okay, and then let me give you a quick review on the Pascal Bureau analysis when the sigma equals zero. So this is the glass of Poisson system, the case of gravitational interactions, so attractive interaction case. In this case, yeah, consider the energy, total energy. And since we have, since we don't have We have since we don't have the linear Poker Planck operator, so we don't have entropy in the total energy, and then we can first the conservation of the total energy E. Okay, and then now we estimate this moment of inertia. So we take the second time derivative with respect to time, okay, then we have this equity, okay, and then now we. And then now we replace this by the E of T plus this interaction term. And we have this. And if the D is greater than equal to 4, then actually this becomes non-positive. So actually here, and then the energy is conserved in time. So we have this one. And then, so if the D E of zero is negative, then Then, after integrating this differential inequality twice, we can have that the i of t should be negative in a finite time. So, we follow this idea. So we consider this second time derivative of i, then we can have this differential inequality. But here, we need to control the negative part of the entropy. So, yeah, so we control the negative part of the entropy by the momentum of inertia and then kinetic energy. And then, so we combine these two differential inequality to have this second order differential inequality for the momentum of inertia. And then we now have this gronel time inequality. So, as you see here, So, as you see here, if the vector is positive, so if the coefficient of this e to the beta t is negative, then h of t should be negative in a finite time. Okay, so yeah. So, we can have the finite time singularity formation even with the linear Portland cooperator. Okay. Yeah. And then here I only mention about the attractive cases, but actually, we can also consider the combined attractive and repulsive case under certain condition. Okay, so let me summarize my talk. So we first discussed the lowering time verification theory for the plus of laser system with beta between three colors and one. And then we will. And then we also discussed the finite time singularity formation for Vlassov, Lis or the Vlassov Planck system. Yeah, and then this part was the A progress made. So if we consider the intersection of these two results, then actually if the alpha is between two and the minus three quarters, then we have the recording time. And we have the recurrent time where it was initially and the finite time singularity formation. Yeah, so and then this table shows our current state on the verpogenous and singular deformation, the attractive cases. Yeah, and then this is the end of my talk. Yeah, thank you for your attention. Okay, thank you very much. Okay, thank you very much. Any questions in chat here? The audience? I actually have a quick question. We have a minute or two. As a numerical person, I'm always curious, can we actually somehow find the time when the singularity forms in these cases, or it's almost impossible? Yeah, I mean, uh, yeah, in this estimate, we know the upper bound of the finite, the time that gives the singularity formation. But I think it's very hard to find the exact time of the singularity. Yeah, okay, okay, just thank you, thank you very much. Um, and then we'll we can. Um, and then we can continue with the next talk now. Yes, I'm here. Uh-huh. Can you show that I can share when perfect. Perfect. Okay, so the next talk is. Can you? Okay, perfect. We can see it perfectly fine. So the next talk is.
