Okay, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak here and for inviting me to this nice workshop. So I want to talk about the work I did during my post talk in Stony Brook together with Simon Donaldson and it's based on three papers. So here you can find as preprints on the archive and the third one is Preprint and the archive, and the third one is working progress. Okay, so as the title says, I will talk about dimension five and dimension six, but because our common interest is G2. So I want to start in dimension seven, which is G2. Of course, there are various different ways to think about G2 manifolds. So I want to start by recalling the point of view. The point of view by defining it by stable three forms and Hitchens variation by description. Okay, so where we call a differential form stable if the orbit under the action of the general linear group is open, and that in particular is the case for this model free form on R7. And now, if we are on a seven-dimensional manifold, and at every point. Manifold and at every point shows such a stable three-form, then point-wise this determines in a purely algebraical way without taking any derivatives. So we get another four-form, a Riemannian metric, and the volume form. Of course, in such a way that this one here is the hot star of the three form, and that's the volume form of the metric. Okay, so we have in particular this volume form. In particular, this waveform, so we can integrate it over the manifold. Now, something interesting happens if you look at the first variation of this. So now, if you vary your free form, then you see that the first variation is precisely given by this four-form. So, more or less, you can think of this four-form of the gradient of where in the volume form, if you change the free. form if you change the free form. Okay, so now this becomes even more interesting if you assume that the G2 structure is closed and you only consider variations in the homology class because then the variation is necessarily exact. So if we substitute this in here we can use Stokes theorem to rewrite it like this and then if you are Like this. And then, if you are on a closed manifold, so there is no boundary, this term doesn't exist. And this here now has to be zero. If it's a critical point for the H function L, has to be zero for every sigma, which means that the four form has to be closed. So to sum up, we can think of the torsion-free conditions as given As given that the structure is already closed, the other equation means precisely that it's a critical point in its comology class. Okay, so let's move on to dimension six. But what is the six-dimensional analog of G two? Well, of course, if you think about G two in terms of holonomy, then it's SU three, which also gives rise to Gives arise to a Riemannian metric with a special holonomy and which is richly flat. But from this pigeon point of view, the analog will be SL3C structures. So on R6, which we can identify with C3, there also is a stable form. So it's more like the real part of this DZ1, watch DZ2, WHG DZ3. Three and just as in the seven-dimensional case on the six-manifold, such a stable form point-wise gives us a lot of other structure. So now instead of a four-form, we get another free form, which I will call A of capital psi, just to emphasize that it's a function of the psi. We get an almost complex structure instead of a metric. And again, a volume form. And this time they're related in such a way that if we form the complex three-form psi plus I ape psi, then this is of type 3, 0 with respect to the almost complex structure. And because this form is nowhere zero, then this in particular means that the associated canonical bundle has to be trivial. I mean, the bundle has to be trivial. So you can always think of this stable three form in dimension six as the real part of such a complex volume form, trivializing the canonical bundle. And now here the torsion-free conditions are again that the two differential forms are both closed. So then we say that the SA3C structure is torsion-free. And so this equivalent. And so this is equivalent that this almost complex structure is intactable, and this 3-0 form is holomorphic. And then now we could, just in the G2 case, we can now consider the functional where we integrate the volume form over the six-manifold. And if we assume, so this time again, the gradient of this is the sort of the partner, the three-fold. The three-form, the other differential form, and given that the psi is close, so then on a closed manifold, critical points precisely correspond to the second condition, the torsion-free conditions. Okay, so you see, this in some sense is very another. In some sense, it is very analogous to the description of G2 structures. So for me, dimension 6, the analog is cosmo 3C. And so there's no, in particular, there's no natural metric associated with this structure. So there is a direct link between those stable forms in dimension 7 and dimension 6. So if you just own R7, take the 6-dimensional. On R7, take a six-dimensional linear subspace. So then the restriction of the three-form on R7 to the six-dimensional space is precisely the stable form in dimension six. So for example, if we write R7 in a standard way as R6 plus R with the variable R, then the stable three-form dimension seven looks like this. So if we restrict it to So, if we restrict it to where R is equal to zero, then we get precisely this here as the standard form on R6. And now, so what is omega zero? You said there is no metric. There's no metric, yes. But omega zero is then not either omega zero. Oh, well, this is just on us and just I mean if if it's a hypersurface energy to structure then there is a metric but okay so well in any case sort of this thing here sort of raises the question sort of that's the point-wise model for a boundary value problem which Sam Donson considered. So if you have a certain manifold with a six-dimensional boundary Dimensional boundary, and we have a closed stable freeform on the boundary. Can we fill it in with a torsion-free two structure in the interior, which restricts to the freeform on the boundary? So he considered the perturbative problem of this. So now the topic of my talk will more or less be this. Talk will more or less be the same problem, but now we want to go from dimension six to dimension five. So, now the first question is: if we have such a complex three-fold with a torsion-free SL3C structure, and we have a five-dimensional hypersurface in it, or possibly that five-dimensional thing is the boundary of such a six-manifold, what's the induced geometric structure? Geometric structure where we can always take this closed freeform, restrict it to the five thing, and we get a closed freeform on the five manifold. So then more generally, we can ask what's the geometric structure and used by a closed freeform in dimensional five. Then we can ask similar problems like the we have a now you could ask this boundary value problem. So you have a six manifold with a five dimensional boundary, you have a Dimensional boundary, you have a riddled free form on the boundary. Can we fill it in by a torsion-free SL3C structure, which such that the real part of the pseudomorphic volume form will restrict to our free form on the boundary? And we can also ask an embedding problem. If you have a close free form on the five manifold, can we embed it inside the Calabi L3FOR such that the pull Threefold, such that the pullback, so the restriction of the real part of the holomorphic volume form, it gives our little psi. Can you say one of the combinations arbitrary close? Well, that's what I want to discuss now. So that's a question mark and that's what I want to address on the next few slides. But let me first tell you why this is a well-posed problem. Well, if we had a closed free form on a five-manifold, well, locally it's exact. Locally, it's exact. So we can write it as d of sigma. In some sense, they are parametrized by two forms. Two forms in R5 depend locally on ten functions. But of course, there's some ambiguity because if we take this two form instead, which by adding D over one form, we would get the same free form. So we need to subtract again this degree of freedom. This degree of freedom of pi. But if eta just differs by d of a function, then this year doesn't change, so we need to add one back in. So we see that a closed free form on a five manifold locally depends on six functions, at least by this nice count. And you also see that a map from a five manifold, you can think of two. You can think of two C3, which you can identify with R6. So this also corresponds to six component functions. So we see locally they kind of depend on the same number of functions. Kind of makes sense to ask maybe if they correspond to each other that we have for every such close free form we have embedding. It's not a kind of a reasonable question. And it's specific to dimension five. So if for higher dimension, So, if for a higher-dimensional manifold, the space of those three forms will suddenly depend on many, many more functions than maps to a 2n manifold. So, this question would be completely unreasonable. Okay, so in our sense, this makes sense, and that's kind of reminiscent of remaining metrics on two money. We manipulates on two manifolds. Because here, locally, there's a metric two by two matrix, so they depend on three functions, same as maps to R3. So then Weill was asking if we have the two-dimensional Riemannian manifold with positive Gauss curvature, can we embed it isometrically into R3? And the answer is yes. Yes, and so this condition here that the curvature is positive, that's sort of an intrinsic notion which we can check, which would already ensure that if such an embedding exists, then it has to bound the convex region. And again, this is similar. If we move on to higher dimensional manifolds, then the count is not the same anymore. So then we usually need to increase the dimension of the target. The dimension of the target space as a dimension embedding theorem. Okay, and in particular, there's this notion of convexity which is also needed. For example, if it's just flat, it wouldn't work. So the torus can only be embedded in a four-manifold. Okay, so let me revise this question. What's the geometric structure induced by close three form on a five manifold? Form on a five-manifold, and is there some intrinsic notion of convexity? Okay, well, let's just carry out the same discussion as I was earlier, like putting, earlier we were putting R6 inside R7. Let's now put R5 inside R6 by writing it like this. And this here is the real part of DZ1, which DZ2, which DZ3. And we can split it like this. So then let's just call this a little psi naught. A little psi naught, the restriction of the stable form. What are the algebraic properties of this? Well, this time it's not stable, there are not stable three forms in dimension five, but let's take a standard frame for R5, then you can compute that it has this form. So now you see that if you watch E5 to this, you clear the whole form. You kill the whole form. If, for example, you would just watch E1 to it, you would kill this part here, but this survives. So, if you consider this mapping here from one forms to four forms, just watching them with this free form, this has precisely a one-dimensional kernel, which is spanned by E5, which I will call theta naught. And another observation is now that Another observation is now that this two-form here, which I will call alpha naught, it's a non-degenerate form on the R4 because the square of it is the volume form. Okay, so let me sum up. So it has this algebraic properties, which allows us to split the psi into theta batch alpha. Theta batch alpha and I will call this this R4, sort of the kernel of theta, I will call this H. Okay, so let's note this down. If you have an embedding of a five manifold to a six manifold written as a 3C structure defined by capital psi, then the necessary partitions for a three-form on the five manifold A three form on the five manifold to be the restriction of capital psi are those two conditions. Because what we had on the previous slide, that's the point price necessary conditions. No, it's just on the money form. This map here has to have a one-dimensional kernel at every point. We can decompose the free form like this, and the alpha then is non-degenerate on this distribution defined by theta. Theta. Okay. What about the convexity part? Well, we at least want to have a convexity condition. So on C3, now it should be invariant under this bioholomorphisms which preserve our complex volume form. But bioholomorphisms don't preserve convexity in CN for hypersurfaces. For hypersurfaces. But if we have a real hypersurface inside the complex manifold, there's a different notion, so-called pseudoconvex. One of the fundamental invariant of such a real hypersurface is the so-called Levy form. I will not give the definition, but just what kind of object is it? Well, if the ambient space is complex dimension n and at every point the Levy form is a Hermitian form over a complex Hermitian form over a complex bundle which is rank n minus 1. So think of it at every point as n minus 1 times n minus 1 Hermitian matrices. And so then the hyper surface is called strongly pseudo-convex if the Navy form is definite everywhere. And that's a favorable notion for embedding surfaces, for embedding odd-dimensional manifolds is real hard. dimensional manifolds is real hypersurfaces inside complex manifolds. In particular, this can also be defined for an abstract four-dimensional manifold with the so-called CR structure. Well, now the next claim I want to make is that we have an intrinsic just as in the wild problem, the graph coverage. Problem: the browse cover gave us an intrinsic notion of what convexity of a potential embedding means. We have an intrinsic notion of giving us a condition for the strong pseudo-convexity of a potential embedding. Okay, say we have an embedding. We have inside the complex free manifold with torsion-free SL3C structure. Let's look at the pullback. Structure. Let's look at the pullback of the real part. We get the three-form on the 5-manifold decomposite as before. Now I claim that we can check strong, pseudo-convexity intrinsically by checking if this phi form here, theta vetch d theta square, is a positive multiple of theta vet alpha square. What's the reason for this? Well, we can precisely write it like this. Precisely write it like this: that this factor here modus is the determinant of the Levy form here. From the previous slide, we know that the Levy form at every point is a 2x2 emission matrix. Well, what's so special about 2x2 matrices, we can check by precisely checking that the determinant is positive. So that's a nice intrinsic notion. So this thing would basically say that theta has to be a contact for all. So let me note this down. So I will now call a free form on a five money forward strongly pseudo-convex, where first of all if it satisfies our two necessary algebraic conditions and if as before it's this phi form is a positive multiple of the theta batch alpha square which we already know is a volume form. It's a volume form. And as Spiral was saying, this in particular means now that the theta is a non-degenerate two form on this rank four distribution, which then means that H has to be a context structure. Is there any zero structure here? Um not yet. So oh yes. So if we have an embedding then If you have an embedding, then the target will inherit a CR structure. If on the abstract5 manifold we have such a thing, you will see on the next slide. Actually, in three slides or so. So we have the splitting, but sort of the splitting is not unique. So let's find the preferred splitting. Well, what's the choice we have? We can always. Well, what's the choice we have? We can always rescale theta by some function f and then divide alpha by f. So this doesn't change psi. And we can add to alpha theta which one form also doesn't change psi. Let's fix the first choice. We already know they are positive multiple of each other and then we can show that you can choose f in such a way that they're actually equal to each other. They're actually equal to each other. This, in particular, allows once and for all fixes a preferred contact one form, and then you know from contact geometry, this gives us a beta vector field, which is characterized that if we put it into the two-form d theta, we get zero, and if we put it into theta, we get one. So now that this contact one form is fixed, let's just call d theta omega. Just called the theta omega, and now we get nice splittings of the attention bundle, differential forms, and so on. The attention bundle, we have this contact distribution h at the transversal direction is still like the field. And then the differential forms this bit similarly. So more or less, I will say that the form here, that the p form is in here. Well, if you put the red vector field in it, we get zero. In it, we get zero. This only sees the contact directions. And then the other part of the p forms is theta, which the p minus one forms, which only see the contact directions. Okay, and just a note that by the normalization, by this one here, we now have the square of omega. Well, okay, so omega by definition is a two. So omega by definition is a two-form in H. Now we can normalize alpha here so that it doesn't have a component in here. So alpha by normalizing is also a two-form on h. By this normalization here, the square is the same. Okay, so now we have this rank four distribution, so now there will be a lot of analogies with four-dimensional. Analogies with four-dimensional geometry, which I briefly want to recall. Four-dimensional geometry is driven by sort of this on two forms. We can take two, two forms, and after watch them, we get a multiple of the volume form. So we have this symmetric bilinear form on number two of R4. And so as we know, it has signature 3,3. Signature 3, 3, and now the various conditions define certain geometric structures. So if we have an orthonormal pair, this means that the square is the same. And that if we take omega 1, which is omega 2, we get 0. So that more or less defines an SL2C structure on this manifold. Because more or less, this omega 1. This omega 1 plus i omega 2 pointless looks like dz1 matched dz2. It's precisely this condition here. And now globally on a manifold, requiring that those two are closed tells us that again we have a total-free SL2CE structure. So a technical complex structure, trivial canonical bundle, trivializing holomorphic wording form. If we have If we have three two forms which form in so-called orthogonal triple, so again the squares of all of them are the same. If we take two different ones, we get zero. Well, this defines an SU2 structure. So in particular, a metric. And globally on the manifold, if they're all closed, it says that it's a torsion-free SU structure, so a hypercla form. A hypercaler for manifold. And note in particular that in this setting here, this again, this SL2C structure determines almost complex structure. So I haven't yet used that our three form on the five manifold is closed. So let's start using that. But I first have to, we have this nice. But I first have to we have this nice uh splitting of the tangent bundle, so this now also means that the exterior derivative splits, right? If we just restrict the exterior derivative to p forms on h, it will have two components. So the first one that's more or less just the d derivative along the rib direction, and the projection to the second one, I will call this d subscript h. You can think of the constant. You can think of the contact analog of the exterior derivative. However, sort of as a word of caution, that doesn't form a complex, sort of d square being zero now means that there are some mutations, as you can see here. Okay, well, so as I was saying earlier, we now have this preferred decomposition into theta batch alpha, by which we already know that omega. Actually, already know that omega square is alpha square. Now, that d that the three form is closed gives us omega is exact, so this is closed. The three form being closed gives us two more conditions. And in particular, the first two now tell us that we have an SL2C structure on the contact distribution. So, as Julia was asking, in particular, we get a C. asking in particular we get a CR structure on the five manifold, which is given by this two zero form omega plus alpha. And now we also have those two forms. They're not precisely closed, but they're close in the contact sense. So you can think of this as a contact version of a Calabia twofold. So complex two manifold with trivial canonical. Two manifold with trivial canonical buggers. Now, if this three form actually comes from an embedding, then we can also pull back the imaginary part of the odomorphic right form. And then a pointwise calculation again on C3 tells us that this again is a pseudo-convex three form, also closed, and it actually splits with the same contact one form. With the same contract one form, and the beta now will form an orthonormal triple with alpha and omega on H. So we get more, we get a SU2 structure on the contact distribution. So omega is in d of theta. Oh, it's d theta, that's right. Oh, Zero, that's right. Okay. So and they are outlaws in the contact sense. So that's why we call this type of SE2 structure contact hyperkela SO2 structure. And now actually, just as a hyperkela manifold has three complex structures which satisfy the quaternionic relations, we now have three CR structures. Three CR structures on H which satisfy the quaternionic relations. Actually, the one which comes from the embedding is alpha plus I beta. So on the abstract five manifold, we get a CR structure, but it's not actually the one we are trying to embed. Which brings me to the next point. Now we can think of the embedding problem as consisting in two parts. Well, we start out with Well, we start out with this strongly epsilon closed, strong epsilon convex freeform, which gives us this theta, omega, and alpha. Well, now the first task would be to actually find the missing beta, which we would have if it comes from embedding. And as you know, going from a dimension 4, going from a SL2C structure, torsion 3 to a torsion 3 SU2 structure. To a torture-free acyl structure. It's the Calabi problem in dimension four. So you can think of this as a contact version of the Calabi problem. Now that we have the beta, we actually know which CR structure we want to embed, then you could think of the second part as the classical embedding problem for strongly pseudo-convex CR structures. Okay. So there is a different notion of so-called nearly hypo. Notion of so-called nearly hypo SU2 structures. Giovanni Conti and Simon Salomon considered a slightly different problem where now the ambient six manifold instead of having a total free SL3C structure has a torture free SU3 structure. So now there is a metric. So there's more structure on the ambient space, but they don't assume any condition on the map, so no convexity condition. So, no convexity condition. And just because the embed space has an SU3 structure, we now always get an SU2 structure on any real hypersurface. And the torsion type, it's what they call nearly hypo. So now we see that actually contact hyperkela SC2 structures are a subclass of nearly hypo structures. So even though our ambient space has less structure, the convexity. Less structured, the convexity pseudo-convexity condition is so strong that we end up with more structure on the five manifold. And so, in particular, a crucial difference is that in the near-hyper setting, the age is not necessarily contact. So, you could just take as the ambient money for C3, it's the real hyper surface R5, and then the H would even be integrable. And the sort of the contact property will be crucial for the analysis. Okay. Doesn't hypo also mean like not quite not quite almost there. So it's sort of a nearly, nearly. Yes. Sort of also related to this half that. Um yeah. All right, so let me introduce some uh differential operators. Um well we have now this triple here, so this SO2 structure determines a Riemannian metric on the contact distribution. Now we can just get a Riemannian metric on the whole Riemannian for it by saying that the red vector field is left one and is orthogonal to the contact distribution. Now we also, this then gives us This then gives us adjoints. So, our dh gets an adjoint dh, which comes from the analogous formula as we mind in geometry. You can define a Laplace, so it's an analog of the Laplace, Hoch-Laplace operator, or p-forms on H. And as in four-dimensional Riemannian geometry, there's this important splitting of two forms into self-dual and anti-self-dual two-forms. Dual two forms and then it can now take P over one form and then project it to the anti-self dual two forms. What I will call dh minus and then projection to the self-dual two forms dh plus. All right, so now if you think about the linearization of the this embedding problem, the main operator more or less is the Laplacian restricted to anti-self. Restricted to anti-self-dual two forms. And it will turn out that the obstruction space to solving this perturbative embedding problem will be the contact analog of the harmonic anti-self-dual two forms. So this phase, which I will call H, and it's the kernel of the Laplacian here. And just in four-dimensional Riemannian geometry, Dimensional Riemannian geometry, if you know that the anti-selfQuil two form is closed and it's also co-closed. So to check harmonicity, it's also just enough to check that it's closed. Okay. So then the perturbative embedding problem is, say we have a reference embedding, a strongly pseudo-convex embedding of M into a complex pre-fault with a torsion free SA3C structure. As a 3C structure, suppose that the space which I was just explaining, so the contact version of harmonic antiserved two forms is zero, sort of determined by this contact metric structure, determined by this embedding. Then for every closed freeform which is closed through a little psi in the sense Little psi in the same hormology class, we can slightly wiggle the embedding such that this deformed free form becomes the restriction of the real part of the odomorphic varying form. And the proof is an application of the inash-Moiser inverse function theorem. So, what happens if it's the boundary? The boundary value problem? Yeah, so if you can't do it, now you can't do all the value. So now you can't do all of the things if you sort of assume that optical outside yes, so the boundary there will also be a sort of a finite dimensional vector space which will be obstructions and it's related in some sense to the age, but still have to work out the details. Okay, well in any case this abstraction space here is finite dimensional. Is finite dimensional. And that's not trivial. Well, on the fourth manifold, of course, it's finite dimensional because Gierde Laplacian is an elliptic operator. We know and love them, but this is not true in our setting. Just to illustrate you how this Laplacian looks like, this H Laplacian. So the Levy-Gibba connection of this metric actually doesn't present. Of this metric actually doesn't preserve the contact distribution, but we can adapt, we can introduce a connection with torsion, which does. Then, if we would choose a local orthonormal frame, the Laplacian looks like this. So there is the sum of the second derivatives, but the second derivative in the real director is missing, but it shows up as a first-order derivative. It looks a bit different than the absolute water looking? Oh, yeah, this is the batch product with Ek and this decontraction. So this is just the action of the curvature of operator given by this connection on the boundary. It's called hyperlability? Well, so if this operator is the trace, so hyper there's this notion. So, hyper, there's this notion of hypoanalytic operator, which gives you the same functional analytic properties, but it's better and so on. So, whether it's hyper elliptic depends on the eigenvalues of the action of i on your bundle. So, this here is a hypoelliptic operator because we have a contact distribution, those vector fields. Distribution, those vector fields satisfy the so-called Hermann definition. That is Laplace and this hyperhyptic. But if this is too big, it could kind of mess with that. But in our case, on the anti-self-dual bundle, it's zero, so we are lucky. Okay. To give you another sort of more intuitive way what could go wrong with the finite dimensionality, well if the five manifold is a surple bundle over a four manifold, Bundle over a four manifold, just and everything is circle invariant, the SU2 structure. Think of the standard embedding of S5 and C3. It is a circle bundle over C V 2. And so with the circle bundle, we have an associated complex line bundle. And now, as we know it, for functions on a circle, there's an associated Fourier decomposition. So we can think of a p formos H as splitting into infinitely many Fourier modes. Infinitely many Fourier modes, where for each we can interpret as a p-form on the base with values in the kth power of this line value. Now you see that the kernel is more as this infinite sum of the kernel. So if it's non-zero for infinitely many Fourier modes, then the kernel would be infinite dimensional. So here a quick proof that for the standard embedding the obstruction space vanishes well in use the Space vanishes well and use the Weizenberg formula for this operator. And so we get the action of the anti-self-dual part of the Y curvature and the scalar curvature. But the Fubini-Sludimetric on Cp2 is self-dual, so this W0 is zero and it has positive scalar curvature. So here the curvature term is positive. So there is no kernel in any um for any k. For any k but to give you a different um to just show you that this doesn't always happen um particular age vanishes when it's landed embedding but on the other hand sort of this opera this Dirac operator here going from one forms to zero plus RDself to three two forms by the index theorem that has a positive dimension equality for every k so then this contact delug operator actually has an infinite Debug operator actually has an infinite-dimensional kernel. So, this would not be nearly helpful, even though it kind of looks like a contact analog of an elliptic operator. Okay, so this embedding, if we get it, it's never unique because, for example, if the ambient space is C3, we can take an element SL3C and compose it with the embedding. We get a new embedding, and it's still because SL3C. Because SS3C preserves a capital psi, we will get the same free form on the five manifold. But we can prove that up to such movements by volume preserving by holomorphisms on the ambient space, it's unique if the ambient space is C3 and our obstruction space vanishes. Okay, so there's a special type of contact type or TLA ICT structures. Contact hypertailer ICT structures, so-called Sasaki-Einstein. I mean, we've heard a lot about them this week. And in this setting, it means that the derivative in the rib direction of alpha is beta, and if the derivative of beta is minus alpha. As we know, it implies that the metric is Einstein and the coronavirus is retroflat, but we're going to meet SU3. So if the induced SU2 structure is Saki Einstein, structure is Saki Einstein and the ambient space is a so-called Steinmanifold, then we get a nice vanishing theorem for the obstruction space. So that's in particular the case for the standard embedding of S5 inside C3. Let me briefly describe the idea behind it. So on CR manifolds or dimension, there is an analog of the del bar operator, which is called the del bar B. Operator, which is called the delta B operator. Think of it as the restriction of the delta B operator of the ambient space. And so we're interested in anti-self dual two forms with respect to this almost complex structure there of type 1, 1. And so the nice thing about Stein manifolds, about strongly pseudo-convex domains in Stein manifolds, is that on the boundary rule, there are more or less no. There are more or less no del V harmonic forms. They all vanish. So now if we take harmonic artisel dual two forms in the contact sense, so an element from our obstruction space, it automatically satisfies this equation here that it's cool close in the del Bar B sense. So now we know the space is zero, so one idea to prove One idea to prove that sigma has to be zero is to try to prove that this equation is true. You can compute that the norm of this point rise is given by this. And as I said, sigma is anti-self dual. So if we have a, in the Sasaki-Einstein case, the lead derivatives, they're self-dual. So those forms are orthogonal to each other. It has to be zero. This would give us the vanishing theorem here. Theorem, yeah. A bit more time. Okay, so notice that if you have such a strongly epsilon convex 3 form, as I was saying earlier, this theta vet alpha square is a volume form. So with every such form becomes a preferred volume form. So now if we have a for strongly pseudo-convex embeddings of M into Z, we get two volume forms. We get two volume functionals. The one we can integrate this phi form on the boundary, but we could also integrate the volume form of the ambient space over the domain which sits in the interior, which is enclosed by this Farschmanif. So now this part actually also makes sense in higher dimensions. One difference is that in higher dimensions the A is not intrinsic anymore. So here you can write the A So here you can write the A as a function of the three form, but in higher dimensions you actually need to know how the manifold sits inside Cn. And so the A, if we would just look at certain maps from sort of a real hypersurface inside Rn, cross it with ITN and look at maps into Cn. This is generalizing So-called classical affine volume of convex hypersurfaces. Okay. Well, now we have these two functionals, volume functionals. So now we could think of extremizing one and keeping the other fixed, sort of extrema with constraint conditions. So let's look at the first variable. So let's look at the first variations. So if you have an embedding, we only need to consider deforming this embedding in the normal directions. On the manifold, pulling back by the diffeomorphism just induces the pullback of the volume form, so the integral will be the same. Well, the variations in these normal directions, so let's say the normal direction is F times this unit. is F times this unit normal. And the variation of this is this F with bold H. And the bold H is defined by this equation here. Why a bold H? Because it's the generalization of the affine mean curvature by the letter H and here. H and here the variation is just the integral by F. So now we see that the characterizing extrema of A with keeping the other one fixed, it's precisely that the H is constant. So a quarter multiplier. So just for your convenience, I put in again what H means. Now in particular, if we have a Sasaki-Einstein structure. We have a Sasaki-Einstein structure, so then the lead derivative of alpha is just beta. So you see that in this case it's constant. Every time it induces a Sasaki Einstein structure, we get a critical point. Well, if the again, if the obstruction space vanishes, then we can prove the converse. Then we can more or less characterize. Then we can more or less characterize Sasaki-Einstein as the critical point of A with this constraint that B is fixed. All right. Just to preempt any questions by Marcus, I was explaining one way to rule out the obstructions for the standard embedding of S5 inside. Embedding of S5 inside C3. So there we had the circle invariant case. We could use the Weizenberg formula on the Bayes manipulate. Now is there sort of something more general? Well, as I said, the Liv Tivita connection doesn't preserve this plating here, but we can choose a connection, the ONTN, which does preserve this plating, and also the SU2 structure. The SU2 structure. So that connection is not unique, but it's unique up to a section of school symmetric endomorphisms of age. Maybe slightly more classical, if you would just look at connections which preserve the splitting in only the U2 structure. There's more classical work by Webster and Tonna. Okay, and then now we can prove kind of a contact. Now we can prove kind of a contact analog of this Weisenberg formula. We have here kind of the contact rough Laplacian, just as in the four-dimensional case, something like an analog of the anti-self-dual Y curvature, scalar curvature, and this is this function f. So f is defined by this equation here. So the lead derivative of alpha and the self-dual component can only be a multiple of beta and then possibly Uh uh ASDF two form. Um, so this is nice. If it's a circle button, this will just be the pullback of what we have on the base. Um, in the abstract case, I have no idea sort of what this geometrically is. So I haven't found any applications of this form here. And thank you for listening.
