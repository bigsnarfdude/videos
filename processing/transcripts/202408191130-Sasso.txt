We will work on always when Z is stable. I think that Federico in his talk treats also the case in which he removes the hypothesis that that is stable. But we work in this context, and I will try to explain the reason at the end of my talk. Here, I introduce also the same condition. Introduce also the same condition that Franco presented in his talk, because if we apply the Bochner theorem to the Ah, okay, yes, it's the same. It's the same. But your your case was plus, yes. Your case was plus, yes. Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes. Both are equivalent infinitely. Infinite mode, all are equivalent, right? Yes, yes, but also here. Yes, yes. And if we apply the Bochner theorem to our quantum characteristic function, we obtain that S is the covariance operator associated with a Gaussian state. Associated to a Gaussian state if and only if this condition is satisfied. But for these results, there will be the talk of Damianov this afternoon. So I don't spoil anything more. Okay. But this is for me important because we can work with Gaussian states also to define the spectral gap. In these slides, I report some I report some examples. For example, if here we have an example in which the Z is not stable, and in this case we have a lot of invariant states that is not Gaussian. And in the second one, we have that in this case that is good, but we have noted that CZ is 30 positive. Strictly positive, and in this case, we have in various data that it's Gaussian, but it is not payful, obviously. So, yeah, these are two examples that maybe answer to the previous question. Now, since we have an explicit way to write the action of the semigroup on the vial operator, we can describe the action of the predual of the semigroup, so working in Group, so working in Schrodinger feature of the semi-group, of the predual of the semi-group on a Gaussian state. And we obtain that the Gaussian state is mapped in another Gaussian state in which the mean vector is transformed by this formula and the covariance matrix by this formula, which appears always the same matrix Z and C. And C. What we have that these three definitions are equivalent. So we have that we can introduce a Gaussian quantum Markov semigroup in terms of the parameter of the generator or in terms of the action on the vial operator or by observing that the its pre-dual preserve the set of Gaussian states. With a set of Gaussian states, and this is what Franco explained in his talk. Now, I want to underline something about the relationship with the Earth and Nullenbeck setting. Now, what I mean for Nullenbeck generator? I mean a second-order disruption operator in which it appears a matrix A that represents the drift. That represents the drift and the matrix Q that represents the dissipated part of the diffusion. And I would like that there exists abelian volume sub-algebra such that the restriction of the generator to this sub-algebra is invariant. And in particular, we have that the generator maps a multiplication function into another multiplication function such that the new function such that the new function is the first one transformed by a Orstenullenbeck or generalized Orstenullenbeck operator. Roughly speaking, we wanted that f is a function of some quadratures that are commutative. Now we wanted to give a sense of this slide. We started from an easy case in which the expression In which the expression became easier to write. And if we start with the Hamiltonian is equal to zero, and the matrix U and V that are the parameters that appear in the Krauss operator, that are real. And if we think by Schrodinger representation to the position as the coordinates and the momentum as the Coordinates and the momentum as the derivative, the constant, then we have that the algebra generated by the 1 Qd, that are X1, XD, is invariant. So we can write this result. We have that if we restrict the generator to a function of x1, xd, so a classical function, we obtain a Ursa-Nullenbeck generator in which the Generator, in which the matrix, the drift and diffusion matrix, are a part of some matrix that appears in the quantum context. In particular, L star X, the drift matrix, is the bottom-right D times C D blocks of the matrix Z and the other matrix, star X, correspond to the same bottom-right D times C D blocks of the matrix CZ. The blocks of the matrix CZ. So we have that, as Luigi says, that the quantum setting contains the classical setting, because we have that in this case, if we start from a Gaussian, quantum, Markov semi-group, we can build a Ursenu. Can build a Ursen-Nullenberg semi-group and they are generated. The assumption that H is equal to zero and the U and V must be real can be removed by the destruction becomes more complicated because the algebra that is invariant is a mixture of P1, P2. Okay. And we can also obtain a vital diaspora. Can also obtain a V chevales. We can start from a Ursa-Nullenbeck generator with this diffusion matrix non-degenerative, and we obtain a quantum Markov semigroup that is its extension. Now, we can speak about spectral gap. As I said at the beginning, we have a different definition of a spectral gap if we consider different embeddings. We start from a faithful We want we start from a faithful invariant Gaussian state rho, and we can obtain different embedding by write rho on the left, on the right, on the X in its embedding. If we have rho only on the right part, we have the GNS embedding, and we obtain, we can define from this embedding a strongly continuous contraction semigroup, capital T, and we say that T a positive. And we say that T a positive spectral gap if there exists a constant 50 positive G, such that this inequality is satisfied. We can obtain another embedding if we split the row on the left, on the right. And in this case, we obtain, when we consider this asymmetric splitting, we obtain the KMMF embedding. We attain a new strongly continuous. Strongly continuous contraction semi-group, and the definition then the spectral gap is the same. We obtained in the last minute, the main minutes, that in both cases, the spectral gap are related to the eigenvalues of some matrices, but we can obtain also different results for GNS and KMMS. I recall briefly that in general we know that the matrix CZ is greater than zero and if that is stable and CZ is 50 positive then we can work with invariant state that is Faithful and Gaussian and in the following we remove the mean vector z to make the form To make the formula easier. The first result. If Z is stable and the matrix CZ is strictly positive, then T has a positive spectral gap for the GNS embedding. And in this case, G tilde is up to this constant the minimal eigenvalues of these matrices, of this matrix. I wanted to say something about the hypothesis in particular. If we assume that the CZ is the slightly positive, then it is equivalent to say that we have 2D Krauss operator, and so we have noise in every coordinate. And these two assumptions are not so restrictive because we have that if T is the Gaussian quantum Markov senior. Gaussian quantum Markov Senate with an invariant state rho and a positive spectral gap, and we are interested to have a positive spectral gap, no spectral gap equal to zero, for example, then that must be stable. So it is not restrictive to require that Z is stable for this problem. And the second one is that if T is a Gaussian-Quantum Markov semigroup with a faithful invariant states, if States, if the kernel of Cz is different from zero, then the semigroup has no spectral gap. The proof of this result is a classical situation in which we work when we wanted to prove something in this context. Because the idea of the proof is to calculate directly the action of the semi-group on some quadrature, but the quadrature are not bounded. Product were not bounded. So, the idea is the technique is always to write on a linear combination of the bile operator and then to obtain the result by a sort of limit. And this is a classical sketch of the. I give a sketch of the proof of the spectral gap. We compute directly the action of the semi-group on a linear combination of the value operator on L2, so when after the embed. After the embedding, we proved that there exists a strong relationship between the spectral gap and a positive kernel related to this matrix. We prove that if we choose G tilde as minus omega zero over two, where omega zero is the minus omega zero is the smaller values of this matrix, then the spectral gap inequality holds and this is optimal. And this is optimal because if we choose omega smaller than omega 0, then the spectral gap inequality doesn't hold for every T. The same proof is the idea of the proof is equal also for KMMS embedding, in which change the matrix associated to the positive defeating kernel. And we obtain this result. And we obtained this result. In this case, we don't need an additional condition, but the expression of the matrix became more complicated. Here we have that FTA Gaussian quantum Markov semigroup with a unique invariant phase of Gaussian states. If the kernel of this matrix is different from zero, then there exists a positive spectral gap that it is equal to the minus the maximal of the Minus the maximum of the gain values of this matrix. Well, this matrix, as a breve, is a transformation of a diagonal matrix that is a transformation. This diagonal matrix is related to the diagonal representation of the covariance matrix S. Now, I finish with an example in which we have that. In which we have that for this Gaussian-Quantum Markov semi-group, we calculated directly the two spectral gaps for the GNS embedding and KMS embedding. And here we obtain that the spectral gap for the KMS embedding is bigger than the spectral gap for GNS embedding, but we are not sure that it is true always. Always. And in the case in which, for example, lambda is equal to zero, rho is a faithful is always a faithful Gaussian state, but the kernel is different from zero. And we have this condition that the spectral for KMS embedding is greater than zero, while the spectral gap for GNS embedding is equal to zero. Is equal to zero. Are there any questions? Yes, please. You say that Z star is a real linear operator. And speak of Z Z is a real linear. And speak of Z star. How do you define the adjoin of a real linear operator in a complex linear space? In a complex linear space, this has to do with the doubling you mentioned, but how precise? Yes, because we, as I try to hide, we have to understand what is the scalar product and the duality that we consider when we pass to work in the complexification of the operator. I don't want to stress about both. Stress about bold Z, C, Z, bold C that are the same metrics seen in a complex space and in radial space. But we have to consider this difference when we write the proof. There is a technique to define the adjoint of the real linear operator in a complex. Yes, yes, because we complify the operator. because we complify the operator. Not trivial. Trivial, but sorry? Isn't it the same as the transpose of the operator? Transpose. Yes. But for example, take the simplest case. The linear operator is F goes to real part of F. What is the age of computer? This is an example. An exercise for the afternoon when there is a day. I think to answer your question, the scalar product is the real part of the complex scalar product. When you consider the C D as a real film space, the scalar product is the real part of the complex product. That scalar product is a real linear vector space and you have transfer. Scalar product, the real part of the complex scalar product. Yes. The scalar product. But this is a difference. But my question was, how you define the adjoint of a real operator in a complex inference? And you are reducing the complex input space to the real input space. That is, of course, I think that's what they are doing. But then in In we met a similar problem. In the complex interspace, not always you have a scalar product between a real vector, a vector of the real subface with the real. You can have a scalar product, real with complex. So you need the complexity. And then I wanted to know how you define. Their case is. Right. Their case is they consider the real part of the scalar product and do the data tag. If I added the reason to the scalar product, maybe you're right that this should be, I mean, you have a real a real uh scalar vector space in basically complexity. That's quite a inner problem. There you are. The process is you start with a real vector state, basically, and there you specify it. And the the expression of this new joint operator depends on Depends on how you write which basis you are saying that in this way you can do but not in a unique way. Well, the complexification is unique, the joint is unique. The way when you write, I mean, every element of the complexified state can be thought of in different. All in different isomorphic way and the joint is unique, but the way you express it is and you make computationally dependent on the basic okay, thank you. Uh Emmanuela, I have a small question. The when you talk about the S with a little U on top. Little U on the top you said something about it was related to a kind of diagonalization. Okay, yes, yeah. Is that a Williamson form, Williamson theorem, or syntactic diagonalization? No, no, we know that S is diagonalized by some matrix M on the star. So the first step is that we diagonalize S by this matrix in a new diagonal matrix, and then we change. And then we change the eigenvalues of S by some formulas that are related to our problem. Okay, okay, thank you. Well, let's think. We have another question. Yes, please. How do you define the spectral gap? It's some exponential decay estimated at an L W but how does it relate to the actual spectrum of the spectral rate or on the L A. I'm not sure. Maybe yes. Say the spectrum of L plus the head point, you say you first transform L to an operator on L2, then you take the head points in L2 and look at this L2 operator, right? Yes, yes. But this is done by direct computer on Loh. So unless if we look without see that we got drawing within so okay, but like at least to me it's not clear how that relates to the spectrum of the operator on C or K. Yes. Depends on the operator is more the gap of n plus a joint.
