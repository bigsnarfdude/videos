So our second talk of the day is Claudio Norati, who will talk about monodromy of singular body lie of sheaves on K tubes. Thank you very much for the invitation. And I mean this last change, last minutes changes because we realized last week with Ari that we are going to speak on the same thing. So some of them should have a change in it. Okay, so this is Okay, so this is a joint work, latch a joint work in progress with Arvid Ferrigo and Antoine Orapanieta. And I mean, tell me if I'm writing too small, too big, or if I'm speaking too long. Sometimes I tend to speak a bit low. And so I want to start by telling you what's the main result and then maybe some of the fun. So when I talk about modular spaces or shapes on K3 surfaces, so for me S is always going to be like a projected key tree. And I'm always gonna use fix an ample bundle that is gonna be my stability condition and a vector in the chi lattice for which the moduli space is non-empty. I'm going a bit quick on this part that I A bit quick on this part, but I will recall also something a bit later. And so I'm gonna write this V as M times W, where W is primitive and M is just an integer, greater equal to zero. And then our result, which I can state here. So, our result is that if L is bigger than 1, then we can compare the monogramy group of this modular space with the monotony group of DA. Does that separate power? Oh, sorry? So you write like bond with the superscript? Or does that write? One, two. I mean, now I'm gonna explain everything. I just want to state the main result. So for people who know what I'm talking about, they know where I'm going. For people who know I will introduce African K in the next section. In the next section. So, the idea is that these modular spaces become very similar when M is greater to one, but they are still simple thing in some senses that I will recover, recall. And the monotony group still makes sense, this setting. So, we have actually TRMs, modular spaces. And so, it's natural to ask what is this modular, what is this monotonic group. And then, why? And then why is it interesting? Because there is by a result of Markmann, you know, what is this guy? So those are just orientation presently isometries, just say isometries. No, dude, you really mean V. It's a W here, sorry. So this is a W and So this is a this is w and this is a small one. This is a m times w so it's w okay. So yeah, it's easy. Yes. It's just I want to specify that this is the one you can have. And I mean this is the smooth modular space and by a result of Markman this group here is just isometries that acts that acts as plus minus the density on the discriminant group. On the discriminant group. But I mean, just to give corollary an example, if we choose that W square is equal to 2, then this is just going to be it's just going to be the group of integers. The group of integers serving asometries. So it's the biggest possible. So from the point of view of this conference, why do we care? Well, for example, because here we have X this attribute for homomorphism. That is reproducible on Morphy Sympletic. We know that there is a representation map on Integral Topology. And the image of this map is always contained inside the monotony group, which is a subgroup of it. So, from the points of view of starting out. So, from the points of view of studying automorphism, it is important to know which are the monodromy isometries and say that having a maximal monodromy is really like very good news because it means that we don't have many restrictions. And let's say that in general, so this is a history so okay for kid resurfaces in fact in front of me. In fact, the quantum group is plus of the H2. This is like a classical result for manifolds of K2N. Okay, it's basically what I wrote here. So once you it's also known and often it is oblast like for example in this case or every time Or every time that n minus 1 is just the power of a prime. Then for the generalized commerce we have again this is never a plus but in the best case it's always contained with index 2. It's probably also one of the reasons why there are not many Of the reasons why there are not many results on out of this of the generous pumpers. Then, I mean, what results? I mean, this is due to Markmann, this is with Markman and Mongarhi. Then there was the 36, in which again Montu is actually equal to a plus. And this was computed by Mugari Rabanienta. Then we have the audio 3D10, where again onto this oblast, and this is. Is oblus, and this was the result of myself. And then, okay, this is about the smooth cases. So we run out with examples, and that's why we go to the singular ones. So we get something interesting. The best of my knowledge, I don't think that there exists any results on singular symplectic varieties where we actually know explicitly what is the monotonic. Maybe some portion. Maybe some portions by groups. Maybe many as a result in that direction, but I'm not sure it is published yet. Okay, so now I want to make a little introduction about some verse in particular. Just to understand also the definitions and the properties. And the properties, and then I want to convince you that this singular theory is basically as good as the smooth one. So, everything goes along normally. So, I mean, I need to make a little displayer first. So, when I'm working with uh So when I'm working with this in this singular setting, it's always a bit tricky to tell you where I'm actually working because everything I'm going to say should hold in a sense of a Keller, I mean singular Keller varieties. I don't really want to give you the definition, but I really need it because I'm not making the formations that are not projected. So everything I think. Projective. So everything I say is projective for laziness, but in fact, I should talk about something that is called color spaces. So essentially, your tools are like. Essentially, those are like singular analytic varieties that admit a resolution that is scalar. So you can think like this, but the definition is a bit more involved. Anyway, so all our varieties are going to be normal and yes, I said we say projective. And every time we have a normal variety, we know that the regular locus is inquiring 2. Let me write simple locus is in co-dimension 2 and I'm going to use this notation. So I don't know. I don't know which idea the inclusion, the opening version of the regular logo inside X, and I'm gonna use this notation to mean the shift. So now it's great. So those are T forms on the smooth logos. I take the push forward and I take the left. And this is for. This is uh this is called the the sheaf of reflexive p forms, the p forms on the regular blocks. Um I'm gonna give many definitions. One so what is a symphony a sympletic form sympletic form on X for me is just gonna be an element in a reflexive form that is non-degenerate. At any point of the regular round. Okay, so just like extending the normal definition. Then we say that X is a symplectic variety if there exists a symplectic form. Let's extend quantity similarization. Okay, so I'm not saying that extract to a symplatic form on the disparization. That is gonna be like a gravant resolution. I'm just saying that I'm just saying that it extends as an holomorphic form on the desingularization. And just let me make two remarks. So the first remark was too slender, much more general, that if we assume that the dimension of the co-dimension of the single Codimension of the similar locus is at least four, then in fact admitting a symplectic form is the same as being a symplectic form so this is just to tell you that if you're if you don't like this uh this Don't like this condition that for any to extend to yeah, you need to consider all the desingularization and see if it extends. If the singularities are simpler logos is small enough, then having a synthetic form is just but this is uh this is the needed in general in this definition. Then another remark coming from Remark, I mean, if you are interested, which kind of singularities we are here, so the extension. I mean, you are asking for the extension, but you are allowing sort of zeros for the extension. Yes, also some both. And does it matter if you take if it extends to one desynchronization? Does it not extend to all this? I think if it extends to one, it extends to all of them. Because you just take like a disinclaimation, I mean it's Smooth variety dominates both of them, then you can do the same metric, right? And I mean, essentially, if you want, this is the same as rational and Gorestain. I mean, Gorestain means that the canonical bundle is essentially Cartier. And if I rationalize it, it is just that the higher push forward of the structure shift vanishes apart from the zero. And I mean, the irrational is exactly a property that doesn't depend on the desingularization of any dissingularization. And essentially, rational plus Gaussian is the kind of singularities that appear when we... Appear when we consider single accalabiao many bottles. So essentially, single accalabiao varieties. So essentially, here we are requiring that there exists a non-degenerate form on the C on the smooth logos. Here we are requiring that there exists non-degenerate top form, so volume form on the singular logos. So this inclusion, I mean, this implication is really. Inclusion, I mean, this implication is really like symplectic, it's kind of yeah, and then you don't want to say anything more about this. Probably not. Okay, I mean, practice singularities are also canonical. Try to extend that you can get on this on the exceptional device, or you can have Or you can add those. And then this is a very general definition. I mean, we don't have like when we give the definition of irreducible mafia symplatic, we require that we ask that the symplectic form is unique, for example, and that the variety is simply connected. So let's see what we have here. So definition again. So X is going to be a symplectic variety and this is called primitive if If H1 of the ox is zero and H0 of is generated by the symptomatic form, but variety for sigma. So this is exactly Exactly the definition that we have in this multi-log of in this motion, right? So we are just like that. Then the second one is that this variety is called irreducible. This is gonna be a bit more complicated for any fancy outcome. But see it's out of cover, so I mean then we want it to be a one-stop page. So, I'll say that for any positive means that it's etalic co-dimensional one, and for any positive cover, then the algebra of holomorphic k-forms is just generated basically. It's just generated basic data that is generated by the pullback of the symptomic form on our symbol variety. So this is quasi-ethy? Is it just entire at qualified? Quasi-Tar means italian co-dimension one. So the idea is that we always have an inclusion like this direction because we don't change the identity. So it's a actually stronger, so say remarkable irreducible is primitive, but the other way around is not true in general. You can think, if you take a Ketri surface, you can consider the symmetric product of a Ketri surface. So this is it meets an adaptive cover just by it. In a cover, just by the Cartesian product. But on the Cartesian product, we have a lot of simpler forms, for example. Right? So, these are two definitions. And I mean, this is the good setting for TRM and To run the DRM and to have basically all the moduli theory that we also have in the small case. But this is the good setting to have I mean let me just say the model of decomposition theory in this singular case. So, in the singular case, we have all the good hypotheses, there exists a similar version of the Wilboromalov decomposition theorem, and the varieties that appear are this irreducible, but not this primitive one. But on the other hand, if we are just interested in having DRM and pyramid, Period mapping, then we can very safely restrict the primitive varieties. So the varieties we are interested are, in fact, irreducible. That was a nice result. But since we are only computing the monotony group, everything, the only properties that I'm going to use is that they are primitive varieties. So I'm going to essentially work with the setting of primitive varieties, even though our varieties are irreducible. Right as I principle. And then let me just make a mark. So in general, one can one can do, can ask. I mean, the smooth case we don't really ask this weird question. We ask just that the fundamental group is the The fundamental group is trivial. You only ask the fundamental group. I mean, the variety is simply connected. So if the variety, this is singular logos, the varieties, is simply connected, then the variety is irrecognisible, essentially, because there are no positive others. But the other way around is not. There are counter-examples, so it's not sure. And I think there are counter-examples already in the old before. But in fact, the varieties we are needing. But the varieties we are interested in will have this property. So I really like the best varieties you can you can hope for. So trendy and not remaining. So notice action x is going to be a primitive syntactic variety. And so we consider the second integral homologic role, as always. Under this hypothesis, this is going to have a pure hot structure of which two and it's also going to have a oville-boggomorphushiki form. Of course, I mean, in general, we need to restrict the In general, we need to restrict the torch-on-free server, the touch-on-free part of the server, which is open discriminatory. So, we have this and we have a build model for Shibish Prof. So, this is very good news. And shall we just take a bit here? Ah yes, I'm gonna need to tell you because now I want to essentially what I want to do I want to construct for you a period mapping so from a modular space of marked primitive symplicate varieties to a period domain. In the period domain is pretty clear what we are going to use but for the construction of the modular space I need to tell you which families we want to consider. So, in general, in this moda setting, we were considering just families of this form where this map here, well, this was smooth and then, I mean, I say projective because of the disclaimer I did at the beginning, but otherwise, we should revive that all the fibers together. Together and what do we ask? What do we suppose we put on B? This is supposed to be an analytic space. And the only condition that I want to put is that this is connected. And then that's it. We don't ask anything anymore. But in the singular In the simpler setting, we want to do something similar. I mean, again, here I can ask that this is projective. More generally, I should ask that all the fibers are color spaces. But then are we gonna use the same? Are we gonna replace the smoothness here? We replace it with what is called the. It with what is called the localitrivial, and the localitrivia means that, okay, let's put any point on the top of space. I need to take let me say an open I think an open subset on the dollar space, an open subset on the base, and then an open subset inside sorry, this is going to be P1 in the fiber of a P of X. And I ask that that uh this uh we write such that the x splits as bit px cross p x. So essentially here this is very similar to the Heresman theorem that is happening in the case where we are saying that at the topological level this Logical level, this variety is locally trivial, really locally on the base. And I mean, here we are requiring locally triviality on the total space more than the base. So we are splitting an infinitesimal number of the open of the fiber. Okay, so these are the families we are interested in. So the locally treated families. Families and why is this that? Because in this way, essentially, the singularity type remains unchanged. Okay. So, what's uh, what is it you et? It's open. It's open in the fiber. Yes, it's an open in the fiber. I mean, here I'm using the analytic topology basically everything, everywhere. Sorry. Okay, and Okay, and then another thing, in general we have the Greenish space of objective variety in general in the space. This is way too big for our case. We want to consider the locally treated of runish space. So this is the the Ronish family. And this is the sub family. Okay, so the magic is that uh any subject here can be very bad, sometimes uh ritual components can be singular, radio components of different uh dimensions can be really bad. Dimensions can be really bad, but in this case, and this is, I say, backer land, but it actually follows from more general results that this space here is in fact smooth. Fracture, and I mean, this is a germ of a spin. It's a smoother and of dimension each one. So it's essentially like exactly what happens in the small case. And yeah, so I mean moreover this has a universal family and if we take any other point inside point inside this germ is a itames deformation family, a universal deformation family. So everything that holds in the small case is also also in this primitive symplatic case. But in particular this means that we can consider a modular space. So let me just this so this is the modular space. Space of a previous syntax varieties such that say varieties x dash such that x dash is a locally trivial deformation to x and we have the mark. Okay, so exactly what to be used to this unmixed view Yeah. Yeah, don't have to say too much. And there exists a global tornado. Well, it's exists both in the infinite decimal version, and also in the global version. But here we need to be careful about the subjectivity of the viewer map. It doesn't hold always, but it also at least in the cases. And these cases are, for example, when the variety is locally factorial or when the variety has terminal singularities. Okay, so terminal singularities in the simpletic world is equivalent to ask that the decoder. Equivalent to ask that the dimension of the simple lotus is greater than or equal to four. So it was the condition I wrote at the beginning. Sorry? Sorry to say that. That's a lot of time for that. I guess I'm a little bit confused about the implications. Are you doing all the conditions in real? Thank you. Only this. Okay, and then we can think of the monodromic growth. In the management group, what is gonna be? Like in this one case, we basically just consider all the locally tried families as level. So this is and then we consider the associated local system. Yeah, I should probably write torsion free in general because the Free general, because I said this is not in general. Free. And giving logical system again is equivalent to giving a representation of the fundamental group. And basically, we just consider the image of this, and we consider the union of these things along all the possible families, and this is going to be the monotony group. So, we basically just consider parallel transport inside all the possible families, but always look at. But always locally treated of that. Okay. And I mean, as always, you can, once you have this reality theory, you can always think that the monotony group is the stabilizer of a connected component of the modular space of Mart writes simply because here we have a natural action of the orthogonal group of. Just like change the marking, and then I mean, one is that what is a stabilizer? It's every time that you remain the same one at the component, so every time that when you compose those markings, you have a parallel transport, you are in the same training. I say isomorphic because it's not really any quality. It's an isomorphic up to communicate, so it's isomorphic to the stabilizer under its action of a collector's vector. Well I just got and maybe also another remark is that the monotony group is included in an orthogonal group and this is always a finite index. So, in particular, we have finitely many connected components. Okay. How much time do we have? This is the actual time. 10 minutes. I went way too slow. Okay, so um pay for three to moderate specific shields on Q3. So the setting is the one I wrote at the beginning. So X is going to be So X is going to be a projective K3, V is going to be an element in the Monkai palax. And we always gonna choose a polarization now. So nice means the volume. So nice means the following. This means that the following also that if V is a primitive, then in fact the motorized A is smooth. If V is not primitive but is of this form, then modular space is not smooth, but there exists a symplectic. More about there exists a symplectic decimalization. So essentially, I'm saying that this m tilde is the obligator. And then in general, when b is mw so now let's say m is greater than two or if m is equal to two then and is equal to two, then delta square is equal to two, then those are the actual objects we are interested in. This NV is a irreducible static writing I mean also in this case it is It is pre-mediative is actually reducible symptomatic, but don't tell me okay, I would say anyway. Which properties does it have? It is always locally free. It has terminal singularities and by one of the regular Regular, I'm sorry, regular. So the smooth, what the smooth, I mean, the subset of smooth sheets or stable sheets is trimmed up. So those are the nice properties. In particular, we are in the setting where neutrality theorem holds like in the small case. And I mean, this is a result of due to a lot of people, most people. And just about this set that we are interested in, this is due to Perikorapanietta, this is due to Kaledina and Surja, and in fact, this hypothesis implies that there exists a non-symplectic dissimilarization. Okay, so in this case, there is a non-symplectic dissimilarization. And actually, this is the property that the data government gets approved. That the data going up and yet approved, that's not the proof that this bright is argued for. So, what is another nice fact is that in all these cases, when we want to consider this object here, so this is equal to let me write so this is So, this is always gonna be W perfect. And I didn't put torsion 3 because in this case it's always torsion 3. And in this mood, in the primitive case, it was Obrady and Yoshiolka. In the in the other cases, okay, when there exists a dissimilarization, I think it was again Umbridi or maybe Lepanienta, but in the non In this case, here this is a result of Pellegarpagnienta. So, this is always true. But then, what is actually what we actually prove is the following. So we are in this case m bigger than 1. So this nice polarization in particular means that we have a stratification of our singular motorized space. And in particular, we have that the motorized space MW is the most singular structure. It's the most similar stratum and it embeds here. What is the embedding? Well, you take a shift and you send it to m time itself. Okay, so this is gonna be like, if you want, this is the class of s equivalent, the class of S equivalents. And And in ten codes of such varieties, we can look at the whole bag. And you can ask, okay, so here we have uh two two lattices and uh I mean this is uh isomorphic to Isomorphic to compare. This is isomorphic to that compared. This is maybe an isometry. That would be very nice, right? But in fact, this is not true. So let's start with not an isometry but is m times an isometry. In isometry. So, what I really mean here is that again, when I write it again, so we have here a W. Here we have the natural isometry, here we have the natural isometry, and here we have the identity. Then this in fact commutes, but it commutes with the different. But the communes with the factor M. So it's actually this I this is the pullback this is equal to m times this composition I don't know if it's clear what I'm I start so if I call this lambda and this mu is just gonna be equal to equal to lambda and times your inverse composite and in particular this implies that the start produces or if you want the joint action on the orthogonal group is an isotope. So, this is a nice function. And our result, I brought it again in this much fancy way. That if we start with the monotony group and start here, then we land in the monotony group. This is a nice process. So essentially, by restricting to the most singular logos, we get all the possible functions. We get all the possible phonetic operators. And I wanted to say a few words about the idea of the proof, but there is no time, so maybe I can finish it here. Any questions? Just one question of this one. Last thing at the end. Here we have all these factor M. So because we have the factor for me multiplied by M, or the Earth theorem. Now here this is an actual isomorphism of toggle. Even if they have a isometric, so that you can see the microphone. But this is a global factor. It doesn't affect uh it doesn't affect this isomotion, this is isometric here. That that was the the point. This is why Was the point. This is why I want to remark this thing. Even if we don't have an assumption about this, just interesting words. Maybe you can say one very brief word about me. Yeah, thank you. I want only to say why it is natural to believe that the monotonic rule. To believe that the monotonic group of this singular one is including the monotonic group of this one. And the idea is that we start with a family. We take, we said elements here are just given by locally trivial families, right? Of this object here. So we start with a family where the central hyper is this modulus space. And so, as I will say, we have this nice inclusion that is actually the modular inclusion. And it's not just modular inclusion. This is really, I mean, every time we have a family, we can stratify our varieties in family. So, in particular, we have also In particular, we have also a drop of family here. So let me just call it I again over the same panes and again over zero we have the most similar it's a very weird diagram and so And so the monotony is associated to these families just given by the representation of the fundamental group. But on the other hand, we also have this other family now and we have this one. And then we have this isomer sensor here. Right? And basically what I clean, well, what one has to remark at this point is that this is an isomorphism, but it's actually an isomorphism of representations. So, in particular, So, in particular, this is telling you that this I star sends the monotony group injectively into the monotony group. And maybe this can be bigger. So, this is a different. The proof is divided into parts. First to prove that monotromic group is injective and then that it is subjective. Then for this subjectivity you need to construct another operator. So that's always the same trick. But we are going to use the result of Markman for that. Any other questions? Don't let's thank the speaker here. Don't listen to me for yourself.
