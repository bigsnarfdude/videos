Yeah, I see on the screen there is this small icon and maybe this people at home are modeled for I don't know how much people type down it's an idea. Sorry about that. For anyone w uh watching online, do you see something in the middle of the screen or is it fine? Do you see the whole blackboard or anything? There's no one watching online. I'm very pocketed. I've seen the whole thing, but it's very hard to hear understand what this is saying. Okay, so all right. So I haven't talked to you. Alright, so. I haven't talked yet. Okay. Just make sure it's. Okay, well he Chris will try his best. I won't forget. So let's welcome Chris Baron from Not Open. I've tried a couple of methods, but I'm pretty sure. Thanks very much. Thank you to the organizers for the invitation to this beautiful place. Beautiful place. I'm going to talk about today some joint work in progress. It's very, very new. And that's new, and so I will be very, I'll try to be very conservative. There's some of the stuff that, even the stuff that we have. Stuff that, even stuff that we have proofs for, I don't feel like I actually understand inside. So, this is all very new stuff. And it's joint with Jesse Wolfson. We started this, this is a side project we started basically right as the pandemic stuff. And it builds on the technical aspects on these papers here, which are already in the literature. So, I'll say that. Uh someone online that has a micro open, if you could please mute yourself because it's uh thank you. Okay. Yeah, so let me say to all of you that I'm not a Passant Geometer, but I'm a fellow traveler. And the thing I'm going to talk about is an integration problem that I think is very close and spirit to a lot of the integration. Is very close and spirit to a lot of the integration problems, in some sense, maybe, that people deal with in post-stellar geometry. So, at the very least, what I talk about today may somehow subconsciously inspire some progress on the killer integration problem that you're interested in. So, let me start with motivation by giving a theorem. This theorem is due to Ezra Getzler. As our Gessler. 2009. Okay. So I'm going to state the theorem, and then there's going to be some words in here that I'll explain on that board over there as we move along. So given, say, finite type, no potent. The N algebra calls this data is L D and L sub K. We're always working, for this talking, it's working better. Given this, we can functorially assign Finite dimensional simplicial setting. Anything else involved in the topic? We're interested in earlier. Let's call that simplicial set gamma. And this simplicial set has many more properties. So the first one, first property, is that it's an entry. Okay, the second property is that if L is a nilpotent Lie algebra. A nilpotent Leotra. Something that everybody knows, but that is, that's an example of such a guy. Then this supposedial set is isomorphic to the nerve of the one connected. The one connected, they'll put Lie group integrating G. So this is just going to be G equipped with the chemical house store product. That's what G tilde is. The nerve is exactly the same thing that was on the board in the previous talk. Another fact is if L is just an ordinary finite dimension. Ordinary finite-dimensional vector space in concentrated in degree m. So that's just a chain complex basically, no differential, and then just v sitting somewhere between 0 and infinity. Then this simplicial set that you get applied to this example is going to be is going to be the simplicial set kvn plus 1, which is the output of the don't confirm that goes from chain complexes to simplicial abelian problems. So last property before I define what these things mean for those that don't know, this Those that don't know, this is actually a statement that appears in a paper by Andrew Bergwin in the Rational Homotopy Theory of Literature. If general or material, you'll put in bite-dimensional, I see something about the homotopy groups. Groups. Actually, I'm going to switch immediately the N's that are floating around to be capital N's when I'm saying the N. So the supposed homotopy groups of this little stuff, n greater or equal to 2 are going to be just the homology groups of the Lie and algebra. Algebra, for n variant two. And then for pi one, you expect this to be a non-abelian thing, and indeed it is. This group is actually isomorphic to the degree zero homology, which, as we'll see if you don't know already, will always be a Lie algebra for any one of these things. Just like a DGLA. It helps to think. Just like a DGLA. It helps to think of DGLA so we don't want all the Die algebra stars. H0 of L will always be a Lie algebra. And this group will, and in this case, will be a Neopoten Lie algebra. And this group will be isomorphic to this. Well, basically, the one connected to the group that anger is the still co-linear and the outer, which is just the thing itself, again, with the Campbell House of the Pone. So let me say, so this is the motivation. Excuse me. Yeah. Excuse me. Yeah, Dima here. Yeah. So what do you mean by saying that that's an equal set is finite? That's an excellent question. And really what I mean is that it is It is, well, roughly what I mean is that it's a finite dimensional, it's an affine variety in every degree. Okay, easy. So this guy, where are we here? This gamma L, this lives inside for each N. All I mean by this is that it's some. It's some locus that lives in some R N. This N is not equal to this N, so let's call this N. Sorry? Is it smooth? It's certainly equivalent to something that's smooth. But that's but that's it that It doesn't matter not to erase a whole bunch of this anyway. So let me say what some of these things are, okay, just to orient ourselves. So, some rough definitions. So, Lian algebra L D L K is a chain complex. This is just so, you know, you can compare this. This is going to be an example of an L infinity I want, so I just want to get our conventions down, even if you know what this is on the way. So this is a chain complex. It's going to be concentrated in degrees 0 up to L n minus 1. And so everything is homological here. Differential is going down. And then it's equipped with linear maps for each k variant equal to k variant equal to. In fact, because of how I have it concentrated, it'll go all the way up to capital N plus case. And it's convention that you just define little L sub i here to be the differential D. Differentiate D. These guys have a degree of k minus 2. Again, that's a choice of convention. It's not 2 minus k, it's k minus 2 in this talk. Such that all these guys form some sort of higher coherent homotopical analog of the Jacobia identity. So Jacobi holds, and what that looks like very, very roughly is some quadratic relation. Amongst the L sub P's and Q's, and you have this for all n greater than. So that's, I'm just going to leave the definition like that. We'll have an explicit example a little bit later in the talk if it's the first time you've ever seen this. But it's just an L-infinity algebra with these conventions concentrated in these degrees. And we say it's finite type if each one of those L sub i's is a finite dimensional vector space. Finite dimensional vector space. Okay, and nilpotent. Yeah, so I'm about to erase the word nilpotent. That's sort of the punchline at the talk. But I'll just say that there's a notion of a lower central series here that just mimics, in some sense, the one that comes from that you think of for a note-blown DGLA. And if you don't like that, DGLE. And if you don't like that, then just think of a nil-code in DGLI. And if you really, really don't like that, then you can force me to write down what the definition of nilcode is. But I don't want to do it. So there's a notion of a large entrance series, you know, if as you go out to, you know, some, it terminates after finding steps. That's the definition. So that's the L infinity stuff. What about the other things that are in this definition? Well, n group, Lee N group showed up in the last talk, and this is the same thing. Showed up in the last talk, and this is the same thing, but just for, we're talking about simplicial sets. So everywhere where you saw in the definition of a Lie-N group the word subjective submersion, just replace that with subjection. Everywhere where you saw diffeomorphism in the definition of a Lie N group, just replace that with isomorphism since that's what a thing means. Ng tilde, so that's the simplicial set that's just going to be Root. Be further GS is going to be the nerve of the one object, of one object nerve. Okay, and this guy here, this is supposed to mimic the notation for a Heimenberg McLean space because it is, in a sense. But let's see. So, yeah, so ABN plus 1 for finite dimensional vector space, this is going to be a simplicial set that, if you really want the precise definition, is ums of chain complexes between thermalized chains on On the n-simplex, so that's what the, this is going to be k here, say k here, into this graded vector space. These are important building blocks. That's why I'm taking the time to try to find them solid precisely. But what this really looks like in terms of just a Looks like in terms of just an abelian group, a solution abelian group is, so we have nothing in dimension less than, say, n plus 1. And then we have products of the B's, K2's N plus 1, from K gradery. This is the dope. This is one of the ugly dope. Adult, this is one of the functions in adult for adult converse. Okay, last thing I want to say is: what do I mean by this pi SPL? So this means you just take, this is simplicial homotopy groups. And it doesn't matter right now what that means, but the thing is that you don't want to confuse this with topological homotopy groups when everything switches to a smooth manifold. To a smooth manifold. So I can define what these are if you'd like me to, but it's just basically the standard definite MS of the Hotobi group of a simplicial set. All right, so that's the motivation, okay, is that this theorem exists. And today, I want to talk about a result. Absolutely no disrespects to any of the people's names here. I'm going to just erase this just for the purposes of time and do that thing that our students absolutely hate when they're doing a black work. So this is TRL Muscle Eraser Eraser. So the statement will be, at least the statement for today will be: given a finite type V n algebra, L D L K, we can functorally assign. So I'm going to put, I'm going to work in red here. So functorially assigned or pseudo functorially assigned, I'll be I'll be slightly vague about that for right now. Finite dimensional simplicial manifold. Finite, finite, finite dimensional simplicial manifold. Let's just call this for this talk the integral of L, such that the integral of L is a Lie-Ang group. Okay, if L is equal to a Lie algebra, then the integral of L will be a simplicial manifold that's isomorphic to the nerve of the Lie group G tilde, where G tilde is the one connected integration. The one connected integration of G. Okay, this statement stays the same. If I have a finite dimensional vector space that's shifted up into M, that's an example of a Lee analysis. Up in the M, that's an example of a Lie algebra. Then the integral of this guy is going to be this Li N. It's going to be this guy. I'm going to get my ends mixed up. It's going to be this guy now thought of as a well as a simplistial abelian Lie group, not just as a as a bear, circlistial abelian group. I feel like we're so same isomorphism as before. And this will be all the same as well. So in general, we take the simplicial homotopy groups of the integration of L, and this will be Hn minus 1 of L as abelian lead groups. And pi one, this potential pi one of the integration of L will be isomorphic to, as a lever, will be isomorphic to the one connected lever. A leader that integrates H0L. So I'll write that like this. So does the statement make sense? Any questions about this statement? Yes, for excuse me. Yes, so in your situation, this Situation this pi one, this g hat, will generally have longitudinal pipe combats on it. The g hat will have a general, well I mean it's a finite dimensional leap group that will generally have non-shadow common topic. That's right. So in particular, there will be a period homomorphism from pi 3 of that group into. Of that group is you, I guess what you're grading is H1 of L. And that might have non-discrete image. So won't this mess up your well, the first part of your statement? No, no, no, it doesn't. No, no, no. Does not. Because Because the reason why is because you think about the long exact sequence where that connection homomorphism shows up, the way this shows up is as simplicial homotopy groups of Of the sky that we're integrating. So it's the reason why it doesn't show up is because this integration is not Enrique's integration. And so it doesn't have the property that if you take the integration of the elite algebra G, that its simplicial homotopy groups could be non-triple. Not necessarily could be non-trivial above degree one. Do you understand what I mean? Yes. Yeah, yes. Certainly do. That's why, yeah, this looks very surprising. Yes. But yes, please go on. Yeah, so that's the punch. Yeah, in some sense, that's one of the technical punchlines of the thing. Okay, great. So, but yeah, so I'm always. So, you know, I'm assuming basically that I'm going to get to some level of completion of this talk and it's going to spill over into the discussion. It's just how it's going to be. I'm sorry. So, right, so let's prove this theorem. Let me say a few things, though. For the purposes of just exposition, I'm going to only talk today about how to get the infinity group. And as some people And as some people know, that there's a truncation process that has to happen to get to the end group. And sometimes that could disrupt sort of representability related to these issues that Dima was talking about. They again don't show up. This we have a proof of. Okay, so but it just will take too long to sort of explain how that all works. Okay, so I feel like I feel like to people who are not so into this sort of thing, I should say something about how it's connected to L-Finny algebras that maybe you've seen already in the solid geometry-like contexts. So, don't, one thing I want to do is these are not the same thing as L infinity algebras or DGLAs that you would find in deformation problems. That you would find in deformation problems. These are very different flavor. So, in particular, in this definition that I gave in L-infinity algebra or Lien algebra, the Maurici-Chan elements of such a guy are going to be degree minus one elements. That's the conventions. And so that means that they're zero for a row. But this thing has no interesting maraudon elements on its own. So that's weird, right? You're usually used to looking at those things. But we're going to get a tensor element a little bit with some CGAs. CGAs that will make it have narcoton elements. So that's the first thing. These are not deformation theoretic sort of gadgets that you usually play with. But where do they show up? The song geometry, I can think of off the top of my head two places, maybe more than now, you know, since the last time I've sort of looked at the literature. So the first example is: so vector fields on a geometric stack. So, vector fields on a geometric stack formally lead to algebra exactly of this kind. I think that's the result of what was down. Sorry. Perfect. And there we go. That's 2016. And another example comes from Global Sections of Kron algebra. And that possibly is also from a Li2 algebra, with Pront bracket, the one that doesn't satisfy your code beyond the nose. And that's due to Wingbridge Weiss. That's 1998. Okay, so these are not finite type necessarily, okay? But like you can imagine having some interesting finite type sub-algebras of these guys that maybe come from some sort of group action or something like that. That's something that can show up. So finite type guys can live inside these. Right, so to solve this problem, the proof Solve this problem, to prove this theorem, we need the first part of this, the title of this talk, which is homotopical methods. So let me say a few words about that. Just separating the yellow hole. Okay, so I don't need to toggle anymore. Homotopical structures in the homotopical structure of two categories of interest. The one is going to be of Li n groupoids, or Li-infinity groupoids, and Li-N algebraids. So I'm just going to, this is the category of Li Infinity group points and groups. Okay, so we'll try to be concise about this. So, okay. So. Okay, so the first thing is, so I'm going to list three sets of morphisms that are very useful that exist in here. The first one is going to be called fibrations, and what these are going to be are the con vibrations. So the con vibrations are maps between Li-infinity group waves that satisfy a horn-filling condition that's very similar to the one. That's very similar to the one that was written down for the definition of a Li-infinity group void. So it's like a relative version of a Li-infinity group void. So this satisfies important filling. And I'm going to give filling conditions. So let me say relative. So absolutely. So map plus x and y. And it has to satisfy something like so you have this horn. So for all m greater or equal to 1, for all i equal to from 0 up to m. M. Any diagram of this form has to have a lift. That's the statement level of sequential sets. But the space of these guys will form a manifold, the space of all such diagrams. And then the assignment of a lift to a diagram has got to be a surjective submersion. That's how to say that in words. So, happy to go over. So, happy to go over, say something more precise about that if you want. Won't need these to be very precise about these so much, but they are there and they are important. Okay, another notion is a weak equivalence. Okay, and basically how these look are something like Now these look are something like the following. So if you have a map from x to y, a map of the infinity group voids, I can define two simplicial sets for each x and y. Okay, so let me do it like this. So I'm going to find two simplicial sets. So p0x, is this going to be the simplicial set that's just Simplicial set that's just the underlying set of x. So this is in general going to be a Bonach manifold or whatever like that that has an underlying set. This is a sufficiential set. And the same thing for y. And then I'll also define another sufficial set for both x and assigned for both x and y called P1x. P1x is just going to be the following sufficial set in dimension n. It will be the direct limit. It will be the direct limit of the following sets. Com manifold Are we talking about simplicial sets or simplicial manifolds? This is a simplicial manifold. This is a simplicial set. This is a simplicial set. This is a sequelic set. This is just a set of manifold smooth maps from an interval that looks like this, an open interval around zero, into xn. This is a set. It's a simplistic set. Everything comes along. It's like taking a stop with the sheet. Okay, so you get one of these for any for any special manifold x and y. And then we say f is a weak equivalence. If f induces on p0 and p1, we come into we equal to simplicial sets. So these last ones like germs of maps from or to text to psychology. Yeah, yeah, yes. Could you give some intuition for why we only care about terms of maps from a one-dimensional space? Why do we need to probe it in the middle? Inverse functions here. So in our paper, so in a paper of Chen Chung, we came up with, well, we talked about these things, and we gave a more complicated definition of equivalences, actually than this. There's an exercise here, there's a claim, that it suffices us to do just that this notion is equivalent to the one that is in our paper. In our paper. Okay, but good news is that, so in the one ripoid case, what does this correspond to? This will give you the, this covers the notion of weak equivalence of leaker units for anything. So maybe that's like a So maybe that's like a fun exercise then. Oh boy, that's good. So the other thing that we have is hypercumbers. Hypercomputers behave like Hypercovers behave like things that are both weak equivalences and vibrations. So that's called asyncric vibrations. And it's a theorem that if you have something that's a con vibration and a weak equivalence in this sense, what you have is a hypercover between Lie infinity group points. And there's much, much more. So basically, the other thing that we need is that vibrations and acyclic vibrations preserve under base change on the pullback. And I'm going to put a tiny little asterisk there that means I'm not, I'm hiding one little d2 clean. Okay, so an example of such a guy here for the one groupoid case is just a weak equivalence of one groupoids. An example of a hypercover for the n equals one case would just be a weak equivalence of groupoids where the zeroth level map is just rejected submersion. I think that's that's the way to think about all the ways. That's the word thing. So if you're holding on for life for examples, they're examples. Y'all are. Excuse me. Yeah, sorry for interrupting me again. So since you're talking about group weights as opposed to just n groups, so I'm talking about group weights in general, but everything that I General, but everything that I just said, you know is true, it's true for the accuracy as well. Yes, in that case, I'm a little worried about the vibrations here. Well, because they what to do about F naught. Yes, that's what that star means. That that star means right there. Ah, is that what it is? Yeah, so so so so here's the so so to this will make sense to to to people who Sense to people who it'll make sense to. These things, we and our voids form almost a category of fibrin objects for a homotopy theory. So that's almost the right half side of a coil and model category. The only axiom that you have to weaken is that you always have pullbacks of vibrations. So in our definition, you So in our definition, if your pullback exists for a vibration, it's precisely because of this zeroth level thing that Dino's talking about, the axiom is that if that pullback exists, then it will be a vibration. Does that answer your question? Yes, well, except that if that is not a submersion, then I I wonder what if the uh if the notion of vibration is well. The notion of vibration is well defined because these corn spaces you construct m uh may not be uh many faults. So like this like the thing that's in the diagram. Yeah, yeah, but that yeah that that that that that turns out to be okay. You just need to sort of strengthen the statement about collapsible simplicial sets that Henriquez has in his paper. That's not the problem. That's not the problem. The problem is just in this case whether or not we have pullbacks or not. This is in the paper with Chen Chang, so I can point you to this reference. Thank you. Sure. Okey-dokey. So that's the homotopy theory that we have for Li infinity groups and group points. And this is not a quick sort of bit of theology. I know I'm totally killing the clock here. When I mean homotopy theory, I mean something that you can put your hands on. Theory, I mean something that you can put your hands on. I really mean homotopy theory in terms of like chapter four of hatching. Where that, like, you know, do you want something like brown representability? Do you want something that looks like Plasnikov systems, obstruction theory, things like that? You can ask those questions and compute those things in this framework. This is not like infinity categorical nonsense. I mean, that's great too, right? But this is something that's designed to be used and compute with. All right, so let's get back to. Alright, so let's get back to integration. I'm just going to keep following my notes. I'll try to cut out some things, I guess, towards the end, but I'd rather not rush just go again to the discussion section. So there's a well-known infinite-dimensional integration, celebrated result by Andre Riguez that's been referred to already a couple times. And what does that look like? So I shouldn't put it first. Okay, so if I have finite type be an algebra, then I can integrate this to a Li-infinity groupoid in sorry, Li-infinity group. That's infinite dimensional manifolds. That's an infinite dimensional manifold, so it's a bonach. It's a infinity group in Bonarchy. I'll say what this is really quickly. Okay, so this thing here is, these guys here are differential forms. So CR differential forms on the geometric angle. So with my geometric end simplex, what do I mean by this? So I mean, just r continuously differentiable forms for r greater than one. It doesn't matter what it is. I just need it to form a Bonach algebra. That's why I have to do this. And you know, I want the differential to be closed under this, so I have to require that alpha is Cr and then D alpha is Cr. And D alpha is the silver form. So this forms a TG bond architect. And then the way I think about it in this context, if you're trying to keep kind of reading and things like that, is that for each n, I think of this thing homologically as living in negative, in non-positive terms. So one form is a degree minus four. Now I tensure that with my Now I tensor that with my L infinity algebra, I get a new L infinity algebra. The only structural difference really is that the random differential now plays a role here, but the brackets are just sort of carried over. It's because this is commutative. And then I take my Cartan elements. And in simplicial degrees greater than or equal to 1, I'll has something, because this guy now is in degree maximum. So this is something that has trivial, you know, only one vertex, but then interesting things all the way up there. But then interesting things all the way down there. So, this is inspired by Sullivan's realization function from rational homometry theory. The thing that Andre did that was really great is that he just sort of, well, took the analysis, functional analysis seriously and got a geometric project. We could pick here that neural diffraction functions that means that we have the diffraction function. Um well isn't it okay if I just required this to also be the subs I include this guy to be also GR? Or sorry, CR. Otherwise exactly that moral point. Okay, so just a quick example To use a Lie algebra, okay, then the sequential miracle time set of G in this case, what will it be in degree N? Well, it's going to actually turn out to be isomorphic to R plus 1 continuously differentiable maps from the geometric n-synplex into the one connected lead group that integrates G mod G tilde. How does set differentiation come about? By literally looking, opening this up in this case and realizing that you're really talking about flat connections on the trivial G tilde bundle over the geometric end sequence. And then just you use what you know about flat connections on such a line to get this clear. My point, and I think I'll just leave it at this, is that this thing is not the same as the nerve of G tilde. And here's another thing. So Andre computed what the simplicial homotopy groups are of this eye. Are of this guy. Now, the simplicial homotopy group of this homotopy of this guy are all concentrated in degree 1. It's just pi 1. This is, in the smooth world, this is an eigen-verbed plane space, kg tilde 1. And so what you get is just this group back as a weak group. Not so here. Okay, so here, what you get is, well, Is, well, n is equal to 1, you do get G tilde. And if n is greater than or equal to 1, what you get are the actual honesty goodness topological homotopy groups of your group. Okay, so Bott's theorem says, you know, I could put a three here, right? And so the difference between this and this. The difference between this and this starts at pi 3, which is exactly sort of probably like to have started talking about that issue. And if you want to find conventional integration, the moral of the story is that I'd like to note the case, this is like true integration. I feel like this is something that people who do Poisson geometry and integration really understand or appreciate if I said pi 2 or something, right, for algebra. Something right for algebra. Okay, so that's the problem. Okay, and so sort of fast-forwarding a bit, let me just say that even though these aren't the same, there is a map, and it's a configuration in the sense I described earlier, that goes from this simplicial step to the nerve of G, tilde. I'll call this tau tau 1. Okay, so the way this works is Okay, so the way this works is that if you have a map from this guy to here, you just restrict it to the vertices. Okay, so that's going to give you n plus 1 copies of G tilde. That would give you, like, you know, points, n plus 1 points of G tilde, if you're strict to the vertices. Then you bought out by G tilde. What do you get? G tilde n times. And that's what the n simplices are in the curve. That's one way of thinking about what that map is. Another fancy way of saying is like this is the one truncation of this, but I don't want to say anything about truncations. Okay. So the goal is to somehow get rid of higher by ends of the thing that we started integration with. So VN algebras also have a gravitometer. Meaning that you, you know, again, this is a compute thing. If you open the paper, you're just going to see homological algebra, and you can ask questions about things we chapter for Hatcher, but for Lee, and algebras. You compute them. Okay, let me just say, so we're Just say, so for purposes of being very quick, so if I have a morphism, what we call an infinity morphism, so a collection of maps, F2, you know, all the way up from an LEN algebra. Okay. These are all going to be Linear max, we're going to have degree k minus 1 here. Okay. And these all have to satisfy some compatibility conditions with the brackets. If you're going to be really terse, you can take your Lie algebra to be an NQ manifold over a point. And now I'm just saying that these are going to be maps between the NQ manifolds. Maps between the NQ. That's a little different. But in particular, the relations that these guys have to satisfy to be an L-infinity morphism, so I'm defining an L-infinity morphism. One of the relations is that F1 has to be a chain map. That's one of the conditions. So you always will have something next to that. So every Allenthoniomorphism gives a map between the corresponding Gives a map between the corresponding chain complexes. So we will say that F is a weak equivalence if F1 is a quasi-bisomblance. And we'll say F is a vibration if F1 is surjective or positive degree subjective. Pause it to read this chat. Just I'm copying sort of the sort of like same mantra as I did in the infinity group. Okay, I can say a lot more about this. It's stable under, the vibrations and acyclic vibrations, they're stable under base change, just as you would like. You pull back a vibration, you get a vibration. Pull back an acyclic vibration, which is just going to be a Mac that satisfies both of these conditions. A map that satisfies both of these conditions, you'll get an acyclic vibration. But the main thing relevant to our discussion about integration is Pausnikov systems. So Li-N algebras have empirical notion of a positive system. So I'm going to give an example of this just for the case when n equals two, lead two algebras. Okay, so just as a basic example of NAS2, so what's a, and let's let's be very, very explicit. So let's consider a lead to algebra that is minimal, just for fun, okay? Because it's going to make writing easier. What that means is that the difference. Easier. What that means is that the differential is zero. So there's going to be the differential, an L2 bracket, and an L3 bracket. I'll tell you what all this boils down to, the L Finity axioms boil down to when you have a chain complex, starting with a chain complex. So this guy here will have to be a Lie entropy. The L2 bracket restricted to G will be a Lie bracket. This thing here is just going to be, you know. thing here is just going to be some vector space shifted into group one. When you take L2 and you restrict it to G tensor V1, this is going to get an action. This corresponds to an action G on V. The axioms tell you that, okay, in a special case. What are the axioms for the L3 map? The axioms for the L3 map are going to imply that in this special case, this guy is a Lie algebra 3 cocycle with values of V. So that's the same data as a minimal V2 algebra. It's B algebra degree 0, representation degree 1, 3 cosine. So, what's the possiboff system going to do for us in this case? Well, it's going to let us build L, so this is L, from G and a classifying map into a universal vibration. So, this is what this So, this is what the system is going to look like. So, let's talk about what the universal vibration is going to be. So, should mine do something like the Borel construction. Okay, so and then there's a fiber over here. And then there's a fiber over here. What is these guys are all DGLAs. They're all strict Li 3 algebras, actually. This one right here is going to be V 0 and degree. Degree one, degree two. This one here is going to look very similar, except I'm going to have an extra copy of V in degree one. And my differential is just going to be the identity there. What that does is that tells me that this thing is intractable over Nv. Now, what are the bracket structures? It's just a Lee bracket on NV, and then On NV, and then there's only, and then the bracket, something in here over here is just the action of NV on V. Same thing for this. Notice that this thing, just the level complex, as you can see, has fiber V shifted to one. Now let's take G. This is the bottom of my possible. And I have a classified colour. So G has an action on NB. On NB, so there's that map. And xi is going to be in degree 1. This is going to be the action again. In array 1, rather, just from G to N B. C at level 3. Okay, well, if you're paying attention to what the degrees of these maps have to be, this has to be. But the degrees of these maps has to be, this has to be a, this has to be a, let's see, a degree 2 thing, because degrees of the maps are k minus 1. So this is a free area thing, so it's going to go to degree 2. So it has to land in E2, because that's what I have here. Is there anyone taking a guess what that map is? It's this three-co-cycle. And then the theorem, which is really easy to prove because it's so explicit, everything is so explicit, is that, okay, well, this is a vibration, given the definition I had earlier. I pull this back, and I get a fiber, you know, and I also have, you know, fiber is going to be one property of V. So that's what I mean by a cost and cost system for a two algebra that's minimal. So you have to change your category at this point. From lean n algebras, I'll just say infinity algebra, a few minutes left. You'll at least be able to point to something and say something before we break. So Li infinity algebra is a finite height. Finite type, now equipped with classifying maps. This is the category of lead infinity algebra is equipped with classifying maps for each stage of the positive plantar. That's extra data. Like choice of coastal. And in the morphisms, they're just going to be all the maps in the infinity objects that would commute with these choices of classical. Of classifying them. Why is this important to the integration story? Because on this side, I had finite dimensional models for all these. Okay, so and here's what the finite dimensional models look like. And we'll stop here for eating through chalk. I'm used to the so the analog of this n finite-dimensional Lie-free groups. Is something like the following. So instead of Nv, I'll have the nerve of the one connected integration of that Lie algebra. Here, I'll have an eigenverticle space shifted up one degree, so Kd3. Okay, so what is this group? Hang on a second, let me think for a second. Yeah, so what is this Li-N group? This is like the action groupoid for a simplicial group acting on a simplicial manifold, if that's how you want to formulate it. If you're familiar with the W-bar construction, W-bar construction. We're just basically doing like Borel's construction, but with simplicial leap groups. I can say, of course, I can say exactly what it is. I just want to get something down in the next couple of minutes. Okay, here, I also have a fine-dimensional thing. What's my notation? BT. Same type of construction as before. It's like an action group way, but now it's acting on the Eilenberg-McLean space that caused by. The Eilenberg-McLean space it comes by taking the Dolph confunctor and applying it to B in degree in degree 3 and B in degree 2. So it's going to give a, it has its contractability. And the five into this thing is Kb is going to be Kb2. Okay, so then I got to stop because we have to eat lunch. But how do we. But how do we integrate this to this is that we integrate this Postnikov data using Andre's infinite dimensional functor. But then we add in one extra special detail, and that's something called a one-atlas. And that's going to be like an atal hypercover of the nerve of G in this case. That's where all the delicate stuff comes in. Delicate stuff comes in. But the concept is this: you have this decomposition, and I've taken this thing I don't know how to integrate necessarily and broke it into things that I do have good finite dimensional models for. That's everything over here. Then it's just a matter of sort of passing that classifying map data over to this diagram here in leaf, five-dimensional leaf times. Sorry, I didn't get to the actual punch punch. Sorry, I didn't get to the actual punch punch line, but that's just going to have to wait unfortunately for some questions. So I'll stop here for the sake of stopping both. Yeah, I have a I have a couple of questions. So the first question is this um the collection of this classifying data is contractable, is that? Yeah. Contractible money, is that the piece? Yeah, so that's another thing, I guess, the moral of working this way, is that the functor that we get is a one functor. But it also descends to the level of, let's say, just say the homotopy categories, because we have homotopy theories everywhere, so we can just mod out by, say, weak, let's just be very vague and say mod out by weak equivalences. Then sort of the possible choices of such data will be contracted. Contract. So it's like we actually never picked anything at the level, we never made any choices at the level of electronic care. Another reason why, like, it's good to work this way. Can you say more about this remark you made at the end about a Natal Atlas? Yeah. So So, what I mean by an Ital Atlas is going to be, let's see, let me try to use the same definition. So it's going to be, this special case, it's going to be a map to be a It's going to be a map from a say a Li infinity group to this infinite dimensional integration such that this thing's big. But remember, I have that vibration that's called like truncation. It takes me to the nerve. So it's that this composition Is an etal hyper. Okay, so what do I mean by an etal hyper? So first of all, morally we should think of is that this thing is an attempt to split this vibration by a span. To do that, this should kind of feel familiar for people who do things like Maria Theory, like the one in the legs has to be a hypercover. Covered, okay. The fact that it, to say that, so it's not just a towel, it's good towel. What does that mean? Well, it's a hypercover, such that the map on every level is a local diffeomorphism. And this thing is a disjoint union of contractible. Trackable spaces, topological. That's what we mean by this. So this thing is finite-dimensional, first of all, because it's local diffeo down to this guy. So that's great. If you want an example of such a thing, a mythical example of such a thing would be to take, so this thing here is like g tilde plus n, this thing here, This thing here, a mythical example would be if you had a way of taking a good open cover at every level of G cross N and forming that into a simplicial manifold. So every level is a good open cover of a G cross n. I don't know how to do that for all levels n. For all levels n. The degeneracies turn out to be a problem. I think in certain cases, people have very good models for this, but people have played with like gerbs over compact lead groups and stuff like that. There's the same type of data that's going on here. But that's what we mean by here. Is that answering your question? Yeah, that's fine. So to me, this looks like in the case, like if you have professed G with a Lie algebra, this should somehow resemble choosing like a transversal to the Choosing like a transversum to the foliation by combatopis, right? Oh, I have no idea. Because no? You have to ask somebody who or a geometric intuition for this. But I mean, shouldn't the NCG in the case of... I mean, you showed like the NCG for the case of Lie algebra's was like maps from simplices into like uh maps from simplices into this algebra, right? Yeah. Uh into G tilde, yeah. Uh, into G tilde, yeah. To G tilde. At the Lie algebraic level, that's like algebraic morphisms. Sure. Sure. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. If you want to think about like T, if you take tangents and everything. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Let me just say that this is the key step to getting from there to here. Because you apply Andre's MC functor to this thing, and then you start pulling back along this map to something that's funny to actually. It's fine, actually. And that's how the rest of the story flows. The fact that such a thing exists for every Liean algebra is a theorem, and it's, to me, very difficult. Excuse me, Chris. Yeah. So what properties does this map C have that you just read? The only properties that it has to have are the ones It has to have are the ones that, well, the only properties I know of that it has is that it exists for all Lie n algebras when I put H0L there and think of that as Lie algebra. And this map is fun, this is canonical, and so its composition with this canonical one has to have this bid atal hypercover property.
