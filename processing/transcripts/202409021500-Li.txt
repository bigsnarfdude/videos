So, this is the title of my talk. So, I want to explain this title and also give you the penchline in case I don't get to finish the thing. So, we want to study this 4D ink to theory, and we want to study the theory whose half DPI spectrum has a quiver description. BPS spectrum has a quiver description. So we call this BPS quiver. And the question we want to ask is: what is the BPS algebra? So this BPS algebra is in the sense of having more. I write very slow, so I'll use lots of shorthand, and I'll probably not give many references, but they're all in our paper. And so in case it's not clear what the short tense is, please interrupt and ask me. So this BPS algebra is defined physically by Harvey Moore. And so the element of the algebra is BPS state. And multiplication is supposed to characterize the fusion of two BPS states into a third one. So of course the whole So, of course, the whole point is to give more or less rigorous definition of what is the mathematical definition of the BPS states, and in particular, what do we mean by fusion here? So one of the main results of this paper is that this algebra has a formulation by This algebra has a formulation by Kinchewich and Swobermann, the Koha, which stands for co-homological Hall algebra. And it's a function of, it depends on this equivalent potential. One of the main results of this paper is that for the class S theory, class S, which is essentially the N5. The N5 theory on competitive on a Riemann surface. And for a very generic case, whose BPS quer has the property that the Q is 2 acyclic, meaning that there's no cycle of lens 1 or lens 2. And also for the potential that is generic enough. It's generic enough, meaning that, I mean, there's a we call it infinitely mutable, meaning that it's generic enough so that you can always do a mutation on this quaver. And okay, so for this class of a BKS quiver, this coha actually reduced to a very simple algebra, which is the spherical sub-algebra. Is the spherical sub-algebra of the Schuffle algebra that only depends on Q here? And the second main result is that once we get this algebra, we can use this to study the line defect, the Hub BPS line defect. So it's an old result that the Hubbi P line defect in this theory is given by the frame. theory is given by the frame quaver. I'll use this notation to denote the frame quaver here. So essentially you just first imagine that this is another quiver. So this has a new friending node, except that it's frozen. So you first imagine this is a whole new quiver and you define the koha. And you define the koha. You study the koha, and then you can also reduce to this spherical shaft algebra. And then after that, you take into account of the fact that this one node that's frozen. And so you do some reduction. So in the end, what you get is that for one theory, you have one equivalent potential. So you have one algebra. So, you have one algebra, and then in the theory, you have all kinds of different line defects. So, they're characterized by different by module of this algebra. So, I'll try to explain these two results today. So, okay, now let me explain this setup more carefully. Not too bad. So, the first So, today we focus on the 4DNQ2 supersymmetric theory that's given by MPhi theory on Riemann surface. And this is called a class S theory. And so it has a coulomb branch with coordinate U. And it's a charge that is. And there's a charge that is big gamma and the charge vector, we'll call this small gamma. And this chart lattice has a DRC pairing that is anti-symmetric. And then what's important is there is a There is a central charge, which is a linear map between the from the charge lattice to the complex number. And it also depends on the position in the Coulomb moduli space. So now given u, we want to, so this is a complex number, so we want to look at the Complex number, so we want to look at those gammas such that the imaginary part is positive. So this will correspond to the particle, BPS particle. Sorry, so the BPS means that the mass is equal to the absolute value of central charge. So and then you also, if it's if the imaginary part is negative, then it's an antiparticle. So to describe this spectrum, you only need to focus on the particle part. So the antiparticle is from the CPT. So now, so today we um focus on the uh theory that the the spectrum is given by uh VPS. Is given by a VPS quiver. So this quiver might have a potential. So the quiver is given by a bunch of vertices that were labeled by A and a bunch of arrows labeled by ij. And so we write this is the arrow from A to B. And so So the number of vertices here is given by the rank of that charge lattice. And so if a quiver has a loop, it's possible to have a superpotential. So the superpotential is just a sum of loops, and for each term, it's a product of the arrows along this loop. So, what does it mean that this PPS spectrum is given by the quiver? So, here, basically, for each vertex in the quiver, it corresponds to a basis of the charge vector. So, meaning that for each A node, you have a basic charge vector such that Such that any BPS state, so any populated charge vector can be decomposed in terms of this positive integer. And the arrow is related. The arrow is related to the Dirac pairing between these basic charge vectors. So for any pair of nodes, I have this. And so if you already know the spectrum, you can basically. Spectrum, you can basically read off the BPS spectrum this way. So, if you don't know the spectrum, I mean, generally, you don't know the X spectrum, you can also compute it by some triangulation of the Riemann surface here. So, today, for this class of theory, Q has a properties that is too acyclic. Meaning that we don't have this self-loop and also you don't have this lens two cycles here. And yeah, so I'll probably explain later. So we also want the potential to be generic enough. So the The name is infinite mutable. No, it's it can be finite, right? Can be finite, right? So, why? I mean, think of this one. There's no potential. Sir, what did can you ask a question again? No, okay. It means that so, yeah, I wanted to explain later. So, you know, the part of the mutation at the very last step, so if you have this pair, you want to integrate it out. So when you want, so means that, so in a mutation, even if you didn't have this pair from the beginning, after you do the mutation, Beginning, after you do the mutation, you might obtain, you might get this pair. So, but you want, I mean, you want to integrate this, you want to delete this. So, I mean, but when you integrate this out, you want to check that it's consistent with the potential you have. So, if your potential is meaning that you replace this arrow by its by its the solution to this equation. The solution to this equation. But if your w is not too special, even if you do this, it will still appear, it stays here. That means you can't integrate this. You can't perform this last step of the mutation. I mean, this is just some generic condition saying that you can always do this. I mean, if you use a finite mutation chamber, of course, you just come back to yourself. It doesn't mean that you can mutate infinite. You can mutate infinite. It just means, I'm not sure whether it's a good name, it just means that it's generic. It doesn't stop you from doing the last step of mutation. Right, so now what can we do after we get this? This VPS quaver. So suppose we have a VPS particle with a charge vector gamma, and you can decompose this in terms of the basic gammas. So this, so we have this vector, we call this dimension vector. So if you consider the low energy Consider the low energy effective theory of this BPS spectrum, you basically get an ink to four quiver quantum mechanics theory. So now, so now in this query quantum mechanics theory, each node corresponds to a Correspond to a UN gauge group and each arrow corresponds to a bifundamental a chiral bifundamental so now the the PPS hilbert the PPS hilt space is given by Superspace is given by the cohomology of the moduli space of the supersymmetric ground state of this theory. Meaning that you want to solve this bifundamental field You want to solve the F term equation and the D term equation so this F term equation So this afternoon equation is just this dw equal to zero for all the arrows. So this is basically creates some pass equivalence. And the D term equation can be translated into the stability condition. Okay. So s uh so we because we basically want the um the zero energy state. So then we will solve this is basically just a constant map. So now we translate this uh into uh looking for the stable representation, stable curve representation. Stable curve representation of the Jacobian algebra. So the Jacobian algebra is the pass algebra of the Q divided by the pass equivalents that come from the F term constraint. Right, so okay. Right, so okay, what does it mean, the stable representation? So if you have a stable representation of dimension n, so that means that for each node, you have a vector space with dimension and A. And for each arrow, each arrow corresponds to a linear map. I also want to solve for the also had to satisfy this condition. This condition from the potential. And so stable here means that for any sub-representation, that is a real sub-representation, and that is also non-zero. It should satisfy the slope. So you compute the central charge and look at this slope. This has to be Be smaller than R. So, remember, we also have this gauge group there. So, that means so we have the gauge. That means, so we have the gauge group that means that we should we only look at the equivalent, so this X representation of with dimension vector n. So that means that we only uh should take the equivalent um uh c equivalent classes of this under under this uh group. Under this group. So, in the end, the PPS spectrum is given by this equivalent cohomology space. So, this is basically the underlying vector space of the Koha. So now for the BPS algebra, the element is inside this space, and the product is this cohort product that is defined by the contributor solutions. So to properly define this So, to properly define this one would take me 15 minutes. Also, I think someone is giving a talk on Koha. And then, the whole point of this paper that I just erased is that for this very large class of the theory, you actually don't need to use the cohort for computation. So, now let me explain how we reached that conclusion. Zero versus zero fish. Uh fashion. So this one has uh this this n is the from here. So this is a charge vector here. So the central charge is a mapped from the from this gamma to the So first if the if potential is zero, then this equivalent uh homology simplifies. Simplifies into the drain of symmetric polynomials. This is a collection of a bunch of variables with sort of, I mean, this is a collection for all the All the all the notes in the query and so this is the symmetric polynomial and now this cohort product Cohort product is just reduced to the shuffle product of the symmetric polynomial. So let's define the shuffle product. So suppose you have a two-symmetric polynomial. So let's call the So let's call the so this is dimension vector n, and this dimension vector n prime. So, okay, so this is a shuffle product. So here's the definition. So it's like you take two stacks of cards and then you put them together and then you shuffle them and then you divide them again into two set. I mean, okay, they can have different numbers. So you have this vector, a set of cards, and then this is prime. You put them together and then shuffle. You put them together and then shuffle them, and then you divide them again. You put the first part, you feed that into the first function, and then feed the second part into the second function. So we sum over all possible shuffles. So this is again a vector. So each sigma A is the permutation N A plus N A prime. But because F and G are already symmetric, so you want to divide this permutation of the separate. So you have some sign that we don't need. And so you have F G. So we have F G So you look at this so this is the this is a sh this S maybe as ready as double point sorry so so this sh this is the um the the variables after the The variables after the shuffles. And then, like I said earlier, so you have F1 NA, and then you put it together with F prime, 1, 2, NA prime, and you shuffle them together. You call this S double prime, and then you divide into NA and NA prime. And then you feed this first one into F, and then the second part into G. To G. And then the information of the quiver is encoded in this additional factor. That's normally they call it fact. So the information requires in the this spec is. This fact is there's some sign that's not important right now. So this is some over A and B all the nodes. And then I and J. So I is from 1 to N A, J is from 1 to N P prime. And this is S A I minus S P I minus S B J. And so this is the number of arrows from A to B. So you see that if there's no arrow from A to B, then this part of the factor is one. So when W equal to zero, this cohort simplifies into the Schuffle algebra. To the shuffle algebra. And then, so we have this shuffle algebra, let's call this SHQ. And then here we can also consider the there's a special sub-algebra called the spherical shaft algebra. I'll call this uh small s. So it's a subalgebra of the It's a sub article of the Shuffle algebram and it's generated by the it's generated by the symmetric polynomial with only one variables. So that means That means that we can define a function for each node. We can define generator a series of generators.  So inside this spherical Shuffle algebra, you can use the Shuffle product to deduce the relations between these e-generators. For example, the quadratic one is easy. The form is also universal. If um so this part is easy, and then the you can also have higher order relations. Can also have higher order relations. So, this part is harder. But basically, this can all be fixed by the shuffle product here very straightforwardly. So, now let's come to the first main result of the paper. I mean, for this, it's not really the same relation, it's just a higher order relation. And then this, I mean, you put in the mathematical and then try to generate the order by order. Okay, so I'll use H to denote Koha. So let's start from a koha of a quiver with potential. So this is hard. So I first look at the I first turn off the potential. I set the potential to be zero. And then this is, as I explained earlier, this is. As I explained earlier, this is equivalent to the Shaufer algebra. So there's no potential anymore. And then this one has a sub-algebra of spherical Shafi' algebra. So the first main result of this paper is that for this class of quiver, so this is a conjecture. For this class of BPS quiver, that's Q. BPS query that Q is 2 acyclic and W is infinite mutable. This is true. So, I mean, it's not easy to see generically why it's true, but roughly, I mean, already you see that it's not preposterous. This is a big, so. If you start from something that without potential, when you turn on the potential, your algebra becomes smaller. And this is also smaller. And so it's not impossible that these two are the same. So now let me explain that what are the evidence that you have that this is true. So I already mentioned a little bit earlier that it's important. This mutation is important for us. So let me remind you a bit what we mean by mutation here. So all these PPS query, they are the mutation class of some two acyclic. To a cyclic quiver. But in general, I mean, the mutation is that if so, you have a quiver. Suppose you want to mutate with respect to a particular node. So you denote this operation by mu A. So for every arrow that involves A, you flip the direction. So, this is the first step. And then, if you have a pair of arrows that go through a so you flip the you flip the direction of both these two arrows, but you also have to add additional arrows from this C to B so that you form a loop. So, this is loop. So this is why that even if you even if you didn't have a pair of a lens2 cycle because it's second step you can create a lens two cycle. So the third step you have to also adjust the mutate adjust the potential. So at last step you want to cancel out this parallel You want to cancel out this pair of errors. So, at this last step, you have to check that this is consistent with this potential. So, is it the last step that impose some condition on the W that has to be generic enough that it shouldn't stop you from doing this last step of mutation? The last step of mutation. So there is this result of some famous result. If the Q is too acyclic, you can always find such a generic enough W. Because we don't like this. I mean, I as you see later, we don't I mean this one we don't like and um so also And so also, I mean, for the class of quiver that we consider, you can always find this. But it's not true that for all the BPS query of the class, it's not true that the query and potential always satisfy this condition. I mean, there's some special ones that the W is also fixed by your class Series itself. So, but we're going to focus. So, but we're going to focus on the generic case. So, this Q is always exactly, we're going to focus on the generic case with generic potential. So, now let's see what despises us. So as explained earlier, that so this is okay, so this is our conjecture. Let's check, let's see how to understand this. So first, if the quiver has no loop. Then that means that the W has to be zero. So I just rewrite that part that triangle for this special case. For this quiver without loop, so this then is the same as so I mean this is empty statement. I'm just drawing this again here. So this is So, this is here, and so from the conjecture, this is equal to the spherical sub-algebra of the Shafi algebra. So, you see then this has to be equal sign. So, it means that the spherical sub-algebra is identical to the full algebra itself. So, now let's check this. Now, let's check this. Let's see how to understand this. So, how much time do I have? Yeah, so if the query has no loop, you can order them. For example, one, two, four, three. You can order them such that all the such that the arrow is always going from the lower number to the higher number. So then you use this quadratic relation to move your generator. So so for this, uh so when there's no loop, you can always use so basically actually sorry let me let me explain the the simplest case of this. So the simplest one is uh So the simplest one is uh a quiver with just one node without any arrow. So then uh you have just so let me drop this uh label A. So the E is this. So there's no arrow. So this fact is just one. So you get this. So basically your coha so uh suppose this has a charge rapture comma. has a charge vector gamma so this koha is koha of this is equal to the shuffle algebra and this equal to the spherical shuffle algebra of this paper and it's just a serious algebra of this bunch of um generators and then you can oh by the way I actually By the way, I actually say that we can compute the character of this algebra. So the character, so as a vector space, it has a Heisenberg gradient. So it's labeled by the charge and the spin quantum number. And so this is gamma. This is the spin. This is um the spin. And uh so the character of uh uh a space as a vector space as Heisenberg uh grading is uh defined this way, gamma n. And this big x gamma is in the quantum tools, meaning that they multiply this way. This is direct pairing of this gamma. The arc pairing of this gamma and gamma prime. So this makes sure that this character respect the tensor product of two such space. So then you can so this is just a serious algebra here. So you assign so each E n has a quantum number Qn plus one. Q Qn plus one. So basically, this character is just the quantum dialogue. So now this makes it easier to see this. So now the cohort of this. The coha of this Q without the loop is essentially just you can the PBW basis of this coha is you just put together of all these individual nodes in the order of so the higher numbers to the to the right so in the order of J decreasing and um And so you can see that this, so I mean, so the character of or the character of Koha is called the contributor spectrum generator. So it's just given by this product of the quantum dialogue in this order. So you can see that this is all just So, all just you put them all these building blocks together, and this is given by the spherical shuffle algebra here. And then, on the other hand, for the shuffle algebra itself, it has a closed form for any for the character. This is Q. So now you can just directly check that the this character of the this uh shuffle algebra is indeed identical to the character of this uh spherical part. Of this spherical part. So, but so this is just an easy case. And now, what do we do for the more general case? So this spectrum generator S is the main properties that is invariant under the war causing. So there are two types of war. So it's called war of the first kind, or war of the marginal stability, or war of the second. Stability or of the second kind. So the first kind happens when there are two charge vectors whose central charge line. For example, in this famous A2 clear So you have two chambers. So also, let me write this again. So the definition of this S is the product of gamma in the order. In the order of the phase of the central charge decreasing. So, for example, this is two, gamma two, gamma one. On this side is gamma one sorry, gamma one, gamma one plus gamma two. Gamma 1, gamma 1 plus gamma 2, gamma 2. So this is the polygonal identity that you can that's very useful to manipulate the identity here. So the second kind is also very useful. So the second kind is defined by when your central chart becomes real. So So remember when the central charge has a positive imaginary part, that means it's particle. If it's negative, it's antiparticle. So if this is zero, for example, when this real is negative. So we move in the modular space. So when it touches here, that means that it goes. That means that it goes from being a particle into an antiparticle. So when it's just slightly above here, it's a particle. And then the z of minus gamma, this corresponds to antiparticle. So, but when you just move a little bit below, this minus gamma becomes the particle, and then the diversion will become anti-particle. Become anti-particle. So the real spectrum, the full spectrum doesn't change. It's just what changes what part you consider as a particle, what other half you consider to be the antiparticle. So this shuffling is precisely what's characterized by this mutation here. And you also have to do some relationships. Have to do some relabeling as well. So this is either B goes to A or A goes to B, depends on whether your real part is negative or positive. Yeah, so this is all. Yeah, so this is old stuff, but we want to use this to go from the quiver without loop to quiver with loop. So as I explained earlier, when you do the mutation, even if you don't have a cycle, a loop, after your mutation, you can get a loop. For example, here. If you do a mutation with respect to this guy, so the mutation, let's say ABC, you'll become so you see that you have a loop here. So now if you have a query with loop, what you can do is that you first try to do some mutation and also probably have to. Do some mutation and also probably have to use this Pentagon identity to massage this a bit. So you go to another quiver, some mutation, that without a loop. So then you can uh so then this part simplified and you can characterize this uh you can write down the coha and as a spherical shaft algebra. spherical sharp algebra of this the new q prime and then uh this is the this then just give you the the original cohort with the with the loop right so uh what we did is that um so So this guy, you can compute wire mutation. And this spherical shuffle algebra, you can compute order by order using some mathematical state. So we check this. Mathematical say. So we check this uh some cases and uh and uh to low order. Yeah, that's the that's the first part. So how much time do we have? Five minutes? How much? Seven minutes. So let's see. This is uh checked some cases. Cases with computer book dialogue for for this for for what one? For what? Uh Oh, this d this is enough. I mean, this is generic enough. This will work. If you start from this one, you can mutate back. So this W allows you to cancel. I mean, suppose you do the mutation A here, you see that you first get this, this, and then a pair here. And then a pair here, right? And then you can check that you can solve this by decreasing motion, and then it allows you to do this. So you get this back. I can write down some example where you can't do this. For which speaker? For the same example. For the same example? Okay. So suppose you start from here. This will be the Q. You want to mutate to this Q prime. So this one has no loop. So. Uh for this example, so so you write down the uh so it's generated by all these small E's. So you have a like E1, E2, E3, where EABEBEC, and you just copy the universal quadratic part. Yes, you get the quadratic relations, which you can read off from the Redoff from the shuffle product okay, so fine defect so happy fires lines so this is uh physically skipped by the frame quiver. By the frame quiver. By framing here, I mean that you have one addition node and also some arrows from this photo node to the gauge node and also some possibly something to pull back. So the statement is that to characterize this, you first consider the koha of this you just consider this as if you have a new query. But then you remember that this new node is frozen. It's not a gauge node. So that means that that corresponds to the fact that you can only Except once. Sorry, which and it's one. So that means that the generator for this for this node, sorry, the character for this node has just this X itself. So then you use this trick, you mutate and then to, I mean, even if the quiver, original query doesn't have loop, you might create a loop just from this new node here, like this. But then you want to do some trick to remove, to mutate, you can also mutate with respect to this, to remove the loop and then carry out all this. All this. And then at the very, but you can see that the reduced version where this dimension vector with this folder node is one. So once you write down the PPW basis, you try to move, you can move either all the old PPIS algebra to either this side or the other side. So then so that gives you a bimodule. By module of the algebra. So different line defects will correspond to different framings and different biomassing. So as a shuffle algebra, you can also first imagine that it's a real, it's another new quiver. And so this is basically correspond to the fact that this spherical, sorry, the shuffle, this spherical. The shuffle, this variable inside this matching polynomial is zero. Yeah, I think I will stop here and for questions.
