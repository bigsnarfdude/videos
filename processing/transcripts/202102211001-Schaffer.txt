Talk a little bit about where this workshop or session idea came from. I have always been fascinated by swirling movements of dancers. As an audience member, as a dancer myself, as a choreographer myself, it's always been of interest to me. And I began looking at how. At how dancers and choreographers put swirling movements together in mathematical terms recently, partly just to better understand what it was that I like so much about that. And so I found a lot of ways to play with these movements in a way that may seem more mathematically connected or connected. Mathematically connected or connected to mathematics. And so I'm going to share those things with you. And I'm going to try to give you a whole bunch of things that you can do yourself or can share with classes you might teach or other people that don't take a lot of preparation. And I am in a space that is pretty large, a garage. Large garage converted to a dance studio, but you'll be able to do this stuff without having this much space. But it will, having this space, will allow me to demonstrate for you some of the things. Now, I put in the chat a handout for this session that will remind you of some of the things we're going to do. And I also put a link for the Bridges background paper. Bridges background paper. The Bridges background paper has also lots of references to the ideas, the circling movement ideas. Carl, excuse me, there's nothing in the chat. I think, yeah. Okay. Oh, no, you probably posted it, but before many of us showed up, so we won't see it. Oh, you won't see it. Okay. Yeah. So I'm. Okay, so I'm going to, whoops. Let me po it's not letting me do it. All right. So there's the handout and there is the background paper. Did those show up? Yes, they did. Thank you. Great. Okay. So the background paper has. So, the background paper has some links to things you can find, especially online. There are lots and lots of references online to this, the doubling circle kind of idea that we'll go over. Okay, but enough talking. I want to actually start with something for you all to do. There'll be lots of things for you to do. And so here is my Mickey Mouse doll, and there's some wonderful mathematics. And there's some wonderful mathematics you can play around with with the doll. This particular Mickey mouse can do three things. Mickey can do a half somersault like that, or a half cartwheel like this, or a half spin or pirouette like that. So there's the half somersault, there's the half cartwheel, and there's another half. Cartwheel, and there's another half, and there's the half spin, and there's another half. And what I want to know is: if Mickey does a half somersault followed by a half cartwheel, followed by a half spin, where will Mickey end up? Facing you or facing away from you? With head up or with head down? Four possibilities. So try to play. So, try to play with this with your hand instead of an object. Our arms have at least three joints that allow motion and actually more if you consider fingers in the scapula. So, again, a half somersault followed by a half cartwheel, or like that, like that, followed by a half spin. Where will Mickey end up if Mickey? Where will Mickey end up if Mickey starts head up facing you? Play around with it and see what you come up with. Any agreement? Back where he started? Yeah. Back where Mickey started. Yes. So now here's a question. We did half somersault, half cartwheel, half spin. How many different orders can you put those three movements in? I know most of you are familiar with this. How many ways can you order those three things? Six, I guess. Six, three factorial, three times, two times. So there are six ways. So, what about other sequences besides half somersault, half cartwheel, half spin? Do they also start and end at the same place? Try one of them for yourself. Explain again what. Okay, so there are other orders. Well, just switch the order. Orders. Oh, just switch the order. Okay. Okay. Got it. Try another one and see if Mickey always ends up starting and ending at the same place. Could you again say the three moves that we were talking about? I didn't get. Those are a half somersault, a half cartwheel, or a half spin. So the half somersault, followed by the half cartwheel, followed by the half spin got Mickey back to where Mickey started. But what if you put those three in a different order? It looks like, yeah, any combination of those, any order, we're getting back. Yeah. We're getting back, yes. Now, here's a here's the question: the next question: which is, why is that? Why are they commutative? Why does it not matter? And some of you may want to explain in terms of group theory, but I often give this to students, adults, teachers who don't have much mathematical background, and they come up with some nice answers. So what's an intuitive answer for why that is the case? Answer for why that is the case. Why is it that no matter what order we put those three movements in, Mickey starts and ends in the same place? Another way of saying that is these are half turns. How is it that three halves make a whole? What are some thoughts about this? I mean, any two would be like the inverse of the other one, sort of. Can you say more specifically why that is? Like, give an example. So if you rotate first. Rotate first and then somersault. That's the equivalent of doing the cartwheel. Ah, so rotate first and then somersault. Oh, I'm sorry. Rotate first and then somersault. That's the equivalent of doing the cartwheel. Okay, other ideas? Other thoughts or ways of putting that idea together? Now you might think about the different possibilities. The head is up or the head is down, the head is facing you and away from me, or the head is facing away from you. Are there ways to put those ideas together? Maybe connecting with what Sarah was saying. Joseph? This does not connect to what Sarah was saying, I think. Not connect to what Sarah was saying, I think. But if you think of the doll as a vector pointing to the North Pole, then you move to the South Pole, and the vector itself doesn't show the spin, but it shows that you come back to the North Pole. Okay. And also, of course, it doesn't matter if you go clockwise or counterclockwise because a half spin brings you to the same place. Ah, okay. Ah, okay. So building off of Sarah and Carl, you know, each, so you have sort of front back, are you facing forward or backwards? And then are your head and feet right side up or upside down? And then you have the right left. So you have sort of three different coordinates you could describe, right, left, up, down, and front, back. And each operation swaps two of those. And I guess. And I guess in total, you know, they each swap, you know, each operation twice. Yeah. Okay, so a half cartwheel swaps up, down, and right, left, but not front-back. Oh, right. Oh, you're thinking orientations, but not front-back. And a half-somersaw swaps front-back and top, top, bottom, but not right-left. But not right, left. And a half spin swaps right, left, and front, back, but not top, bottom. Right now, see, I haven't distinguished right and left by holding one of Mickey's arms up. So you're adding in a complication of orientation, which is kind of nice. So these are the kinds of things you all are saying are what I've had, I did this at something like this at MoMA. I did this at something like this at MoMath recently and had some kids who seemed to be about seven or eight years old, six or seven years old, coming up with these same ideas about what swaps what, what reverses what, what is the inverse of what. And they would say, oh yeah, like you were saying, the somersault, you all were saying, the somersault reverses front, back, and up, down, and each of these other. And each of these others does only one of those. And so, when you combine them, they get you back to the same place. So, okay, there are some fun things you can do with a doll, but what about quarter terms? Are those going to be commutative? So, if we do a quarter cartwheel in this direction followed by a quarter spin, is that going to get us to the same place as a quarter spin followed by a quarter cartwheel? Followed by a quarter cartwheel doesn't look like it, even if I do the quarter cartwheel that way. So, quarter terms are not commutative, and they combine in more interesting ways or more involved ways. And as an introduction yesterday, I showed you all this thing I call the mathematical hello. Let's just try that one more time. We want to. One more time. We want to spin our arm at the elbow, or get our arm with the hand facing us to turn the hand so we can wave hello. We start with the hand facing our face. And if it's your right hand, you rotate it down to your left and then out and then up. And now notice it's turned a quarter turn. We do those one, two, three movements again and wave. Again, and weight. So, those quarter turns combine to give us a half turn without twisting at the elbow. And this is actually important for people in dance to keep track of, but also people who do robotics. For example, if someone designing an algorithm for movement of a robot's arm has the Of a robot's arm has the arm do these kinds of movements over and over again. The arm is going to get so twisted that it falls off unless some compensation is made. And just to show you what happens in dance, this is what's called second, first position, second position, fifth position, and what's called the Russian system. And it's very common for someone to go, and I'm going to mess with the I'm gonna mess with the second position. Usually, the palms face inward in all these, but I'm gonna have the palms face out. Out, if you go from second position to first to fifth, and then bring this arm straight down to second, it's turned a quarter turn. And dancers know that as they rotate the arm down, they have to rotate, they also have to rotate the palm forward to get back to the second position. Back to the second position. But often dancers have different ways of doing that. Sometimes they'll rotate the arm the 90 degrees and then turn the hand forward. And so it's intuitively used, these ideas within any kind of movement form gymnastics, dance, sports, but usually not commented on. So let's Let's think about these kinds of rotations. And I want to get you all, you can do this sitting to try some ways of rotating the hands or the arms. So do this with me. Rotate both hands in the same direction and then reverse the direction. So there are two ways to rotate the two hands. Now try having them go in opposite directions. Now try having them go in opposite directions and reverse that. So we're up to four different ways to rotate the hands. Now, you could call those rotations in phase. What if they go in the same direction, but out of phase? Try moving them out of phase, which most people find fairly easy, and reverse that. Ah, we're up to six different ways, but they were turning in the same direction. But they were turning in the same direction. What if they turn in opposite directions? Is there a way to have them go out of phase or reverse that? So eight different ways to rotate the hands, and we're going to find even more ways. Why don't we try this? If you have space, stand up, and we're going to rotate the whole arms very carefully. The whole arms very carefully. So, if you have space, do this with me. I'll let you stand up and move back. I can see a lot of you doing that. Let's try very slowly rotating the arms in the same direction and together and reverse that. Good. Now try rotating them. Now try rotating them in opposite directions and reverse that. Okay, now we're going to try same direction, but half a circle apart. And when you get here, you have to fiddle with your arms a little bit so they don't hit and reverse that. Reverse that. Very good. But now let's try going in opposite directions, but half a circle apart and try reversing that. I see everybody who's got a camera on doing it, or some are still sitting and doing with your hands. Okay. With your hands. Okay, well, that was fun. Let's try this. What about if your hands face each other like this? Let's see if we can make all eight of those circles. So we can go same direction or reverse that. Okay, what about half out of phase, apart? Out of phase, apart, or reverse that. So there are four. Now, what about opposite directions? Now, here's a trick for getting that going. I'll face diagonally. Just sort of swing your arms back and forth like so, and make that bigger and bigger until they get to the top. So let me do that again for you. They're kind of swinging back and forth in opposite directions. And forth in opposite directions, and we let it get bigger and bigger. Now, my hands are facing each other, and as it gets bigger and bigger, they come to the top and reverse. Now, try this. I find it very difficult. What about doing that and having them half a circle out of phase? If you do it really slowly. Slowly, you'll find that they pass at the quarter, and I'm not doing it very well. There's a funny, fun little trick. So this, they pass at the top and the bottom if they're in phase, but they will pass elsewhere. Let's see, they pass here and here. And here. Okay, something to work on. Here are some other really fun things about circles. Let's just do this with our fingers. If you're sitting, you can still do this. Make circles with your fingers, two index fingers, and go faster and faster. And you may find that they start out going in the same direction. And as you get faster and faster, your hands want to go. Your hands want to go in mirror image of each other. What is going on with the brain? I'm asking a rhetorical question. Maybe somebody knows why that happens. What about if they're facing each other and you start going in the same direction and go faster and faster? I find, and many people find, that they start going out of phase. Why is that? Is that yes? Yeah, Joe. One thing that I noticed, I don't know if anyone else has noticed this. I'm right-handed. If I put chalk in my left hand, I can write in mirror image, but I can't write with my left hand the same as my right hand. In other words, the mirroring motion is so natural that if you just kind of close your eyes, you can sign your name with. Sign your name with your wrong hand backwards. Yeah, so one way of writing your name backwards is to just practice doing symmetric movements with your hands like you're a conductor, and then write your name if you're right-handed with your right hand, and your left hand will duplicate it. I've worked a lot with Scott Kim, who plays around with that idea a lot. So, yeah. A lot. So, yeah, you'll find you can pretty easily reverse it. Other observations before we move on? Okay, let's see. I wanted to ask a question. Yes. So I really appreciate the intuitive explanations of the Mickey trick with the half twists. What's sort of the maybe most concise group theory explanation? Explanation? Well, those three operations are the operations of what's called the Klein four group, one of the two order four groups. And it's the one where each one is the inverse of itself. So each one undoes itself. So it's a nice model of the Klein or group you can do with your hand or a doll. By the way, To wear a doll. By the way, the other order four group would just be, say, quarter turns. A three-quarter turn followed by a three-quarter turn gets me to a half turn. So we can model a lot of group theory by motions of the body in different ways. So let's see. Oh, since you've all sat back down. All sat back down. Some more fun things to do when you rotate one foot, and I'm holding my foot up so you can see. One foot and one hand in the same direction. Now, I'm using right hand and right foot, but can you reverse the right foot, have the hand go in one direction and the foot go in the other? I can only do it if I go slowly. I find it really difficult to do. I find it really difficult to do fast. But try one hand and the opposite foot. And most people find it easy, maybe it's because of that mirroring thing, to do right hand and left foot in both directions. So let me just say that again in case that wasn't here. One hand and one right hand and right foot, I find it very hard to have them go in opposite directions. In opposite directions, right hand and left foot, I can easily do it. Did you all find that's the case, also? Yeah, so why is that? What is anybody know why that would, how the brain works with our hands and feet? Is it what you were saying, Joe, that we can mirror image the left side of our body with the right side? We're very used to doing that. Okay. Okay, so let's move on. I did suggest you bring a belt because the next thing I want to get into is gets closer to this swirling movement idea. So some of you are getting up to get a belt, I see. Let me make my image bigger here. Screen. There we go. So, and I'm guessing. And I'm guessing a lot of you have seen this sometimes called Dirac belt trick, because the physicist Dirac actually used this. He said when he was teaching, if I twist the belt one turn and then two complete turns, it looks very twisted. But now, if I hold the belt buckle going in the same direction, but pass it under itself, it untwists. It untwists automatically. So, again, one twist, two twists, and then keeping the belt buckle going in the same direction, pass it under itself, untwists it. Or if I do that again, I end up with two complete twists. One, two. So, what Dirac was saying is. What Dirac was saying is, you know, if you have an object that's tied down in some physical or metaphorical way, two twists are equivalent to zero twists. In fact, any even number of twists are equivalent to zero twists. Now, that isn't true of one twist. If I twist with it going clockwise one and pass it under itself, it actually ends up with. With one twist. So here I'll twist it one way clockwise from your direction, pass it under itself, and now I have to untwist it by still going clockwise. So one in either, one twist in either direction, they're kind of equivalent to each other. We can also ask, well, how many ways are there to do this? I can pass under in either direction. Either direction, but I can also turn the buckle this way over the top, and that gets me one twist. And if I turn it, turn the buckle again, I get a second, and I can undo that. So there's some wonderful addition of twists going on. Again, what I did a little differently was I turned the buckle 360 degrees as I passed. Degrees as I passed it. Now, you can do that over the top in this direction, or over the top in this direction, or under in this direction, or under in the other direction. So there's a lot of different combinations of twists, but we want to see how that plays out with the arms. And Carl, can I? And Carl, can you do the very first one again where two twists and then you undo it by? Yes. Okay. So let me hold it diagonally. So I twist it once completely around. Yep. And then I twist it a second time completely around. Oh, I see. I was doing my twist all the way around. Yep. Yeah. So now you've got two twists. And if you pass that buckle under, it's. That buckle under it's the and you have to change hands. Yeah, yeah. So one of the wonderful aspects of this is that, for example, if you do one, two, three twists and pass it under itself, you actually get one twist. So there's a parody situation where all even numbers of twists. All even numbers of twists are equivalent in a certain sense, and all odd numbers are. And they add and subtract as mathematically in interesting ways. But we were going to deal with which group this is related, this activity, which group? Well, the group would be Z mod. Z mod, I mean, it's actually just Z mod Z two. The odds and the evens, you could think of it as the Z2. All odds are equivalent and all evens are equivalent. That's one way to think of it. And somebody in one of the other workshops I did said, well, what about quarter turns? Okay, well, they add up too. You still got. They add up too. You've still got a situation where you don't have more than one twist in either direction. So let me see if I have time. Yeah, I'm going to share the screen and show you a little video clip. If I can bring it up, where did it go? Ah, here it is. Here it is. Yeah. Can you see this picture? So let me. So this is a Philippine candle dance. Is it filling the screen? I can't tell. I think there was mute. I think there was music, but it's not showing. So they're doing this Philippine candle dance where they rotate the hand twice around and without with the candle always facing up. So let me show it again. And notice that they start with one hand going around two complete circles, and then they have them go in opposite directions. So watch again. One hand, two complete circles. Hand two complete circles and then two hands in opposite directions complete circles and then they reverse that. Okay, so let's try that with our hands. And you can do this sitting again. We have so many joints in our arms that we can usually do this with the palm facing up. If you circle once around, you've got a twist in your arm. You've got a twist in your arm. And now, if you circle underneath, you come back to where you started. So, what dancers do are more generous, bigger movements, like so, when they're doing these swirling movements. But let's try all of these variations. So, let's go in opposite directions with both hands and then reverse that. And then reverse that. I see Henry is trying with an actual object. Takes some practice if you're using a cup of water not to spill things. Okay, well, what about going not a half circle apart, but one circle apart? So I'm going to twist this hand one complete twist and see what happens when. What happens when they're one circle apart from each other? So, one way to do it is to do one circle with this hand and then try them both together like so. Did that make sense? Let me try it again. Twist. I'm twisting my left hand under and around so that I've got a full twist. Full twist in my left hand and no twist in my right. And now I bring them around together in either direction. Okay, well, wait a minute. What about if they're actually one circle apart from each other? So I'm going to start like this and bring that around. So there Around so they're kind of going apart. Let's see. They're going in the same direction. So I've got to start with a twist in this hand. And I'm going to do one complete circle with the right and then start the left. And notice I'm to make facilitate this, I'm leaning to the right and then to the left. That seems to help. Seems to help. See if you can make that happen. And then you can reverse that. Camellia, I see you've got it. Anybody else feel like you've got that one? Okay. So there are actually eight different ways to do those kinds of things, but there's more we can do with this. I think we are. Do with this. I think we have time. So, if you stand up, I'm going to show you how we can play with this with our whole arms. Now, I'm going to do this really slowly because you're going to have to twist the body in a certain way. And let's just use one arm. If you keep the palm going in the same direction as the movement, when your arm gets around 300. 360 degrees, you'll notice it's twisted one complete turn. So one complete turn without untwisting the arm leaves the arm with a complete twist. Now, usually when people do arm circles, when they get partway around, they'll start to untwist the arm. So if you want to continue making circles, you have to untwist the arm here. The arm here. But if I keep the palm going in the direction of motion, I end up with a twist. Now, how can we get out of this? We can do a circle in back of ourselves. Now do it slowly. I don't want you to hurt your knees. My arm is twisted. Now I do a circle in back of myself and it comes back to the beginning. Yeah, and you don't have to go all the way. Yeah, and you don't have to go all the way around. You can just sort of partly do that twist around. But in reality, what's happening is you are doing two complete turns with your palm facing the direction of motion in order to bring it back to the beginning. Like with the belt, it takes two complete circles of the arm. Now, what about going in the other direction? What about going in the other direction? In the other direction, you probably want the back of your hand facing the direction of motion. So I swing down and up. And then in back, I swing down and up. So it takes two complete turns. Now, here's another way to do this. Instead of circling around this axis, Circling around this axis, let's circle around this side-to-side axis. So I can do one circle to my left and one circle to my right. Try that. One circle to the left and one circle to the right. Nice. Now let's try it with the other arm just for fun. So the circle in front of So the circle in front of your body and behind, in front and behind, but also to your right side and to your left side. Right side and left side. Or we can reverse that with the back of the hand leading. And now we're starting to get into how dancers employ these circling movements. We've circled around the front to back axis, the side-to-side axis. What about the upper axis? Take your hand above, circle, and below in front of you, circle. So try circling above and below, above and below. And below. And dancers and choreographers will actually do this as they turn. And that kind of hides what's really going on. Okay, one more of these, which is, can you do two at once? So let's just start like this. We'll do this easy one where we've got our arms going up and down, and let's go. And let's go in back of our body with the right arm and in front with the left. And then we come back here. And then we go in back with the left and in front with the right. So here we go. Ah, just start by tilting back and forth, make it bigger and bigger. But now I'm going to take my right arm in back of myself and continue the. And continue the circle in the same direction. And now I go in back of my body with the left and in front with the right. Okay, so that was the double circle with both arms going in the same direction. Can we do the same thing opposite direction? We actually can. So if we start like this, but let But let the right arm sneak in back of our body and then come forward. And now let the left arm sneak in back of your body and come forward. And that's equivalent to doing both arms above and below. So let's try one more. Both arms circle above and then below out of phase. And some of you, I see. And some of you, I you can try and reverse that, okay? So, all of those are all of those kinds of movements are used by dancers. And I'm going to show you a few, just a couple of videos of people doing that. I did suggest that you bring that, and we won't have time to do this today, but you can. To do this today, but you can play with these ideas with the movement form known as poi by putting one sock inside of another. And this is how poi artists learn to do this. And you don't want to do this if you've got a lamp up above that you're going to hit. But the nice thing about playing with socks like this is that if you hit yourself with it, you're not going to hurt your socks. Well, a great way. Exercise. Well, a great way to learn the movement form that uses these double circles. And let me show you some video of people doing this. Okay, let's see. So this is this, and these are all from our dance company's pieces. A little hard to see this, but let's see if we're twirling PVC. We're twirling PVC pipe. There's that double circle. And we do it one more time. So we circle twice in order to come back to the beginning. And here is a dancer who's worked with us for many years, named Saki, doing this poi movement with some rope. With some rope. So to her left and to her right, double circles. Then front and back, double circles. And now she'll go to above and below. And one more. Very briefly, you're going to see the kind of swirling motion where we swirl our arms overhead. This is a very short clip, and it's right here. There it is. And notice that the swirling motion seems to propel us into a small leap. And again, this is. Leap. And again, this is a kind of thing you see constantly in dance, where not only the arms, but sometimes the legs swirl around and propel the body forward. Okay, so we did the double arm swings. And just to say, this is all nicely modeled with the quaternions. Can you see my slide here? Yeah, so Euler's rotation theorem. Euler's rotation theorem says that any combination of rotations about a fixed point are essentially equivalent to one rotation. And how can we represent these ideas? People use matrices or what are called Euler angles and axis and an angle or quaternions. And I'll just briefly show you a bit about quaternions. So axis angle, you've got this axis in, and we rotate. Axis in and we rotate the system around it. And with quaternion algebra, it's a four-dimensional algebraic system that really combines a scalar part with what's called the pure vector part, the i plus cj plus dk. And unit quaternions can be used to represent rotations in three-dimensional space. And the usual way of doing this is to say, Way of doing this is to say, well, that rotation, that unit rotation with a norm equal to one, is composed of cosine of the angle in question, the angle around that axis divided by two plus the sine of theta divided by two times the three-dimensional pure vector part. Why do we divide by two? Well, it has to do with the fact that it actually takes The fact that it actually takes not 2π, but 4π in the quaternion system to get back to the beginning. And this is why quaternions make a really nice way of modeling rotations in three-dimensional space. And it's used in computer graphics and kinematics and so forth. So there's, I'm not going to go into the algebraic stuff, but one more idea. Know one more idea is there are a couple of ways to model this with the arms. I can let my right arm be the x-axis or I, and my left arm be the y-axis or j, and the vertical be the z-axis or k. There's my coordinate system, and we can think of what multiplying by the quaternions are going to do. By the quaternions are going to do to the vector, say this is the vector J. And it's complicated how you do the calculation. That is actually going to be the rotation vector, you're going to have to take the rotation vector Q and multiply on the right by the inverse of the vector in question, the vector you're moving around, and on the left by the rotation vector. So it's a conjugation kind of. It's a conjugation kind of operation. But if we just want to see how rotations combine, you multiply the two rotation vectors together. And you have to multiply the first one, rotation Q, followed by rotation R. You have to multiply the Q on the right and the R on the left. So we're going to, I'm going to try and get you all to model this with the arms. Arms. And here's how we'll, so there's the picture. I is going to be a rotation around the x-axis and y or j around this side-to-side or y-axis and k around the vertical axis. So let me stop this sharing. And so we can model. So, we can model I not by a 90-degree rotation like we would in the complex plane, but by a 180-degree rotation. So I times I is I squared or negative one, and there's that negative one or positive one, their equivalent twist. And then I cubed gets me here and I to the fourth. Here and I to the fourth is back to one. So I'm modeling these things by rotating. If I want to do I, I rotate from y-axis to k-axis around the x-axis, but 180 degrees. So i, i squared, i cubed, i to the fourth. I to the fourth. What about J? Well, J is going to be around the Y axis. And so I can do, I want to go from the z-axis down to the x-axis direction. So I want to go this way. Let's see. Down that way. So here is. Here is J, and it's rotated. And I guess I go like that. J, and I have to do the two complete turns, J to the fourth. J, J, if I bring my palm, if I go in the direction of my palm facing backwards, now I've got a twist in my hand, and I have to do one more complete rotation. complete rotation j squared or negative one j cubed and back to um to j to the fourth and around the z axis i have to do those complete two terms so we can actually model the um the uh say i times j well if i want to multiply i times j which is supposed to give you k I've got to do the j first. I've got to do the J first. So I'll do it with my right hand. K, I times J should equal K, and that should get me around to here. Well, let's see. Here is J, and here is I. And that is the same as K. So we can use our arms to do the quaternion group multiplications, which is really fun. If we had more time, Really fun. If we had more time, I would ask you all to say, multiply k times j or j times k and see what happens. But again, let me say again what I'm doing here. I'm rotating from k in this direction, from the z-axis down to the x-axis, 180 degrees, and that's my j. Now I want to rotate the x-axis towards. rotate the x-axis towards the y-axis, the i towards the j, and that gets me to here. So first j, then i gets me here. And that's the same as what we as we write it from left to right, i times j. But if I wanted to do just so if I wanted to do just k let's see, so there's j. I'm sorry, j and then I'm sorry, J and then I, there's I, goes that way. J, I, or K gets me to the same place. Okay, so one more thing that we may have time to do is, and I don't know if you all have paper, but this started with our dance company with sheets of paper. With sheets of paper. We were doing a show that was based on Herman Melville's short story, Bartleby the Scribner, in which Bartleby is a paper copyist in the 1800s. He copies documents and he refuses to work. So we were trying to make a show about somebody who manipulates paper, but he doesn't want to do anything. That's the heart of Melville's story. He decides. Of Melville's story, he decides he won't ever work anymore. And we were very puzzled: how can we make a show about somebody who doesn't want to do anything? And we came up with the idea of just playing with paper. And so we started manipulating ordinary sheets of what in the U.S. is called 8.5 by 11 sheets of paper. And we made an entire concert where we played with. Where we played with manipulating paper. So, what we found was that if we did one complete circle, I mean, we don't want to drop the paper, we have to be pushing the paper and keeping the palm going in the direction of motion. And we had to do a second circle to come back to the beginning. So, you can, it's easy to do this to the left side and the right side, or if you If you flatten those circles out, you find you're doing a figure eight motion. Well, in order to do this first circle, second circle, we can also just do it in front of us with a figure eight. So we were using these figure eight motions a lot, and we learned how to essentially do all kinds of movement with the paper without dropping the paper. Without dropping the paper, except in rehearsal, where it happened all the time. So I urge you to play with paper. We won't have time to really do it in this workshop today, but you can also do the simplest thing is just to do overhand passes to yourself, then try underhand passes, then try to make a complete circle by handing off from one hand to the other or going around and back. Or going around in back of yourself. I'll just end, I think I'm getting close to my time, by showing you a few of the excerpts. And you'll see the swirling motions with the paper. We're not using glue or anything like that to hold the paper. As I said, we dropped the paper in rehearsal constantly, but in performance, we were pretty good at it. So let me go back to here. Here, and I'll show you a few excerpts. I think I have time. This is from the Bartleby show itself, where we were just doing a lot of paper passing.  And here is from a duet that Eric Stern and I did. So Eric and I were the choreographers of all this stuff. And halfway through, you'll see a swirling motion overhead very briefly. And you'll also see us at one point we go down to the ground and instead of doing double a double Instead of doing a turn of the arm, we turn our bodies, keeping the paper itself, and that was very hard. So again, it's just air pressure that's holding, there's the swirling motion, just air pressure holding the paper to our hands. And there's this trick that was very hard to do. And I'll show you one more. That back roll, I can remember to this day, even though it was about 25 years ago, almost dropping the paper in this video clip, but it didn't happen. Okay, one more. And there are double circles right here. Circles right here that are a little bit hidden. Okay, so I think I've come to the end of what I've got. And I know we're out of time. Is that right? That we have another two minutes. Yes. Two or three minutes, yes. I have a few more minutes, yes, two or three minutes, I guess, with my time. Well, let's uh do you have questions, comments, thoughts, ideas. I have a question that it's very interesting that it seems that you use these group structure and create movement. Is that right? Or you just want to relate the movements that you had with some of the group structures. With some of the group structures that you know. And how far we can go with this? Is this just the groups that you mentioned, or we can do this with more complicated groups? Oh, the fact that you can do eight of these. I think that's a combinatoric. I don't know that there's a group action there. I'm not sure that there is. I mean, for example, with SUN or other group structures. Or other group structures to come up with new movements. So that's an interesting thing for me to think that maybe each one of the groups that we are working, we can create a dance model for that group with actions, even if they are having maybe finite numbers at least. Yeah, yeah, no, I think you can. For example, with three dancers, you can do Can do a model the S6 permutation group of three elements really nicely. Do you have a number of dancers to be able to model the right? Yeah, probably so. I mean, you can have one dancer doing three different movements, but you have to figure out what the group action is, I suppose. Is, I suppose. But with three dancers, you can do the symmetry group on three elements, which that group has six elements. So, yeah, you can model lots of group theory with these movements. But if you're teaching classes and when you're finally back in the classroom, I urge you to play with paper with your classes because that's the main prop you see in a dance class. I tend to hand students paper. To hand students' papers back to them like so, and then they'll start handing their papers in by doing similar kinds of crazy things. So that's a lot of fun. Are we out of time? I'm not quite sure. Do we have any other questions or comments? Yeah. I just had a quick comment that, you know, we're doing a lot of online teaching and we're all stuck in front of our computer all day. I think it'd be fun even virtually. All day, I think it'd be fun even virtually to try to get students up and moving. It'd be good for my back and for their back, probably. Yes, yeah, right. Yes, so um, we either teach or take dance classes a lot online. And at first it was very frustrating, but now everybody's in the dance world is very used to that. Um, and so I wonder what's going to happen when we get back in the studio. So, yeah, it does some things to be aware of. Some things to be aware of. Be aware of the surface. If you do a twisting motion on carpet, you can injure your knee.
