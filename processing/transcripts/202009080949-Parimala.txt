  I think we should continue with the next talk by Rahman Parimala, the unramified Brower Group. Okay, so thank you very much, Louis and happy birthday, Andre. We will wait until we get to meet each other to say in person happy birthday. And also, I thank the organizers for this opportunity to speak. And needless to say, I miss the mountains in Bath. In paths. Okay, so let me just begin my talk. So, okay, so whatever I'm going to talk about is a piece of joint work with Eva Bayer. And of course, the key idea in or the origin of this work, the key idea was shared with us by Kuliotalin. By Kolyo Talin. And so let me begin with some definitions. So X is any scheme. And then the Brawer group of X is simply the homological Brawer group H2XGM. And if K over K is a finitely generated Finitely generated field. Then we define the unramified Brawer group of this field over little k to be the intersection of the images of Brawer group of O V. I will say what V is. V is the discrete valuation of K and V restricted to K trivial. All the discrete valuations of this finitely generated Valuations of this finitely generated field which are trivial on K. O V is the discrete valuation ring at V and then take the image and the Bravo group of K. This is an injection. It is the intersection over all discrete valuations. This is a subgroup of the Brawer group of K. This is called the unramified Brawer group. And what is the connection between these two Brava group of scheme and the unramified Brava group? So let me just state a theorem of Cestinemius this is the purity result purity for the brower group for the brower group I mean this is maybe I should say there is a host of results before before Cesnavious results of GABA etc so this is the final form and most general so X is And most general. So, x is a regular integral scheme. Then, the Brauer group of X is a subgroup of the function field. This can be identified with, and F is the function field of X. This is the intersection of the Brouwer group of the local ring at every coordinate. Local ring at every co-dimension one point of x, which all sit inside the function field of the Bravo group of the function field of x. Okay, so this is the co-dimension, this is the purity result. So when you put these results together, we have the following. Suppose x over k is smooth, projective, or even proper, then the Brouwer group. Then the Brouwer group of X is simply, and suppose the function field of X is the function field of K of X. The Brouwer group of X is the unramified Brauer group of the function field over K. So it's a birational invariant. So the interest in this study comes from several viewpoints considering the discussions of rationality for varieties and particularly. And particularly, maybe I'll mention the Braver-Monin obstruction monin obstruction. So, this obstruction is defined by Monin for a variety or a number field. So, variety or a number field or a number field. Okay, so you have a pairing. Okay, so you have a pairing from the Brouwer group of the variety cross. Suppose this is an obstruction to existence of rational points on the variety, given that it has a local point. Xkv is not empty for every V in omega k, every place of k. So you have a local point at all places. So you have a pairing from rava x cross this product to q mod z. product to Q mode Z which is defined by any brower class and you take a collection of local points and evaluate it at psi at X V and you take the invariant at V of this is this is a brow class over K V so take the invariant and sum it up over V this is a finite sum and so you get a pairing and in fact the the set dower sorry X K V Sorry, XKB, the local points for all V, which are orthogonal to the Brava group of X. That means all the elements in the local points which are killed by every sign under this pairing, every sign in Bravo X. This is for the Brava-Manin set. And in fact, we say that if even if the variety has local points, if this Braverman set is empty, then Brauer-Mannian set is empty, then this produces an obstruction to XK being empty. So, this by the reciprocity for Brauer group XK is contained in this product XKV for all V orthogonal to the Brauer group of X. And then this is contained in the local points. And if even if this set is not empty, this could be empty, just leading to this. Okay, this is one of the motivations. Okay, this is one of the motivations for studying the brower group. I mean, not just studying, but maybe getting hands-on elements in suitable elements in the brower group. And so maybe did I say X is a, maybe in this definition, I should say proper variety if I put all the local points. Otherwise, I have to take the ideal points in case X is not projective. Okay, so this is one motivation for studying the Motivation for studying the Brawler group and also the explicit computations. Okay, so what I am going to explain today is a result. I would rather call it a philosophy to derive to use arithmetic information, arithmetic data to obtain algebraic. Information. This is regarding only one particular case I'm looking at regarding the Brower group of or the ungrammified Brower group of Tori, Tori and their compactifications. Okay, this is the key thing I want to explain today. Passing from use arithmetic data to From use arithmetic data to algebraic information regarding the unramified Brouwer groups. Okay, this is the point. Maybe instead of explaining various things, let me just state theorem. Once again, as I mentioned before, all that I say is joint with, this paper is joint with Eva Bayer because with the inputs from Kolya Telane. So this is the statement of the theorem. This is the statement of the theorem. So let G be a finite group and M is a G lattice. Okay, so and suppose we have the following arithmetic data associated to this pair, the finite group and the G lattice. Suppose first there exists a finite group of groups. exists a finite extension finite Galva extension of number fields number fields with the Galva group isomorphic to G and all decomposition groups of L prime over L this extension groups of of I prime over I second this is the condition first condition and secondly if S is the L torus associated to to the G lattice the GABA lattice and the G lattice M Yeah. Taurus X. This is the Taurus or a number field. This is a torus over a number field. Then this torus satisfies Haase principle. So what do I mean by Haase principle? That means every principal homogeneous space. So I will just denote by H1KS the Tamako homology set which classifies all principal homogeneous spaces under S. Under S of the isomorphism. See this local map to the local principal homogeneous spaces has trivial connect. That means every principal homogeneous space which has a local point has a global point with respect to the storage. So this is the assumption on the pair G and M. G is a finite group, M is a G lattice. Suppose there is a finite Galva extension with Galva group G. finite Galga extension with Galva group G and the condition on L prime over L is that the all the decomposition groups are cyclic and secondly there is you take the S torus associated to this lattice M via this ejection then there is Hase principle for this torus S then what is the conclusion then so we have the following if K is any field this is This is the transfer to algebra, any field, and T is a K torus with G action. Rather, I will say with so with the dual lattice with T hat isomorphic to M the given lattice. Isomorphic to M, the given lattice, via once again a sejection of the absolute Galois group onto G. G, realize G as a quotient of the Galois group. And suppose the dual lattice is isomorphic to M. Then the Bravo group of the a smooth compactification of C mod Breva group of K is zero. mod Breva group of K is 0 and if X is any principal homogeneous space I'll contract it as PHS under T and X C is a corresponding smooth compactification then Bravo X C mod image of Bravo K is also zero and as an outcome one gets using various One gets using various results, which I am going to explain now: that if k is a number field, number field, then t satisfies both Hase principle and weak approximation. Weak approximation. I will just explain these terms. Okay, so starting with a data of m and g. With a data of m and g, if you can transport it to the case of a cyclic of a Galaxy of number fields, number fields with certain property, then you have this general conclusion that for any torus or any field with a dual lattice isomorphic to this given lattice via a subjection of gamma k to g, the Bravo group of Tc mod Brower K is zero, and the same is true for principal homogeneous spaces under T. Okay, so this is the main thing. is the main thing. So let me straight away go on to explain a proof of the theorem towards proof of this theorem. So let me set up some notation which makes the presentation a little easier. So suppose y over k, any smooth proper variety and And y kar y bar is y cross k bar over value closure. Suppose we assume that this is y bar is rational, as a function field is a purely transcendental. Then we denote by the algebraic Bravo group of y to be the Brauer group of y modulo, the image of instead of writing each time this quotient, I'll just call this Bravo algorithm. I'll just call this Brauer algebraic. This coincides with the standard notation if y bar is rational. Okay, this is the algebraic Brauer group. And so this theorem states that the algebraic Bravo group of Tc, which is a, we didn't see T C is the smooth compactification of T compactification of T and so on. Okay, this says something about the algebraic group of a smooth compact. Algebraic group of a smooth compactification of a torus given certain data about this lattice. Okay, so first I want to comment. First, this is a result of Freud. One may wonder, the first condition of transporting a given group as a Galois group with some property. This is given to us by a theorem of Freud. If G is any finite group, then there exists. then there exists a finite Galva extension of number fields, which is actually unramified. This field extension is unramified. In particular, all the decomposition groups are cyclic and the Galois group of L prime over L is isomorphic to the given group G. So the condition A, the first condition. The condition A, the first condition in the theorem, one can always have a choice of a Galva extension which is ungrammified. In fact, ungrammatified, therefore, locally, the decomposition group cyclic with the Galva group isomorphic to G. Okay, so let me go on with some recall. This is a bit of recalling of a host of results which. Of a host of results which have gone on towards the study of this facts on Bravo groups on Tori and Bravo groups, etc. etc. So, I'm just going to recollect a bunch of facts. The first one, suppose T is any K torus, then T admits equivariant, an equivariant. equivariant an equivariant smooth compactification Tc so and also if X over X is a principal homogeneous space under T then you get a as a result a compactification take the contracted product over P over. Take the contracted product over P of the compactification, then this is a smooth compactification of the principal homogeneous space. Okay, so this actually maybe there is a host of results in literature on this, especially characteristic k equal to 0, but I would like to quote Pulya Talain. Harari Korobogato for the final statement in any characteristic, the existence of such a smooth compactification. In fact, most of the things I recall, a good reference will be the book called Bravo Growth and Reg Growth. Growth and deep growth is a good reference of what is the title of this book called the Brower Book and Declutical Varieties. So this is due to polyothalane and scorobogeto. So, whatever I say, probably it will be very nicely, even the history of the solutions will be given in terms of how these results were proved. Okay, and the second fact, once you have this smooth compactification, the next, how are these two related? So, if you access the statement is Brouwer group of the smooth compactification of a principle. Of a principal homogeneous space is Brauer algebraic. I have to do a model of the image of Brauer K. This is contained in the algebraic Brauer group of the smooth compactification of T. And if further, if the principal homogeneous space is rational in a finite extension, in a finite extension, extension k of k. K of K which is cyclic, suppose it becomes national in a finite cyclic extension, then in fact the above is the injection is in fact an isomorphism. So I will not go into the details. I mean what goes into this is a discussion of the Gala module structure on PICX bar C and PICHT bar C. Once again, this is again in a paper of Polyuthore. Harare okay, so we have this so basically whenever you're in the situation of X admitting being rational in a cyclic extension, the algebraic route group of the X C is the same as algebraic route group of T C. Now, the follow very important result from Kolya Tale Sansuk. Sansuk. So, how do you compute this algebraic Brauer group of? This is basically the Brauer group of Tc, which is a smooth projective variety, which is which is rational over K bar. Modulo Brouwer group of K. So, this is the object which we would like to calculate, the Brouwer groups. So, this is the theorem of Kolya Kalin-Sansook, which states that, so let me say T over K, K is any field, T O or K is a torus and and suppose T hat is G lattice via the subjection of the it is a Gaga lattice so it goes factors through subjection gamma k to G where G is a finite group finite group and so let me define this following group so Group. So shoot cyclic GT hat. We define this to be the kernel. The cyclic is for restrictions to cyclic subgroup of H2 of G t hat to this is the comology of groups H2 cyclic of G T hat to various restrictions. To various restrictions as G varies in G, restrict to various cyclic subgroups and the class which vanishes when restricted to each cyclic subgroup, this is called Chatou's cyclic G T hat. Then the theorem of Colliotelin-san Silk says that Brower algebraic, the algebraic brow which you are looking at for computing, this is in fact isomorphic to Chatu's cyclic. Of G T hat. So the right hand side is purely a group cohomology. So G is a finite group, T hat is a G lattice, and SHA2 cyclic is defined as this kernel of this restriction to cyclic subgroups. This precisely calculates the algebraic Broward group of a smooth compactification of a torus. This is very helpful in the computations. Okay, so much for general phase. For general phase, now let me come to k is a number phase. And so let me just define for so n is any gamma k module, gamma module. Let me just have this notation i k t k n this is just kernel of the local to global h2 of k n to product h2 Product H2KBN for all places. Okay, this is the notation which we use for tori as well as the dual lattices. Okay, what is the first statement about number fields which I want to quote? Okay. Okay, so we are interested in suppose T is a K torus and T hat is the G lattice, so the G lattice via a subjection gamma k to G. Then this group SHA2 and let us assume. And let us assume that suppose k prime over k so the GABA group of that is the k prime is the fixed field for this kernel. Suppose this is GABA group is G where K prime is a finite extension of K over which the module becomes trivial and then we have that sharp to so we have the following condition this is maybe it is the fourth one. This is maybe it is the fourth one. Suppose this extension k prime over k, this is a finite extension of number phase gamma extension, has all decomposition groups cyclic. Okay, so under this condition. Okay, so under this condition, then we have this short to cyclic of G p hat. This is what we are interested as to complete the ungram fed brow group. This is isomorphic to just sh 2, the usual sha 2 of k t hat. So, this group can be interpreted as sha 2 of k t hat provided the Gala group G of K prime over K has. G of K prime over K has all the decomposition groups cyclic. So, this is a way to realize the SHATO cyclic as SHATO of K p hat. So, this helps because we have this duality of T Nakeama. So, SHA2 KT hat is isomorphic to SHA-1 KT, the dual. KT, the dual, the human C dual. So you have this duality. So we start with the Brauer group of Tc that is related to SHA2 cyclic in the case of any field. But this can be reduced to SHA2 KT hat if you have a certain condition on the Galva group of the splitting field. And further, this is this SHA2 KT hat is always SHA-1 KT star. Okay, so finally, I Okay, so finally I also want to state the following exact sequence due to Vostokrasensky. So let me just say T over K any torus. I defined SHA sets which measure failure of Hase principle. The failure of weak approximation A of T is defined to be product Tk weak. week modulo modulo you take the dynamic embedding and take the closure for the for the topology on product induced by the topology of the local phase so this is the this is the this group measures the failure of weak approximation for t then the voskers and steques that to at to sha2 cyclic g t hat or g hat for g t hat all are defined as before and then you have sha 1 k t to 0 we have this exact sequence this is very nice if this group the unwrapped this is simply the brouwer algebraic of t c so this group algebraic brouwer group of t c contains information on the weak the failure of weak approximation as well as sha one of Sha1 of the failure of Hase principle. Okay, now I can exactly say the proof of theorem. It says that once you state all these bunch of results together, it's not a big deal how you prove the theorem. So we are given that M is a G lattice, you are given a finite group. This is the data given. M is a G lattice, G is a finite group. So we are given. So we are given L' over L, blah blah blah, the Galois group of number fields. This is isomorphic to G. This is all decomposition groups cyclic. So given data and you are given that the SO or L, the torus associated to associated to the G lattice M. By that I mean the S hat actually is a G lattice via. is a G lattice via subjection gamma L to G. You choose a subjection and through this subjection you get a L lattice S whose dual lattice is precisely M. And we are also given that SHA1KS is 0. The Hase principle fails for, is Hase principle holds for S. Then if you trace back all the things I mentioned, Shaw things I mentioned SHA1 KS is 0 by duality you have SHA2 KS hat is 0 which means that S hat is the same as this is short short this is the same as short to cyclic rather I should put y number field short to cyclic of G s hat is 0 which is the same as because Is the same as because S hat is the same as the given lattice M shotocyclic G M is 0. So this is the information you get about this G lattice M from the arithmetic data you have given. But then you can go on to any field K. So it is easy to see what happens now, any field and T is a K torus and T hat is a G lattice. That is via any subjection gamma k to g. Well, then we know that the algebraic Brauer group of T hat is simply SHA2 cyclic of G T hat, which is the same as SHA2 cyclic G M which we have proven is the so the algebraic Brow group of T hat vanishes. Also the algebraic Brow group of any smooth compactification of Smooth compactification of a principal homogeneous space also vanishes because the subgroup of the previous one. And of course, if you are in the case of a general number field, suppose K is any number field where we are applying this, then because this because of the Voskresenski sequence, because the undraphed draw group is zero, we have that weak approximation and Hase principle called forty. Called 40 such a torus. So, this is the proof. I mean, this is just the proof of this philosophy of transferring algebraic arithmetic data to algebraic setting concerning the unranified brow rope of the torus. And of course, the critical fact, okay, so the transferring G to a situation of a number field with Galois group, I have with just local decomposition group C. Decomposition group cyclics is no issue because of the result of Freud. Okay, so now I just want to illustrate an example to use this transporting data from arithmetic to algebra. Okay, what I want to say broadly is that there is a host of results. I'll just take the particular case of a multi-norm torus. So, this is simply suppose. So, this is simply suppose L is an ethyl algebra over a field k1, k2, kn, ki over k finite cyclic. So, if you and then you have this torus T L over K, this Norman torus for this for this torus for this ethanol algebra, this finite dimensional algebra L over K. So, this is defined by the equation known L over K of T is equal to 1. T is equal to 1. There is a host of results in literature on validity of Hase principle, etc., for such Tori in various special situations. Maybe for product of two separable extensions, Purieman. And there are results of Polio-Rapincho. And there are results of Dimash and And dash and V, and our several other results concerning Haze principle for such multinorm tori under certain conditions. But I want to, and also maybe the most very general results are also due to recent work of Masidho. But I want to mention one example from Maya Tinyuli Karimulo. So we just look at the following situation. Following situation. So we look at the following. Suppose L is a product of Kn dot dot dot. So n cyclic extensions of extensions of the field K of degree a prime P where P is a prime. So these are all. So, these are all Ki's or cyclic extensions of prime. I'm just taking one special example from there. Okay, so let us take this and T L over K is the normal torus. Okay, so we would like to say something about the unramified driver group of driver algebraic driver group of this, call this T. This will be the standard example for T C, the smooth compactification. Tc, the smooth compactification. We have to say something in general about this situation. So, what we use is the number theoretic data which is provided by the theorem of Bayer, Lee, and myself. So, what does it say? So, L T as above, multi-nouncorus, and K is a number field. And suppose And suppose k prime over k is the minimal gamma extension splitting t see this is an extension which contains all these subfields for every i and g is the fine this is the finite group Galga group of k prime over k through which the gala action on t hat factors. Galva action on T hat factors. And so, what is the statement? First, and we are always assuming that n is at least 3 in the product. There are at least 3 field extensions. Then, first, and k over k are cyclic of degree p degree p is cyclic. So, in this situation, if n is at least p plus. least p plus 2 n is large then you have and sha 1 k t is here and there are too many fields involved here then the Hazard principle holds for T and if n is less than or equal to P plus 1 and the Galois group of G which is K prime over K this is too big it is not isomorphic to Z mod P Z cross Z mod P Z Pz clause V not P Z it is not isomorphic to this then also the Haase principle holds for G is 0. Okay, there are two cases where blanket there is Haase principle and the final case is if if G is isomorphic to Z mod P cross Z mod P. Here what happens? Here two things can happen. A if some local degree Some local degree degree of k prime over k is p squared. The Galga group, the k prime over k is degree p squared with Gala group Z mod p plus Z mod P. If some local degree persists as P squared, then still Shaw 1 K T is 0. Shaw 1 K T is 0. It still vanishes. There is Haase principle. And if all local degrees All local degrees are at most P that means locally it is cyclic then this SHA1KT is precisely isomorphic to somanicophilus C mod P C to the power n minus 2. This is a very precise calculation of the SHA in the case of the computation is done in much more general setting, but in the case of But in the case of product of n cyclic extensions of degree p prime degree, which are distinct, n at least three, then it says precisely, except in the last case, the sha is always zero. So what is done in the paper is precisely to construct an obstruction group with respect to this et al. algebra. And then, given a principal homogeneous space norm equal to C, then you construct an. Then you construct an obstruction homomorphism alpha c to q mod z and you say that the corresponding homogeneous space has a k point. Suppose x c has local points, suppose it has local points implies x k is not empty provided this obstruction vanishes, provided alpha c is 0. So, this is essentially like This is essentially like we reconstruct the Brahman obstruction, it is the obstruction group and the abstraction homomorphisms. Using this, we have this description of Shah. Okay, now we want to translate it to translation to algebra. Now, suppose you have this case any field. Now it is clear where I'm going. So yellow or k is. L over K is the et al algebra, exactly as we had before, Kn. And K prime over K is the minimal splitting field, G is the Galva group of K prime over K. And T is a, T is T L over K, etc. Then 1, so here always N is at least 3. The first, the algebraic Brouwer group of the smooth compactification is 0. If N is 0. Is 0 if n is greater than or equal to exactly similar conditions as in the theorem 1 and 2. If n is less than or equal to p plus 2 and g is not isomorphic to two copies, then the browser, still the algebraic brow group is 0. And finally, this is the point n is less than, sorry, this is p plus 1, n is less than or equal to p plus 1. n is less than or equal to p plus 1 and g and g is isomorphic to product of two copies of z mod p z. In this case the algebraic Grauer group is exactly n minus 2 copies of C mod P 6. So there are no two different cases here. It's only one case. So how does this how does how do you get this from the the general principle of arithmetic to algebra? Principle of arithmetic to algebra. So let us just translate this data. So T, you have this T hat and the group G, and T hat is a G lattice. Suppose L prime over L, which by Freud, we can choose L prime over L finite galva unramified such that the Galva group of L prime over L is isomorphic to G. Suppose Over to G. Suppose you choose a subjection gamma L to G and S gamma L to G and you are given this T hat call this T hat as for in the jungle setting called this is our M. So if L is the L is S is the L torus associated to M as via this rejection gamma k to G. Sejection gamma k to G. So S hat is isomorphic to M as G lattice. We can choose a torus associated to this lattice. Then by this theorem of Bayer Lee, see we have this that in with conditions 1 and 2, that is either n is too much or the diver group is too big, then we prove that SHA1 i. That SHA1 al S is 0. This is Hase principle for S. Now you trace back all the steps towards going to Abra algebraic. This means that SHA-2 cyclic of GS hat is 0, which means that so because this is locally cyclic, this is SHA1. This is simply Chateau cyclic of Gm, which is just the lattice associated to a given torus. So the algebraic Brouwer group of Tc is 0. See in cases 1 and 2, then this algebraic Brouwer group is 0. And in case 3, what happens? Chateau cyclic of G S hat in this case, this is isomorphic. This is isomorphic to SHA2 because the extension is unramified. This is isomorphic to SHA2SL S hat, which is SHA-1 LS star. But the torus has Hase principle. This is zero always because the extension is Yoki. The decomposition groups are cyclic, which means that working back, the algebraic Brown group of Tc is zero. So in this case, So, in this case, whenever there are exactly the Galva group is exactly Z mod P plus Z mod P and N is at most P plus 1, then that, sorry, this is not enough. So, here So, the statement of Tingu Leap Bayer Leap Arimiha, this is that this Sha1 Ls is exactly Z mod Tz to the power n minus 2. This is a constant. And therefore, we get that in general, the algebraic Brow group of the compactification is always Z mode P Z. In the last case, when it is the Gauva group is correct, then it's always. Gala group is correct, then it's always remote e z to the power n minus 2. So, am I supposed to stop now? Or hello? Yeah, I just about, but if we did a few more minutes, I think we'll do it. Good, thank you. So, you have this computation, and the real, I mean, now suppose that I want to point out this dichotomy. If you use the, suppose K is a number field and you use the Worst Class and And you use the Voskesenski C sequence for this such a torus associated to G and a torus whose dual lattice is T hat. So you have this, the algebraic Brauer group of Tc. This is sandwiched between the weak approximation and SHA Ta1 KT, weak approximation and failure of Hase principle. And this is just SHA2 cyclic GT hat. G T hat. Okay, so the real observation here is in this case, all either T satisfies weak approximation and Hase principle fails. These are the only two things. Either this is 0 and this is an isomorphism, or this is 0 and this is an isomorphism, or T satisfies. T satisfies Hase principle and weak approximation fails. Okay, these are the only two things that can happen. There is no, this is, we know that this group is isomorphic to Z mod P Z to the n minus 2 factors, but there is no distribution among A t and SHA 1 T. It always happens over a number feet. Either this is 0 and SHA1 is the whole of the Z mod TZ power n minus 2 or vice versa. So I'll just Vice versa. So I'll just say orally, I mean, why this happens? Because we know that in this case, by the precise, this is a consequence of the precise computations of bile leaf alumina. So that is in the case. I mean, I say this happens in the case, the non-trivial case where Brauer algebraic of Pc is Z mod P Z power. That is, the Galois group is. Power that is the Galois group is correct and so on. When in the non-trivial case, when the Brouwer algebraic is remote PZ power n minus 2, then there is a precise computation of Shaw 1 K T in the paper. So either this is remote Pz to the n minus 2 or 0. These are the only possibilities for SHA1. If you grant that, you know, the unramified brow group and SHA-1 is either 0 or Z mod PZ. SHA1 is either 0 or Z mod Pz power n minus 2. So the only possibility is that from this sequence, there is always Hase principle for T and weak approximation fails or weak approximation holds and Hase principle fails. There's a complete dichotomy between these two. So thank you very much. I would like to stop at this point. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? Yeah. Go ahead. Yes, is there a question? Is anyone asking a question? No, I don't see any. Here's a couple people with their hands up. You know, maybe I. I don't hear anything. Maybe they can use the microphone. Yes, I will invite them to do so. Is it Ning Guo? No, I haven't raised my hand. Okay. There's another raised hand. I can't PA. It is not a raised hand. People are clapping. Okay. Okay. Yes, I just declared. Yeah, okay. Thank you. So maybe I can ask a question. So is the moral here somehow is that the so if we know everything over number fields and even very particular number fields, then somehow we can tell. Somehow, we can tell what's going on with the Brouwer group over an arbitrary field. Exactly. That is the translation of data. Okay. So are there other results of this type? I'm not sure. I was very excited when Jean-Louis shared such an idea with us in the beginning of the project. I was pretty excited, but maybe Jean-Louis knows better. Maybe Jean-Louis knows better. Maybe he can give some answer. Yes. Would you expect to have results like this when Taurus is replaced by an arbitrary linear algebraic group? Oh, okay. This is a good question. But, you know, the key facts we use about Tauri are, first of all, the Tori are determined by their lattices. Okay. So, and therefore, the whole question. So, and therefore, the whole question reduces to so when you so when I just uh cheated a little bit here, when you transport the multi-norm torus to the case of number field, what happens is you get a torus of the same type, the same multi-norm type as you have the torus you started with because the torus is completely determined by the associated lattice. Okay, so the transported object has the same properties as the original. Object has the same properties as the original one, so you can go back and forth. So, this is the equivalence of categories between Tori and the corresponding lattices of Gala modules. And I don't know, maybe, perhaps, but I don't know an answer to your questions in a way. Thank you. Okay. Hello? Hello? May I say something? Hello, may I say something? Yeah, sure. Yeah, so um okay so I'm sorry I'm fighting with this machine. Anyway, so I don't know how to put the video. Now the point is that the sequence, the exact sequence which you're using, it also, I mean, Sansuk proved it for arbitrary connected in algebraic groups. So I could start the same type of argument. I mean you have this same sequence with a I mean, you have this same sequence with a lack of weak approximation. In the middle, the bra group, modulo, the bar of the constant, and then on the right-hand side, the share of the group. So, yeah, one should think a little bit whether the same argument might work.
