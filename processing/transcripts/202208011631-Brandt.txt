You see it? Yes. Yes, yes, we see it. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you for inviting me to give this talk. I was actually there four years ago, the last meeting that you just mentioned. It was very nice. And hopefully, next time I will be able to come in person. So, what I will talk about today is some recent works and mega simulation of And mega simulation of evaporating droplets and turbulence. And I will first discuss the method, a little bit about the challenges that we face if we want to do simulations with phase change, and then present some of the results. Okay, I guess it's switched. So the motivation is, as I said, want to study flows with phase change because of different applications from geophysical flows. Some geophysical flows, pre-combustion, but also, as was mentioned earlier, drop red carrying viruses. So, if we are going to do simulation with phase change, then of course, what we want is we need to couple mass, momentum, and energy equations. And then we want to be able to solve this for a potentially complex equation of state. Now, in this work, I will consider idealized gas, but we are working for. Idealized gas, but we are working, for example, on mixtures and more complex configuration. And as I will show here, usually it's not suggested to use constant thermophysical properties. So it's important to let, for example, diffusivity be a function of temperature composition. So in particular, what we want to, what I will talk about when discussing the results is the role of turbulence on turbulence operation. And how accurate are the correlations that are now employed to evaluate evaporating droplet? And then, hopefully, I will have time. I will mention a little bit the role of the droplet volume fraction. If I'm in relative dense conditions, what can I expect? What deviation I can expect? Okay, so if I can. Okay, so if I go now to the to discuss the numerical issues related to phase change, then I mean the thing is that one needs to consider compressibility in the phases, even if we are considering, for example, evaporation at room temperature. So if you assume we have two phases, 0 and 1, H0 and H1, which are separated by a sharp interface, The sharp interface, the year we consider sharp interface formulation. Now we know we need to conserve momentum in each phase. We need to be able to transpose color fields, for example, temperature and vapor mass fraction in the case of evaporation. And then we have some jump conditions at the interface where this jump condition is the evaporating mass per unit time, which we need to relate to the Time, which we need to relate to the gradient of the concentration phase and two phases, and then the physical properties, diffusivity distances, and so on. But that's the thing. Now, the thing is that how can we the challenge is that we need anyway to compute the divergence of the velocity field, the local variation on the volume of a fluid particle. And as we see here, even if we can assume that both phases are divergence-free. Have divergence free, so are constant density. Well, in the presence of phase change, we have that the divergence of the velocity field is not zero, but it will be proportional to the mass evaporating per unit time, and then this coefficient is a function of the two densities. And this delta gamma means just that this divergence is not zero at the interface. zero at the interface. So we have a region corresponding to the interface where the diversion is not zero. So in many of the simulations, not necessarily all, but most, we might consider wall-bound domains, so close domains, or for more fundamental studies like the one I will present here, we can have three periodic or shear periodic domains. In this case, what we have is we have In this case, what we have is we have two constraints. On one side, we need to conserve the volume, the total volume. So the integral divergence is zero in my volume. On the other side, because I want to simulate consistently phase change, then I have that locally the divergence is not zero. So and so how do we solve this? Well, we need to relax the assumption of zero division. Relax the assumption of zero divergence for the velocity field of the two faces and go back and obtain the divergence of the velocity field from its definition. So, from the material derivative of the density. So, we just follow the relation of density of the different fluid particles. And in order to solve this, then we will need an equation of state for the densities of the two phases. So, this means that we require a compressible formulation, at least in one of the two phases. At least in one of the two phases, here we will consider drop evaporation, the liquid will be incompressible, but not the gas. Okay, so now if we want to do simulation for a fully compressible fluid, or assuming compressible fluid, well, then we need to transport a conserved momentum. And then what happens if we do a classic non-dimensional, we just take. Non-dimensional, we just take the classic non-dimensional form of the momentum equation. Well, then we will have the Mach number appearing once we scale the pressure with some reference pressure. This will have also, of course, a Reynolds number in front of the viscous terms. The problem is that when Mach goes to zero, where most of our applications are, for example, I mean, if you're going to say evaporation and ami and condition, but also if you think about Also, if we think about fuel evaporation, well, then this pressure time is ill posed. And we suffer because we will have a strong restriction on the time step, because the time step will be version of the Mach number. We have this so-called acoustic time step restriction. So, to circumvent this, we can follow this very old work by Bigil and Western, which proposed to scale the Which proposed to scale the pressure as P minus some reference thermodynamic pressure divided by rho u squared in a classical sense, where this thermodynamic pressure is a function of the condition in our simulation, so it's related by an equation of state to the temperature and density in the system. Oops, sorry. Distance. So, if you do this, then we will have that the Mach number disappears from this from the regional state. So, we kind of remove this mass, this restriction on the time step. Of course, we also need an equation for depression then. And this can be obtained now as by combining observation of mass here, the first equation, and the second equation, which is now conservation of the Is now conservation of the total energy of the system, to the internal energy, when now the Mach numbers will appear, and now this will not pose problems. Now, these two can be related by noting that one can express the pressure as a function of density and energy, right, via some thermodynamic relations. So, where here this gamma and xi are just thermodynamic variables as x. Variables as introduced here. So, if you combine equation four, the two equation four with this definition of internal energy and the different thermodynamic derivatives, we will obtain an equation for the pressure, where you see you have Mach number times material derivative plus the divergence. There you have again the Mach number in front of this dissipative term, dissipation term, the dissipation, and then we have heat transfer and. And then we have heat transfer and the time the radio of the pressure. Now, there are two ways to solve this system that appears here. One is the so-called all-Mach methods. And they work for a Mach number, because now the question are well posed for any Mach number, we have no strong restriction. The problem is that if there are shocks, strong discontinuities in the system, then one needs. system then one needs to pay attention so but in for the application we're interested in shocks are not relevant or one can take an expansion for machine to zero and recover this classic zero mach methods so that the mach number goes to zero if you assume mach number going to zero then we will solve this system of equation now this is this is written for a single phase flow where we are conservation of momentum Where we are conservation of momentum. Then we have an equation for the thermodynamic pressure. The benefit is zero. Then we have the same equation for the pressure we had in the previous slide, where now the times with Mach will go to zero. And then we have conservation of energy. In this case, what we have is that dependence on Mach number is removed. We are in the limit of Mach being zero. And then numerically, there's an advantage because we have an equation for pressure, which is which can be obtained as a pressure can be obtained as a Poisson equation. And we have a lot of fast solvers for this, for example, FFT base, if you have regular domains. Then, I mean, what we pay is that now we have basically two pressures. One is the thermodynamic pressure. Thermodynamic pressure, just some of the reference pressure for our system, and then we have the perturbation pressure P, which is used now to enforce the constraint on the divergence of the velocity. In the case of multi-phase flows, then this can be extended directly. In this case, of course, if you have multi-vest flows, we need to consider compressibility for. Flows, we need to consider compressibility for two reasons because we can have phase change the interface, and that's what I mentioned before. We need to be able to impose non-zero divergence interface when there is phase change, but there is also change in the gas density due to variation in pressure, temperature, and composition. So, what we will solve here now for the results that we present, basically we have an equation for H, where H is the facing. For H, where H is the phase indicator, so we transport the phases with the local velocity plus the addition of the term to account for evaporation. We have conservation of momentum where this F sigma is the interfacial force that will act the interface, which we see is scale with the Weber number, as we have in the previous talk a lot about. Then we have conservation of energy or an equation for the temperature. Or an equation for the temperature, where we have, of course, an additional term production of heat due to the phase change. Basically, you have the lattice heat, which is released or absorbed by the system when there is condensation of evaporation. Of course, if we are going to start evaporation, we need to track the vapor, the mass function of vapor of the evaporating liquid in the inner gas. So, this is classical. Gas, so this is classical transport equation, and then we need to estimate the evaporation rate, the mass per unit time, which we relate to the gradients of the vapor concentration at the interface. So, once we have the evaporation rate, the mass permit time, then we get the expression for the divergence of the velocity field at the interface. Okay, in this way, we are showing. Uh, okay, in this way, we are sure that we ensure mass conservation of the compressible phase, and then numerically we can be rather efficient and perform a large-scale simulation inturance within a reasonable time because this weak, the equation for pressure that we use, that we use for a correction can be solved with some fast solver. Um now there's one thing we need to notice that I mentioned only quickly so far is that okay we transport H, so the interface between the two faces, but strictly speaking, this doesn't guarantee conservation of mass and not the correction correction step does, because they guarantee basic conservation of border. So if we want to be sure we conserve mass, then we need to obtain the thermodynamic trait. Need to obtain the thermodynamic pressure with the use of an equation of state, for example, ideal gas, to be assured that we conserve the exact mass of the gas. And this we do by basically computing the integral of the mass in our domain, to the integral of the density over in the volume, over the volume of the conventional domain. So if there is no change, this should be constant. But if there is change, then we. But if there is change, then we can obtain the mass at the new time step basically adding or subtracting the evaporating, the total evaporating mass from the previous one. Now that we have the total mass of the gas phase and we have an equation of state for the gas, then we can compute the thermodynamic pressure Pt, which is basically obtained from this equation of state, integrating over the volume. Integrating over the volume. Okay, then, as I said, mentioned before, when we're going to solve this equation, we do a pressure correction step, then a prediction velocity, then we solve a Poisson equation for the pressure, which allows us to impose any divergence we want, and then we obtain the final velocity, velocity of the next time step, where of course, now the divergence of the velocity is not zero for. The velocity is not zero for different reasons. One, at the interface, we have phase change, but also we have variation of the density of the in the gas phase because we may have variation of the background pressure. For example, you have a closed domain and there is evaporation and significant evaporation, then, of course, the gas will be compressed because it needs to stay within its initial volume. Then, if you have changes, Then, if you have changes, if there are changes of temperature due to the effect of light and heat, this will also induce variation of the density of the gas. And similarly, if you have a variation on the concentration of the vapor phase, we have variation on composition, and then will also be in principle a variation of density. Okay, this is the algorithm is not so important. Algorithm is not so important. We can skip now the evaluation part and start with presenting the results. First set of results: we looked at finite size evaluating droplets in compressible homogeneous shear turbulence. This was published not long ago. The idea here is to consider now the dilute regime. So, better you have three, four droplets within the computational domain corresponding to a volume fraction of 0.1 percent, so very low, or we can consider the droplet. Or we can consider the droplet droplets as isolated. And now we change the temperature of the gas, and we want to investigate how good is the approximation on the vibration rate that one obtains if neglects some effect, for example, vibrational on thermophysical properties. Then we want to investigate the role of the droplet size and the role of droplet deformation. So we do this interface. So, we do these interfaces of simulations based on the sharp interface method, in particular the volume of fluid method. And then, as I explained, we couple this with the weakly compressible approach. So, in particular, the case of in the limit of zero Mach number. Here we see, for example, the density for the case of an evaporating droplet in turbulence. Okay, let's In turbulence, okay, let's okay. So, so the configuration is a homogeneous shear turbulence, and we chose this because there are no walls, so for the moment, it's simpler. And the turbulence is self-sustained because of the background shear, and there is no need to external forcing which might alter or interact with the tracking of the interface. Oops. And then when choosing the computational setup, When choosing a computational setup, these are the parameters. Basically, the idea was to use parameters for pentane in dry air at relatively high pressure, 40 bar. And this is mainly done in order to limit the density ratio to something about 15, 13 here. These are different non-dimensional parameters which characterize the system. As you will see, there are different parameters, print number, schmidt number, Stefan number, which quantifies the importance of the letter. Which quantifies the importance of the latent teeth, and then that the ratio between the different properties of the two species. So, for example, container. This is the details of the computation, this is the resolution, and yeah. And to be able, not just a note, to be able to simulate properly the evaporation, then we will have a resolution of about 64 click points per proper day. Flip points per proper diameter. Okay, these are non-dimensional numbers. We buy the Reynolds number, and by doing this, we change the Gomogorov scale. So we talk about variation of Reynolds number also in terms of variation of the droplet size. So lower Reynolds number, higher Komogorov length. So we will have relatively smaller droplet d over eta 10. But if we increase the Reynolds number, the Komogorov scale decreases and then we have droplets which are larger in Komogorov units, 21 in this case. Units 21 in this case. Then we change the Weber number, and then we change the temperature of the gas here scale with the critical temperature of the liquid. Okay, this is a visualization now of the mass fraction of the vapor field. And you see this isolated droplet. You see also that the deformation is quite limited for the lowest vapor number, we consider 0.1, which is Which is meant to mimic conditions for evaporating fuel. So, the first thing we did is to consider different models. CP, basically we assume constant properties. So, the physical properties are evaluated at the beginning of the simulation via this one-third rule, which is classically used in simulation with evaporating droplet, point-particle simulation mainly. Stimulation mainly. Then we'll have stimulation with the uniform properties, except for the gas density. So we allow the density changes in the gas phase, but not diffusivity and viscosity, for example. And then the third model to be the full, complete one where we allow a property to vary. And this is expected to have an effect because we just estimate, we know that the evaporation rate goes as the density time. The conversion rate goes as the density times the diffusivity of the liquid species in the gas. And we know that now the density goes as one over the temperature, where the diffusivity typically goes as the temperature of the one out, 1.5. That means that we expect this to grow as the square of the temperature. And the other thing we do is we compare the evaporation rate we obtain against available experimental correlations. Correlations. Here we can see we use this expression here based on this Dankoure number following this frosting Rand's mascher correlation, which are maybe the most used when looking at models of evaporation. So these are the results now. These are results at high temperature. This is D squared, the diameter squared of the droplet, versus ti, scale with the diffusive time scale. Scale with the diffusive time scale. And what we see here is now the constant property model is the black line, red is the full model, and green is the model when we only allow the density to change. And what we see is that constant property with the properties evaluated with this one-third rule, so with some average properties, is quite close to the full model. So it's a good model, good representation of the full model. And it's also relatively similar to. Relatively similar to these lines here, and these lines are the prediction from the correlation in literature. That we just because a correlation in literature provides the slope of this curve, so we just represent it here to show that more or less we are close to the prediction in the literature. But if we then only allow the tendency to change, then we see that this is the result. The result obtained, but you see, it is quite different from the other one. Okay, if you now go to a lower temperature, like room temperature simulations, then we see again that the one-theard rule works quite well compared to the full simulation. If we just vary the density with temperature and so on and pressure, we see that we are not consistent. So we introduce some error. Now, if we look at the Now, if we look at the dotted lania, which are the predictions from the theory, we see that they are quite far from what we obtained. So, this may be not unexpected because all these correlations have been obtained for experiments with fewer experiments at high temperature. So, if we want to extrapolate and use this correlation at lower temperature, like for example, people did now recently examine. If we examine evaporation drop evaporation in the case of virus spreading, then of course these correlations are less accurate. Now, let's move on to the size, droplet size. As we said, we change the size by changing the Reynolds number. This is basically under assumption that the large scale will not affect. Will not affect this process and this evaporation and this mixing is kind of dictated by what happens around the size of the droplet. So we see now basically black is the Lorentz number, so it's the smallest droplet. The orange is the large Lawrence number, large droplet, and we see that there is an increase of operation rate with the Rate with the Reynolds number the Reynolds number, so the faster decrease of the size of the droplet. And this is because there is an increased gradient of vapor at the surface, and this is because there is a larger mixing of chronoturbulent site. Now, what we show here is the evaporation rate normalized with the evaporation rate a stagnant condition, so in absence of flow, minus one, and we see. Minus one, and we see that in any case, even when you have high temperature and relatively fast evaporation, we see that the presence of turbulence increases in the evaporation rate. We have a significant increase order one order of magnitude at low temperature and big droplets. But still, if you go to high temperature and smaller droplets, we still see an increase due to the turbine. Increase due to the turbines, which was something that was, I mean, not questioned, let's say, in the context of fuel evaporation. Okay, here we see the temperature of the liquid at the interface and on an average. And we see that here in this case, we have two computing effects. We have cooling evaporation because when Evaporation because when there is evaporation, there is it is absorbed. But then, for when it comes to the liquid, they're also eating from the hot gas outside. And then we see here that for high temperature, the region values are larger for the droplet, for the large droplet. Instead, for low temperature, the liquid temperature is lower for the largest droplet. So, this is just given. The largest drop. So, this is just given by balance between those two effects. So, if the evaporation is fast, then cooling will be more important. If there is lower evaporation, then there is more time for the heat from the gas to be absorbed by the liquid. Let's consider now dropping deformability. If we're going to consider dropping the formability, basically what we have done is increase the Weber number from 0.02 to 01 by a factor of five. Again, this is the Again, this is the theoretical curve basically based on this empirical correlation, actually. This is the slope predicted, and this is now the slope when increasing the Weber number. And what we see is that if we increase the verbal number, we increase the formation, then we have a fast evaporation. Now, here is at large temperature, on the right here is at lower temperature, and we see that the decrease of aberration that we Decrease evaporation that we see here with deformability is more pronounced at lower temperature. So, here on the right side, and this is because, as being the evaporation slower, there is more time for the deformation to act. Again, we see that if you compare with theory, high temperature is not so bad, what correlation we have now, but a low temperature, the theoretical curve will under predict the reality. Under predict the real evaporation rate, the one observed in the simulation. I don't have so much time, and I can skip this. This is just a ratio of time scale to show that when we have low temperatures, lower evaporation, then there is this factor goes below one, so there is more time for the deformation. Okay, this is a joint PDF to show that there's a positive correlation between. There's a positive correlation between the curvature, region of higher curvature, and region of the strongest evaporation. But this is more evident at lower temperatures. And higher temperature evaporation is relatively fast, so that there is not so much correlation with the evaporation. Okay, I think I need to close. We don't have time to talk on the effect on volume fraction. The main message here was that once you have many particles, Have many particles, many droplets, like in this configuration here where we have 7.5 percent volume fraction. This assumption in the absence of flow, you see that there is no linear behavior as predicted by the theory of this square row, but there will be a saturation. And this saturation will depend on the temperature. So, for high temperature, the saturation will kick in later, but if you have low temperature, then we will have a quick saturation. So, if you Saturation. So, if you want to consider the effect of volume fraction in new models, then we will have to consider this deviation from this d-square row, from this classical d-square row, not only a function of alpha zero, the volume fraction, or the initial volume fraction, as we see here, but we need also to take into account the temperature variation. Because at low temperature, the saturation will be So, it will become important much earlier. Okay, so I guess maybe I can put up this slide with the conclusions and then leave some space from some work, from some questions. These are the three effects we studies, effect of Reynolds number, the precise, effective deformability, and then effect on volume fraction. And some of these were already published this year, but not the effect of volume fraction, I would say. I would say. So, yeah, thank you very much. Let's see whether I can. Thank you, Professor Brandt. We have time for a few questions, and then we'll move to the next talk. Questions from the room or from the audience on Zoom? Very nice talk, Luca. I have a question, moderator, if you have a moment. Yes. Sorry? Go ahead. Sorry, go ahead. I said very nice talk. I just said I have a question of the moderator. Yes, sure. Go ahead, Shankar. Thank you. Yes. So, Luca, this is very interesting because we ran into a similar problem trying to simulate a more industrial problem, evaporation from a wet granular mixture. So, I really appreciate your pointing out the importance of the compressibility in the gas phase. Right. I didn't understand a couple of things that might have just. Understand a couple of things that might have just been my slowness. Could you explain again what your T sub C is, which is your reference temperature for defining high energy? It's the critical temperature of the liquid phase. Okay. So the gas is hot, but and that's the temperature of the gas. And but the liquid is anyway colder and that's anyway it's below critical condition. But then we we yeah, we don't initialize the Yeah, we don't initialize the temperature of the gas with the critial condition of the of the fuel of the penthane. Makes sense. Okay, okay. And I guess I had a little bit of difficulty understanding the evaporation behavior changes between that ratio Tg0 by Tc for the D squared law. Would you mind just explaining that piece again? I mean, the evaporation rate is similar. Okay, let's see. The evaporation rate is similar, okay. Let's see, right, for example, here. I don't know, uh, yeah, that one, I think, yeah, these, yeah, yeah, not before the deformability yet. In a way, this is the relation of the diameter square of the droplet. Actually, this is in principle is an average between the four or five droplets in the simulations. And we, yeah, we just followed this square. And then, if you in the literature, we have this empirical prediction. Empirical prediction, which will just give you the slope of this, which we represent there with this dashed line. So, just we try to compare what we see here because here in this motion, there is an initial transient, and then more or less we see some kind of linear behavior, which is something one can obtain the theory if they have isolated droplets. And then we try to see how good are how far are the simulation from this empirical correlation. Yeah, from this empirical correlations. Well, this empirical question probably obtained with smaller droplets, but not as big like 20 Komogorov scale, but I mean, it seems anyway to be close enough, at least for high temperatures, because they were mainly measured for fuel and few sprays. So, I guess in at high temperature and high pressures. Luca, just a quick clarification: your liquid phase panting, you made the assumption about incompressibility to use the projection method, or you could have chosen a fully compressible solver to avoid this. We do, I mean, we do incompressible. I mean, we do incompressible the liquid, but we could we could have we compressible. We could have weak compressibility there also. In fact, actually, now we are working, we are trying to do similar things for mixtures. And in that case, I may have two species, maybe one is more volatile. And in that case, we have variational density in the liquid with composition. So in principle, this is fully incompressible in the liquid, but now that you're doing mixtures, Now that you're doing mixtures, we can change the density of the liquid with the composition if one, the two evaporates much faster. But actually, then looking in say tables, it seems that if you have a mixture of fuels or biofuels, then the volatility is not so different. But in principle, we can have some compressible effect also in the liquid phase. Well, thank you, Luca. More questions from here or from Zoom? Here or from Zoom? Let me quickly check if there is any question on Zoom. Okay. You can unmute yourself if you.
