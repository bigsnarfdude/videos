Brooding and so I'm focused on the vascular system here. I'm not sure if I push the right buttons, the left buttons. Oh, okay, okay, it's very sensitive. Wow. There we go. Okay. What is going on here? This thing is going crazy. Okay, it's just sweep and push. Push. Okay, so Okay, so the microcirculation consists of the very tiny blood vessels that are throughout our whole body, and this is a set of pictures actually from Valentin Djonov in Switzerland scanning EMs of the microcirculation of various types of various species and tissues, so the mouse heart, chicken eye, mouse mammary gland, and mouse kidney. And mouse kidney, and you can see that there's a degree of organization there, but very distinctive structural factors, features, and some degree of randomness as well. So, this raises an immediate question, which is how are these structures generated? And a key point that probably has already been mentioned here, actually, both Boba and Thomas yesterday have introduced many of the key concepts here. Key concepts here. So, Poisson's law tells us that the flow, for a given pressure gradient, the flow in a cylindrical tube goes it's the fourth power of diameter, which means that flow distribution is very sensitive on diameters. Or to put it another way, if you want flow to be appropriately and efficiently distributed, then diameters have to be very tightly controlled. And another feature of the Vascular system is that the diameters cover about four orders of magnitude from microns to... Of magnitude from microns to centimeters in diameter. And then the diffusion distance, as I already announced yesterday, the diffusion distance for oxygen into oxygen-consuming tissue is somewhere in the range from 25 to 100 microns, depending on the situation. 100 microns is the thickness of a human hair. So that means that there has to be a blood vessel bringing oxygen within that distance of every point in the tissue. And that is the fundamental reason why we need a microphone. Reason why we need a microcirculation. And you could also say, well, what should be the structure of a network that would be very effective in delivering oxygen? And your first thought might well be that some kind of a mesh structure like this would be very good. But actually, that's very bad. I mean, it's very good for diffusion distance, but it's very bad in terms of the energy required to pump the flow because you do not want to be pumping blood flow continually through tiny vessels for the reason. Tiny vessels for the reason that the flow resistance is extremely large. So, for efficient convective flow, what's needed is a hierarchical structure. And interestingly, if you look in textbooks, you'll see pictures of the circulation. And sometimes you'll see a picture like this, sometimes you'll see a picture like that. And actually, neither of them looks remotely like the actual circulation. And partly that's because the real situation has to be. That's because the real situation has to somehow combine both of those things. This structure has to be dynamic, it has to be capable of continual adjustment, both on short times due to flow regulation when you run up the stairs to the dining room, and on the other hand, when blood flow increases to your legs. And on the other hand, if you do that every day, then you'll build up muscle mass and you'll need a structurally different vascular system. Structurally different vascular system to deal with that. Also, the number of vascular segments is huge. It's somewhere in the range of 10 to the 9 to 10 to the 10. So the concept that the structure of the vasculature is somehow genetically determined on the individual vessel level cannot possibly be true. There's not enough information to do that. So the question then is how, it's still the same question. How is this structure generated? It must be a self-organizing structure where each vessel responds according to a generic set of rules. You could also say, Genomics and it rules. You could also say where each cell responds, and of course, then the emergent behavior of those cells gives vessel behaviors, and the emergent behaviors of those vessels gives the systemic response. So in a way, what I'm talking about today is an attempt to uncover what these rules are by means of developing mathematical models. Oops. Oh, that works. Okay. It went too far here. Okay, so Poisori's Law, I already mentioned. And now, okay, so there's mention of optimality, and I'll say right up front: optimality is a double-edged sword. It is a very useful conceptual tool, but pushed too far, it leads people astray, in my opinion, in many, many cases. Anyway, so Murray, almost 100 years ago, asked the question: let's suppose that we have to. The question: Let's suppose that we have to bring blood from point A to point B, and we know how much we know that there's a certain flow rate Q. What should the diameter be of that vessel? Now, on one hand, there's some energy required to do the pumping, and the amount of the energy requirement is the flow rate times the pressure drop. So, if the flow rate is fixed, you want to minimize the pressure drop, which means make the resistance as low as possible, which means make the diameter as large as possible. So, according to that, you should. Possible. So, according to that, you should just have a gigantic pipe. But obviously, that's not, that has its own cost. And so, Murray's idea was, well, there is a cost to maintaining and providing the blood. So, he devised the cost function, which is the sum of delta P times Q, which is the rate of energy dissipation, and B times V, where V is the volume inside. V, where v is the volume inside this tube, which is just the cross-section times the length. And it turns out it's a nice bit of calculus if you do go through that and then say for what value of diameter D is that minimized, where you have this relationship between delta P and Q, and you find out that the minimum occurs for a diameter whose cube is proportional to the flow rate. And so this is the so-called Murray's law, where the diameter. The so-called Murray's law, where the diameter, well, we could say where the diameter goes is the cube root of the flow rate. And then the next question is: well, that's nice, but how could such a situation be achieved when there is not some master planner telling every diameter what it should be? And the answer to that is that all shear stress is given by this formula. Well, of course, polymology is more. Well, of course, blood neurology is more complicated than that, and anyone who knows my work might know that there's more to a story. But just for the moment, let's just say that blood has a viscosity eta. Then the wall shear stress is given by this formula, where you see the ratio Q over DQ appearing in this. So according to this, if wall shear stress is maintained at a constant value, then that optimality principle is satisfied. So this has been very influential. So this has been a very influential concept as far as understanding the structure of the circulatory system. So this paper, which I have to admit, we were pretty far into our work before we found this paper from 1975, at least we've made it into the second half of the 20th century now. He put forward this idea that diameters are controlled structurally in terms of a feedback loop based on wall shear stress. In other words, that there is some set point for shear stress, and that if for some biological reason flow increases in a given segment, then that increase in shear stress causes growth of the vessel's diameter. He put it in terms of drag and caliber instead of shear stress and Instead of shear stress and diameter, but that's you can follow that. And so, this idea, I would say, up to about the mid-1970s, this was the state of the art, maybe even until the early 1980s. But actually, this has obvious failures, and Murray's law has obvious failures as well. First of all, if you look at veins and arteries that are supplying a common region, then invariably the vein is larger than the artery, and the shear stress. Than the artery, and the shear stress is less in the veins than it is the arteries by about a factor of 10. So you know right away that there is a large deviation from Murray's optimality principle, just from that basic fact. And so a lot of this is a work in collaboration with Axel Pries in Berlin over about a 40-year period. So we came up with a revised version. Up with a revised version of this model, published it in 1995, where we made the target shear stress depend on pressure, and that took care of that particular problem. Fortunately, we published that before we became aware of this fact that has already been alluded to quite a bit in the preceding presentations, which is that parallel flow pathways are unstable according to this. By the way, this floor here is equivalent to what the previous speaker was talking about for the case. Was talking about for the case when gamma equals two-thirds. So, this is exactly that model that she was talking about. And so now we are not considering pulsatility here. It is true that there is some pulsatility in the microcirculation. It's variable, sometimes it's significant, sometimes it's insignificant. I don't think that it plays a major role in terms of the microcirculation, in terms of, for instance, maintaining loops. In terms of, for instance, maintaining loops and that kind of thing. So, there is a problem. How can parallel flow pathways be maintained? Because if you start off with a system with multiple vessels coming into the capillaries, going out again, and then every pair of parallel pathways is unstable, which is the back that cuts out the instant from packing, and the phase diagrams and everything that you saw in the previous talk, then what happens? It just decays to a single flow pathway, and I've And the way I say that is that if you want to minimize the energy consumption of pumping of the circulatory system, then connecting a big pipe from the aorta to the vena cava will do the job wonderfully well. But what it fails to do is to actually supply the tissue with oxygen. It doesn't meet the metabolic needs of the tissue. So, what we came up with in 1998 and subsequent work is the idea that. Is the idea that there must be a metabolic feedback where if oxygen levels get low, then that's producing a growth signal that should be included into this relationship. In other words, this relationship by itself, without any metabolic signal, has no linkage to the functionality of what the circulatory system is trying to do, and therefore it can't expect it to give realistic behavior. Okay, so now that that So at that point, we thought, okay, now this is a model that should work. And we had exquisite observations of the mesentery, which is a thin sheet tissue, and the distributions of flow and the matocrit and the diameters and lengths and so on of all the segments. And we try to then say, well, we'll take our model for the dynamics of every segment and apply it to that network and see if we get something that resembles the actual situation. And the answer is we failed this. And the answer is, we failed dismally, and the model did not come close to working. And the problem became fairly evident. That is that in realistic microvascular structures, very often the feeding and draining vessels are adjacent to each other. And in that case, we have short pathways and long pathways, as has already been alluded to. And there has to be some signal that tells this segment that it has a lot of responsibilities in life, whereas this one has Possibilities in life, whereas this one really is pretty worthless and we could do without it. And there is no strictly local signal that will do that job. And it's even worse than that because if you think about shear stress, naturally the shear stress would tend to be higher in that one and lower in that one. So actually, shear stress is working against what you want in terms of getting flow to go to the long flow pathways. So there has to be some signal to this guy here and to this guy there, actually. Guy here and to this guy there, actually, that tells it: okay, you need to be bigger, and this one doesn't get that signal, so that we can get this situation, which would actually be functionally adequate. So, unfortunately for us, this was not totally a dream because conducted responses are a well-known mechanism in the circulatory system. That is, for instance, shown in this experiment of Robert Siegel at Dooley and others in 1915. Dooley and others in 1989, where we have flow going left to right in an arteriole here that branches into two daughter vessels. We observe the diameter at this point, and then acetylcholine, which is a vasodilator, is applied at one point or at the other point. And at the upstream location, we see a vasodilation. In other words, there is a signal traveling upstream. And I could talk more about the mechanisms of that. The mechanisms of that is conveying the signal upstream and telling this vessel to dilate. Now, this is on the short time scale, but also what is known is that when the same signal is chronically present, in other words, when a flow regulatory signal for beta dilation is chronically present, then that ultimately leads to a structural rearrangement in the same direction. So, in other words, that on the structural adaptation time scale, these Timescale, these conducted responses can still play a role. So, in fact, that was the missing element that we needed. And putting all of that together, this is so sensitive. Maybe it's easier. Okay. So, this is the overall model. So, this is the overall model which we applied in networks of the mesentery, where the diameter is getting a signal to get bigger or larger based on S-tot, which is what we call the total adaptation signal, which has contribution from shear stress, pressure, local metabolic responses, and conducted metabolic responses. And then we have this thing called KS here, and we make that negative. And we make that negative. And what that is conceptually saying is that the vessel that does not have a job to do should go away in a normal tissue. So either there has to be a shear stress, a signal coming from shear stress, or there has to be a signal coming from meeting metabolic requirements. And if a vessel is not receiving either of those kinds of signals, then KS should win and it should go away. And that is the Go away, and that is the pruning mechanism, which is actually essential for generating efficient structures. Well, maybe I will. No, it works. Okay, so now I'm going to talk about the brain for a little bit. And this is a particular, I haven't talked about the angiogenesis part of the story yet. So, what I'm going to do now is talk about angiogenesis in the context of the brain. In the context of the brain. So, this is a human brain that's. Okay, I'll give up. Who's this one? Okay, so this is again a corrosion cast. This is the human brain cortex. It's about two millimeters thick. You can see it has a highly convoluted structure of capillaries. These vessels on the top are the peel arterial. The peal arterioles and venules, the pia is the outer surface of the cortex. And then the question is: now, how does that develop? And this is from 1986. What happens, in fact, is that a plexus of vessels spreads out over the surface of the cortex, and then branches from that plexus dive down into the tissue of the cortex and form side branches. And form side branches that then meet and form loops. So we have loops formed there, and eventually leads to a situation like in C, where you have the black are the arterioles and the grey are the venules, and they are actually disconnected from each other on the surface. So that's a key point because in the plexus they were connected together. So there was a potential shunt there that had to be eliminated. And so we've developed a model for angiogenesis and structural adaptation, combining the model for structural adaptation that I just showed you with angiogenesis. And I'll show you... Maybe I skipped the slide there, but I don't know. Because I wanted to show you how that model worked. A manual pointer? Oh, well, yeah the pointer I can manage, thank you. The pointer I can manage, thank you. Yeah, so this is actually an image from the messengery with the vessels picked out. And in this particular paper, which is from 2013, we set ourselves a challenge of could we have a computer program that would regenerate, if we took away most of the vessels, could we then regenerate a network that looks something like that? So the elements of this will be familiar from Thomas's talk. So actually, we So, actually, one thing that's different here is we solve for the oxygen field in the tissue itself. So, we're solving the convection diffusion problem in complex vascular geometry. The colors here indicate the contours of oxygen blue being hypoxic. We then assume that in hypoxic regions, a growth factor which probably VEGF would be the best candidate is generated. That's what this hatching is here. Here, if that goes above a threshold level, then we have a probabilistic generation of sprouts, and those sprouts can then grow. The sprout is preceded by a tip cell, and as I mentioned, so indeed, I guess if you waited for long enough and you only had the width of the capillary to sample, then you would eventually form loops, but it would take an extremely long time. But by having the philopodia that are exploring the territory, The Philipodia that are exploring the territory in front, in this conical region in our model, that has the chance of forming a connection. Once that connection forms, then we have blood flow coming through here, and now that region is better oxygenated, and so the growth factor release is ending. So there is a feedback loop there where if an area is inadequately oxygenated, there's a mechanism not only to expand the existing vessels, as I already Expand the existing vessels, as I already described, but also to add additional vessels. Okay. Okay. Talk about that. Okay, so this is a sample of how this goes. Now, we do give this thing a startup package. In this particular case, we know that in the cortex, there are penetrating arterioles and vanules that run almost perpendicular to the cortex. Cortex. So we set up an initial condition that includes those two vessels. But notice we have this flowing vessel across here. Then at subsequent stages, I'll show you a movie in a moment, but you'll see that connection there, star, star, star, star. Then it went. It went away because it has almost no conductive response. And let's see. Okay, so now you want to see the movement. So here the colour code is according to oxygen levels, but the purple is non-flowing vessels, so that's sprouts that haven't connected. And here I didn't explain, but this is in a hexagonal periodic boundary conditions array. So the idea is that this can represent the cortical structure, and then this is the final structure as it is now rotating. And then you can judge for yourself the question: does this look like the picture I showed you before? Like the picture I showed you before of the electron, scanning electron microscopy of the cortex. And just to show you how it fits together, this is the image you already saw, if I take four of these hexagons and put them together, then you can see that the periodic boundary conditions doesn't just mean that the oxygen field is periodic, actually the network structure is periodic, which that is quite a challenge in terms of the computational aspects of this work, like the second. Aspects of this work, like the second. And now, this conducted response, so I really want to come back to the conductive response. This is my mission in life now as a heading towards retirement scientists is to tell people that the conductive responses are incredibly important for the proper function of the circulatory system and are extremely vulnerable because they rely on the coupling of endothelial cells by gap junctions. If the endothelial cells lose their coupling between each other, then you lose the gap. Between each other, then you lose the gap junctions, and then it doesn't work very well. So, this is a simulation where we just say, well, we're going to decrease the strength of the conductive responses, and it's okay for a while, and then when we get down to a certain point, then the hypoxic fraction, in other words, how much tissue is bad in the oxygen that it goes way up to the PO2 goes down. And you can see what happened. The parts down here get lost because they're on the long flow pathways. And we would believe for it. And we would believe, for instance, that in tumors, the situation is that conductive responses are not working properly, and tumors typically have a lot of hypoxia despite having good perfusion. So here's some conclusions, and maybe I'll let you read them. I think I've already said everything here. Thanks very much. Are there any questions? So, yeah, I guess I'm going to have a couple of simulations. Yeah, it's a question about how to simulate field modules, because from what I understand, they are important from the point of view of link reconnections. Somehow connects to what Stepan was saying, that there's some length scale where the anastomosis happen. Also from what I've seen in experiments, from this formation of blood vessels, these experiments I was showing, that they are hesitating, the cells are hesitating, like exploring the space. Exploring the space and then they go in some direction. So, yeah, that was what we do is define a conical region ahead of the growing sprout and then take a kind of weighted average of where are the vessels within that conical region and create a vector in that direction and include in the direction. So, there's about four different terms that decide the direction of the sprout, but part of that is. But part of that is a pretty strong attraction to another vessel that lies within the reach of the Philip you're exploring. Interconnected question. So this clinical region, in the sense of the position of other vessels, is guiding the direction of growth, or does VH, for example, also have any factor? Example also have any kind of available. Yeah, so VEGF also actually, I already made that comment yesterday that putting, we have it in the model that we can make it follow VEGF gradients, but that doesn't actually help. In other words, going up the VEGF gradient doesn't help us, if you imagine that picture I showed you earlier on, because once we want to connect to another vessel, that vessel is going to be sitting in a region of low VEGF, so it's got to get to there. So strictly going up the VEGF grade. So strictly going up the VGF gradient is not a effective space. In your cartoon, the the vessel the the new sprout, let's say you didn't modify the oxygen fuel like immediately, but after it connects it, I can't. Oh yeah, only when it connects. So only when it's connected to you. Yeah, only when it forms a patent connection. So it has to somehow or other. It has to be, so at this point, as it's going across this way, it's going, see here, it's going down. It actually went out of the high. Down, it actually went out of the high VEGF field to find another vessel to join onto. I mean, maybe I just comment that historically, the experiment of the rabbit cornea assay, where people put a little bit of MGF in a cornea and then looked at the various growth towards it, that's been unduly influential in making in the modelling of angiogenesis and has strongly influenced people to say that. Influence people to say that vessels should go out. I think if you have a really strong gradient, they do. But I don't believe that that's a major component in the actual physiological situation. I'm wondering, do you have, I didn't see any surface area term in the model for the size of the blood vessels, but I would have thought that would tend to make the things smaller so that they could transmit more oxygen to the surrounding tissue. No, so actually, the diameter of the Actually, the diameter of the vessel is the amount of oxygen going to the surrounding tissue is only weakly dependent on the diameter of the vessel. I could explain why that is important if you like. So, the thing that is very sensitive to the diameter is the flow distribution. That's the crucial thing. The question which is. Oh, sorry, maybe we keep this for the discussion. Sorry. Yeah, it's not expected that.
