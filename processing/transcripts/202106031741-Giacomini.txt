Okay, so welcome everybody to this discussion session and thank you for being here after so many days and thanks to our speakers. So as in the other discussion sessions, we would like to start by asking each of you to either give us an overview, like put your research in a broader picture, or tell us. Broader picture, or tell us what the big challenges are next, or the most interesting things to study are. So we will start in the order of the speakers. So maybe Daniel. Well, it's a rather tough question that I haven't thought deeply about. But let's say most The most interesting questions for me now are related to black holes. And I think I sort of evolved from the view that information loss paradox is the most important challenge to taking it maybe as a red herring. But I'm really, really, really interested to know what it takes for astrophysical black holes to have the usual set of. The usual set of properties that we ascribe to black holes. So, really fully explore the consequences and then translate these consequences into potentially observable signatures. And as a challenge, I would say that, at least in spherical symmetry, we mostly done with low-hanging fruit slit. Bringing fruits that the results that you can obtain just by looking at the self-consistency. And we have to start doing hard stuff. And that means use this metric as a background, well, this information about metrics that we obtained as a background, or at least as constraints for the background, and try to redo, let's say, quantum field theory. Quantum field theory calculations that lead to Hawking radiation and see what happens. Because it's again, it's one point to one thing is to point out and say, oh, we have problems with surface gravity, and this is bad, and this is even worse. Another one is actually to see if it really plays the role people expect it to play. And if yes, then what? Yes, so that's one side. And another side is without making theoretical. Theories about what the matter looks like, the matter that is needed to produce such black holes. Let's say if they exist, we know something about the metric near the apparent horizon. We have to start perturbing them and see how they respond. So, quasi-normal modes and how that stacks up against standard. The standard predictions of the classical black holes and predictions for the alternative objects. And this way, maybe those differences are observationally significant, and then we have something else to compare with, or but it will be that for all practical purposes they're not. That's something that we don't know. So I would say that the challenges is. I would say that the challenge is to go from the framework, which is pretty clear, from let's say skeleton, to try to grow some meat on those bones. And of course, another one, it's all nice and well and you need to do calculations in spherical symmetry. But real life is at least axially symmetric. Mass is definitely harder. Is definitely harder. We have a few nice results, but that's another direction in which we have to go if we want to do something realistic, but it's semi-realistic. And yes, I would really like to understand what goes on there and what does it take? If it's a semi-classical physics that breaks down. So, yes, we can put it all under. So, yes, we can put it all under the title, Do Black Holes Exist? But then we have to put in the brackets, maybe in small font, for a given definition of a black hole. But yes, that's a group of questions that I find extremely interesting. And I would love to know the answer. I wouldn't, even more, I would love to get that. And by the way, if you have a potential. And by the way, if you have potential students to send to Australia, there are some money for that. So, yes, please we'll be happy to get one PhD, to fund one PhD student to work on that. I know I'm trying to steal people from you, but still. And thank you. And Valentina? Um, so yes. Uh I haven't thought about it much. Like, I hope it kind of makes sense to what I'm going to say. So, from the point of view of someone like me, I'm relatively new to the old entanglement harvesting with online detectors. What I find fascinating is the fact that these things, like the capacity of these things to harvest entanglement depends a lot on the configurations that you have. So, it seems like indirectly speech. seems like indirectly speaking, sort of like you have this measurement that depends sort of on the apparatus that you're using. And probably people who have worked on this thing for quite a long time, maybe it's like it's just the way it is, it's totally fine, but I found it fascinating and that's why I got interested in trying to understand like what happens when you add quantum degrees of freedom to do with detectors. And I think from the big picture point of view, The big picture point of view is that I think it's like I have to say that Nick sort of like converted me to this idea that it's nice and cool to do physics from an operational point of view. So like you can sort of like do measurement, do experiments, and from them you sort of try and develop some theories that justify what you have just found. Coming from a background in gravity, like to me was completely different. Be different. So, so that's why I think this is like, um, this, I guess, justified what I said at the beginning of my talk. Like, I think that when we develop this mathematical model that express, that try to model what is actually happening in reality, it's really important that, at least from my point of view, that we consider the relevant degrees of freedom that, because I guess like Guad shouldn't be randomly just say, oh, why don't we try? Randomly to say, oh, why don't we try this? Why don't we try that? Like, it'd be better to sort of narrow the space of the configuration space that one wants to consider. And I also think I sort of agree with what Hakeem said yesterday in his talk in terms of, you know, sometimes we should have more of an information, theoretical information approach to these things and understand what the role of information is in this sort of. Of information is in this sort of settings. I'm trying to explore that, but it's probably slower than I thought. But yeah, just to conclude, I just think it's really important to understand what the relevant degrees of freedom of decisions are and why we want to model them. Or even if there is a way of defining it that way, maybe it doesn't like it's a question, it doesn't make sense. Yeah, and that's all for me. Thanks. Okay, so. Okay, so for myself I feel it's very important to find new experimental methods to observe the vacuum photon production with non-inertial detectors. And one thing that I found interesting, but I don't understand much myself, is that as I showed in my talk, even detectors with a non-relativistic regime can produce some kind of the vacuum photons. Can observe vacuum photons. And I wonder if that idea can be extended to some experiments testing the interface between gravity and quantum. And also, I think right now, little attention has been given to the coherent amplification of photon detection using many detectors. And like what I'm planning to do next is to need to do next is to use this to realize the arrow effect and and I yeah I'm I'm also curious about extending these ideas to other aspects for example entanglement harvesting because I'm doing things like entangled bottom pairs harvesting but I'm not focused on entanglement though Yeah, thanks a lot. And I think now we can open the questions to everybody, to the participants. So please ask questions. Okay. So then. All right. So I was going to ask Valentina, but also maybe there's probably a lot of people who have ideas about this. Of people who have ideas about this, I about entanglement harvesting in practice, so actually trying to do an experiment. I'm wondering what is the parametric difficulty? So not conceptually, maybe, but just like, what's the scale that kills, that makes this so hard? So in the UNRO effect, it's like, you know, I need an acceleration that's large and units of the Planck mass, say. But is it the same thing here? Is it? Yeah, would love any comments. Yeah, would love any comments. Actually, I think this is the kind of question maybe UAI can answer. I am fairly new to the field and I'm a total theorist. I have never set hands on an experiment. So I don't want to set like parameters that or give you like sort of values that don't make any sense. I really feel like I'm very ignorant from this point of view. I'm very ignorant from this point of view. Okay, sorry, I asked just because you're playing with this, which is a very, again, from my experience and models which I played, and I think Alex can maybe correct me, to get interesting results, yes, we need weird environments like near horizon, near horizon experiments, or we need Experiments, or we need to be able to separate detectors and maintain coherence on the scales which are comparable with interesting, say, topological scales in the universe, which brings it flatly to sci-fi. But I also know that more sort of if people were working at least on simulations, like similarly, like you have, say, a coup. Earlier, you have acoustic black holes, and you can do stuff with Bose-Einstein condensates. It was maybe possible to have similar sorts of effects in a simulated environment. But let's say taking per-phase value, we need to keep the detectors between early universe and now, or drop them into black holes and do other feats which are worthy of the interstellar. The worst of the interstellar, but a bit hard to produce in real life. But again, I'm a theorist, so for me, experiment is very, very easy. And I feel heroic if I go beyond writing Hilbert space operators. So I think we need some more qualified answer. I would say, like, I don't know, I know of Silk has been trying to do, like, because I think the old concept, and this is a The old concept, and this is some work that we have done with Nick Menikuchi, some of his students here, is to try to understand how you define observers that are like if you want to do experiments, you want, well, maybe not, but a cool idea would be trying to see when you have in-universe observers. So, observers that actually, like, for instance, if you have, if you're trying to have an analog model of gravity in a Bose-Einstein content state, maybe what you want to try to do, and I don't know how easy that's going to be. I don't know how easy that's going to be, honestly, because I'm not an experiment, but trying to say, like, sort of create the equivalent of an Urdu detector in something that is that tiny, and they can like do the measure and see the effects. But that's like, I know that Silke is trying to do something similar with lasers, like in the experiments with water. I honestly, yeah, that's the, yeah, as with Jenny, that's the knowledge that I have. Danny, that's the knowledge that I have. Maybe I can just quickly add, too, is that the actual amount of entanglement that's harvested is extremely small, like, it's really small. So, you would have to do some sort of distillation over like hundreds of atoms that are getting entangled or going through that protocol. I think, but Alex, so can you just say what I'm really just trying to answer this simple question? Like, when you say it's small, like parametrically, what is that? Why is it small? I mean, what because of the acceleration entered or something? Because of the acceleration enters or something? Oh, no, there's no acceleration. You just have them stationary. Right, so what makes it a small? Usually the interaction is small, but the actual amount of entanglement when you quantify it in terms of like a procedure that you would actually go to measure it, maybe like some kind of distillation protocol and count how many bell pairs you could produce from a bunch of runs of the entanglement harvesting protocol. It's like a really, like, you would need. Really, like you would need. I don't know the numbers off the top of my head, but it's like you would need to do it a bunch of times to get like a meaningful entanglement signature that you could witness. I don't know if that's making sense or if someone else wants to add to that. I think it might be like you need hundreds of thousands. Okay, yeah, you had some more, yeah. But sorry, what are what do you what it was? You must be assuming some coupling and some feeling. Yeah, so it's the analysis is perturbative and like a small interaction, right? Interaction. But I know Rob and one of the papers Hui cited too was a non-perturbative thing with Gaussian detectors. So I don't know how the magnitude scales in those models off the top of my head. But yeah, the interaction is really small. And then the actual just amount of entanglement that you get from that interaction is also. I don't know if that helps. I feel you're unsatisfied. I think the problem is you're talking to a bunch of theorists. Yeah, I don't know much about it. Know much about it. You guys agree with formulas, right? I'm just asking. Okay, sorry, just to keep anyway. I'll have some thought. So, Hui, you wanted to say something? I just feel intuitively you need such a big acceleration to get photons from vacuum. And of course, you need extreme conditions to get entanglement. Well, but but so all that being said, so maybe if I could elaborate. So, maybe if I could elaborate, Dan, although Miles, I see, is in the queue. Yeah, so the amount is small, and almost everything is done with bipartite systems, two detectors, and the dominant measure used is concurrence. So, what we find is the concurrence is very tiny. Now, tiny doesn't mean zero. And I'm, I guess, Hope Springs Eternal. I'd like to be a Hope Springs Eternal. I'd like to be a little more optimistic. People are keen on the UNRU effect, but a simple back of the envelope means you need 10 to the 26 meters per second squared, which is completely unfeasible. So, you know, that's 45-year-old effect, but over the years, people have thought, well, let's do analog systems, let's simulate. So I don't want to butt in front of miles, but I would at some point like. But I would at some point like to hear from Hui to how optimistic she is that maybe your approach could actually do entanglement harvesting. But Miles should go first. Don't answer that till he's gone. Sorry, I'm speechless. I'm not used. Yeah, I don't know if I'll be able to participate in a normal seminar after this. After this, you know, when we all go back to being in the same room again, yeah, when you can mute, laugh quietly, and then return. Yeah, so actually to Valentina again, but I guess others will have maybe some thoughts as well. And so I have two questions. So the first one is: did you look at entanglement harvesting for space-like separated detectors? No, in the case that we are considered, it was time-like separated. And the reason is due to the fact of the switching function that we have considered. I see. So maybe just opening up to anybody else. So what I mean, what's the current status about entanglement harvesting when the detectors are space-like separated? And I guess connected with that is how confident can one be that it's genuine harvesting and not just an artifact of the model one's. Just an artifact of the model once working with like the model Hamiltonian, or maybe the method of approximation, time-dependent perturbation theory versus maybe something more exact. I thought Tim has some results about it. But I don't see him among the participants. But yeah, I'll leave it to people who have more experience in this field then. To people who have more experience in this field than me, like Laura, Rob, or Magdalena, and Alex. Yeah, so I see that Magdalena has raised her hand. So yeah, just to briefly comment on the current discussion. So, about, I think we also will maybe to some extent address Max's question. So there are beautiful works by Summers and Bernberg, Reinforce and Berner on algebraic quantum field theory, and they have proven that in a relativistic quantum field theory, in principle, between any two local regions, you can find observables with which you can violate Bell inequalities maximum. So this means that in principle there is a maximum amount in some sense of entanglement between any two local regions on the relativistic period. Local regions in their latest interior. What is not known, and when I talked with the Reinhard some years back, this was still completely open: is what are those observables? And it's just very hard to derive or compute from their approach. And so that's why the approaches that are used here are those where we actually understand how measurements are done. So there are measurements done on the detectors. But the drawback is that they extract only very little amount of entanglement. But so I would say that. But so I would say that this tells us that nominally, at least as the theory says, there is entanglement between like in quantum field theory and it doesn't depend on any kind of modeling that is used in this approach. But then this approach of using detectors is the one that we can actually understand for how to get to this entanglement. And it's just clear that it's obviously not optimal. And then the effort is probably to try to kind of bridge the two and understand how. try to kind of bridge the two and understand how to yeah how to get to these correlations in a in a fashion that will extract point so yeah I just wanted to add thank you thanks and does anybody else have a comment on this or another question well I still want to hear what we is thinking about entanglement harvesting in her approach Approach. Do you think you can really do it? Well, do you think it really can be done? Let me not personalize it so much. Well, so first, I'm not that familiar with entanglement harvest. So as far as I know, I actually don't know. I actually don't know things like smearing functions. I know sometimes it functions as acceleration of those detectors. But I'm not very confident with that since I don't know if some artificial thing or something you can really do. So I don't know the answer to the question. Okay, I mean, it might. Okay, I mean, it might be worth thinking about. I mean, I think the general, like, like you've got this thing in the, you know, you're putting a detector in a cavity, I guess, maybe simulated with the superconductors. But in principle, as soon as you have one detector that can do these things, you can add a second one and something like entanglement harvesting should happen between. The question is, how and partly how. How and partly how much you get. But I'm happy, well, maybe not happy, but I'm willing to let a journey of a thousand miles begin with the first step, right? And even if one can only get a little bit or partially simulate under restricted circumstances or something, I would declare victory. I mean, that's at least something, right? That's kind of what I'm thinking. But you're shaking a You know, you're shaking a thing in a cavity and showing you to get photons out. So it just seems to me there might be some way of turning this into an actual thing to demonstrate the phenomenon, but I'm not quite sure how yet. I guess something to clarify. So the entanglement I was talking about was between the cavity and detector. And of course, I also talked about the case with I also talked about the case with many detectors, but still it's like entanglement between the detectors ensemble with the cavity. And so to be honest, I never took a look at like if there exists entanglement between those detectors. So intuitively, I feel there should be some entanglement. That's right. That's what I think. I know it's between the cavity and the thing, but when you have two of them, the object of the game is to get that entanglement to slide. Get that entanglement to swap between the detectors. But Miles has been waiting to say something. Yeah, Miles, go ahead. I don't want to dominate. So why not have an analog with phonons instead of photons? And so you can think of some optomechanical system where you've got a membrane, and that's the phonon in quantum vacuum, so to speak. And then you've got two cavities. So to speak. And then you've got two cavities that couple locally. And then you can imagine harvesting entanglement between the photons and the cavities. Yeah, that may be. Sure. I mean, I'm open-minded. I just haven't given enough thought to how to actually do the dirty work. Maybe we could talk about it offline sometime. It'd be great. Yeah. I think enhancing the coupling is very important. Any ways to enhance the coupling strength? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You want to find the optimum setting to get as much as you can. But the real world always has trade-offs. So I don't know what the best ones are. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. So we have a few more minutes to go before we close the session. So we have time for one or two more questions. Yeah, Valentina. I got a question for Danny. So maybe this is something that you said, but I missed. So you were saying that basically whatever black hole or whatever object that we see that we think it's a black hole, they're basically still forming. So, in the sense that the event. So, in the sense that the event arises not there yet. And is there a chance to see? Like, I haven't followed it. Like, what is the stage with gravitational waves? Can we see a signature of a horizon still? Like, I haven't followed what people in one set. One word answer is not no, two-word answer is not yet. Popular alternatives. Popular alternatives which compare standard, say Schwarzschild standard care with various ultra-compact objects, for example, produce a spectrum of quasi-normal modes, which has differences with the classic one, but also significant overlaps. And as a result, you can see the difference between object with the horizon and object which looks almost An object which looks almost like a black hole, but without a horizon, only on time scales which are reasonable, but much longer than what is currently available. So the hope is that next or next generation should be able to see the differences because let's say the ring down signal should be different for objects with horizon and objects without the horizon. Good news is that at least some Is that at least some models show that this difference persists and it remains finite, even if that parameter epsilon that I defined as closeness of fake black hole to the horizon of what would be horizon of the black hole with the same parameters. So even if this parameter epsilon goes to zero, difference in the ring down signal will persist. But it requires much higher sensitivity. Similarly, there are predictions. Similarly, there are predictions that horizonless objects will have slightly different light sphere, but again, for this, you need to upgrade the interesting horizon telescope. And what follows from our work essentially is, I mean, when you take it to some logical extent, that metric is different and necessarily so, and then the practical question is whether. Question is whether the list of differences starting from finite collapse time according to distant observer are translatable into different quasi-normal modes. But at the moment, no, we don't know if there is a horizon. Even in the black hole, gravitational physics roadmap, at some point they admit. And all we know is that there are dark, compact, massive objects. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, yeah. I remember the Nobel Prize last year. They, I mean, for Peru is okay, but for now, I don't remember the name of the other two. Sorry, my memory is really bad. But like, you know. Oh, it's Gaz, Andrea Gaz. Yes, and yeah, it's like discovering dark compact objects in the center of our galaxy. So they haven't said, like, they've been very specific. They very deliberately haven't said it because, for example, I remember squabbles. I remember squabbles about what the pictures from EHT actually showed during the GRG in Valencia and they spilled even into the plenary sessions. So those are extremely important results and but I still believe that they show that compact objects really exist, really exist. But now, well, the Now, well, with the development of those detectors, it will be possible actually to say or at least constrain what we can say about the nature of those objects. But so far, there is room. And again, what we started is just to say, okay, those objects exist. What is the price? What are the consequences? And the price might be really high because if at the result Because if at the result of those first calculations we get into situations that we have demonstrably different sort of signatures between classical black holes, physical black holes and horizonless objects. And then it is found that what we have are physical black holes that will indicate that there are a lot of physics that we Lot of physics that we think is exotic or sci-fi is actually true. Well, and if we don't find it, then yeah, it's sort of boring answer that physics, as we know, works, which is also good. But that's becoming an observational question and not just matter of opinion in sort of just discourses. Discourses. So, yeah, those are very interesting times. Thank you. So, we are over time already, but Alex, if your question is very quick. All right, okay. I don't want to keep anyone. I know it's the end of the day, but it was a quick one for Danny. I was wondering, I would see this nice picture from the Event Horizon Telescope, and I wonder, like, are we ever going to be able to do spectroscopic measurements of the light that we're collecting? And then the question was: would there be like, And then the question was: Would there be, like, and even if that's pi in the sky, I was wondering if there's going to be an observational signature in the spectra that we might see that would distinguish between an actual event horizon and actually, I don't know. First of all, of course, it's not visible. It's microwave and I think some millimeter. So it's orange color is simulated. Now, I haven't heard about say. Say spectral differences in the radiation. And I just don't know. After all, I'm not a real astrophysicist, but that's something that I would be pestering them with questions. So definitely thanks for raising it up. Calculate, could be good at calculating. Anyway. Okay. So thanks a lot, everybody, for participating in the discussion. For participating in the discussions, let's thank our speakers again, and thanks to you all for being here and talking to us. And thank you for organizing. Thank you guys, organizing. Even if it would be nice to be in real life, but we have one. It would, it would at some point. Hopefully. Thank you. Thanks, guys. Bye, everybody. Bye. Thanks. Bye. Thanks. Bye. Bye.
