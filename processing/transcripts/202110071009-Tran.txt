Except that we multiply by two here because we count the contributors up to embeddings, right? So that's why we multiply by two here. And if you remember the talk of some people before, sorry that I forgot to name, but when there's some talk before DeFi, Euclidean lattice, if you remember this, then usually you have the scripts. You have a discrete entity subgroup, and you have a scalar product, then you have a lattice, right? So, this pair is called an ideal lattice of F. In other words, an ideal lattice will be an ideal of the ring of integer of F and another U with three components, all positive and real, you to define the scalar product. Due to defy the scalar product for this lattice or the length function for this lattice. So now, when you have an ideal lattice UI, we can define the psi function at this ideal lattice as follows. So the C definition. So the psi function denote by A0 here at the ideal lattice u. At the ideal lettuce UI the sum here, log of this infinite sum. And the sum here run over all the elements in the ideal I. And if some of you working in function field, this is an analog of the dimension of the Riemann rock space. Of a divisor on a curve. The only difference here is that the difference here is that this psi function can be a real number, can be any number, not necessarily an integer number at the dimension of Riemann-Rocks-Veryov divisor on a curve. And then we didn't know by pick zero f, also it is. F also, it is similar to the Picard group of all a divisor up to a principal divisor degree zero here, or the set of all isometric classes of ideal lattices with the co-volume effects. So, the co-volume here is the co-volume of the lattice UI here is computed by taking the norm of the ideal I mean. The norm of the ideal i multiply by the square of discriminant and product of u1, u2, u3. And in this case, because this if this one equal to square root of delta, we if and only if the product of u1, u2, u3 equal to one, right? And just a remark that the special, the trivial ideal at this OF1 here. One here, one here. It's just a pure notation. I mean, the vector of three coordinates one one one. And this, this trivial ideal, the class of ideal lattice have this colour volume, square root of root of delta. So the question here is at which class of ideal lattice on this on this set, on pic 0f, that the psi function attain its maximum? So, I'm going to show you some pictures and then you can give me some guess. So, this is a picture of, I draw the picture of two cases here. The first case is when the number field case is real quadratic field. In other words, this field is Galois over Q. The second case is The second case is when K is a quadratic extension of some imaginary quasi-field. I denote the imaginary quadratic field by little k here, then it's mean capital K is galo over little k here. For both cases, the trivial, the origin here, the red point you see it here, here, sorry, is the trivial ideal lattice, class of ideal lattice, I should say, in peak zero. Say in peak zero. So, in both cases, the psi function attained maximum at the trivial class of ideal lattice. And this function that you see in the picture is periodic. And all of these are the trivial class of ideal lattices here. So, if K is gala over Q or Galois over some imaginary quasi. Over some imaginary quasi-field, then the sine function attains maximum at the trivial class of idealatic. This is the K when the bow cases, the units group of this field, have rank one. Now, I'm going to show you another example of this psi function when the units group of this field is half rank two. Is have run two. So this is a picture of the psi function, and I draw it in the so the xy plane is the fundamental domain of the units group of f and therefore it have dimension two here. So the domain is dimension two. And again, the same phenomenon happened that the psi function attained its maximum at Psi function attained its maximum at the trivial class of ideal lattices. So now you can get what is the conjecture, right? So the conjecture is exactly what I have shown you in the previous pictures. This is the conjecture from van der Guy and SCUF. I think SCUF is another thing. I mean SCOOF also a 10-hour workshop here. The conjecture is Sharp here. The conjecture is that if a number field k either galois over q or galois over some imaginary quadratic field, then the psi function will attain its maximum at the trivial class of ideal lattices here. This conjecture has been proved for several number fields, and I denote the degree of the number field by n. The degree of the number field by n and the units group is of rank R. So in 2001, Franginis have proved that this is true for all quadratic field, for both cases, imaginary and real. So unit group of rank 0 or 1. And then in 2014, we proved that this also true for n equal to 4 and r equal to 1. So the own quadratic. The own quadratic extension of imaginary quadratic field that you saw in the previous pictures. In 2016, we proved that this conjecture holds for all cyclic cubic fields, and this is the first result when the units group of rank two and degree of the field three. And in this talk, I want to give you some idea about our recent work in 2020. We show that this conjecture. We show that this conjecture actually true also for another class of a number field with units group rank two, the imaginary cyclic sector field. So do you have any question up to now? This is the first part of my talk. So if you don't have any question, I'm going to move to the second part. I'm going to move to the second part. Can you say again what R is? The units group. Sorry, the units, the rank of the units group of the number field or the units of, you know. So the ring of integer is OK, right? The units group of OK is as an abbeying group. An ABA group is that what you're saying? So the rank of this unit group is R. Okay, thank you. Yeah. So is any other questions? Yes. Yes. So this group can be generated by two elements. Generate by two elements independent over Z. Yeah. It's a B, or you can think like it's a Z module of rank two. So if no more questions, I'm going to go to the second part. Before showing you this main idea how to prove this conjecture, I'm going to recall you this lattice called it. Lattice called it log units lattice of F. So again, just a question someone asked me before. This is the one I'm talking about. This is the units rank here. So FE, again, the imaginary cyclic sector field. And for the units group of OF, this one, we did know, we noted by OF and the cross psi. And then the log unit slot. And then the log unislattis is the one that you take the log of each of the elements in this unit group after you embed it to C3, right? So X is in OF and then you embed it using the map phi to map it into sigma 1x, sigma 2x, sigma 2x sigma 3x in C3, and then you take log of each components. So you have a vector in R3, the absolute value, right? So log x here will be the log of sigma i x here. And this one is in R3. However, you know that being a unit element, the norm of this element in absolute. The norm of this element in absolute value will be one. So, therefore, when you take the sum of the log components here, it's equal to zero, right? So, therefore, even this log unit lattice is in R3 because of this constraint, the unit rank, the rank of this lattice equal to two. So it's only This is only a lattice of rank two and add three. And it had the special shape that you see in the picture here. This, the picture on the right-hand side, is the log units lattice delta F. And I'm sure that you see this many times in this conference, many people talking about this. This really special lattice of rank two. This is the unit lattice. The C, the unis lattice, the unique lattice in up to similarity of rank two that have six shorted vectors. So this log unit lattice have the property that it have six shorted vector. I denote in, I draw it in blue color here, that when you connect the end void of these vectors, you obtain a hexagon, right? In other words, this lettuce is called In other words, this lattice is called a hexagonal lattice, and it has this really special shape. And in the next slide, I'm going to denote by H the area inside this hexagon. Okay, so H either the region inside this red hexagon. So the reason I recall this property is that because proving the conjecture for the imaginaries. For the imaginary cyclic sector fuel F can be reduced to proving the followings. So instead of proving that on whole peak 0F, the conjecture here is on peak 0F, right? We can reduce this problem to prove that if we can show that the maximum of this psi function on H, where log u is in this region h is Is equal to the value of the psi function of the trivial class of ideologus, then we're done. I put this in practice. It means it's actually a little bit work, but it can be done easily. It's not the difficult part of the proof. So, again, this condition just means that the volume, the co-volume of the ideal lattice, OFU equals to F u equals to square root delta f so that this ideal lattice will be in pic zero. So this means the class of this ideal lattice is in pic zero f. So this condition is not important. The important is that we can reduce the problem on pick zero prove the psi function maximum pic zero on the smaller region h here. So So this is the first idea. The second one is that now we know we can limit our problem to when log of u is in this text again. So we divide our proof into two cases when log u is not too short, this vector is not too short. In other words, if we draw a circle of If we draw a circle of really small radius, let's call it epsilon for the small parsity number. If log u is not too short, it means it's outside of the circle, but still in this tax again, then we can prove the conjecture by showing, by finding a good upper bound b for this value. So we actually want to prove that this psi function is smaller than the value of the psi function. The value of the psi function at the trivial class, right? This is what we want to prove. So, in order to do this, we're gonna find an upper bow for b, and good mean that this upper bound is smaller than the psi function, the value of the psi function of the trivial class of right. So, in order to do this, we need to use three different techniques here. The first one is that One is that we have to count how many units elements here, or in other words, when we take log of f, it's going to be in the log lattice, the unit log lattice. So how many elements in the lob lattice? So that this condition satisfy the length of the vector uf here is less than the constant. The constant here depends on epsilon. The radius of this circle, the tiny circle here, and this can be done efficiently. The counting the number of elements in the lock lattice can be done efficiently because we know the shape of the of delta F, which is really special hexagonal lattice. So it can be done efficiently based on the shape of this lattice. The second thing we need to The second thing we need to do to find a good value is that we need to estimate for this sum, or we need to really tie up a bow for this sum. Now the infinite sum for L is a general lattice of dimension 6, alpha iposity. And this one we borrowed a technique from the thesis from Crowe. From Crowan region. I may pronounce this person name wrongly again. The idea is he has an upper bow for this similar type function like this. However, his bow is not good enough for us to prove that it's less than the value of the function, the psi function at the trivial idealatus here. So we have to work on it more to pass. To work on it more to fire a tie upper bow for it so that we are able to show that this upper bow is still good enough. And the last thing we have to do is to compute the number of roots of unity here. So delta F is all the root of unity in F or in OF. So in the previous work, for instance, the cyclic. work for and for instance the cyclic cubic field we don't have to care about this one because that's totally real k so it only have two units uh two root of unity is one minus one however now we work with imaginary cyclic sector field we have we may have many of them for instance that's i remember some of the calculation the number of roots of unity of some field is 14. so on the sum that we have calculating before The sum that we have calculated before without root of unity, now we have to multiply by 14. Without this factor, our upper bound will be really small compared to the value of the psi function at the trivial ideal articles. So, with all of these techniques, all together, we able to find a good up about b and then we can done this can be done. So, this is the first case when log u is not too sure. When log U is not too short. Now I'm going to go to the second case when log U is really short. In other words, now log U will be inside the circle. So this is the second case. When log U is really short, then there's a technique that I just name it when I make the talk. I call it amplify the difference. And this is actually the idea from Skoof. We are all from him when we try. All from him when we try to do the cyclic cubic case. So, the idea we want to prove that this sum at this difference is negative, right? We want to show that the one on the left-hand side is smaller than one on the right-hand side. However, now, seeing log u is really small, use and number one, the vector 111 here is really close to each other. So, the difference of these two values is really tiny that we shouldn't. Really tiny that we shouldn't be able to even distinguish or calculate them. So, in order to work on this different, we got an idea from SCOOF saying that, okay, if we divide a different by log U, and again, this log U is really small, but non-zero, okay, it make the different become much larger, and we're able to calculate it and say that this is negative, so we're done. We done, I hear some people talking, right? Um, I don't. Oh, yeah, it's fine. Sorry, maybe just the echo in my headphone. Okay, so we want so using the amplify techniques, uh, we can make the different must be good and able to calculate it. Um, so we're gonna calculate as follows. So, so C. So, C here can be written at this sum. And then this sum, again, we rewrite the sum into three different sum. The idea is this in this sum, the short vector in OF contribute significantly to the value of C. The longer one is really small that we can control and we can do the optimate on. So we have to divide into the sum. So T1 is just the same sum at C. Is just the same sum at C, but the element, the root of unity of F only. The second sum is the one with the long vectors, you know, F, long here, just 22 in our case. And the last sum, T3, are the one with shorter vectors. So here with all the sum where the length is less than 22. She should write F square here. And the first sum can be calculated easily when. sum can be calculated easily when we just estimate the number of proofs of unity and we can compute this function easily. The second sum can be done, can be bounded by u by first we do we compute a maclarine expansion of this function and this can be done because f is galois is c click not only galois but click galois and then therefore after we we After we use the Maclarin extension of this function, we can bow for this using the similar techniques in the previous slide. And then we can bow for T3. So this can be about efficiently as well. So the last step we have to do is bow for T3, where T3 have all the short vectors, right? So T3s are the one have the same sum at C, where all the vector F here are not. Here are not drutab unity and have the length square less than 22. And in order to do this, we have to use the two subfield of F, the cyclic cubic subfield of conductor P here and the quadratic subfield Q root D here. And this is a new result because we use the previous technique for the other number field, it doesn't work anymore. And so And so the idea is if f have some elements, short elements, then it must be one of the following cases. Either F is in the cubic field or the quadric subfield, let's see the first case, or the discrete minute of F should be really small in the sense that we can bow for the screen of the quadratic subfield and the conductor. Quadric subfield and the conductor of the cubic subfield. So, here we can vow for discriminant of F will be small. So, we can list them all. So, in both cases, the first and the second case here, either case, we can list all the first case here, we list all the cubic subfield and the quadratic subfield and we enumerate all vector f with length less than 22. Similar for the Similar for the second case, we have a bow for the screen meaning of the sectic field here because it's small. We list all the field and we count all of the elements, short elements, and then we approximate, we can find a good up about 43. And then we can show that the difference that we saw in the previous slide is negative, and therefore, so we have the C is negative, and therefore, we don't. Is negative and therefore we done because you have that the value on the left is smaller than the value on the right. And I think that's it. So this is the idea we use for the psi function. And here are some references if you are interested in the conjectures is in this paper. In this paper, that you want to see and add the property of the psi function and relating to the dimension of Brilliant Rock space of divisor on the curve, you can see on this paper. Okay, so well, thanks Ha for a very nice talk. And we have some time for questions. Some time for questions or comments. So I don't know if anybody has a question, comment.
