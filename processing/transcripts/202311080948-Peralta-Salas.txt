So uh real MHD, so it's this system of P D E's so it's it describes uh an incompressible uh plasma which has no resistivity. So this is reflected here in this first equation. This is the dynamo equation. It tells you that the time derivative of V is this Lie bracket, which means that this transported V is transported by the D, by the velocity field of the plasma fluid. This second equation is This second equation is the Navier-Stokes equation for the velocity, and then here coupled, well, there's the hydrodynamic pressure, and here this is the Lorentz force, which is coupled with the magnetic field. And of course, both V and V velocity and magnetic field are solenoidal vector fields. In this approximation of ideal MHD, there are no other electric fields neglected. And so, this is the system. And here, these are the unknowns of these equations, be it the magnetic field. These equations be the magnetic field of the perfectly conducting plasma, B is the plasma pressure, and V is the plasma velocity, Î¼ is the hydrodynamic viscosity. There is no resistivity, as I said. If there was resistivity, this would no be longer a dynamo, a transport equation, but there would be here some additional term, but it's neglected in this ideal situation. Good, so there is some heuristics, which is still very important in some physical processes, which Some physical processes, which is what is known as the magnetic relaxation mechanism. So, this is the heuristics of this mechanism. So, since you have here viscosity, a hydrodynamic viscosity, then it's reasonable that this viscosity forces the velocity after some time, for t tends to infinity, the velocity tends to zero, and then if in the case that the magnetic field The magnetic field tends to some limiting vector field V bar and also for the pressure as T tends to infinity. You formally obtain something in this equation. If you look at this equation, which is when V is zero, this term is zero here, here, here, then formally you get that the limit satisfies this the magneto-hydroscopic equations, so which are exactly Equations, so which are exactly the same as the steady order equations, B playing the role of the velocity field, and this could be actually the Bernoulli function or minus the Bernoulli function. So this is always at the formal level and assuming many, many things. And a second consequence of these heuristics is that, of course, this dynamo equation means or implies that B at each time is transported by the... Transported by the time t flow of the velocity field. So precisely this means that B at time t is equal to B to the initial B, B naught, after pushing forward by the time T flow of the field. So the topology, as far as there is no blow up and solution remains smooth and all that, the topology of the magnetic field is preserved for all time. So this is the heuristics. So this suggests to introduce a concept that is Concept that actually is introduced in the physics literature in plasma physics, which is the notion of topological relaxation, which is actually independent of the precise mechanism of relaxation that one uses. And so we say that there is topological relaxation if the initial magnetic field, B naught, is topologically equivalent to the limiting field V bar, in case it exists and it's smooth. Or equivalently, this is the same as saying that Same as saying that B bar is equal to V naught up to pushing forward by some volume, smooth volume-preserving diffeomorphism of the space, of the unit space, or the torus, or whatever the space, of the domain where you are. This is the notion of topological relaxation. It's a purely dynamical systems notion, if you want, but it's somehow related to this heuristic mechanism of magnetic relaxation. So, of course. So, of course, as I said, this is a heuristic argument. There is no rigorous justification. There are many, many things here that are very hard, starting from the existence, global existence of solutions to these system smooth solutions. This, of course, we don't know. This includes the Navier-Stokes equation. This is, you know, one of the famous clay millennial problems. But there are many, many other heuristics. First, you have to prove that the velocity tends to zero, and what's the meaning of tending to. Test to see, and what's the meaning of tending to zero in which topology, which norm? Also, what's the meaning of this tending to some limiting fields? What's the regularity of these limiting fields? What's the meaning of this convergence in which topology or norm, etc., many other things. And even in the case that all these worlds, you have this global solution and you have these limiting fields, it's not clear that the limiting field is topologically equivalent to the original one because it The original one because this limit in diffeomorphisms could not have in the limit could be no longer a diffeomorphism. It could the differential, the terminal, could lose one in the limit. But still, even taking into account all these issues, it suggests the following question. So, this is the problem, actually, that I'm going to consider in this talk. And the question, very precise question, is it possible Precise question: Is it possible to have topological relaxation for any initial magnetic field? Or more precisely, is any, this is the exact question that I'm studying here, is any solenoidal or divergence-free vector field B naught topologically equivalent to a smooth magnetohydrostatic equilibrium? So, by magnetohydrostatic equilibrium, I simply mean a solution to this system of equations, okay, V cross curl V plus. Okay, B cross G plus the gradient of the pressure is equal to zero and B is solenoidal. So this is the question and the motivation of this problem is well it's first it's motivated by somehow by these heuristics, but there are some physical processes where apparently this has this is more significant. And probably one of the more important physical situations where this Where this appears somehow is in the study of plasma physics in the context of stellar atmospheres, because there apparently solar physicists say that ideal MHD is a very good approximation. Maybe I'm not sure if it's so good in the setting of Tocamax or Solin surgery. In the Sun, it's compressible. Yes. Incompressible, yeah. Yeah, but it's compressible in the scope. But still, in the solar corona, it's a good approximation. You can check the. Approximation. You can check the literature on this. It's very well known. In the solar corona. Yes, this picture here. Yes. In these solar flares, there you have that this is a good approximation, the ideal MHD. And the MHS is insensitive to the model, incompressible, compressible. It doesn't matter. The velocity too, you get the same MHS solutions. So the beat will, of course, always incompressible. Good, so this is a good physical situation. So, and actually, actually, in 1972, this solar physicist Jean Parker, he proposed a hypothesis, which is precisely this problem that I'm telling you. It's a different setting from the one that I'm going to consider, but this is very well known. There's a lot of literature. If you type in Google Parker's hypothesis, very well known. Typing Google Parker's hypothesis, very, very extremely well known. And this is the hypothesis. And he said that for most magnetic field topologies, whatever most means, it wasn't very precise in the formulation for a generic magnetic field, Parker proposed that there does not exist a smooth magnetohydrostatic equilibrium with that topology, which you can understand this way. This way. For most of a generic magnetic field, solenoidal vector field, there is no diffeomorphism that transforms it into a magneto-hydrostatic equilibrium. This is exactly what Parker was asking. And then his motivation for Parker, which is one can think it's controversial or not, that there are several mechanisms for heating of solar corona, but this was one of, this was his proposal, is that since he believes in this conjecture, then Conjecture, then and taking into account this mechanism of magnetic relaxation, then he argued that the field should then relax, typically, towards a state which is an equilibrium, but it's a weak solution to the magneto-hydrostatic equation. So in particular, it has tangential magnetic field discontinuities, these weak solutions, something like vortex sheets or magnetic sheets, if you want. Or metal sheets, if you want. So, this change of topology somehow in the limiting process should be able to produce a heating of the solar corona. That's the motivation for this equation. If this is true, then you cannot relax to a smooth equilibrium. It could relax if you believe in the relaxation process. It could relax to an equilibrium that is a weak solution. It's an equilibrium with simple. weak solution is an equilibrium with singularities and then these singularities would have produced some heating some energy that it's it's inverted in heating the solar corridor that's the proposal as I said it's controversial I mean it's not something that everybody believes but it's something that even nowadays it's it's under discussion so it's not something very often to good. So what's the goal of this uh talk? The goal of this talk. So, well, there are essentially no rigorous results concerning topological polarization. This hypothesis is wide open. Although it's very nice to say that Parker has a book on this stuff. And in the book, it's not called Parker's hypothesis, it's Parker's Machinetohydrostatic Theorem. Because there is a proof, proof with notation. Very beautiful wrong proof. Wrong proof or incomplete or gap proof. But so sorry, there is there is something called albino turbulence that we can think it's really the upbend waves, yes, you mean for the heating, for the heating of the maybe that's a different proposal for heating, I'm not sure. Probably, yes. That's the dying problem. Yeah, that's the language. This is something like a topological mechanism for relaxation. It's a bit different. It's the same. So this equation formally these are steady solutions. You can have a noise theorem about this. Sorry? Adventure about topology of steady solutions. So it's just some kind of answer, partial answer to partial answers. We'll we'll see. Uh we'll we'll see later that there is some connections, yes, for sure. Um but the the problem with um um yes, yes, so okay, I'll tell you about because there are several steady states. Uh the level sets of this bar P, if they are regular, they must be dry, that's uh theorem. But uh this may have some big gradients where it vanishes the gradient, so there is a coexistence of the Trami with okay, it's uh Okay, it's uh and in any case, it's not uh it's not obvious if you try to construct a magnetic field that is not diffeomorphic to a magneto-hydrostatic equilibrium, that's not easy. It's complicated. You can try. I tried for many years. Just a comment that when these sheets form, the heating actually comes from the resistivity. In fact, it's really there. But because they become so concentrated, they heat up very fast. Concentrated, they heat up very fast. I think it's the missing physical principle of Parker's conjecture. Exactly, yes, this Parker's conjecture. But isn't it true that at least Arnois's theorem shows that not every field can be realized like this? Because it has a clear constraint. But you have the force-free fields, and for the force-free fields, there are no constraints. So maybe you have to prove that not any field is diffeomorphic. Field is diffeomorphic to a force-free field or to a coexistence. And actually, solenoidal fields typically have invariant surfaces which are tori. It's not completely, although heuristically there is no theorem in the direction. I'll tell you something about an obstruction which is related to ref cylinders. This will become at the end. But even if you have some components, Some concrete examples which are not topologically equivalent. Here in Parker, he asks about most. If most are most or are generic, is a generic magnetic field ifomorphic or not to a metal hydrostatic equilibrium? It is open, it's completely open. I believe it's true. Good. So the objective of the talk is to show that under Talk is to show that under suitable conditions, assumptions, I'm going to tell you now the setting, a generic divergence-free vector field, actually locally generic, I'll tell you the precise statement, is not topologically equivalent to a smooth magneto-hystatic equilibrium. So, first let me tell you the setting of uh that I'm going to consider. So, the setting is uh first uh domains uh in Euclidean space uh, which are toroidal domains uh which are assumed to be axisymmetric. Which are we assumed to be axisymmetric, axisymmetric to the domain, and with analytic boundary. That's a condition that appears in the pool. Second is the class of solenoidal vector fields that we consider inside the domain. This appears in the literature of solar physics. It's called the braided magnetic fields, which are magnetic fields in the domain that are solenoidal. Of course, they are tangent to the boundary, and the swill is. To the boundary, and the swill is positive, so they are rotating at any point. So V theta is the theta component of V, the identical coordinates is the swill. And I show with you now some pictures. And finally, the diffeomorphisms that we consider is polyperserving, diffeomorphisms that are diffeomorphisms from omega onto itself. So they live in invariant the boundary, but they do not need to be the identity. Just, I mean, a natural differing freezing of the many for weak boundary. It goes to itself. So, this great condition, it appears naturally in solar physics where you have bundles of radiated magnetic lines that emerge into the solar atmosphere. It's a different setting in the sense that here you have this cylindrical domain. In our stuff, our domain is closed. I mean, it's periodic. Is closed. I mean, it's periodic. It's a periodic, it's a toroidal domain. Actually, in the solar atmosphere, you have the cylinder, and here this bottom and top disk are attached somehow to the solar atmosphere. So it's an open cylinder, actually. So it's not periodic. But the braided assumption is that the lines go always in the same direction, this direction here, or this picture is. This duration here, or this picture is taken actually from uh Parker's book. And this is a bunch of magnetic lines which go from the bottom to the top, and they are braided in the sense that they could have a complicated topological structure or whatever. But I want to emphasize that in the in Parakel's problem, actually the domain is not a it's not a periodic uh ceiling, there is not a torrential domain, it's an open ceiling. Domain is an open cylinder. And I'm telling you today about the toroidal domain because I cannot prove the theorem in the open cylinder. Of course, I wanted to prove the theorem for the open cylinder, but it's hard. You can try to prove it. I mean, you don't know if something is hard of not if you don't try. Or you try to realize if it's hard or not, right? That comes down to the value. Yeah, it is related. You'll see that we use very crucially Very crucially, the periodicity because we use the PoincarÃ© map of the here, there is a transition map, of course, from here to here, but there is no recurrence. You are not. If there is time dependence in field lines of moving, you have to come up with some definition of what it means to move a field. And that is not so easy. And within MHD, you can do it, but various people have made up things in the footprints to try to. To try to be in grips with that. So, your problem is a lot cleaner. Yeah, here, yes, you're moving with the diffue. Yes, I'll state actually that my last slide, I'll go back to the Parker because actually it was the original project that I was interested in, the Parker report. Still, there are, still in plasma physics, in in this solar physics, they consider this this setting is what they call the periodic, because it's uh somehow simpler for some mathematical tools, maybe the point. Mathematical tools, maybe the PoincarÃ© section, that you can use in good. So, this is actually the tool that we'll consider. When you have this periodic toroidal domain and you have this swill positive swill, so you have a section, you have a family of disks that are transverse to the field. So, you can define certainly the first return map or concurrent map, which is, for example, which is for example is the intersection of the domain with this section for example theta equals zero so this this white section and in some sense in some very precise sense this Pancake map encodes all the dynamics of the of the magnetic field and actually this this Poincare map is something that is very well studied so it's smooth of course if the field is smooth it's a diffeomorphism of sigma and we And actually, it preserves an area measure, an area form. It's not the induced area form from the ambient to the disk. It's related actually to the theta component of the field. That's very well known also in plasma physics and in dynamical systems. But it preserves an area measure for this good. So now I think we are ready to state the theorem that we proved. The theorem that we proved. So, this is the result. So, we consider a vector field, be a vector field whose Pancari map satisfies these three conditions. The first and second are more or less typical or well-known or not-so-surprising questions. The third one is, I would say, surprising in this setting. So, let's summarize this. So, the diffeomorphism on the boundary. The boundary is a circle. Hamburg is a circle. It's Morse's male. I'm telling you now the definition of this. Morse male is something that is generic for this dimension. And I'm telling you the definition in the next of the lab. The second condition is that the diffeomorphism is non-integrable. I'm telling you what this means. And it's not obvious that a generic diffeomorphism is not integrable. It's something that you have to prove. And I'll tell you something later. And the last condition is what is The last condition is what is called in dynamical systems fast growth of periodic points. And so it's this condition, which looks a strange condition. So for certain which countable set of positive integers and j k of n, so actually for each j n on k, you have this infinite sequence, and this is for any j n and any k, so you have infinitely many families of sequence. Many families of sequences. And this is fixed by the proof. I mean, in the proof, you see what this is. Then the PoincarÃ© map, this condition says that if you count the number of hyperbolic periodic points of the PoincarÃ© map of period n, minimal period, then this number grows faster than any element of this sequence, that the superlimit, or n the infinity is infinite. This is why this is called supergrowth. Why is this called supergrowth? Because, for example, if this sequence grew exponentially with n, this would say that the number of periodic of hyperbolic points would grow faster than much faster than exponentially. Okay, so these three conditions assume that you have a vector field whose quantum map satisfies these three conditions. Then the claim is that V is not topologically equivalent to any smooth mass metro hydrostatic equilibrium, and actually this exists. This exists, it's something that we have to prove, and not only that, is that the set of vector fields that satisfy these conditions is residual, in particular dense, because it has the vert properties, in a non-empty open subset of the space of magnetic fields. We don't know if it's a residual in the whole space of, and I'm telling you something now, but this is locally residual, locally generic. There's an open subset, well this is generic, these three things. This is generic, these three things. So let me explain to you something. Well, first, the topology. This is the typical setting, it's infinity topology. This space of graded fields makes it pair a metric space. So in particular, locally residual is dense. It's locally dense. Morse's mail. So what's Morse's mail? It's a diffeomorphism of the circle which has finitely many periodic points of any number of all the periods. any number of of all the periods. I mean the the union of all the periodic points is finite. Okay, not that only that for each period is finite, but all of them is finite. And they're hyperbolic. So contraction or expansion. Okay, this most is mainly this generic in this dimension actually. Non-interval means that there does not exist a non-constant function, smooth non-constant function such that it's a first interval, h composed with phi b is equal to h. Actually, Actually, this in the proof or we give actually two proofs for this, this can be substituted by something that is stronger but more transparent, which is that the diffumor fisin, all periodic points of the diffumorphysine are non-degenerate, hyperbolic, or elliptic, and dense. These two things. If you have these two things, actually, it implies that it cannot have a first integral. If you have a diffeomorphism, A first integral. If you have a diffeomorphism, all whose periodic points are non-degenerate and they are dense, the set of periodic points dense, this turns out to be dense, actually. Which is actually very far from being obvious. That the set of diffeomorphicism of the disk which satisfy this is tense are very, very far from being obvious. And okay, so this is the meaning of this non-international. Of this, non-intervalual, more smell, is the fast row. So, finally, I want to tell you this conjecture, which is many people, in particular Timothy from Imperial College and other people, believe that actually these three conditions, well, mainly the third one, is generic on the whole set of diffeomorphisms of the disk. So this is I'm not telling you anything about this, it's related to something that is called in dynamical systems the new house domain of area preserving diffeomorphisms. Area perserving diffeomorphisms. So it is conjectured by several people that actually this new house domain is residual in the space of smooth diffeomorphisms of the disk. And if this turns out to be true, if this conjecture turns out to be true, and since that is complicated, it would imply that this set of weighted magnetic fields that are not topologically equivalent to an automagneto-hydrostatic equilibrium is dense not only on some open subset, but on the whole. Open subset, but on the whole space of radio fields. So, in this theorem, you would have almost for free just the same proof, but applying the conjecture, this genericity of the new house of n, it would imply that the set is residual in the whole b, the whole set of. But this is wide open. So, I'm finishing, I think, in the slides. So, I am not telling you anything about the proof of this. You can ask me later, of course. Just I want to. Later, of course. Just I want to introduce this slide, which is some partial auxiliary results. Oh, because I like Veltami fields. Maybe some of you know that I like Veltami fields. So I wanted to, of course, I had to write the Veltami equation in this talk. Already Eva wrote it. But this is the Euclidean standard Euclidean setting. So you can define given an omega domain, in this particular case, a total domain, you have You have the Kell operator, you can define the spectrum of the Kell operator, which is these numbers lambda, for which this has a solution, vector-friend-stanging to the boundary, and orthogonal, H-orthogonal to the unique harmonic field, the periodic domain, the original domain. The spectrum, this is well known, easy to check uh that it consists of a countable number, of uh of real numbers that uh don't accumulate at zero, they only accumulate at infinity. Zero, they only accumulate at infinity and all that. So, the theorem, a partial result that we first proved, and which is related to this first and second condition, just the Moses male and the non-interability, is that there exists a residual set. In this case, this is generic, really. There's a generic set, a dense set in the space of all these braided fields, which is non-intervable. There's a dense set of magnetic fields braided type that are non-intervable. Type that are non-integrable. And if you have a field which is non-integra in this set, then this is topologically equivalent to, and if this is topologically equivalent to a magneto-hydrostatic equilibrium, so this is much related to Boris's question at the very beginning, if you have this non-integrable field and it's topologically equivalent to an equilibrium, then it must be certainly a beltrami field because any other magnetohydrostatic equilibrium should. paragraph hydrostatic equilibrium should exhibit somewhere uh some uh invariant toroidal surface that's uh consequence equations and a lot of theorem and not only it's uh it's a veltemic field it's a veltemic field with an eigenvalue that is in this spectrum away from it cannot be away from the spectrum I mean this has solution for any lambda actually any real constant lambda but it must be in this in this In the spectrum of sigma. So, here, something that is interesting in plasma physics, because usually the this non-integraction, this is well known, this is what Boris said. If you have non-integrability, then it can only relax the force free field, october thermic field, that's well known. But then you have to prove non-integrability. You have to prove that the generic C-infinity, so in Oda field, is non-integrable. The usual, what The usual, well, not the usual, the only mechanism that I saw in the literature of plasma physics that they use to prove non-interability is topological transitivity or erodicity. Of course, if you have lines, the magnetic lines that are dense on your domain, this cannot exhibit non-constant first integrals. That's very well known. However, this works very well in the C1 topology because a generic A generic solenoidal field is indeed erobodic or topologically mixing. But this is not the case in the C-infinity topology. By K-M theorem, a generic solenoidal field has a continuous Cursing integral. Because you have this steady staircase. So non-interability is not clear in this infinity setting. Certainly a generic magnetic field. A magnetic field is not a robot in the same thing before it's not a robot. So you have to use a different mechanism, and the mechanism that you use to prove this, yes, thank you, is that this that I tell you. Well, there are, we give two proofs, but probably the more transparent is this non-generacy and density of the points. This is the mechanism that we prove to, that we use to prove non-interacting. Okay, a final slide. This is a Final slide, this is about abstractions for topological equivalence. In weak topologies, it's something that is called a red component. This is a red cylinder, so it's an invariant surface which has the the boundary consists of two periodic orbits and then this is the dynamics on over the surface. Okay, any this is a well-known lemma, it was written now by Chileva, Camborgo, probably was known before. Probably was known before. Any equilibrium, I mean, no vector field with such a common can be homeomorphic actually to a magneto-hydrostatic equilibrium. This is a consequence of Stock's theorem. That's easy to prove, probably. And using a construction that is called a Wilson-type plaque, you can prove a sort of weak density in this sense. So there is an H1, H1 dense set of divergence-free vector fields that are not topologically equivalent to a magneto-hydrostatic equilibrium. Because there is an H1 density of vector physias plugging into small radians, these cylinders, which exhibit these objects. So, this certainly doesn't work for Synfinity topology. You cannot plug this in the C topology. But in the H1, and certainly they are not braided, because this doesn't have recurrence. Okay, and my final slide, and I'm finishing, it's I wanted to go back to the Parker hypothesis because it's actually the problem that I originally The problem that I originally started to think about several years ago. So the setting is different, as I said, it's not, unfortunately, it's not the periodic cylinder, it's the vertical cylinder, let's say, the model. The set of rated fields is similar, these analogous. You have the tabergence-free vector fields that go from the bottom to the top, and the third component is positive. And the diffeomorphisms that are considered in the hypothesis are volume-preserving. And usually, the identity on the top and bottom boundaries, because you know Top and bottom boundaries because you don't want to move the foot point. I mean, you don't want to, you want to be the magnetic field anchored on the bottom and the tops, and you don't move the lines. You move just in the interior, not on the bottom and the top. And this is the hypothesis. There is a generic set of graded films that are not topologically equivalent to any smooth magneto-hydrostatic equilibrium. But unfortunately, since this is not the periodic setting, we cannot use a Frankari map. Setting, we cannot use the one-carry map, which is the beginning of the proof, to improve the dynamical systems theory in the proof. Then, this problem remains quite open. We continue to think about this, but up to now you can succeed. So, thank you. Thank you very much. Are there some questions or comments? Please? So, in the spirit of Parker's problem, I guess you could consider generalizing. I guess you could consider generalizing not conjugate smoothly through MHS solution to closing that in a strong L2 sense. Because Parker wants to say you lose an appreciable amount of magnetic energy when you change topology. You close it in some strong sense. The limit, maybe an MHS solution, with the same energy, so it doesn't lose any. So if you want to explain, so have you thought about, for your examples, are they also, is there an obstruction for them to be? Is there an obstruction for them being MHS solutions in some closures of your vault? Yeah, yeah. So actually, yeah, there is a big difference between, yeah, for example, this is very in this theorem, which is somehow classical, let's say, you can insert, given any solenoid field, you can insert somehow this cylinder. So then this is not topologically equivalent. So then this is not topologically equivalent to a finite hydrostatic equilibrium. Even with a homeomorphism, no need of hypnomorphism, but it's related to your question. But it is in the limit in the not only weak L2, but even stronger true limit, or it could be in the stronger true limit of magneto-hydrostatic equilibrium. Because it's yet you start, this is easy for the proof of this, for this Wilson-type construction. You start to deform the lines. I mean, you start with a magneto-hydrostatic equilibrium, you start to deform the lines. You start to form the lines, and at the end you break something and you create this. So it's in the limit, but it's not topologically equivalent. So, yes, the question of the limit, strong L2 closure or weak L2 closure. You have examples. You can construct, this is been done for example by Rafal Komentacic. You can construct a solenoidal vector field which has zero helicity. Has zero helicity and which has some other conditions, and then you can prove that if you consider the adjoint family, I mean, all the vector is diffeomorphic to this one, even in the weak L2 closure, you cannot have any equilibrium. But these are very concrete examples. Yeah, this is done. So there's a field, which is a weakness. There is a field which is relatively simple to construct. It's a field, I remember now, it's a field with zero helicity. Zero helicity, it's a field with zero helicity. So this immediately prevents this from being from approaching some, even we have to sense a force-free field, a volatile field, because volatic field has non-zero helicity, condition. And even in the weaker two, because the helicity is continuous in the weaker two unit the why couldn't you go to zero? But uh we're gonna feel this Python field is completely telescope. So uh and and uh so you construct this field and in this uh uh in this I mean in the set of all the vector fields either morphic to this one etc. There is no weak in the in the weak L2 closure of such a set there is no magnetohydrostatic equilibrium. This exists, but it's not generic, for example. You can perturb and then the zero helicity is a condition that is lost. Is a condition that is lost very easily. So then you cannot use the argument of zero helicity. So, for example, I don't know, yes, we tried actually with Raffle. Yes, we tried to construct, we tried to prove the following. We tried to prove that for a genetic in some domain, I don't know which domain, a toloidal or whatever, in some domain, to prove that a generic solenoidal field, if you construct, even a generic solenoidal field. A generic solenoidal field, if you construct the set of all vector fields ephemorphic to this one and you consider the weak gal to closure, that there is no magnetohydrostatic equilibrium. We didn't succeed because the non-zero helicity condition, I mean when the helicity is non-zero, then it's complicated to prove that there is no, in the Wiggle to prove that there is no force-free eclipse. But it's something around. I have some other questions. Is this applicable to the convection in the mantle of the earth? Because that would be incompressible. Maybe still can answer this one. I don't know. You mean the parfarger hypothesis? Or? Yeah, just his height. So for one thing, it doesn't have temperature. So, for one thing, he doesn't have temperature gradients. Yeah, yeah, it is not for temperature. Yeah, well, the real physical models are much, much more complicated. It's a very idealization. There was a whole lot of early dynamo work trying to explain Earth's magnetic field. Is it a weakness that you suppress the electric field? That's in the in the approximation, but it's uh ideal emission. The electric field is actually determined by the plus. Yeah, because the condition E plus B V equals zero. So it's just a maximum condition statement. So it's not in the equations. The corona of the sun there is also heat, isn't heat? So if you if you say at the mantle you need the heat gradient, you also need it at the corona of the sun. This is a simplistic model. Model. I think people, if you can't understand this, then maybe you won't be. So it's very complicated. I had a question. Do you know about the Grad conjecture? Yes. And basically he, as I understand it, said that unless you have a symmetry, you're not going to get an interval, full collection of interval. Exactly. Yes. So, where does that fit in here? No, this is not working. It's not Drummond anymore. Yeah, it's not the Drummy. In RAD, it's with the Bernoulli function. And no, no, the proof that we give, I think it doesn't give any hint. It doesn't, because you're using the same boundary conditions and whatnot. It's certainly the setting of the toroidal domain. That's the same. That's uh the same. Uh although in grad you don't need to assume in principle this brave structure, but but no, I would say he's saying that you cannot make a yeah yeah, so I would say yes. It's a problem this rather very interesting in the same setting of this marketostatic equilibrium, but
