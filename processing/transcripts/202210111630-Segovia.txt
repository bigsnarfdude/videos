One of the locals, Carlos Egovian, is going to tell us about the classifying space of the G coordinates in category. Thank you very much, Mauricio, for the presentation. And I also want to thank you to the organizers, Omar Antolin, Andrew Baker, Tobias Bartlett, and Unrika Tillman. It is a pleasure to be here and to talk about the classifying space. About the classifying space. This was already accepted for publication in the next year in Homology, Motopy, and Application. So let me talk about how I came to this subject. It was in my PhD that I read a paper of Tilma and well, and then I decided to. I decided to do the geek version. And well, we'll see during the talk. And this is the plan of the talk. I will talk about how to define the coverage category and the Tillman method. That was, I think, was the first time that somebody was care about the classifying space of the coverance category in dimension two. And then I will define what is the G coverage category. Is the G coverage category, and we will analyze the component components that you will see is there will be the algorithm of the group, and we will prove some splitting sections for the fundamental group of the coverage category. And also, we will see what's happened for the classifying space, how we can be splitting as this product, this three time three. Product, this three time, three spaces. And I encourage all the people to be awake for the application. That will be the more interesting. Okay. The usual alcoholic category in dimension two has objects and morphemes given as follows. The objects are finite Dijon unit of circles that we will put an order and that is the An order that is equivalent to put just an element in some cushion of symmetric groups, and the morphemes will be two-dimensional coverts that are manifolds of dimension two, oriented, compact, that not essentially closet, but up to the few amorphous. So, here we have some examples. This is morphines from the disjunction of three circles to the dision union of three circles. Sircos to the union of three silk costs, and it's right in terms of some elementary components given by pair pans, cylinders. Here we have another element that go from the empty set. Here, yeah, it's a a handle that goes for the empty For the empty one-dimensional manifold to one dimension. And here we have a pair of pants with multiple legs that go from three to one. So this is the elements of the coverings category. And let me say that the Tilman method, this we locate in the year of 1996, when it was published this paper, and she defined that moment. In that moment, some subcategories, and then using these subcategories, she can be able to prove something for the classifying space. So let me say why are they? The sigma zero is the full subcategory of sigma with only one object given by the empty one-dimensional manifold. So these elements are just These elements are just the John Union of closed surfaces, and they are given just by the genus. S bigger than zero is the subcategory of S with the same objects of S except for the empty manifold and where each connected component of every morphism has not empty incoming boundary and not empty outgoing boundary. So, here I put some counter examples, something that there are. Something that they are not allowed in this subcategory, something that starts from the empty set is not allowed, something that end in the empty set is not allowed, but also you can have some morphemes that go from something that in boundary that are not that is not empty, but in some moment, some component can arrive to the empty set. Component can arrive to the empty set, and this is also not allowed, you know. And also, we have some category that is really similar. This is the posited boundary subcategory that is the subcategory with the same objects of the cover disk category, where each connected component of every morphine has not empty outgoing boundary. So, in this case, this is not allowed. And S1 is And S1 is the full subcategory of S biggest nano with only one object given by the circle. And you can imagine an amorphous here, so this has only one object, the stair circle, a morphism is something like that, something that is defined by the genus. And you can ask to the little princess from this picture, what did you see? Maybe an elephant with three legs. Relax now. Okay. So and so you can find then this isomorphism. S0 is just the infinity product of the natural numbers. S1, they are defined by the natural numbers as just the natural, it's the natural numbers. So the classifying space is the infinite-dimensional torque. The infinite-dimensional torus, and the BS1 is the circle. And I think the second part of the method of Tilma is the definition of this fontor, that is in terms of the Euler characteristic. This map is constant, is the constant map in objects because this category has only one object. And each morphine. And each morphins with incoming circles, C connected components, and unus G and N outgoing boundary and outgoing circles is mapped to the following quantities. It's the Hall of N minus N minus the other characteristics. But you can just make the calculation and this is the same that G plus M minus the connected components. And you can see that here, you observe the genus. So you observe the genus, but these are the exits, meaning the connected components. And we can put a geometric meaning to this. For example, here, sigma is a morphine from four to four. So it's just this part. And you can glue at the right pair of pants with multiple legs. And then after that, you count the genus, the genus of the whole. genus of the whole procedure and you count and this is two so here we have for example here it's one genus is one and then here we have four minus three so it's two sorry is uh we have four and this is three and it's only one one genus generated no so we have at the end two genus no so i use this procedure I use this procedure later in the GKEAM process. But you cannot say the following: this functor and the inclusion, I think you cannot see there, but it's just the inclusion of the sigma one into sigma bigger than zero. So, and we have the following: this composition of the perpetuates with multiple levels. Of the pair of pants with multiple legs, just you can't push your finger here and push, and you can push all to the right. But what this say is that we have the following commutative diagram. We can put here P sub N is your is just the pair of pants with n entries and one exit. Pn is the same. So if we put sigma, we have sigma, and then the composition will be. Sigma and then the composition with the paper pants is just this is the left part, and the composition of the top and the right part is just this part. But what it says, we have, since this is just the inclusion product by phi, so you have something that end in one, in one circle, so the purple punch that you glue is just the identity, so you don't do nothing. So, you don't do nothing. So, this is just the entity. But in the second, if we observe this square, this gives just a natural transformation. It's a natural transformation that goes from this composition to the identity of this subcategory. So, why does say if we put classifying spaces, well, the natural transformation transform into a motor equivalent, so we can say that this. That is this subcategory you can see we can observe that it's really big, so it has a lot of morphines, but really the classifying space collapsed to the circle. Okay. And since we have the category and this functor phi is defined in terms of the elder characteristics, so we can just put negative numbers and we can just extend to the natural number. Just extend to the natural numbers, just allowing the negative values. And then this composition, which is just an amotopic kilo, but we can, these are symmetric monora categories. So the classifying space, there are infinite in those spaces. So this, in essence, gives a splitting of the classifying space of the covenants category. And the fiber. And the fiber is just the homotopy fiber, but it's just the homotopy fiber of this filter. So, this omotopy fiber is going to be also an infinity loose space. So, we can summarize all the results that I put the classifying space of all the subcategories. This is the infinity torus, and all of these subcategories are of the same circle, and the whole, the classifying. And the whole classifying space of the whole coverance category is split as the product of the circle and x, where x is the multiplier and is an infinitive space. And I own that to prove that the classic the fundamental group of the covenants categories are the integers, but we will prove later. But this also says that it's simply connected. And then after this came with the After this came with the whole story and came then in the year of 2009, this paper about the Galaxian maximum Tilman bias, where they find the omotipitai of the commodities category in any dimension. But this is a little bit quite different in the category because it is defined in terms of embeddings of manifolds. So this category, in certain sense, is discrete, it has not It has not the poly, but we can compare the first the component compass and the fundamental group for each category. This was the results of Tilma. And then later with all these professors, they proved that also the same, but the classifying space is of the motop type of certain tone spectrum. That is just a generalization of this important. Generalization of this important theorem of Pontragon construction just by seeing the connected components. So after that, I'm going to talk about what is the case of the G-equivariant case. So I will take as objects our principal bundles over circles and also the Disjoint unit. Circles and also the decision units of that. But in terms of a combinatorial way, we can treat in terms of sequence orderer that each elements, the notes, an element in G or the zero. And what I mean with that, an element, so they represent the union of principal G bundles over the circle for X in G. In G and or the empty G bundle for X equal to zero. The morphins are three coordinates classes of principal G bundles where we are going to take up to boardings. So we have the usual diagram in order to define the right definition of a covenant class. But imagine the same for principal Gibond. So you have a Same for principal dubundos. So you have a diagram that goes outside the screen with all with principal dubundos, and everything is just commutative as what it should be. And we have here examples of principal dubundos over the circle. Let me just here, and we are assuming, this is very important, we are assuming that we take a base point in the base space. In the base space, and also we take a base point in the fiber that projects to the base space. So I take a subcategory and all the other objects that are isomorphisms to that. So I'm taking really what I'm considering is an equivalence category. And for example, here we have these examples. If we take the cycle group in four elements, Group in four elements, and we consider as a multiplicate structure, we can take just this element associated in order to construct the principal Debundos. And we are going to call this the monodromy. That is just the lifting, and then you count in certain things, all the steps that you have to walk in order to arrive from the base point in order, which is sended by the action. And then, for example, for the generation. And then, for example, for the generator, the order is four, so we have the identification here, is the just the multiplication by x, and then the multiplication by x, and also, and so we have only the total space is a circle, and the projection is a map of degree four. But just take x two, so we have an element of there two, so There are two, so you can find that the total space is the union of two circles, but each one projects to by a map of degree two. We can also do the same for S3. And here you can see that the multiplication is, for example, for A, yeah, it's multiplication by the right. So, and we can have these kinds of coverings, yeah. Okay. Okay. In order to treat the covenants category for the jequeren case, I use a song combinatorial way. And so I put everything in terms of elementary components. So let me explain what are they. The first is the cylinder. And for the cylinder, we can prove that if we start by a monodov X, then the exit has to be a concocation. To be a concocation, and you can prove this, just put it, for example, by the homotopy lifting. So you lift the cylinder, the cylinder itself, and then you start with some with the monodromy X, and then you can prove that the right, it doesn't go to the same point. And this freedom is this seed, is the concugation, in order to. And for example, here is X and Y has to arrive to XJ. So in these pair of plants, in essence, there has no area. So they are really, they are thin. We are considered principal G bundles that has the base space of the waste of two circles. And then the principal G bundles are in essence the G-deformment to this. G-deformment to this principal g bundance over the waist of the silica. So, because you can think of principal genders over pair pines where the x's are twisted by some monodromy. For the disk, since this is contractible, the only possibility is to have the trivial bundle. And here we have an example of some principal G-bundle over the handle, but the important Handle, but the important thing here is that by this, all the all these combinatorial data, you can prove that the exit has to be a commutator. And this is really important for us. And also, if you put another handle with different holes, we can prove that this is also an element. The exit has to be an element of the commutator group. So let's see what happened for the connector. For the connected components. For the connected components, you can just start with some sequence with all elements different for zero. And why? This is because of the existence of the disk. Every element that is assigned to the zero, you connect to some element that is neutral in the group. So we can start by some sequence on every element. By some sequence, every element is different from zero. And after that, we connect all these sequences by the multiplication, just by the pair of paths we need to do x. So we reduce just the problem to the connected of elements that has base space only one circle. And if you just you can just disregard, yeah, we can disregard all the connected components. All the connected components with that are closed because yes, we can throw away. So there are two cases that there are two cases. This there are the base space is connected or is not connected. And it is not connected, but it's in method that one of the exit has to be, the two exits are the exit of a hundred body. So there are commutators. But if they are connected, let's say. But if they are connected, let me just put it in a picture. Yeah, they are connected. Yet you can do the following. You could put a handle. So, and here it says that they differ by some commutator. So, what we proved is that this is just the relation where we are identifying two elements in the group that they are right in order to. Yeah, to in order to put all the connected components, they are connected if only if they differ by an element of the commutator group. Consequently, the connected components is the same as the evaluation of the group. That is quite big respect. So by all these things of omotopy theory, since the class The components category is a symmetric monoidal category. The classifying space is an A space, but also with a Belian fundamental group. So any two connected components has the same homotopy. Then you, the homotopy is just by product with these paired bands. So really, what we care is just the one we can choose one component, and always we are going to choose the component of the empty. Component of the empty trivial wander. And so, to pass and to find the fundamental group of the covenants category, we are going to use this theory, the localization of a category. We choose a category that we are going to use that is connected. That we are going to use that is connected. And we can choose a substantial morphism, and the localization in this morphism is just given by a category and a functor that satisfies the following. Every element sending to the localization is invertible, and also we have this universal property. But using something that is saying in Something that is said in this paper by Quillen, algebraic high-chi-theory, we can start that this universal property in essence say that the invertible fontors from C to sets is in correspondence to the fontor from the localization, where here is the whole morphemes in the category to sets. And we can go by this by the left part, and this is. The left part, and this is the same of the equivalent to the coverings of the classifying space. So you have a covering over the classifying space, then you have the fiber, and then just by the lifting, every morphine is a line, and then you lift, and then this gives you an invertible filter. Yeah. And this is the same also. And this is the same, also is equivalent to the phonors. This is just the actions of the fundamental group, the classifying space to sets. Here we have some more reconstruction, but in the right, this is because we're taking the categories connected, also we had an equivalence with fontors from the automotive group of in based in some point to sets. So at the end, I said this. At the end, I said this was not a turn, just some comment by Quilen that there is an isomer from the fundamental group of the classifying space of a category based in an object of the category with the automatised group of the localization in an object of the category. And so here we are going to find the localization. To find the localization. And this is my seal in this talk. We know by the work of Gabriel and Sisman that if we have a localizing set, then the category of fraction has an easy description. So let me recall you what is a localizing set. We have a substitute on morphines, and we say that this is a localizing. And we say that this is a localizing if sigma contains the identities and also is clustered under composition. And also, we have that for amorphins, an element in the set here, so we have here S and F, we can find an element in the set an amorphous that we can close this square. Also, we have some condition of equalization that it Of equalization that if we have two pairs of morphemes from the same and the same start and target, then if there can be equalized at the end, we can equalize it by, we can start choose a T and we can equalize also this. No, so this is just an if only if. And the theorem of Gabriel and Seisma say that if you have that condition, Seisma says that you have that condition, so the category of fraction associated to this set of morphemes can be described in an easy way by these kinds of roofs. A root is something that is composed by amorphins in the set that we are localizing and unusual morphines in the usual category. But this has a That this has an equivalence that if we have two we have two roots that this is S, F T G, they are equivalent and we can find another root such as all the diagons has to commute. And the identities are just the pair of the pair of identities, but also you can prove that f, f, there are also identities and the composition we use. Composition: We use some of the hypothesis that we put to localize the set that the composition of this and this by the hypothesis we can find another roof and then the composition of this and this is going to be the composition of the roof. So let me say what's happened then, how you use this in the covers category. So I put it in step. So, I put it in steps. The first step is: we consider the subset of morphemes that I put the same notation of the paper Tilma, just a tilde, which the meaning, this is forget of this category that I told before. This another, this is the nose as total morphisms. This is the disjoint union of identity G covering this over cylinders. Cover this over cylinders and G cover this over closed switch waves. So let me just put an example here that is: we have something that start and end in the same, but also we can have some closed G over this. So this they are like that. And we can observe. We can observe that this is a localization set. And this is just, we can see really easy. Let me just put again the definition of localizing set. This contained identities. You drop the clusters of places. This contained identities. Also, it's clustered under composition. This is really easy. And also this, you have this two morphemes, one in. Two morphemes, one in the subset, then this arrives to the end of the G cobones, but you can put it in the start. So you have something like here, something here arriving here. But you can just transpose, you put your race here and you put it at the beginning. And this says that has satisfies the. Has satisfies the second property of localizing, but also this: this is just a transportation of the closed surface. So it's really easy that this satisfies to be a localizing set. Okay, so therefore, the categorical fraction can be described by roots. And I'm going to denote this by identities, this young unit with gamma, and gamma will be denoted. Gamma and gamma will be the node G coordinates over closed surfaces. And this is just a useful G coordinates. So as previous, we showed that all the connected components have the same omotivity type, so we can restrict to objects of sigma which are in the connected component of the empty G bundle. And for amorphous, And for amorphous, we have to produce the inverse. And in order to produce this inverse, we will do as follows. Since we are in the connected component of the empty G bundle, so we can put more things that start in Y. This is Y hat, the not a vector. A vector, it's a vector of monodromies. So we can put something that arrives here and arrive to the entity bundle. And then we can consider the gluing of sigma with this. So we arrive at a morphism that starts in N hat X to the empty bundle. And the proposal for the inverse is the following. So maybe here is. Following. So, maybe here it's good to put some pictures because I'm going to do a lot of pictures on here. We have the morphins x, and this is just the identity, and this is sigma, where I do. sigma where I to y so I have to propose something for the first is the identity the joint unit this with this and this is just a close it so you you put sigma x sigma and then we close it for the empty and this is delta y is delta y so you can just this is sigma and then this is delta y and we are going to call this sigma prime but then that notation say is sigma prime and this the underlying means to traverse in the other directions and then sigma prime Sigma prime. And this is just a decommission over a closed phase. And here we are going to arrive. This is sigma prime, sigma prime. And if we compose these two rules, These two groups, we arrive to this composition. So we can impose the equivalent relation generated by this identification in order to put these two elements as the same, in order to have F F now, and that this is the identity. And we can say this is not, this is really This is really suited. We have two elements are equivalent. You can produce, we can arrive from one to another by a finite number of steps using this identification and also in a monoidal sense. And this gives you a coefficient category. And what we proved is that there is an isomorphism of the category of. Of the category of fractions in terms of this coefficient category localizing in this set of morphemes. But also the next step is that to prove that this relation is implied by only one relation. And this is the relation that you have the cylinder, the sphere, but with principal G bundles, there are all three. Principal G-bundles, they are all trivial. This is the same as the disk composition of disk. And I can prove this in this, for example, if we have sigma, we can use this relation and then. And then we can just use the connected component, and this will produce a sphere. And a sphere, but it's not a spher, it's a principal human over the sphere, the unit principal. And you can code here by the monodrome in the monodrome going in one side and then reverse. And this you can just. And this you can just is this the same you have here sigma sigma one traversed in the other direction and since you have the circle this is the same as to have this is a graphical graphical proof but you can put we can put really in the paper is explaining very well. So now we are going to show how this works in order to give you the splitting. The fundamental group can be identified by the automorphisms in this localization. Localization. So the monoid consists of pairs where the composition is just this pair of sums. Because you can see here, because the composition is just the disjoint union. So at the end, you arrive to something that is abelian. And we define the homorphins for the fundamental group to this, that is just the That is just the free covert group in dimension two, the oriented case by just by the rest. And this is well defined because this, the previous relation, this is up to cover this relation. This just says that the connected zoom is the same as this John Union, only that there is a punish by. So, there is a punish by a principal Gibundo of L sql. So, they say that this map has a fiber given by the principal Gibundo of L sql, and this is what generates the integers. So, the splitting is a little bit subtle, and this starts with a G-cobernis, and we separate along every simple clustered curve with trivial monotony, and we can cap with to this for every time. Can capture with two this, where every time we separate, we add a negative. So, here we recall how we can't understand this group. There is an homology definition, there is a commology definition, but also there is a paper by Miller where she can understand this very geometrically, and you can start with. And you can start with a principal G-bundle, and then you can code all the trivial monodromy, and you can find the generators. And after that, you take the Grottenic construction, and this gives you the two-dimensional vortex group. So what we do is we can find, we start with an element here, and then you could all the trivial monodromy, and you can arrive to this element. To this element. And this gives you just the splitting for the sequence. So we have the splitting, this splitting chorus act sequence, and this proves that the fundamental group is just the integers plus the Bourdieu group in dimension two. For the classifying space, we can define similarly the subcategories. This is the subcategories. The case of the S0G, the elements are principally bundled over closed subfaces. The subcategory bigger than zero, they are not allowed these cases. And S1, only you put that the objects are principally bundled over only one circle. Also, we have an adjoint functors. Have an adjoint functors that is left adjoin, and we have also the same figures. But here, there's some assumption, very important, that every G-cobernis with connected base and not empty incoming boundary has to be factorized through pre-composition of the G-cover disk. And the reason for that is that if we don't, this is like. We don't, this is like all our morphemes are balanced. All the monodromy appear to the right. You cannot allow, you can push all the monodromy to the right. And here you can, there are no monodromy that twist the entries. And this is because if we don't do that, we are not going to have these kinds of pictures of diagrams. Okay. Okay, and in summary, what we arrive is that the same that the classifying space of S0G is the infinity torus, these categories has the same classifying space of S1G. In some cases, we can find this classifying space. This is not the circle. And for the other, we can find that the classifying. Here we can find that the classifying space of the whole covenants category is the connected components, product, and splitting, and where xg is an infinite loss space with fundamental group equal to the Bordeaux group in dimension two. For this, we also for this, we also produce the this font or phi in this case and In this case, and it's a little bit complicated how to define that, and we have to also assume this condition. But where we are taking is the case where you take the trivial G bundle to the trivial G bundle and pre-simple G bundles that have a base space which is connected. So, and this is also the natural numbers. Well, so the applications from my the first application come in the this work by Bogstein and Svein, where they work in the embedded coverage category, this cover this category studied by Galassian, Matson, Bisentilma, and they can put the fundamentals. They can put the fundamental group in terms of the form of these classes closer up to the chimera relation. The chimera relations are the following. You start with these two and then you permute just w1. Now it's glued with w4 and w3 is glued with w2. And we can make the calculation. We can make the calculation in terms of rules, and we can arrive to also to that calculation. And how much do I have? 10 minutes, 15? Okay, so I can put the calculation for the general relation. Okay. Okay. Let me say how that works. We can start by the left W one W three four Or okay. And we can put here W one W one W four One W two W two W3, but also we have to do the inverse. So, here we can identify the right bar is this. And we want to do and this. And here we can just, well, we can then connect this with this. W one w two W1 and we can use again the relation that this is just that this part only this part is W2 W2 plus W1 with W1 so at the end we can kill this with this End, we can kill this with this and this with this, and we arrive to the chimera relations. And this also works in any dimension. Okay. Okay, the next application is something that we have in the last paper with Bernardo, Andres, and Eric. That is the Snide and Klen boarding that is defining in terms that you have a In terms of that you have some boardings and then you make a surgery, and then after that surgery, you can glue as you want, and then this arrives to this night in chain boardings. In that moment, let me explain the components of this sequence. All these are exact. He has, we have here the Bogomolov multiplier. Molov multiplier. This is the free two-dimensional Bordis-oriented group associated with the group of D. These are the toral classes. And here is the fundamental this splitting stack segment that I show it. But also you can just put it the Snyden-Klen relations to this construction. And also you can put the same split in SAC sequences. And you You push the usual covenants category to the covenant category with this relation, then the kernel will be the Torre classes. So we will arrive at this fundamental group of this new Sneid-Claire and coverance category is just the sum of the integers plus the Bookmalo multiplier. And this is something that was Was proved by Newman that the Snyden, the Bornines, Sneiden Clemens, dimension two, is right as this tilde, and he proved that this is the Bogomodov multiplier plus S Q2. And in order, I'm going to say two more things in terms of. Things in terms of figures is how do you find this group? How do you prove that it's the integers? And this is the idea for that. And the other, I will say, how you will eliminate the principal G bundles with genus one. Suppose That you have some genus. So, and put it on an sphero, and spher, and then you could buy here and buy here. So, we have here some genus 2, but then you can identify as this. As this, no? So then it's the same relation that I start and that I reduce all the identification for the fundamental group of the covenants category. And a spherical connection, yeah, connection between manifolds. So you know that the Taurus, the Taurus is trivial in Snide in Heaven. You have Night in heaven. You have the torus, we can prove that this is trivial. Why? Because you just make the surgery with something like this, and then you cool it here, and then you just put it here. And so the term is trivial. So at the end, everything in the Grotenid construction, we arrived at just you count how many spares and negative squares you have, and this gives you the somorphism with. This omorphies with the interiors. And for the other part, in order, maybe you can ask me: how do you trivialize the principal rebundles with genes one? And for that, you can start with an element in terms of this combinatorial way that I put it that you put here. It that you put here some configuration h and you can write to g is h g h one and these are all the lines you need in order to to manage some element like that and every that or every of that elements you can just take a sword and you can divide by the by the middle so in essence they are has some double construction so they can just is They can just, it's the gluing of two cylinders. You glue by the right, but they are the same, so they have the same symmetry. And I don't know, I can put it another letter, H1, H prime. And then you can glue this with the same, with the lower part. You can just glue it here. You can glue it here. And this is also. And this is also H1 by the with the with the it's also to be h1 but with minus one yeah minus one so at the end you arrive to two connected components when this the the monodromy in some other uh generations of the trivial there are that has trivial monodromy yeah and the trivial monodromy yeah you can eliminate You can eliminate that, you can here, you can use some you apply some dense twist. So you can put the monodrome in here. And with some sphere, you kill it. So they are eliminated in the book on the multiply. Okay. Okay. And last, I want to make some generalization of some theorem by Tilma about some application to TKFT. We can start by a full term and some of the techniques here is that the category S bigger than zero is not monoidal. What is missing there is because you There is because you not allow the MTG bundle to you have to do it monoidal. And for that, if you put the condition that you add trivial one, trivial principal one, you add principal one of the reserves, and then you say, well, we're going to put all these relations, and then it's a possible way to do that monoidal. So believe me that, then this say that. Then this says that the canonical functor for the coverance category to the category of fraction can be factorized by this category with some additional relation. So if you have any fontor, then you can make a factorization by this category. And you can push the adjoiners that are joiners that are in this category and S1G also with this relation you can put in this in this term so every element so you can start with with every sigma every morphism and then you push it here and you have this adjoining so you have a way to factorize yeah in terms of payroll pants and also some generalization of the fund or fee so Funt or phi. So F sigma can be factorized as follows. And the case produced by Tilma was for the integers, but you can take also any abelian group and you can take a morph like that. And this S Cn is just the image of in the purple pants. And minus Cm is this will be this part. This will be this part, and here is just the genus, and also the genus transformed into spheres. So, we have a form in order how to write any morphism in terms of phi. We can take an invertible symmetric monoidal functor, and this is in this paper by Turaev on autopica topological quantum theory. Topology quantum theory, it says that if this invertible, so all the elements associated to each monodrome has to be isomorphic. So the closet part has to be that this is, we know this that this invertible symmetrical monodial fun to produce a Frovenus algebra, but a G-Frovenus algebra. So we have this zoom over all the monodromies in the group where the Group where the product of two generators has to be the same up to some cosycle. And how to understand this in terms of this part is that we can every since this is invertible, so this factorized by the category of fractions, and f is completely determined by the restriction to this. Completely determined by the restriction to the automorphic group of the MTG bundle. And plus, an image generated set of the monoid, this is some monoid of handles. But the important here is that this induces a representation of the fundamental group. As we show, the fundamental group is this flow. So in the case of Tilma, you erase the second part, and thus we have some. And thus, we have some map from the integers to the nod units of C, and but we thought this was the invertible case. For any symmetrical monodal functor, we can consider again the subset of morphemes of those and domorphs of the union of the identity Herc over this and Kerk over this over closed spaces. And also here, we can produce the same thing. So you have a closed So, you have a closet, you have a principal bundle over a closed surface, and you can just cut it by the half, and you have two copies. This is a double construction, and by the node generation, so there are we have here, there are by the node generation, this implies that we have to assign to that elements a non-zero complex number. So we can prove that at least every TQFT, these kinds of functors, at least. These kinds of filters are factorized by this localization. And these are the references. And thank you very much. Questions for people who can just unmute themselves and ask. Sorry, can I have a brief question about whether there exists a similar splitting of high B B C say B C three for example as you started with As you started with Tillman's theorem about BC2, I think, which he splits as one cross X. Could you repeat one action? Sorry for connection. You started with a theorem about, I think, BC2 space as one cross X, where X is. Where X is an infinite log space. Yes. I'm just wondering if there is a similar description, non-equivariant of, say, BC3, BC4 in small dimensions. Or is there any stuff like that for, say, not only for C1, but C1, C3, for example, C4. But for that, you are considering you are talking about the dimension of the covenant category? No, no, no, I mean another Ethereum you started with in your slides. Further up waits. One slide more, please. Yeah, yeah, here it is. Yeah, in the middle, B curly S is split as one cross X, where X has now, I see, an explicit description in a preprint. Yeah, and Is there a similar theorem for further, for example, dimensions, lower dimensions, like this? Yeah, you mean higher dimensional categories, no? Yeah, but not too high. Yeah, but not too high. I mean, for example, like in algebraic K theories, it's always very hard, for example, to describe even K4. So is there any chance, for example, in this business to get a similar description, explicit description of BC3, for example. Yeah, you say something about. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you say something about I think in order to give these kinds of description, then you have these words only you can have these kinds of diagrams. So here the circle will be a higher dimensional sphere. Yeah, for example, two spheres, for example, to start with. Yeah, but I think you will have not the whole category. You will have a subcategory of that dimension. Of the of that dimensional coverage category? Ah, so if dimensions become higher, then you have to deal with higher categories, right? Yeah, but this process only works for some two categories of that category. But the fundamental group construction, this work for any category. This localization. This localizing process works for any category, but this splitting, no, I don't know, no, no, yeah, I understand that about localizing, but whether so you are you are saying that, for example, for spheres, one has to pass to two categories, right? Yes. Okay, okay, just for curiosity. Thank you. So creative. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Can you go back to the first of your applications? No, no, no, the applications at the end. Ah, they were the first application. Yeah, yes, this process relations are satisfied. Yeah, yeah, this works for NET and also. D yeah, and also you can prove the same Terminal relations. But so, do you know about the map on pi one if it's uh so in pi one they are the same? Oh, yeah, but you only okay, yeah. So what I don't know, nothing is in pi two in pi two, even though I don't know if this are p-morphins. Um, like we should paint a Like we should paint a couple of segments.
