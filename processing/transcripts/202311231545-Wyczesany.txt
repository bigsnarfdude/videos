I will again indeed talk about the Blaschka-Synthelotype inequality for dual polarity, and this is a joint work with Shirley, Einstein, Abdem and Tresa Dost. So before I get to what the dual polarity is, let me start with our favorite normal classical polarity. So this is a reminder. You can think about a polarity as a transform from subsets of Rn to subsets of Rn, which when given a set K, its polar is simply given by all the elements Y. All the elements y, which scalar product with x is less than or equal to 1 for all x's in k. So, things that we noted about polarity. There is quite a few. So, first of all, the image of the transform is the class of closed convex sets which include origin. And in fact, on this class, polarity is a duality. Moreover, we know that if polarity is applied twice, we simply get a convex how of k with you. Convex how of k with the origin. So indeed, if we have a close convex set that includes origin, right, its convex how with zero will be the set itself. Moreover, the only invariant set of this duality is the Euclidean unitable. And finally, we have the Blaschka-Sanderlow inequality, which for centrally symmetric convex sets can be stated as follows. On the left-hand side, we have the so-called volume product. It's the volume of the set K times the volume. It's the volume of the set k times the volume of k polar, and that's maximized by the volume of the Euclidean ball squared. So this is quite a classical result. It has many extensions. In particular, the sets don't necessarily need to be centrally symmetric. It's enough that we have the center of mass at Dorge, and we can even extend it further and introduce translations, but this is not something that I want to focus. So what I'll be wanting to achieve is an inequality of a similar type. An inequality of a similar type, however, instead of volume, I'll be considering a different measure because my sets will be convex, but they will not necessarily be bounded. So in that case, talking about volume will be pointless. Okay, so it turns out that polarity fits into like a broader scheme of dualities, and in particular, order-reversing quasi-involution. So let me tell you what that is. If you give me a set, then a transform from Then a transform from subsets of x to subsets of x is an order-reversing quasi-impolition if the following two properties hold. For any subset k of x, we have that k is a subset of tk, so the transform applied twice. And if I have L, which is a subset of k, then tk is a subset of t L. So this is the order of reversion here. Clearly, polarity. Clearly, polarity satisfies both. Moreover, as I said, polarity can be viewed as a duality on this smaller subplus. And this is a general phenomenon. So if I restrict myself to the image of the transform T, that is I'll consider just the sets K, for which there exists some subset of X such that K is the image T, it's equal to T L, then T is indeed a duality on. Indeed, a duality on this image. So it's an order-reversing involution. And then this can be very easily seen. So, for example, if I have a K, you have from quasi-involution one inequality, one inclusion. And if I apply this inclusion to, I have applied T to both sides, we have by order reversion that Tk contains T T K. So we have equality on the equal. Equality on the image. Right, so starting from there, it turned out in sort of a sub-branch of what we were doing with Shiri and Shai that we stumbled across this general notion of duality, which we call cos duality. So what the cosduality is? And I'll say why cos duality. So if I have a function from x to x to a real number, including possibly plus infinity, which is symmetric, Which is symmetric, then for any subset of x k, we define its c dual to be all the points y such that for all x's in k, the cost function, c of xy, is positive. In our original definition, we introduce a parameter t, so we say c of xy is greater equal than t. But of course, this constant can be incorporated into my cost function, right? Now, a word-why cost function. So, this showed up when we were studying. And so this showed up when we were studying transportation of measure was caused that attain infinite values and one had to figure out which measures are compatible. And it turned out that this was one of the important ingredients of that compatibility. But it turned out to be very interesting on its own, as it turns out that if you give me an order reversing quasi-evolution, no matter what it is, I can express it using a cause. Express it using a cost duality. Moreover, the cost I have to use may only attain, may only be two values, plus and minus one, say, for simplicity. So here's the theorem. If you give me an order of estimating pollution, then there exists a cost function such that Tk is equal to Kc. So, a brief word about the proof. This is, in fact, surprisingly simple because it turns out that That this cost can be very easily defined via the pairs of points such that y is in the image of the point x. And then I can define the cost c to be simply 1 when my point is in this magical set and minus 1 otherwise. If you write this down and you write what kc is, you will very quickly see that it's contained in tk. You may need to use one property of order-reversing causing evolutions, namely that they are closed under intersections. That is, that, so, or more precisely, that the intersection, you have any family of sets of Tki is equal to T of the union over INI of Ki. This is just one of the proof, but really, the proof is two lines. But this allows us to. But this allows us to come up with your favorite duality, right? You choose a set and you define the cost this way and you can consider a duality in this way. Or another way, you can also choose your favorite cost and produce dualities. The issue with choosing the cost is that if you have duality, the costs corresponding to it can be very different, right? For polarity, I mean, this For polarity, I mean, the theorem tells you that I can choose a cost that is plus or minus one, but in the setting, I can write that the cost function is one minus collaborative x y. This corresponds to our usual polarity. So this is not unique as a representation. So it seems to be much better to work with those assets. In this way, we are able to describe, of course, our origin symmetric context sets. Symmetric context sets. We can talk about duality on unconditional bodies, on star-shaped sets, on there's many reciprocal bodies, flowers. Sometimes you need to consider a complement as well. What we're really thinking is that this equality shows you that the family, if there was a duality or the reversing duality, then this family needs to be close. Then this family needs to be closed under intersection. So, for example, on zoonotops, you can't expect having a well-lined sphere. So, now to the main character of my talk, so the dual polarity. Dual polarity, so maybe how do I define in general a dual duality? If you give me an order-relating quasi-involution, then it has this associated set S. I wrote it slightly different. Set S. I wrote it slightly different. You can convince yourself that the set S that I had here gives you is exactly the same as the set here. So don't worry about this difference too much. So we define then the dual order of a syncosine volution by saying I'm taking the complement of the set ST and taking a closure. I take the closure not to have issues with measurability or anything like that. And so now I can introduce with the dual problem. Introduce what the dual polarity is. And the dual polarity, the set associated to it, is simply the set of points x, y such that the scalar product is greater or equal to 1. And the associated transform is, of course, of course, this transform here. Which you may readily notice, this is very similar, or in fact, up to reflection the same of what Deeping was saying earlier, right? So this Right, so this dual polarity is what other people have been working on. So, deeping with his collaborators or Schneider, they call it often a copolarity. I don't think I personally was aware of that name when we were talking about this, so we talked about it as a dual polarity. Right, so let us think about what this duality does. So, first of all, the image consists, of course, of the intersections of affine half spaces that do not include the origin. That do not include the origin. Moreover, you can see that this will be unbounded, closed, and convex sets. And there is one more characteristic of it: namely that this class of the image of global polarity are all closed convex sets k that do not include origin and satisfy this sort of column-like property that lambda times k is a subset of k for all lambda greater or equal than 1. Now, in order to present to you the main theorem that I'm wanting to present, I want to discuss this class a little bit more. So, first of all, the class decomposes into subclasses. Namely, for any unit vector, sorry, for any set in my C, I can find its closest point to the origin. And if the point closest to origin lies on the ray, lies on the ray u times r plus, where u is a unit vector, then we'll say that this set is in the subclass C. It turns out, of course, that for any vector u, this class is invariant under t, and this can be seen very easily. Namely, if I take a set in my class, I introduce two special sets. I introduce a half space in which k is contained, and I intersect. And I introduce a ray which is included in k. And in this case, a is a special number such that a times u is the point in k closest to the origin. Now if you apply a transform t to h and l, you will see that by the order reversion we'll have this following inclusion. And by easy calculation you'll see that the image of T L is a half space such that here we have a constant one over a. Here we have a constant 1 over a, and the image of the half space is again the ray. So you can see that Cu is invariant under P. But there is one more thing that we can see here, is that if the point closest to the origin has norm A, then in the image it will have the closest point will have norm 1 over A. So in order to talk about the properties like The properties like the measure of those sets, it will be enough to talk about a subclass. And in particular, I can choose one of those subclasses where I will fix A to be equal to 1. So I will say that my Cu is just the union over all A's, Cu A. In fact, A should be here probably greater or equal than 1. Right. So I know, sorry, the A is positive. Right. A is positive. So now I will be talking about, I will fix an orthonormal basis, and I'll study the image of T of the subclass of C E N 1, so where the distance from the origin is 1. In this case, it turns out I can, instead of those sets, I can talk about functions. And for any set k in this subclass, I can define a function phi such that it is the Such that it is the minimum over t's in R, such that x, which is in r n minus 1, t is in k. And then we have the following order reversing quasi-involutions of functions, which corresponds to taking the image of k under t via the epigraphs of the function phi. So tk is equal to x. So, tk is equal to f of this t tilde phi. This identification is, of course, the bijection, and the minimal value of the function, of course, will be attained at the origin. It will be equal to 1. And we have this special property here about the Legendre of this function being bounded between minus 1 and 0. This corresponds somewhat to this con-like property. A little bit just to see where this transform comes from. So, if I have this function. This transform comes from. So if I have this function phi, I can make this easy calculation here if I write tk simply to be the, so I'm separating rn minus 1 and r. I have this color product of x with y, and these are the values of s in my k, right? t is greater or equal than phi. So I write it as lambda times phi. This must be greater or equal than 1. And you can see that I can rewrite it in this form, since this has to be for all lambda. Since this has to be for all lambda greater equal than 1, I can forget about lambda. And this really shows you that this transform really corresponds to taking the dual polarity of this. Right, so it further turns out that this dual polarity has a strong relation to the usual classical polarity in the following way. So the transport T, when restricted to the Transport T, when restricted to the subclass, so I'll be only focusing on this, is up to a minus sign a pullback of the classical polarity under the point map, which is given by, so we denote it as J, this has been used and studied by Shiri Einstein, Abby Dan Florentin and Alex Sugal, which is defined to be, to map x, t to x over t 1 over t. And this is a convexity-preserving map. It maps race. Preserving map. It maps rays that emanate from the origin to lines that are parallel to zero times r plus. Now, a slightly different characterization here of the set case in my class I can use here. I can write them as t times x, 1 for t greater even than some function a. Such a function exists, it's equal to 1 at the origin. And when this function is equal to infinity, this means that the ray infinity, this means that the ray x1 does not intersect my set K. And in this way, I can say that J acting on a set K in my class is simply the set of x, 1 over t where t is greater than a of x. Or in other words, we have this discursion. Now what you can note is that this function, Is that this function 1 over a of x is concave on its support? And its support is exactly the points, the axis where this ray does intersect k or is asymptotic to my set, asymptotically tangent to my set. And so what happens here, this is a transform on the upper half space. So if I say had my, I have Rn minus 1, I have R. I have R. So if I have a set here, which is in my class C, E, and 1, it is being transferred, so this is 1, it's going to be transferred via this J to a half of a convex set. So what I want to do is to add the second half. So in this J tilde, I'm just adding here Adding here a second half of this set. So, what am I doing? I'm just adding the reflection of the set. So, these bodies, the images of my dual polarity sets, they will always include the segment minus en, and also they will be always in this slab between minus 1 and 1 here. One here. Yes, so there is a very nice connection now between polarity and dual polarity, namely that J tilde acting on TK is the same as taking the polar of J tilde on K and adding a minus. A very nice thing to note here is that the image of the ball, the set corresponding to the ball, is simply the set of of points xy such that x squared plus 1 is less than or equal to y squared. So this is just a simple calculation. But that already tells us that this guy is a great candidate for the maximizer in the Blasch-Casenthalotype inequality. So this is indeed what's happening. So this is our main theorem. If I have a set K, which is in the image of the dual polarity, In the image of the dual polarity, which is essentially symmetric. What does this mean? This means that if you think about it as a function, the function is simply even. Then, if I have my dual polarity, gamma n denotes the Gaussian measure on Rn, and I know that then that the Gaussian volume product with respect to this dual polarity is maximized by this die k0 that I've just mentioned on the previous slide. Slide. So, how do we show this? Ah, this is just the central symmetry. What we do is indeed transport ourselves to the world of polarity. And when you want to see what kind of measure you are getting on those sets that corresponds to the Gaussian measure of your dual polarity sets, you'll get this odd norm. This has been established in the paper by Shiri that. Paper by Sheili, Dan, and Alex. But it's really just a very two-line calculation of a digital component. So, with knowing this, we can reformulate our theorem to say that if you have a set L, which is centrally symmetric convex body, which includes the segment minus ENEN, and is included in this slab, moreover, is invariant under the reflection, because I just said at the bottom, then this new Then this new measure, nu of L times nu of L polar, is bounded above by nu of the Euclidean bow square. So a few words about the proof of this. First of all, let me tell you what this measure mu looks like. So if I have mu of some set L, which is like in our assumptions, then this is just, I'm writing out the measure that I got. Measure that I got after the pullback. So I'm doing a change of variables to simplify this a little bit. And you can see that the Gaussian measure shows up here again after the change of variables. Now, I introduce three functions. I introduce a function f, which corresponds to the set L. I have a second function that corresponds to L polar. And I have a third function that corresponds to the Euclidean unit ball. So what I want to do now? I want to use the So what I want to do now, I want to use the multiplicative version of Pekopa Leibler in the equality, right? So what I need to show is that f of s times g of t is less than equal than h squared of the variable squared of s times t. In order to do this, let me maybe note what this guy here is. So first of all, all of these guys, they perfectly work for that inequality. And the only thing that we need to compare is the product. Compare is the product of these two Gaussian measures and this Gaussian measure squared. So let me just note here that the set that I have in the brackets here, if I take the norm, I would have norm squared, I would have R squared, squared times the square of norm of z plus r squared, and thus this must be less than or equal to 1. So in other words, I can write that. So in other words, I can write that z squared is less than equal than 1 minus r squared over r squared. So I need to show this inequality. It's a funny looking inequality, but as it turns out that everything works out very nicely for us. Because if I say that, if I name this set A, for example, and this set B, it turns out that. B, it turns out that if I scale it appropriately, and I scale it by the inverse of this number, so st 1 minus st of the set A polar contains my set B here. So, indeed, I just need to. Indeed, I just need to add the alphas, which alphas are indeed exactly this number, just to cancel things out. And I'm left with showing this inequality here. Luckily for us, this inequality is known. So it's due to Dario Cordero Rascar. He, in his paper, so maybe let me first read what the inequality is. For centrally symmetric convex sets, we have that the Gaussian measure of the set L times the Gaussian measure of the polar. The Gaussian measure of the polar is maxima is less than or equal to the Gaussian measure of the ball squared. Moreover, this holds for any positive alphas as well. So this was in his paper about Blaschke-Santalo inequality in the complex plane. And he also mentions that, so therefore this was a corollary for even dimensions. But if one wanted to have it in general dimensions, he notes that we can use the same Steiner symmetrization procedure as in. Symmetrization procedure as in a layer curve. And that gives us this result. So all our steps, this reduction to considering polarity in factor and this dual polarity together with this lemma gives us our minus. And I think this is more I want to basically.
