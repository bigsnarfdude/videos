In Burrs, where we are free, and many of us hike up this mountain. It's very, very beautiful. This is the last time I was in Banff, at Burrs, in fact, four years ago in January 2016. But I was at a very different kind of Burs workshop. It was Creative Writing in Mathematics and Mathematical Sciences. I don't know if you guys are aware of that. I thought I'd mention it. I thought I'd mention it. This is our group here. And I also wanted to take this 10 seconds to mention that the work that, this is an interesting group of people, mathematicians, scientists, and writers getting together. And the work that I workshop there has just been published as part of a book this past year that is creative non-fiction and it's about humans and it's And it's about humans, and it's about environment, and it's about math, and it's about poetry and life. So, I thought some of you might be interested in that. But here's the title of the talk. I hope you don't mind that I've made this tiny adjustment to it, which is the addition of the red at the end of the title. I'm sure many of you won't mind, but it means I have to rush through this very, very quickly. We'll talk about human environment systems. Human environment systems. I'll talk a little bit about using game theory to study interactions, which many of you will already be familiar with with all of the talks we've heard this week. And then I'll mention a model of climate change very briefly, which Lou will be talking about quite a bit in the next, in his talk. So we can have a nice discussion afterwards. And then I will talk a little bit about the application of the framework to COVID-19 modeling that we've been doing. So before I begin, So, before I begin, I want to go over a few assumptions that we make about human behavior. And you can put in the chat whether you are opposed to that in your role as a human. Humans can be grouped into subpopulations according to their behavior towards the environment, by what they value, or prefer, or do humans value ecosystems, species, environment. Value ecosystems, species, environmental protection, etc., more when it becomes rare or endangered. Humans can influence others in their environmental values, opinions via social learning. And individuals receive a net payoff benefit of their strategy if their strategy is the strategy of the majority via social norms. So, what I want to highlight about the dimensions of human behavior. Dimensions of human behavior that we look at so far in all of our modeling. It sort of has to, I put this up here because we realize and acknowledge that human behavior is complex and has many dimensions. We work quite a bit with this area down here. Can you see my cursor? Okay. Yes, we can. Okay. Okay, great. And down here in the social realm, and we also work... Also, work very sensitive. We also work up here a little bit in the human behavior and environment interface. You'll see in some terms that we include in our models which reflect risk perception, right? So it's a little bit about the actual state of the environment will change our behavior. But we don't really address these other two major dimensions. Others do. Others do, we are hoping to do so, but so far we have not made much progress in those realms. If Eli's here, Eli, I know you hate this picture, but you're going to see a lot of it in this talk in different manifestations. This is how we conceptualize, how we define a human environment system. We have, on the one hand, environmental dynamics, which you know inevitably is represented by some Know inevitably is represented by some simple model of ecological or environmental dynamics as we best understand it in the most simplest representation. And then on the other side, we have human dynamics, which represents human populations, real people who are behaving according to a number of properties and are influenced by things like social. And they are influenced by things like social learning and take into account things like cost-benefit of their actions. And, you know, for most of my career, for those of you who don't know me, I am an ecologist. I'm not trained as a mathematician. And I spent quite a lot of my career pretty much in this circle alone, like many other ecologists. And if we did consider humans, it was in sort of after the fact that, you know, humans, you know, there's some. There's some one-way negative impact on ecosystems, whether you're studying pollution, as I did in the degraded landscapes around Sudbury, or whether you're trying to understand and protect endangered ecosystems, endangered forests, tropical forests in Brazil. Humans sort of are external in a sense. They've already done the damage and we're trying to figure out how to fix it. Whereas now, the idea of putting these together. The idea of putting these together in this coupled system is that we look at the positive and negative feedbacks and acknowledge that humans can also have a positive impact on these systems, or at least on some form of sustainable coexistence of these systems through the types of things we've been talking about throughout this workshop. So, I'm also going to give a very quick introduction to game theory and imitation dynamics because this appears in almost all the models I'll talk about. In almost all the models I'll talk about today, and many others. Evolutionary game theory allows us to incorporate features like social learning and social norms. Individuals adopt one of two strategies. For example, in one of the cases I'll study, it's whether they transport firewood or not. But generally speaking, it has to do with whether they just do one type of behavior or another type of behavior. And you'll see that we can apply that to many different cases. We can apply that to many different cases. And individuals sample others at a constant rate. Individuals change strategies with a probability proportional to expected gain in payoff. In other words, people learn successful strategies from others. How this appears in all of our models is like this, this very generalized equation where X is a population of humans. It's the proportion of humans who are following strategy A, whatever that strategy may be. Whatever that strategy may be. And there is a learning rate here, so that this term is going to appear in all our models, which is very important. And we often vary those and see, we're very interested in the impact of that, of varying that learning rate on the dynamics. This is the imitation dynamic, and this delta U is just a generalized function that can be very complex or very simple. And it's an expected net change in payoff. Change in payoff where if delta u is greater, there's a net benefit to becoming staying strategy A and X goes up in this case, and then delta U is less than zero, net benefit to becoming strategy B. So delta U will include things like costs and risk perception and social norms. Okay, here is a picture. Here is a picture that maybe some of you are familiar with. If you're not, it is a diagram that considers or sort of classifies all along this outer edge in blue the wicked problems of our time and of all time, where humans have come into the picture in the Anthropocene. And these are the planetary boundaries they're called in this framework. In this framework. And we have crossed the safe space for these boundaries and thresholds have been calculated. And we've crossed the threshold for all of them except one, ozone depletion, which is one of the only problems that we've solved. We seem to have solved as humans, the only simple human environment problem that we've solved. So the crossing of the boundaries is another figure here on the top right that you can look at later. Look at it later, but um, so just quickly, you know, the ozone environment problem now in retrospect seems so simple that we didn't even need a model for it. We've conceptualized it here in the framework where there was an observation of the environmental dynamics of ozone. There was an observation of the appearance of ozone holes. People said, That's really horrible, terrible, we need to do something about it. And the international community got together in this Montreal protocol. Together in this Montreal protocol, and it was pretty much solved. So simple, we didn't even need a model. Why was it simple? Lots of people have talked about this, that, you know, there are things about this system that made it relatively simple. That we will all argue that is not the case for many of the other wicked problems that we have not solved yet. That's why we haven't solved them yet. In this case, you know, there was a highly flexible instrument which could increase or decrease controls. Which could increase or decrease controls as the science became clear. The trade of CSCs and other ozone-depletening substances was regulated. Chemicals, the chemicals involved and the sectors, the industrial sectors involved were clearly articulated. And it was a coincidence, a happy coincidence of benefits to industry. So many reasons why that one was an easy one to solve. Now, climate change is a wicked one to solve. We have some recent exciting attempts. Recent exciting attempts to couple human climate systems, which Lou, our colleague, will be talking about, and in fact, was the inspiration for a little bit of work that we did, that we initiated on this. Oh, before I go forward, I want to say that Chris and I have been working on several of these planetary dimensions and using this very basic framework. Well, it's gone, but. It's gone, but you know, using a very basic framework of coupling a simple environmental model to a very simple human model of behavior. And we've worked on almost all the problems. We hadn't worked on climate. And so we thought, okay, well, let's try that. And so our approach here, which has been published, and I won't go into detail, was to just take a simple model off the shelf, so to speak, of climate dynamics that has two variables, atmospheric carbon. Atmospheric carbon and temperature, which of course are related. It's a very simple model that is surprisingly does well at predicting mean annual temperature and mean annual, you know, just sort of some of the important variables that we're interested in with climate change. And we coupled it to our typical model of human behavior, which includes social learning, cost of Social learning, cost of mitigation, a term that actually looks, kind of tries to perceive the actual temperature anomalies. So how bad is climate change? And then a social norm term. And it's, of course, coupled here with the X appearing in atmospheric carbon emissions because we are unanimous. We are unanimous now that it is that humans control that and have input into that through greenhouse gas emissions, and that's what's driving climate change. Anyway, I don't have time to tell you the results of all of that here. What I wanted to tell you about this one of, so I think the most interesting thing we found about this model, and I can show you the figures later in a chat room or one of the Soco rooms or something. But I think the most interesting thing we found is, of course, what we do when we model, as you all know, is we make phase planes, we test the sensitivity of the model to these different parameters like social learning rate, like the mitigation cost, like the strength of the social norms, and which we do, and we make phase plans and we try to understand what is the combination of parameters that. You know, what is the combination of parameters that will lead us to the lowest temperature, or you know, try to lead us to a trajectory that will be within, say, what IPCC recommends where we are, the 1.5 degrees Celsius. So we did that. And what was most interesting about this, you know, relatively twin model was that the parameters in the Parameters in the equation of human behavior were orders of magnitude more sensitive in terms of affecting the trajectory of climate change in the form of temperature anomaly. Then the ones in the climate change model itself. And we could play with those and we could determine which ones, what was sort of the ideal pathway. And it really emphasized the importance. Really emphasized the importance of the potential importance of social learning on and human behavior in general on our climate trajectory, not just on impacts, but also on mitigation. So this, of course, is something that is not really well developed in IPCC models and generally not considered by the hardcore climate modelers. Though Lou might have an Though Lou might have an update on that. What happened with us was when we published the model, the media were just so fascinated with this and they went crazy over it. And these are some of the headlines that came out of that model. We know humans influence climate, but how does climate influence behavior? Social interactions. Oh, here, this is the best one. How to fight climate change? Let's talk about it. Talk about it, which is, you know, one form of social learning might be to talk, talk about it, and I think it's important. I really do. I think, um, I think you know, climate change communication is incredibly important, spreading the word. That's one way that we learn about things, right? But it was so fascinating because it was a moment in a trajectory of my career where, and I hope you're going to get this, the actual media that was taking up this research. Was taking up this research and communicating and propagating it, was doing the thing that, in part, the model was actually suggesting was what needed to be done. Just a really cool feedback loop between research and impact. But moving right along, I'm going to show you in detail another example. It's that forest pest model. It's kind of at the interface of biodiversity loss and land use change in terms of planetary boundaries. Planetary boundaries, a couple of papers. We started the work back around 2014. We published a paper with a graduate student, Leon Barlow, and then another, we took it up again recently with another graduate student and with a colleague from the Canadian Forest Service. And so those are the papers, but we'll go in detail a little bit more. Okay, forest pest spread. Most of you are aware of this problem. Many of some of you may have. Problem. Some of you may have, I'm sure you've many of you, some of you I know have worked on it. What we're talking about here are introduced species, and we're not focusing so much on the initial introduction, which is accidental. And that typically is not the thing that results in this pest. This pest, an exotic pest becoming a problem in terms of infestation and management trying to manage and control it. The problem is when that pest is moved somehow or is spread through a secondary process, which is through human movement. And in the case of forest pests, it's inevitably through moving of firewood. And so that's the part because it's And so that's the part because it's long distance, it's unpredictable. You know, a lot of the sort of biological spread of these forests, of these forest pests is well known. And the rates of spread, I mean, sometimes they spread long distance, but generally speaking, it's a slow sort of diffusion process from some central core. But it's these long distance and kind of random mish with respect to forests. Forests spread that humans introduce. And if you go to, you know, when I went to my government's website on what to do about our forest pest problems, the number one thing on the list is don't move firewood. And to me, I thought, in terms of a human environment problem, that seems pretty simple. Like if you can, you know, seems pretty simple. If you can isolate that problem to just like one. That problem to just like one major thing that's pretty to me low cost or pretty simple to not do, should be able to solve that problem. So just so you know, this is a huge problem. I mean, the emerald ash forest has done more economic damage than any other introduced species. And there are many, and the damage is in the millions, and the mitigation is in, I don't know, also. Litigation is in, I don't know, also in the millions. The government spends tons of money trying to control this and deal with it. Tons of models, lots of mechanistic models of forest, pests, population dynamics. We understand that very well. So what I'm trying to say is that this side of things is quite well understood. But this side of things is not so well understood. The human dynamic side is not so well understood. And it's a human environment. Understood. And it's a human environment problem. So we would just take this, our simple approach of coupling a simple model of forest pest spread with a simple model of human behavior. And these are how they feed back on each other in this particular case, through the cost of firewood, through observing the presence of pest outbreaks in your own environment around your campgrounds or whatever. Around your campgrounds, or whatever, that could influence how you behave and your decision specifically to whether or not you're going to spread firewood or not. So that's what we did. And I'll just quickly go over, this is the forest side of things, the simplest model out there of pest spread in a forest. We started with two patches. We did extend it to several patches as well. Patches can be susceptible or infested in the absence of. Are infested. In the absence of infections, susceptible trees grow logistically to a carrying capacity. Within a patch, the infection spreads at a particular rate that's completely biological. It's just based on the biology of that insect. But between patches, as I mentioned, that's where the humans come in. And then in this equation, humans are L. And the L is the proportion of local strategists, it's the people who The people who don't spread firewood. Okay, so that's that paper. And I'm going to, let's see, there's more. Here's the social side of the model, the dynamics of L. It'd be nicer if it was an X, it'd be easier, but these are the humans. And as you've seen now, this will be very familiar to you. We've got your social learning rate, you've got your proportion of local strategists, you've got your cost of transported fire. Cost of transported firewood, utility, cost of local firewood. And then this year, as I mentioned, that sometimes we humans behave according to some sort of perception of risk. And that's what this term represents. Couple them together. I'm not going to show you any results here more soon. Human behavior matters. For me, the most interesting thing we found from this model was that Was that I thought going into the model that we would have to reduce the cost of firewood to zero? We have to subsidize it. I thought if this is the problem and generally speaking, people are moving firewood for economic reasons, then parks should just give away firewood for free. Doesn't seem like a crazy idea. Indeed, in the model, what we found was in fact you didn't have to give it away for free to curb the infestation. Curb the infestations. You only had to reduce the cost by a couple of bucks. Surprising and easier, right? Even easier. However, you know, the best results, it wasn't just about cost. The best results are obtained when the two aspects or two or three of the aspects of human behavior were combined. And that's a general theme that's going to run. Theme that's going to run through all of this talk is that you kind of have to have a combination of these aspects of human behavior. And then, of course, because coupling these systems creates interesting dynamics, there's multiple thresholds that are possible. And this suggests that policy interventions could really be informed by that. And the timing of interventions could matter. We communicated our paper. We communicated this paper to media. We sent it to parks. We talked to a few people, but nobody, no, the parks people thought it was just completely crazy to ask them to reduce, to give away firewood for free. It's a norm, I guess. And yet, four years later, And yet, four years later, a major national park in Canada in another province decided to ban outside firewood to stop the spread of invasive species. And sure enough, the major gripe by people was that there were complaints about the price. So, indeed, we were right in that cost was quite an important factor. And yeah, I mean. And yeah, I mean, to me, if you did, we didn't do this, but it's, I think, you know, trivial to say that the cost of making this firewood-free is at least an order of magnitude less than the millions of dollars that are spent on not just the direct management of these pests outbreaks, but the education campaigns that are done. Okay. Okay. Then we were approached by a colleague in the Canadian Forest Service, Natural Resources Canada, who said, you know, we have a lot of data actually on firewood transport between parks. So that's what you see here is this network of parks and data that are collected by the Canadian Forest Service. And, you know, let's try to explore this a little bit more and. Try to explore this a little bit more and you know, look at several patches and maybe look at a few other types of interventions that could be done to study this problem. So, we did, and that's where Peter Jensch came in, the student, and he was doing it. He's doing his PhD. And it was pretty much the same model, except it was extended to this network where the nodes are actual parks. And but we added Um, but we added another equation here because we wanted to, one of the ideas that came up in terms of what you could do other than well, there was a few things you could do other than reducing the cost of firewood. You could close parks. So that was one thing that we introduced into this model is what happens if we called it quarantine. What if you What if you individually? What if you closed a bunch of them? And also, what if you had checkpoints where you intercepted the firewood and you my video is not on, but oh, and my internet connection is unstable. Maybe I'll leave my video off. Okay. Yes. What if you had interception, points of interception where you removed the sort of Where you removed the sort of illegal firewood or the, you know, the people who are not supposed to be transporting it, you just removed it from the system. So that's why we have another equation here, which is B, which is the actual population of firewood. Everything else is more or less the same. Okay, so I'll show you a couple of slides from this. So again, similarly to the other model, you know, interventions show thresholds and You know, interventions show thresholds and can work in synergy. So, these are the types of plots that we make. Um, you know, this is the plot of fraction of intercepted firewood versus social incentive to buy locally. And, you know, as you can see, if you just vary one of these, the social incentive, it doesn't really change the level of infestation, which is what the color represents in this graph. Graph. Red is bad and white is good. White is no infestation. And, you know, sort of similarly, if you just increase the fraction of intercepted woods, yes, you could achieve no infestation, but the fastest path was to do both. And another example here that quarantine can work, but only under very specific circumstances. So here's a graph that looks So here's a graph that looks at the change in the duration of quarantine. And again, quarantine here means closing a park. So this is the duration of closing a park, whether you close it for one year or two years or three years or four years, five years. And this is the size of the quarantine set. So the number of parks or this area of total parks that you close. And again, as you can see, if you just do one or the other. You just do one or the other, it doesn't really change the level of infestation very much. You do both, and boom, you can really control the infestation. Another type of thing that can happen in these types of dynamics is that for certain parameter regimes, we can get a second wave of infestation. So, I was talking, I mentioned that before that multiple thresholds and different Before that, multiple thresholds and different, um, yeah, so the timing of things matters, and also, uh, so here is some graphs. Uh, we can look at this one here, infested tree, infested trees on the Y and time. And so here you see that there's a first wave of infested trees, and then there's a second wave of infested trees. And that pretty much corresponds to the fact that humans. To the fact that humans can take a break in our model because once they start to see that the infestation level goes down, because that's a term in our model, the risk perception is related to level of infestation, then they take a little break, you see, and that's that little lull here. And so that can result in a second wave. So summary of findings, I think I'll just go straight to in a nutshell. I think I'll just go straight to in a nutshell. If interventions let through a small amount of infested firewood, those infested bundles can start a new outbreak in a patch. So the interventions need to be watertight if applied individually, or they need to be applied in combination if they are only partly effective. So that's why the title of that paper was Go Big or Go Home. This, of course. This, of course, is a little bit like travel restrictions during a pandemic. If you stop all travel from an infected area, you will stop the pandemic. If you only manage to stop most travel, you will only slow down the pandemic. Well, emergency was declared here in Ontario on March 17th, 2020. I got this email from Peter, our student, 10 days later, after which point. Um, after which point, you know, all three kids were home from school. Of course, like you all experienced this, right? Uh, we're not allowed to return back to our offices at the university, couldn't visit our ailing parents, et cetera, et cetera. And yet, you know, and our students are all dispersing back to their homes all over the world. And then 10 days later, I get this email from Peter, who's been working on his forest pest model. Pest model, and I um I was just like, oh, you know, quarantine, you know, it's obvious what the relationships are between epidemiology and ecology, between forest pests and human diseases. We're not, you know, this is not the first time anybody's making that association. I'm certainly not claiming that, but it was just incredibly surreal to. Surreal to have that and to be in the middle of a pandemic and to realize that you could pivot your research program completely and quickly to address the problem at hand, which is what we did. So here was Peter's forest model. And of course, you know, we had to ask Peter if he was willing to do that. And he was. He was on board for this. It was amazing. So we had this forest. So we had this forest pest model. Of course, the similarities. Oh, sorry. Did I do the similarities? Yes, commonalities here, limiting travel, quarantine closure, slowing spread. Vaccination distancing behavior or slash distancing behavior is likely, is like buying firewood locally. So there's the forest system and here's the COVID system, right, in the same framework, which hopefully is pretty self-explanatory. Which hopefully is pretty self-explanatory now because we've heard about it so much. There's some differences, of course, not real differences, but differences in how we approach the modeling initially anyway, because we've been doing some other stuff since then. Five minutes, Mona, would that be okay? Five minutes is fine. Yes, yes. So let's get to it. Here's the thing, as you know. Here's the thing, as you know, we need a coupled behavior disease approach for COVID. It seemed to make sense to do this. Flattening the curve in March was not possible without widespread population adherence. We saw that. Incredible case study. So here's our paper. It's in press. We can share it. It's in the preprints as well. I think we may have already sent it around. And I'll just quickly want to, you know, here's the environment side, which is a fairly Which is a fairly conventional disease model for COVID, you know, applied to COVID and flu as well. I'm not going to go into the details of this. Here's the human side. Again, very similar to the types of models that you've seen already that we do. There's a few differences that we shall take up in the discussion. And I'll ask Kirstig also to come in on this one. Come in on this one. So we don't have a social norm. So we do have social learning, very important. We do have, and here's X. X here is the proportion of the population that accepts non-pharmaceutical intervention, masks, social distancing, etc. We don't have social norms here. We tried to do social norms. It didn't work. We couldn't fit the behavioral model. So in this case, we have heterogeneity or what Chris admits is a fudge factor. And we have a term that does the opposite. It pushes the pun. Opposite. It pushes the population away from x equals zero and x equals one to represent heterogeneities, specifically people who always distance or never do. I'm not going to go into all of the equations. Now, we did some other interesting things with this model that we, you know, didn't do with our forest model because COVID. And so, one of the things we were interested in is. uh we're interested in is is is uh vaccination which um is not we don't we didn't model here explicitly as a behavioral uh dynamic but uh more so in in terms of uh prioritization of different groups and the when it was introduced so the availability of it the timing of it and the rates of vaccination and then just very very quickly I just want to show here that yes human behavior matters Here, that yes, human behavior matters. So, at the top graph is the disease model without human behavior, and sort of X is constant. So, that proportion of people who are complying with non-pharmaceutical interventions is constant, not dynamic. This is our model that was sort of parameterized with data that we had received up to about October. And please note, we started this modeling before we knew if or when, well, when the vaccine was going to become available. And so what we find here is that without the behavior, there's no sort of third wave. This is for Ontario, by the way. No third wave was predicted by our model. If you add the human behavior component, you see this prediction of a third wave coming up in March. Coming up in March. Many, many other things to talk about of this model. Here's another one where we show that the timing of the vaccination program is very crucial. So as I said, this is something different or new that we studied with this where we had the vaccine being introduced January 1st versus September 1st. This is a plot that shows you that it doesn't matter what the population vaccination rate is, and it doesn't matter what. Rate is, and it doesn't matter what the how strict the shutdowns are in terms of when the decision is made about them. All of the vaccines should be prioritized to the oldest first. But because of indirect protection of the vaccine, if we do it later, this was an interesting outcome, then it matters. It matters which. matters it matters which um you know it might be important to um first so there's a lot more to say about that summaries you know these these models are important overall from some the work that we've been doing we we would like to suggest that human behavior can be a very powerful force in changing environmental dynamics to more sustainable levels social norms of course can work Social norms, of course, can work both ways. And we've talked a little bit about echo chambers and unpredictable results there. Other important factors include risk perception, economic costs, and social learning. And policy interventions could possibly use some of the rich and realistic dynamics that don't appear if the systems are studied in isolation. And I think some of them are being used. We need to anticipate these behavioral responses and we need to study. Behavioral responses, and we need to study if they can happen across different environmental systems. And as a point for discussion, I would love to chat about what we can learn from studies of these different wicked HES problems. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mador. The first question in the chat is from Rebecca, who has a question about the climate consequences of burning. Climate consequences of burning. So, Rebecca, you want to take it? It occurred to me that I get the logic of reducing the cost of the firewood to zero, because if they've paid for it, they're going to want to take it with them. But also, there's logic in valuing wood. And so, I just wondered if the solution would be to have a fee for lighting a fire instead of the wood. Instead of the wood, and then you could check to see if they've actually paid their permit when the fire is lit. But Christopher sent a message saying that Banff and Jasper do it that way. You have to buy a fire permit and the wood is provided. Oh, cool. Yeah. That's good. I wonder if there's less carrying wood around in that. Yeah, or maybe there's less outbreaks in Vanff and Jasper as a consequence. I would hope. I would hope. I would hope. Yeah, that's cool. That's good. It's not the case in Ontario. Okay, let me turn now to Dennis Patterson, who has a technical question. Yeah, firstly, thanks very much for the nice talk. I was just curious about the third wave you showed. So you don't have it when you have no behavior. In your epidemic, you don't have it without the behavior, but you add the behavior and it results. Can you kind of motivate it or something to? you kind of motivated or I think it's asking so I might dump it open I can hear somebody's conversation somewhere I hope it's not me no okay thank you okay so let's and Chris are you here yeah you pop in too if you if you if you need to so yeah I we didn't show those results in great detail but let me go back Let me go back. Yes. Yeah. I don't know the best way to talk about this. Chris, maybe you should answer this. Yeah, well, mathematically, it tends to destabilize the equilibrium because if individuals act more decisively, if individuals act more decisively when there's more cases, the flip side is they don't act when there are a few cases and they allow it to get out of control. So essentially when you add behavior, you destabilize equilibria in these compartments, in these types of compartmental models. That's what's happening mathematically. Yeah, we have some more slides that we could show about this, but don't know if we should go into that right now. So we have time. So we have time for probably one more question. There are a lot of questions in the chat. We'll have to come back to them maybe later. And Frank Jilker is next. Hi, Madhu. The firewood transport between parks reminded me a little bit of the Zebra muscle problem and boat transport between lakes. And I was wondering whether there's a similarity. Was wondering whether there's a similarity in setup or whether the model could be quite straightforwardly adapted to that situation. And I think Rebecca commented that the fire permit could be analogous to a boat cleaning fee, perhaps. Yeah. I'm sure. I think it could be very straightforwardly studied if it hasn't already. Was that problem solved? I don't know. I don't know while you're thinking about that. Another problem that's quite similar is the way the UK had to deal with foot and mouth disease and transport of cattle and cattle products between farms. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's another good example. And one of the first things they do, of course, is to shut down transport. Okay, I'm sorry that we can't take all of the questions. Sorry, that we can't take all of the questions, but I'm glad your talk generated so many questions. So let's take, we got about a three-minute break, four minutes maybe, and then we'll come back to hear Lou's talk. Great. Thank you, everyone.
