Well, I would, of course, like to thank the organizers for organizing this conference and giving me the opportunity to speak here. I was asked to give a mini course on curve shortening. So, looking at the material, there's a lot of things, there's a lot of material that. That where we could fill several weeks of lectures depending on how much detail we do. So, I'm going to touch on a couple of things. So, here's the outline. There will be two lectures. So, today I'm going to just tell you the equations for curve shortening, space curve shortening. So, most curve shortening problems that you see are for curves in the plane or maybe on surfaces, but not a lot of. Not a lot of attention has been comparatively given to curve shortening for curves in higher-dimensional spaces. So that's what I want to talk about. So I want to explain the equations, tell you about the local existence theorem, tell you what happens and near singularities, and then various blow-ups. Various blow-up results, then motivated by those blow-up results, there's interest in ancient solutions. So that's what I'll be talking about next in the next lecture. So first I'll establish an L1 contractivity property for curve shortening, for space curve shortening, and talk about ancient solutions. First, there's the Tuscalopoulos-Hamilton system. There's the Taskalopoulos-Hamilton system theorem. And then there are many other, which inspired a lot of work on ancient solutions. So there are for space curves, for curves in the plane, and for space curves, there are many, many other ancient solutions that have been constructed recently. So I'll talk about those. Okay, so let me go to the beginning. So throughout, I'll be talking about I'll be talking about curves in n-dimensional space. And now, a curve is an immersed curve, which means that it's a parameterized curve. It's a function from an interval to Rn, and its derivative is never the zero vector. So that means that at each point, the curve has a tangent. Much of the time, most of the time, in fact, all the time, if you wish, you could keep in mind just concentrate on. Just concentrate on the case where we have closed curves, so that the interval is the whole real line, and the curve is periodic. So now in calculus, you learn how to calculate the length of a curve. So there's a formula for it. You integrate ds, which is just the length of the tangent of the velocity vector. You integrate that with a Vector, you integrate that with respect to the parameter. Then you can differentiate with respect to the arc length. And the point of view that I'm taking is that this derivative with respect to arc length, that's this symbol, is going to be always be an abbreviation for this operator. So I will never, a different way of describing this is to say you introduce the arc length as a parameter, rewrite everything as a function of the arc length, and differentiate with respect to that. But I really That. But I really lead to various confusing situations. And I want to stick to just the convention that DDS is an abbreviation for one over length of XC DDC, where Xi is the parameter along the curve. Okay, so one thing you can do is you can differentiate the parameterization with respect to arc length. So that gives you this. So subscripts are the same as partial derivatives. So that by definition is. So, that by definition is x divided by its length. So, it's a unit vector and it's the unit tangent vector. So, that's this thing. Then, to define the curvature, you differentiate that again. So, the second derivative of the parameterization with respect to arc length, which is, and so this is a very simple expression. It's a very nice expression for the curvature vector. If you have any parameterization, it really is that's an abbreviation. Really is, that's an abbreviation for all this, which is not as nice. So the curvature vector has properties that it is perpendicular to the unit tangent vector, right? As you can see in this picture. I mean, of course, you shouldn't believe the picture, but the curvature vector is because it's the derivative of a unit vector, it is perpendicular to that. Unit vector, it is perpendicular to that unit vector. So the curvature is always perpendicular to the tangent vector. And the length of the curvature vector, we'll call that little k. That's the length of the second derivative with respect to arc length. That is the curvature, the size of the magnitude of the curvature. Okay, so those are the geometric quantities that are important. So now for space curves, you know that there is a, there are, beyond the curvature, there are other. Beyond the curvature, there are other invariants. There's the torsion, and if you go in higher-dimensional curves, curves in R4, R5, R6, there are torsions, higher-order torsions, all of which are invariants. And I won't be talking about those because those have the, from the point of view of analysis, those are inconvenient quantities because they're undefined where the curvature is zero. So the torque. So, the torsion in particular is undefined if the curvature is zero at points where the curvature is zero. And points where the curvature is zero turn out to be unavoidable in space curve shortening. So, that means that there are all kinds of equations that you could write down involving the torsion, where you have to be careful to avoid so-called inflection points. And so, it creates. So, it creates all kinds of problems. So, I won't be studying, I won't be talking about the torsion. So, the invariants we look at are the tangent, the curvature vector, and maybe the magnitude of the curvature vector. What is the equation for curve shortening? Curve shortening is an evolution equation where you let the curve evolve in the direction of its curvature. So, this first equation is the simplest way to describe that. Describe that. Now, the curvature by definition is the second derivative with respect to arc length of x. So, that's also a nice way of describing it. So, this second, this equation makes it look like curve shortening is the linear heat equation, but it's not because dds is our abbreviation for one over length c, xc, ddx. So, this second derivative with respect to s really is an abbreviation for all this here. So, this bottom equation. All this here. So, this bottom equation, this one is that equation, that is the equation for space curve shortening, which is not as nice an equation. So what do solutions look like? Just how can you imagine solutions? If you start with a space curve here, then a little later the curve will evolve in this direction. It'll do something like this. Direction, it'll do something like this, right? It's moving in the direction of its curvature. The more the curve is curved, the faster it moves. So here, the curve would be moving faster than, say, here. And now the question is, is this a well-posed initial value problem? It looks like a heat equation, so you would think so. But there's something wrong with this equation from the point of view of parabolic PDEs, namely, PDEs, namely, this equation, the equation for curve shortening is space curve shortening, is invariant on the reparameterization. If you have a solution to curve shortening, you pick a reparameterization, which means a function from R to R that is strictly increasing and has non-zero derivative. And then you define a new curve like this. That parameterizes the same curve. If you were to draw the curve, you would get If you were to draw the curve, you would get the exact same drawing. And the curve-shorting equation that I have described for you here is invariant on the reparameterization. So that's a calculus exercise. You can verify that if this original x satisfies curve shortening, then this new reparameterized x tilde also satisfies curve shortening. And that means that curve shortening cannot be a parabolic equation for the following reason. If it were a parabolic, The following reason. If it were a parabolic equation, solutions would be smooth immediately. So, and now if x is a smooth solution, then you can let phi be some function that has minimal smoothnesses, maybe c1, not but not c2. And then your reparameterized function would not be a smooth function anymore, but it would still satisfy the equation. So that's a property that parabolic equations. That's a property that parabolic equations don't have. Okay, so that means that we can't hope to apply standard theorems to produce short-time existence. Short-time existence for this version of the curve shortening equation. So to solve that, there's a trick which involves changing the equation a bit. So I have to talk about the velocity vector. Talk about the velocity vector. If you have a parameterization of a moving curve, then its time derivative dx dt is a vector which in general is doesn't have to be perpendicular to the curve. That could be dx dt. So now you can split this dx dt into two components: one component that is perpendicular to the curve and one component that is tangential to the curve. So in this drawing, the perpendicular component is drawn and the tangential part. Is drawn and the tangential part is not there, but it would be it's the difference between those two pink vectors. So if you have any family moving family of curves, you can decompose the velocity vector in that way. And there's a theorem that you can prove that I won't do, but it's the normal reparameterization theorem. It says that if Theorem, it says that if you have any family of a C1 family of moving curves, immersed curves in Rn then there is a reparameterization, right? There exists a reparameterization, phi, which is time dependent. And if you reparameterize your given moving curve by phi, you get the new moving curve. the new parameter the new moving curve moving parameterized curve uh has uh undergoes normal motion meaning its velocity the tangential part of its velocity is always the zero vector and the time derivative is always perpendicular to to the curve why do we care about the time derivative being perpendicular to the curve let me go back to curve shortening again sorry Sorry. So, this is always perpendicular to the curve. Remember, so if you have a solution to curve shortening, as I described it on this slide, the velocity vector is always perpendicular to the curve. Okay, so maybe we don't care about the velocity vector being perpendicular to the curve because we only draw a care about the image that the parameterized curve traces out. curve traces out um so we're going to relax uh curve shortening and we're going to say um we're going to say um generalized curve shortening is this pde we have a family of moving curves and the the perpendicular component excuse me the perpendicular component uh of the velocity must be equal to the curvature and we can uh so which is the case which would be so The case, which would be so if this vector were equal to the curvature, then this would be an allowed motion because the perpendicular component of x here is the curvature. So a different way of writing this is to say that the velocity has to be equal to the curvature plus some arbitrary multiple of the tangent vector. And then because this last term lambda times t, if you take that component, if you take the perpendicular component of xt here, that lambda t disappears. That lambda t disappears. Okay, so and the normal parameterization theorem says that if I if I have a solution to general curve short, this generalized curve shortening, then I can reparametrize that solution and I will get a solution that traces out the same family of curves, but where the derivative is the time derivative, the velocity is perpendicular to the curve. So x t. Perpendicular to the curve. So Xt will be equal to K. So it will be a solution to the original curve shortening equation. Okay, so now there is what I'm showing you here on this slide is called the Turk's trick. The curve-shorting equation is this first equation, dxd equals k. That's the original one, which is really an abbreviation for this ugly component. For this ugly component, this ugly combination of derivatives. If you apply the product rule to this ddc, what you get is a second derivative term that looks nice and parabolic plus ddxc. And then you get, so here you get this tangent that comes from combining this one over dx with that xc, right? So this What you get is, to summarize, dx dt is equal to one over something positive times the second derivative of x with respect to the parameter, xc, minus something that is tangential to the curve. And so if you drop the last term, you get a different equation. You get this equation. And this equation now is, so here x is just is the parameter. C is just the parameter. DDC is not an abbreviation that is hiding some other stuff. It is just the second derivative with respect to the parameter. So this equation is a quasi-linear parabolic equation. It's a system because x is Rn valued, but you'll notice that the diffusion coefficient is the same for all entries in the all components in the system. And the reparameterization theorem tells us that if you have a solution to this. If you have a solution to this equation, then there's a reparameterization x such that x tilde, which you get by reparameterizing x by phi, is a solution to this original equation. And now here, this goes two ways. If you have a solution to curve shortening, you can reparameterize it. So find an inverse to this phi that satisfies, so that x satisfies the second equation. So these two equations. Equation. So these two equations are equivalent up to reparameterization. And so if you want to find solutions to curve shortening, then instead of solving this equation, you can solve this equation. And so it turns out this second equation is good for proving short-time existence theorems. The first equation is also good because it allows us to do all kinds of other things. So that'll become clear, I hope, later. Okay, so this trick is. So this trick is called the Turk's trick, Dennis the Turk's trick, which is there. So it was at the top of the there, the Turk's trick. Dennis the Turk is, he invented this trick not for curve shortening or mean curvature flow, but for Ricci flow, which is a more complicated system of parabolic equations that is also not really parabolic, but you have to, if you do, there's a modification that he invented. Modification that he invented that allows you to prove existence by using standard parabolic P, quasi-linear parabolic PDE theory. Okay, so here we do the same thing. Once we have that equivalent equation, so let me see if I can keep it up. So yeah, so we have this equation. That's a standard quasi-linear parabolic PDE. The classical theory for such equations tells you, first of all, that you Of all, that you have a solution, a short solution that exists for a short time for any C1 alpha initial curve. We need C1α because the diffusion coefficient should be holder continuous. So, if you start with C1 alpha initial condition, there will be a solution and it becomes smooth instantaneously. And then, second, if the only way that this equation that the solution can become Equation that the solution can become singular in finite time is if this diffusion coefficient becomes bad. This equation is degenerate. If this xc becomes infinitely large, then 1 over xc squared goes to 0 and the diffusion equation becomes degenerate. So if you can keep xc away from 0, then you can continue the solution. So if you have a solution that only exists for a finite amount of time, it Amount of time, it means that the x dx dx, the derivative with respect to the parameter, becomes goes to zero somewhere. It could also become infinite if you just think, you know, if xc becomes infinite somewhere, then this whole thing goes to zero. And I realize I just said it the other way around. So xc can go to zero, then this diffusion coefficient becomes infinite, and that is also bad. It actually actually. It actually cannot grow. So, the reason that I did not say here that XC has to be balanced from above is that this is trivially true, which I'll show explain on the next slide. Okay, so the reasoning behind this is, so formally is that why, so the reasoning behind this second statement is why is that true? Well, if you have a If you have a solution for the detergent version of curve shortening and x is bounded and bounded from below, then you can differentiate the equation with respect to the xi variable. That gives you this equation. So that's a quasi-linear, that's a linear parabolic equation for xc. And if the length of the vector x is bounded between a small and a big constant. Between a small and a big constant, then the diffusion coefficient here will be also bounded between small and large constants. So the equation is uniformly parabolic and their classical theory that Nash estimates tell you that XC has to remain holder continuous. And once you know that the XC remains holder continuous, you go back to this equation again and you find that with shadow estimates, you also get bounds for higher derivatives. You also get bounds for higher derivatives. Okay, so classical parabolic theory tells you that you can get a solution from any C1 alpha initial curve, which becomes smooth immediately. And there is a criterion here for what happens if the solution becomes singular in finite time. This criterion is dependent on the parameter. On the parameter. The criteria that I've written here is not invariant on the reparameterization. If you reparameterize, then x dxdc will change. And maybe for some parameterization, the infuim goes to zero, and for another, it doesn't. So you would like a different criterion for when the solution becomes singular. Okay, so now we're going to do some geometric calculations. We'll calculate the time derivative. It's a parabolic. The time derivative. It's a parabolic equation, and we need to estimate quantities. So we take time derivatives of the various quantities that are around. So the arc length, unit tangent, and curvature, we're going to write equations for how they evolve. And I did this in some detail here, but I don't just want to read these equations. So I'll go through this a little bit quickly and give you the ideas. And then, I mean, these slides will be available. And this is, I'll also provide references so you can. Also, provide references so you can find this elsewhere afterwards. The idea is that once we start differentiating things with respect to time, it is most convenient to work with this form of the curve shortening equation. So we assume that our solution has been parameterized so that the x dt is perpendicular to the curve. So therefore, it is equal to k. And so differentiating this equation. So, differentiating this equation with respect to t or with respect to s, especially with respect to t, is tricky because the s here depends on t, right? D ds was an abbreviation for this partial derivative operator. So, if I differentiate with respect to t, partial derivatives of xc enter. So, you have to. C enter. So you have to so before you start calculating, it is good to just write down what happens if you differentiate ds and if you differentiate d ds. So d dt, so d dt of ds, that's this. Right, and so let me write so d dt. Right, so D D T D S is it is D D T of X C D X C So that is the derivative of X C D C So to calculate this you need to know the derivative of the of the time derivative of the length of X C. Of the length of xc. ddt of dds by itself doesn't make any difference, make any sense. But the thing that you want to know is what happens if I have the s derivative of something and I differentiate that with respect to time? Is that the same as first differentiating with respect to time and then with respect to s? The answer is no. The difference of this is it's a commutator, dt ds, and the answer to these. And the answer to these, what these two quantities are, this commutator is given here. It is the length of the curvature squared times d ds, and the time derivative of ds of the arc length is minus the length of the curvature squared ds. And the calculation of that, I wrote it here, and I'm not going to go through this, but so xc, I'll say a few things. Xc is the length of. things xc is the length of the length of xc is the square root of the inner product of xc with itself so chain rule then you apply the product rule to this you get two terms each of which is xc inner product dt xc and now dt xc and dxc xt are the same thing because t xc x is a function of t x c and mixed partials commute Mixed partials commute. Now, this step, so there is one step that also may explain it here because it shows up several times. And so I'll explain it once. So here we use that XC is zero because our parameterization is such that the time derivative is perpendicular to the curve. So the x. Is perpendicular to the curve. So dx dt and dx dc are zero. So if I differentiate this with respect to c, I find that, and you apply the product rule, you find that this quantity, you find that this quantity and this quantity with the minus sign are equal. Okay, and then you use the definition of xt and T and what xc is there is and the so the upshot I'll just for the sake of time the upshot is that this is equal to minus xc length times k squared okay in particular xc the length of xc is always decreasing it's never never increasing because of that minus sign over there which is why it's called curve shortening right the length of a Called curve shortening, right? The length of the curve always becomes less. Okay, so as a consequence of this, we can say that the solution, so if the here's a geometric description of what happens if a solution becomes singular at a finite time, namely the curvature has to become unbounded. And so this is a slightly more quantitative way of saying that how the curvature must become unbounded. Must become a bounded. The maximal curvature at time t, that's a function of t. If you square that and you integrate it up to capital T, that integral has to diverge. And the reason why that is true is, so there's a short proof and it follows from. So let me let me This is the equation that we just derived for how the arc length of xc changes in time. If you look at this, you think of xc of the curvature as just some given vector. This is some given quantity. Vector, this is some given quantity, then this is just a linear ODE for xc, for each fixed c. And if you integrate that in time, you find that xc is some exponential. And the previous condition that we had that guaranteed that had to blow up said that xc has to go to zero. If you have a solution that becomes singular, then xc has to become zero somewhere. So now if you assume that So now, if you assume that this integral is bounded, it is bounded, it is finite, bounded by some m, then after integrating that ODE, you find that, first of all, xc, if you start with an arc length parameterization, which you can always do, you can always reparameterize your initial curve by arc length. So xc will be less than or equal to one, and it will be greater than or equal to this quantity, which is then bounded from below by that quantity. So, this is a nice geometric description of what has to happen when the solution becomes unbounded. The curvature must blow up somewhere. Okay. Here's, so do solutions have to become singular. And so, here's an application of the maximum principle. So, there are many things that you can prove using the maximum principle in curve shortening. So, if you have a solution to curve shortening, and then x is the solution to curve shortening, then this quantity, the length, the distance squared to the origin, plus two times time, satisfies a nice, it satisfies the heat equation. Okay, and now keep in mind that FSS is an abbreviation for, so if I, if I were. For, so if I were to be honest and tell you what this pretty equation really stands for, this is 1 over xc d dxc, 1 over xc df dxc. Okay, so it is a linear equation. It's not a constant coefficient equation. It's not the standard heat equation, but it is a heat equation. If you work this out, expand the derivatives, it's a heat equation that the maximum print. It's a heat equation that the maximum principle applies to. Okay, so, and the calculation is very short. You take the time derivative of the time derivative of x squared, that's this. Xt is equal to Xss. Then if you differentiate X inner product X twice with respect to S, you get this first term plus this other term, which then you have to subtract here. subtract here and xs s is the arc length so the vector xs is the unit tangent the norm of that vector is one okay so what we get here what we find is that the time derivative of the length squared of x is the second s derivative of that same length squared minus two okay so now if you add plus two t you find that f satisfies the desired equation Okay, so this tells you two things. If your initial curve lies inside, so I'm thinking of closed curves, so they're compact, so they are contained in a ball, some ball, depending on which curve you have. So F zero C A 0 c is xt is 0 c squared plus 2 times 0. That's less than or equal to r squared. If your initial curve is contained in a ball of radius r, then this function f at time zero is bounded by r squared. And then the maximum principle implies that F zero F T is bounded plus is always bounded by R squared and this tells you that the length of X T C squared plus 2t is bounded by R squared and this tells you that 2t is less than or equal to r squared. So time can't go back r squared so time can't go beyond one half r squared okay so that's a proof that's a proof of this first statement there's another nice observation and i'm not uh when i distribute the slides there will be a list of references by uh who of who found these uh these statements so um this is a very nice observation if uh if your initial curve lies on a sphere Your initial curve lies on some sphere, can self-intersect, winds around, loops around, stays on the sphere, and it's a closed curve, right? And it's on the sphere with radius r. Then f of t, f of, sorry, f of zero is r squared, identically r squared. And r squared is a solution to the heat equation. The constant is a solution. Solution to the heat equation. The constant is a solution to the heat equation. This tells you that f of t c is r squared for all t positive and all xi. Okay, so what this tells you is that if your initial curve lies on a sphere with radius r, then at time t, the curve still lies on a sphere, but it's with a smaller radius. Its radius is exactly square root of r squared minus 2t. So this curve will shrink to a point. Point. And you know exactly when it shrinks to a point, namely at this time, at this time, one-half R squared. Okay, so solutions do become singular. There is some sort of maximum principle. You can think of this as saying that if a curve is contained inside a sphere and you let the sphere shrink, then the sphere crushes the curve to a point. A point. The maximum principle that you have to use really is this one with the function f. And I don't know of any other surfaces besides planes, but those are spheres with infinite radius where you can play this game with. Okay, evolution of unit tangent and curvature. And I'm running short on time. So when should I stop? 40, 45? Hello? Okay. Can you hear me? Yes, yes. Okay. So you asked me. Sorry, I didn't. I lost the audio. Could you say it again? Audio. Could you say it again? 10 more minutes. Okay, good. So I'll, so there are some more calculations, and I'll go through these. If you take the unit tangent, and I see a typo, this should be a T. If you calculate the evolution of the unit tangent and the curvature, then you get equations. You get equations for those, and you so here's the equation for the derivation of the evolution of the unit tangent. t is dx ds. So we need to calculate the time derivative of that. For that, you would like to switch the s and the t derivative around. And this is where you use that commutator. So now at this point, dx dt is equal to x twice differentiated with respect to s. Differentiated with respect to s. The commutator was k squared times d ds of whatever you're applying it to. And at this point, you recall that ds dx, that's equal to the unit tangent. So here you get TSS and here and ds dx again is the unit tangent. So you get this. This equation is similar to the harmonic map flow equation. Equation. You have time derivative is equal to Laplacian plus the curvature is Ts, so it is the gradient of T squared times T. And T is a unit vector just like U. So there's a similarity. The evolution equation for the unit tangent is harmonic map flow into the sphere. The equation for the curvature is a bit more complicated, and I, you know, for reasons of, yeah, just to save time, I won't go through the derivation. I'll just say this: the curvature itself satisfies an equation that involves the unit tangent, so it's not an equation by itself. Then, if you calculate the length of the curvature, how fast does the length of the curvature go? How fast does the length of the curvature grow? You differentiate this with respect to S, and then you have to combine various terms. And the equation that you find is you get something that involves the curvature itself. So you get this equation. This wedge product is in R3, it is just a cross product. In higher dimensions, it's the sum of the squares of all two by two determinants that you can get if you put k and k as per next to each other. Whatever it is, there's a minus sign in front of it. There's a minus sign in front of it. So kt, the length of the curvature, time derivative of that, is less than or equal to the second s-derivative of it plus the length of the curvature cubed. Okay, so now that derivation that I'm skipping, here's the calculation. So I'll skip these two slides, right? So we have the upshot is This so I'll the derivative of the total. So this allows us to calculate, say, the derivative of the total curvature. So what is the total curvature of a curve? It is this quantity. You integrate the length of the curvature vector over the whole curve. And so it is right. So if you have a closed space curve. So, if you have a closed space curve, something like this, you get the unit tangent, it rotates around, and it's the total amount that the unit tangent sweeps out. If you look at the image here on S2, you take any tangent vector here and you plot it on the unit sphere. On the unit sphere, then this is called the spherical image of the curve. It traces out a curve over here. The total curvature is the length of that curve, the length of the curve traced out by the unit tangent on the unit sphere. Okay, so this total curvature, you can differentiate this with respect to time. So how much does the unit tangent change along the curve? And that total change, how does that evolve in time? Well, you differentiate this with respect to. You differentiate this with respect to time, you have to differentiate two quantities. You have to differentiate the curvature, that gives you this term, and you have to differentiate ds, that gives you this term, using our equation for d dt of ds. The time derivative of the curvature was equal to all this, and this is just k cubed, so that's k cubed so that's the term is over there this k cubed and that k cubed cancel and this is a second s derivative which we are integrating along a closed curve so when you integrate it it also disappears so the only thing that remains is this which is less than or equal to zero so the total curvature does not increase in time and there's actually a condition that something that tells you what what has to happen if it stays constant Has to happen if it stays constant. Why is the total curvature interesting? So, there are a couple just to remind you of a few theorems from just from differential geometry, which you can find in Docarmo's book on curves and surfaces. So, the total curvature, that's the Fenchel's theorem says that the total curvature of a closed curve is always at least 2 pi, and the only curves for which it is equal to pi. The only curves for which it is equal to 2π are plane convex curves. So if you have a convex curve in a plane, the subtle curvature will be 2π, and otherwise it's more. In three dimensions, there's another interesting theorem that is due to Milner, which the legend says he did this as an undergraduate. If the total curvature is less than 4π, so 2 times 2 pi, then the curve is unknotted. Then the curve is unknotted. So if I draw a trefoil, let me try to draw. There. This curve is knotted. This curve must always have total curvature more than at least 4π. So if you start with a curve that has total curvature less than 4π, it is unknotted. And under curve shortening, space curve shortening, it will never become knotted. Space curve shortening, it will never become knotted. Okay, so let me end with the distinction between type 1 and type 2 blow up. If you have a maximal solution to curve shortening, then its curvature must blow up. And so you can show that the maximal curvature at time t has Maximum curvature at time t has to be at least, it has to blow up at least as fast as one over this square root. And the way to prove that is to apply the maximum principle to this equation. And the techniques here are very similar to techniques that are very familiar from, say, the study of this equation, semi-linear heat equations, because it is, we have an inequality here, and it's like that semi-linear heating inequality. Quality. So you apply the maximum principle to that, and you find that the blow-up rate has to be at least one over that square root. And then Hamilton introduced this notion to distinguish between two kinds of blow-up, namely type one and type two, which some calls fast and slow, but those terms turned out to be confusing. If the blow-up is not larger than a multiple of the Than a multiple of this minimal blow-up rate. So, if this happens, if there's a constant such that the maximal curve that the curvature is always bounded by C or root T minus T, then you say that the solution has type 1 blow-up. Otherwise, it's called type 2 blow-up. And then more specifically, otherwise, there have to be sequences, parameters x, ck, and tk such that this square root, square root t minus tk times the curvature goes to infinity. Okay, so if you have type one blow up, there's a nice. So I if you have type one blow up, then you can, again, with analogy with the semi-linear equation, right? If you have this equation and you have a solution that blows up, you can substitute x of t is one over t minus t to the right exponent times v. exponent times v of x over square root t minus t and then log t minus t you can do this blow-up you can go to self similar variables and you get another equation for the function v well the exact same thing happens with curve shortening if you have a solution to curve shortening then you can pick a blow-up point x naught and a blowout time t0 and then define y by either this equation or By either this equation or by this equation, which are equivalent to each other. And then it turns out that your blown-up profile satisfies this equation, which is curve shortening, where sigma now is the arc length on y, not on, so different from s. And we get one half y. Then Huskin's monotonicity formula tells you that this equation has a Lyapunov function. Equation has a Lyapunov function. And the Lyapunov function is exactly this Gaussian integral. And then so I'll stop here for today. So if you have, using Juhuskin's monotonicity formula, you can prove that if your solution has type 1 blow up, then for any sequence of times towards the blowup and any sequence of points at which you're going to blow up, there's always a sub-sequence such that if you consider this. This. So, if you zoom in on the solution, then you can extract the limit that converges in C infinity, and it is a solution to this curve to this equation. So, it is a self-similar solution. So, I'll discuss those next time. Okay, I'll stop here. Thank you. We have some questions if no change on the the But anyway, anyway, your presentation presentation was extremely Presentation was extreme of my expertise. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. I'm enjoying the conference. Thank you.
