So first thanks to the organizers for inviting me to give this talk. And as Peter said, I'm going to be talking about the Landau-Dijen model for pneumatic liquid crystals with planar anchoring and a weak magnetic field. So sorry, I think my slides are cut off at the bottom. Ah, there we fall. So, everything that I present today is going to be joint work with Leah Bronshart and Dominic Schanteski. And this is ongoing work that we're currently doing. So, we've heard a lot about Landautagen model. Lots of you are experts in it, so I won't go too much into detail about it. So, we're looking at pneumatic liquid crystals, so we're studying these Q-tensors. These Q tensors, which are symmetric, traceless 3x3 matrices. And the energy functional that we're going to consider is this non-dimensionalized Landau-Gijen energy functional on an exterior domain omega. So the setup that we're in is we have a particle that we're going to describe by a manifold M, and it's immersed in a sea of liquid crystal, and we're also going to have this magnetic field that's uniform. Magnetic field that's uniform throughout and it has a vertical alignment. So, going through our energy, we first have the Diracle energy that's coming from the one constant approximation. Then we have F, which is our bulk energy. And so, F is non-negative, and it's zero exactly when Q is uniaxial. And we've chosen the constants in F accordingly so that uniaxial just means n tensor n minus the third the identity. n tensor n minus the 30 identity and we don't have any tons nail at the front. So what f is doing is penalizing biaxiality. G has to do with our magnetic field. So g is also non-negative and it's zero if q is in a sense parallel to q infinity, which means parallel to the alignment of the magnetic field. So we define q infinity by e three times third e three minus the third of the identity. Minus 38n. So what we see here is that f plus g is minimized exactly when q is equal to q infinity. And the interesting part happens when we impose a boundary condition. So yesterday, Dominic talked about homeotropic or normal anchoring, and today I'm going to talk about tangent or planar anchoring. So what we impose is that QB, our boundary condition, is uniaxial almost everywhere on the surface of our particle. And the eigenvector, the leading eigenvector dotted with the outward normal is zero. And so that's our tangency coefficient. Again, this is our energy. And what we're interested in is the large particle limits. So we're taking c and eta to zero, and we're doing this in such a way that eta over c is tending to infinity. And so this eta over xi tending to infinity corresponds to this weak magnetic field in the limit. Magnetic field in the limit. So, what we want to do is first look at the energy bounds of our minimizers, and after establishing these bounds, we want to use them to try to see what we can say about possible defects. So, first we look at the lower bound. So, QC eta minimizes our energy subject to some tangential boundary condition. And what we see is under our limiting regime, we get that the limit nth is. Regime, we get that the limit nth is bounded below by this integral of a constant times 1 minus n3 of the boundary condition. So the main takeaway is that we're able to find this lower bound and it depends explicitly on our prescribed boundary data. And so a natural question is, is there one optimal choice of QP which further minimizes this energy? And so the answer is yes and no. No in the sense that it's not unique, but what we can unique but what we can do is we can define qb star to be optimal whenever the normal is not plus or minus e3 so in essence what we're doing here is we're taking e3 we're projecting it onto the tangent plane and we're rescaling it so we're normalizing it and the property that this has is that it's maximizing the n3 component and as we saw our energy was one minus the n3 component so maximizing this n3 component in the table Maximizing this N3 component in the tangent space minimizes our energy. And when Î½ is equal to plus or minus E3, we don't have uniqueness because every tangential boundary condition has N3 being 0. But what we can get from this is a corollary. So under the exact same assumptions as our lower bound, we have some prescribed boundary data. We get this one uniform lower bound that depends only on properties of the man. That depends only on properties of the manifold. So, to show that that lower bound is in fact correct, what we want to do is construct a recovery sequence of maps, which attains that energy as an upper bound. So, we have this sequence of maps qc eta h delta, where h is some large parameter and delta is a small parameter, and the boundary data that we prescribe is qp delta, so it depends explicitly on delta. Explicitly on delta. Then, as we take eta and c to zero, what we see is that the limit is bounded above by something that looks a lot like our energy from the lower bounds. We have this constant times one minus the third component of the boundary condition, plus something which will disappear as we take h to infinity. Moreover, we're able to choose qb delta in such a way that pointwise, v3 delta converges to root 1 minus To root 1 minus nu3 squared, which as we saw was what our optimal boundary condition is. And so I'll talk a little bit more about how we're choosing this B delta on the next slide. But for now, the important takeaway is that after taking these limits, we recover the same energy from our load of ramp. So we might wonder: why not just take this optimal band? Why not just take this optimal boundary condition to start and construct the competitor using that optimal boundary condition? And so I'm going to look at just the simple case of a torus to see why this might not be favorable. So if we look at just a slice of the torus, we would have these vectors kind of pointing towards the top of the torus, and on one side, they would want to make the optimal turn to E three this way, and on the other side, they would want to turn the opposite way. Side, they would want to turn the opposite way. And what this would do is force a defect in that region. And so, what we're able to do is use this extra degree of freedom from a tangential boundary condition to get around this. So, we define, in the case of the torus, how we can see this is rather than taking the vectors to approach like this, we kind of turn them both in the same direction. So, at the top of the torus, they're pointing around that circle. Circle. And so, in doing this, we save in the gradient, but we pay a little bit more in the boundary terms. So, looking at the energy estimates, so this kind of comes into the proof of the proposition for the upper bound. But we just want to look at the terms here. So, kind of the worst term in terms of eta is this eta. Of eta is this eta squared log eta. But what we can see in literature for similar setups, as in Alamo, Bronze Far, Dilavadi, Lamine, is that Saturn rings want to behave something like eta log C. But what we're seeing is that our energy is behaving like eta squared log eta, which is a lot smaller. And so this kind of gives an intuition that maybe we can show that line defects don't happen in this regime. Don't happen in this regime. So we propose the following conjecture. So we have two regimes to consider, eta log C tending to some positive number beta, and eta log C tending to zero. So in the first case, we would have to show that these line defects are in fact bounded below by eta log c, which is not necessarily easy. But if we're able to do that, then we But if we're able to do that, then we kind of know how to proceed to show that line defects can't happen. And so the strategy here is basically from the lower bound, we would get that boundary energy term plus a constant coming from these line defects, whereas in the upper bound, we would only have the boundary term. And so we would run into this contradiction where our lower bound is strictly larger than the upper bound, and we would say, okay, no line defects can happen. In the other case, where In the other case, where eta log c tends to 0, we would not be able to proceed the same way. And so, in that case, we'll have to find better estimates in order to say something about line defects. And I'm going to finish off with just an application of these energy bounds. So, what we kind of run into this question of: is there an optimal orientation for our manifold M? So, M is just a particle. So, M is just a particle floating in pneumatic liquid crystal. So, it's kind of free-flowing. It can turn however it wants in order to minimize this energy. And from our estimates, we get the limiting energy to look like this, a constant times 1 minus root 1 minus nu 3 squared, where I've written it as nu dot into e3. And the idea is that we want to optimize this limiting energy by varying the magnetic field. So, really, what we care about is. So, really, what we care about is how the manifold is oriented with respect to the magnetic field. And rather than rotating the manifold itself, it's easier to just change the magnetic field and see how the energy changes. So the problem that we're going to be considering is we want to minimize this energy by varying n infinity, which is our alignment at infinity, and its S2 value. And so, kind of a picture of this is going back to the torus. So, in this picture, The torus. So, in this picture here, we have a magnetic field kind of pointing out of the board, and in the other one, the magnetic field is pointing upwards. And we see very different things happening here, and so we can expect different energies in the living. And it's not really clear exactly which of these would be favorable, and so we would have to perform that optimization to kind of figure it out. Thank you for listening. Questions? One thing about optimizing amongst the mapples themselves, the ends itself. As in, like keeping the volume constant, like within a certain class. Possibly, that's going to be problems. Possibly that might that's going to be probably a lot more difficult than the problem we're proposing, but I suppose it could be done. All right, well there aren't other questions. Just thank you again. You shouldn't stop and record again because it should stop between. I apologize for it.
