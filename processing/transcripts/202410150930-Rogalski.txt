So, in this talk, it's going to take me kind of a while to get to the new stuff that this paper is about. Let's joint with Rob Wan and James Zhang. Because first, I want to remind you of what integrals are and then what homological integrals are. So, very happy that Dieming Liu, Chen Shi Wu, and James, who invented Chen Shi Wu and James Zhang, who invented homological integrals, are all here. And then I need to maybe try to convince you that weak half algebras are something worth looking at. And then finally, I'll get to how to define homological integrals for those. Okay, so let me start by reviewing integrals for Hof algebras. So Suppose we have a finite dimensional Hof algebra over some field K. So just to set notation, if I need the multiplication map or the unit map for an algebra, I'll call them M and U. And the co-product and co-unit will be delta and epsilon. So this is a co-algebra. This is a co-algebra. And I like to use summless sweeter notation. So the image of H under delta, I just write as H1 tensor H2. Of course, epsilon here goes from H to K. And of course, delta and epsilon are algebra maps. It's how you define the notion of a body. How you define the notion of a bi algebra. And then we have some antipode. I don't think the properties of the antipode come into this very explicitly, so I won't define it for you. And for anyone that doesn't work with Hofalgebras a lot, the most important example to keep in mind is just a group algebra, and that's going to be my kind of basic example I generalize throughout this talk. Generalize throughout this talk. Okay, so what's an integral? So in the finite-dimensional case, we always have integrals. So this will be a left integral. So it's some non-zero element of H with the property that when you left multiply by another element of H, you just scale by the unit. The unit, the co-unit applied to H. Okay, so in other words, the one-dimensional vector space spanned by this integral is isomorphic to the trivial module. Where, of course, the trivial module for H is given by the co-unit. Okay, so these always exist. So the theorem is these are always these exist and are unique up to scalar. And so, of course, there's a right integral as well. It's just defined in the analogous way. And when H is finite dimensional, you can take the dual, and that's also a Huff algebra, and you have. And that's also a Huff algebra, and you have left and right integrals for the dual. So, all of these things, these four integrals, are crucial in the structure theory of H. For example, there's a beautiful formula of Radford that gives the fourth power of the antipode, some formula for s to the fourth in terms of those four integrals. Or another example is the Larson-Sweder theorem, so the theorem of Larson and Swedler. Yes. The third line here. So this is just the k-vector space spanned by the integral. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so the Larson-Sweeter theorem says that if you apply the co-unit to the integral, then that's non-zero exactly when H is semi-simple as an algebra. So this gives some kind of criterion for semi-simplicity of your algebra purely in terms of the integral of the co-unit. All right, so. All right, so I said you can keep the group algebra in mind as your examples. So if G is a finite group and we take H to be the group algebra, then it's easy to check that you can take the left integral to just be the sum of the group elements. Or you can divide by the order of the group if you want, if your characteristic zero. And of course, this is. And of course, this is that's the element that's well known to generate the copy of the trivial representation inside the regular representation of the group. Or for another example, if you take the dual, the integral in this algebra, so if you want to indicate the algebra you're working in, you can write it down here. In this case, it's equal to E star where E star, where if we enumerate the group elements in some way, taking the identity element to be the first one, then we're taking the dual basis. So, in the dual base to the group elements, we take the dual element to the identity element, and that's the integral in that case. So, it's an easy calculation to check. An easy calculation to check that. So those are both easy to describe there. Okay, so integrals are crucial for understanding finite dimensional Hop algebras. And one would like to have some way of doing something similar for infinite dimensional Hop algebras. And this definition definitely does not work. Definitely does not work. So the homological integral was the theory developed to handle this. So again, this is Lu Wu Zhang. So to motivate this, still in the finite dimensional case, so when H is finite dimensional, When H is finite dimensional, we also know that H is a Frobenius algebra. So the dual is isomorphic to H, let's say, as left H modules. And in fact, the integral is used in proving this. And in fact, one way of thinking about what this means is if you take X from the trivial module to H. Take x from the trivial module to h, you're going to get zero when i is not zero, and you'll just get something one-dimensional when i is zero. So why is this? So first of all, the fact that h is Frobenius means that h is self-injective. So these x's have to vanish when i is bigger than zero, because h is an injective module. But then the hum from k to h is just picking out a copy of the trivial module. Just picking out a copy of the trivial module inside H. And there's a unique one up, the scalar of those by the theory of integrals. So this is actually the thing that gets generalized to find the homological integrals. But not for every Hof algebra. So Up. So here's the first time that maybe something related to this conference comes up, right? So a Hof algebra, now not necessarily finite dimensional, is called AS Korenste. If so, so first of all, H has finite injective dimension. Its injective dimension as a left or a right module. And the second thing is X from the trivial module to H are vanishing when I is not the injective dimension. And it's a one-dimensional module when I is equal to the injective dimension. Equal to the objective dimension. So here when I write k, I'm not talking about module structure. This is just as a vector space. We want the x to d from k to h to be one-dimensional. Okay, so this is a direct generalization of the AS-Gorenstein condition for graded algebras, which is just a weaker form of the AS regularity condition. That's the theme of this conference, where if you want Where, if you want A as regular, you would assume finite global dimension. So, in fact, we can do that as well. So, we call H A as regular if the global dimension of H is D, rather than just assuming the injective dimension of H as a module is D. So AS regular algebras are also interesting Hof algebras, but for the homological integral, I only need AS core and. Integral, I only need a score and steam. So now here's the definition. Let H be A.S. Gorenstein of dimension D. Of course, a Hof algebra. If I write H, it's always a Hof algebra. Well, actually, it might be a weak Hof algebra later. Weak Hof algebra later, but for now, it's always a Hof algebra. Then we define the homological integral, the left homological integral, to be X D from the trivial module to H. So by definition, this is a one-dimensional module. So, as a left module, this is always trivial. So, the left module structure of this comes from here, which is the trivial action of H on K, but it has some potentially non-trivial right action coming from here. So, what we care about here is really as a right H module. You can also think of it as a bimodule, but the left structure is not interesting. But the right module structure carries interesting information. Structure carries interesting information. It's a one-dimensional H module, which is not necessarily the trivial module, but it is special. So what we can note is because this is a one-dimensional right module, when we act on the right by some h, it's always a scalar multiple of itself. So this map. This map, which associates a scalar to each element in the Hof algebra, is always an algebra map. So it's a character. So we can think of rho as group-like in the dual. Okay, so of course, you can do this with finite-dimensional half-algebra as well. Half-altrus as well, that one of the points of the integral is the right action gives you a group-like element in the dual. And this works just the same for homological integrals. So once you have this crucial insight that you can define this integral homologically, then you get this interesting information of a group-like element. And of course, you can also define the right integral and get information from that as well. Well. So, so what's an example? I said I wanted to follow group algebras throughout as my examples. So, let D be the infinite dihedral group. So, let's present it in this way with two generators g and x, where x is free. g squared is g squared is one, g x, g inverse equals x inverse. And then we can take h to be the group algebra of D so you can check that this is, in fact, an A S regular Hof algebra of dimension one and the homological integral in this case. Is the x one and you can calculate it as the following one-dimensional module. So h mod x minus one, g plus one. This is as write modules. So this is not the trivial module. The way the co-unit acts. The way the co-unit acts on this outspreads by sending both g and x to one. So the trivial module would mount out by x minus one and g minus one, right? So this is some non-trivial right module structure on the integral. In fact, you can check that this is an invertible object in the associated tensor category. It's an invertible object that has order two, that we'll come back in a minute. Okay, so this theory, let me just say this theory was essential. This theory meaning homological integrals for the classification of regular affine Ethereum prime. Of GK dimension one. So there's a beautiful and non-trivial classification of these GK dimension one Hof algebras, and they're always AS-Gorenstein. So you can always use the homological integral as a tool for understanding these. The infinite dihedral group is one of them. These. The infant dihedral group is one of them. And I won't list all the authors that did this, starting with Chancy and James, but then a number of other people contributed to this classification. Since I'm not writing down what it is, but it's just one example of how the integral gets used. Let me pause for a second. See how much time I've used up. Are there any questions so far? Yes. So, so this, yeah, it should be the finite tool, but this row is in the finite. The finite tool, but this row is in the finite tool. Yeah. So, um, how do they write this? Is it like that? Okay. Okay, so what Rob, James, and I wanted to do is generalize this theory to Weakhof algebras. So weak hoff algebra. So, weak Hof algebras. So, there's a whole part of Hof algebra theory that deals with generalizations of the Hof condition. So, weak Hof algebras is one of them. You'll find quasi-Hof algebras, Hof algebroids, Hofish algebras. I don't know what those are, actually. And there's probably even more I don't know about. Or I don't know about a hofnoid. So because you can generalize this in so many ways, I think there is kind of a stigma associated to some of this area where it seems like some of it is generalization for its own sake. And in fact, when I gave a version of this talk at USC where Susan Montgomery is. Where Susan Montgomery is, of course, one of the great experts in finite-dimensional Hof algebras, she admitted to being still unconvinced about weak Hof algebras afterwards. So, you know, there's some work to be done there to convince people that this is something worth looking at. I do think it is. So I will try to do that a little bit. Although I will start by not actually defining what it is. Actually, defining what it is. So you can tell me if that was a good strategy or not. So definition star. So it's an algebra and a co-algebra. That part's the same. That part's the same. We use the same notation, but it's not a bi-algebra. So we don't assume that delta and epsilon are multiplicative maps, or we don't, or are algebra maps, or equivalently, we don't necessarily assume that m and u are both co-algebra maps. We assume part of that. So we require delta to be multiplicative. Delta to be multiplicative and epsilon is unital. So the two things that are missing is we don't require that delta is unital. So that might not be one tensor one. And we don't require epsilon to be multiplicative. So this might not be equal to one, and epsilon may not be multiplicative. And there's an antipode. So what I don't want to tell you is exactly what we assume instead about delta one or about epsilon or about the antipode. So plus antipode satisfying some kind of axiom. The axioms are not illuminating. And in fact, one of my goals in working with these objects has been to avoid using the axioms whenever possible because I don't really understand them myself. There are definitely papers where the authors clearly are comfortable with these axioms and they manipulate them in all sorts of ways. They manipulate them in all sorts of ways, and I can't do that. So instead, we've tried to do everything we can with these objects by focusing on the monoidal category that they give and its properties. And when you look at it that way, it is very similar to a Hof algebra. So I want to describe what that monodal category is. But first, let me just give a basic example of a weak Hof algebra that shows that there are. Shows that there are very natural examples. So for Hof algebras, I focused on group algebras as my example. So for weak Hof algebras, natural finite dimensional examples are given by group OIGs. So this is just some categories. I'm going to assume it has finitely many objects. I'm going to assume it has finitely many objects, and all morphisms are isomorphisms. So, this is some category. And so, we'll enumerate the objects one through n, and all morphisms, of which I assume there are finitely many, are isomorphisms. Then we can define the group-wide algebra. So if P and Q were morphisms, so this group-wide algebra equals the, has a basis of morphisms, of the morphisms, just like with group algebra. Of course, the group can be thought of as. Can be thought of as a group point with one object and all group elements correspond to arrows of morphisms, rather than which arrays morphisms. So that's how we're generalizing. So now we take a basis of our algebra to be the set of morphisms. And then for PQ morphisms, we define the product to be the composition one that makes sense if these two are composable. And otherwise, zero. Then this is always a weakoff algebra with the same kinds of delta and epsilon as for group algebra. So if we take delta. Delta so that every morphism is group-like and in fact you can take the antipode to take every morphism to its inverse, then kg is a weak hof algebra. Okay, so just by generalizing the group algebra concept a little bit from one object to finitely many objects, we leave the category of Hof algebras and we're in this world of weak Hof algebras. But we haven't gotten anything too crazy, right? But just to see that it's not a Hof algebra. So notice that the identity element of this algebra is the sum of The identity morphisms at each vertex. So, this is the identity element at the object I. So, of course, the sum of those is the unit element. But what happens when we take delta of one? This is going to be by this group-like property, the sum over I of EI tensor EI, and that is not equal to. And that is not equal to one tensor one, which would have two sums. So you would get the sum over i and j of e i tensor ej. So you see right away that this is not Hofaldzer in the usual sense because delta does not preserve one. And in fact, epsilon is also not multiplicative. In fact, there's a basic theorem. A basic theorem that says that if either delta one equals one or epsilon is multiplicative, then you must have a normal Hof algebra. Yes. So for example, let's take n objects and one morphism. I to J for all I J. Then there's exactly one groupoid like this, because so that in fact that's called as morphism EIJ, then the composition rule is forced to be this. And so you can see then that, so if this is G, then the group point algebra is isomorphic to the matrix algebra as a ring. Both, yes. Yeah, so this again shows you how you've left the category of Hof algebras because there can be no Hofalge. Because there can be no Hof algebra structure on a matrix ring when n is bigger than one, because the co-unit would be some algebra map to K, which does not exist if n is bigger than one. Okay, so this is, in fact, this is one advertisement for Wyckoff algebras. There's a wider variety of algebras that can carry such a structure. Matrix rings over K. You can show that given any two-week Hoff algebras, the direct sum is again. Weak Hof algebras, the direct sum is again weak Hof algebra. That doesn't work for Hof algebras. So it's kind of a more flexible construction. The other advertisement is the tensor category, which I'll tell you about next. Okay, so let H be we cop algebra. So sometimes people abbreviate this as WHA or WA, I guess. So there's a special, in fact, two special sub-algebras. So Algebras. So, but I'll just focus on one of them. So, we have the co-unit, but there's this special map called epsilon t, which does the following. So, because the co-unit does not send one to one, you know, we can do that. Not send one to one in a Wyckoff algebra, then if we follow Sweder notation, we get this. So it's a little awkward, right? But the unit object goes to some sum of tensors. So we indicate the coordinates as one sub one and one sub two. So if you use those elements here, of course, there's a hidden sum. This defines some map from H to itself. map from from h to itself um and we call h t the image of this epsilon t under h this is always that was not an alarm to tell me anything about my talk come forward okay um so this is always a semi-simple A semi-simple finite-dimensional subalgebra of H. It's called the target subalgebra. There's also an H sub S, which is the source subalgebra. So these names come from the group height algebra case, where these algebras have something to do with the source and targets of the morphisms. But the point is, every Wekoff algebra comes with this special. Hof algebra comes with this special finite-dimensional sub-algebra. For a Hof algebra, it's just the base field. And we can use this to define a monoidal structure on the modules. Yes, question? So it's not a Hof subalgebra. It's just a subalgebra in the multiplicative structure. But it's a semi-simple. So if K is algebraically closed, it could be any product of matrix strings over K in general. T is just some notation for this special subalgebra. Yeah. I think the problem okay. So you're taking the groupoid. I'm not sure I understand what your groupoid is. Yeah. I mean, not that I know of, right? I mean, of course. I mean, not that I know of, right? I mean, of course, this delta makes sense for any group void, but I don't know what that corresponds to geometrically in your picture. It's just a theorem. This is always, so this is some. So, this is some very special idempotent element of H tensor H in Swether notation. So, there are finally many second coordinates that are happening here. So, this is the sum, right? And so it's a sum of scalars times these one, twos, right? So, it's definitely landing in a finite-dimensional subspace. Yeah. Yeah. So, this is finite-dimensional, semi-simple sub-algebra. And so, so for the group algebra, So for the group algebra, it is just the K-span of these EIs. So it's isomorphic to the product of N copies of K in the group algebra case. Okay, so how do I use this? So now I want to look at the category of Category of left H modules. So for any such M, in fact, M is a bimodule over this HT. So this is, it's not obvious, something one checks where. On the left, you just act by the fact that H is inside H, but on the right, you apply the antipode to Y. Actually, the inverse of the antipode, as it turns out. So don't worry too much about this formula, but there is a natural biomodule structure on any H module here, and then we define. And then we define for any 2H modules, we define a product. So I'm going to write this as over bar because it's not just tensor over K. In fact, what we do is we tensor over HT, which makes sense because M and N are both, in fact, HTHT bimodules. And then we can define an H-mantle structure on this in the usual way using the co-product. So, this is again an H module. So, how does an element H act on some element? On some element in here, it acts in the way you expect, which is you apply the co-products to H before acting. Okay, so I'm hiding a lot of details here. There's a bunch of things to be checked because I've defined the tensor structure using tensor over HT, you have to make sure that this is well defined. A number of things to check. And And in fact, this makes H mod into a monodo category with unit object being this H T. So H T has a natural left H action. Which I won't write down, but this is naturally a left-hand module. And of course, it makes sense that that's the unit objective. This is the definition of the Minodo product. Okay. And this Minodo category has lots of nice properties, similarly to the Minodo category of modules over a Hof algebra. So Friesen this way, the difference between a Hof algebra and a weak Hof algebra. Algebra and the Weakhoff algebra is just that the underlying monodal structure on the category modules is given by tensoring over a semi-simple finite dimensional K algebra instead of over K itself. And you can make this much more formal. So there's a theory of fiber functors that, in fact, tells you that any monodal category on a module category, which is given by just tensoring over the By just tensoring over the underlying k-vector spaces in some way, you can reconstruct the Hof algebra that that effect came from. And there's a similar thing for Weak Hof algebras. Any monodal structure on a module category that comes from tensoring over a semi-simple algebra must come from a weak hoff algebra structure on the ring. So, this is kind of the, I think, one of the stronger justifications for this is that you're getting very interesting monodoke. That you're getting very interesting Minota categories, which generalize Huff algebras just slightly. But these are quite a bit more general. So for example, in the theory of fusion categories, you can show that any fusion category must come from a weak Hof algebra, whereas they don't all come from Hof algebras. Yeah. So the relation with marine equivalence is not clear, right? So what's true is if you have a weak hof algebra and you take matrices over it, there is some weak hoff algebra structure on that, but it's not uniquely determined. So I don't really understand. So, I don't really understand. I don't see that there's kind of a unique way to go from one Rita equivalent algebra to another. So, yeah, I'm not sure. I don't know. So, if you know about Hoffitz algebras, you can tell me later. Yeah. Um well, so so there um yeah, so Yeah, I'm the fly on the phi, I'm not, I'm not sure. I I'm not sure if you can see it. Sorry, again. Yeah, so it's always if you assume the base fields out directly closed, right? Yeah, then it's a finite product of matrix rings. So I mean, it just trust me that if I had given you the axioms for Wykof algebra, that wouldn't have made this any better. It is just a tricky concept. Okay, so we wondered: is there a theory of integrals for infinite-dimensional Wiekoff algebras? So there was already a generalization of the notion of integral to finite-dimensional Wiekoff algebra. So in the finite dimensional case for finite dimensional Wiekhoff algebras, there's been a lot of work by the people that specialize in that area, basically generalizing everything they can from the finite dimensional theory. From the finite dimensional theory over to the weak case. But very little done for infinite dimensional ones. So we were interested in infinite dimensional weakoff algebras, and we managed to generalize the integral. So, first of all, we want to do this for some kind of Gorenstein algebras, Gorenstein-Weikov algebra. Algebras, Gorstein, Wiekoff algebras. So we just changed the definition of Goriesteen a little bit. So again, we assume that H has finite injective dimension. But for the X condition, it's useful to assume. Condition, it's useful to assume something a little more general. So we take any finite-dimensional H module V, and we want it to be zero when I is not D, and just some finite-dimensional module when I is equal to D. So for all finite dimensional V and H mod, finite dimensional over the over the base field. So this turns out to be equivalent. turns out to be equivalent um to the definition i gave for for hof algebras um but for in the weak case we well we have a trivial module but but the trivial module is not a simple module so in general um so so it's better to just assume this for um for all finite dimensionals that x sting x d to h gives us something finite dimensional. To h gives us something finite-dimensional. So, with this definition of A.S.-Korenstein, we can define the homological integral. So, if H is A.S.-Korenstein-Wiekhoff algebra, then we just follow the same recipe. So, this is, of course, of dimension D. Of course, of dimension d we follow the same recipe as the homological integral in the Hough algebra case. So, so what do we put here? So, if you if you think about it, for homological integrals, you put the trivial module k here. But one way of thinking about what the trivial module is for a Hof algebra is it is the unit object in the underlying monoidal category of modules. So, we put H T here, which is the unit object. Which is the unit object in our category. And this is Azerite H module. This HT? And yes, in fact, so this condition, so H T is finite dimensional. So the A. S-Gornstein condition tells us that this XT is always finite dimensional as well. As well. So, yes, this is a finite-dimensional rate H module. It may be equivalent if we put HT here, but I have not checked. I think that's something we never checked. Okay, so one difference here is: I mean, this is a right H module from this. It's not even a left H module at all anymore, right? So, this trivial module HT is only a left H module. It's not an HH by module in general. Okay, but the left structure wasn't interesting before, anyway. It was trivial. So, it's the right structure that gives you something interesting. So, finally, I can. So finally, I can state our theorem. So, our main theorem right now is just we're able to define this, and we can show it has a bunch of good properties that are analogous to the ones you get for homological integrals. So let H be A as quarantine. We cough algebra of dimension d and let this be the homological integral we defined. So the first thing is: so this homological integral is invertible in the category of In the category of write H modules. So this category also has a monoidal structure. I didn't define it, but it's just dual to the one I had defined for the left modules. And so in other words, by saying this is invertible here, so i.e. there is some w in mod h. In mod H, such that the integral and then take the Minodo product on write modules, sensor W is isomorphic to the unit object in the right Minodo category. The unit object is something called HS. It's just the dual of HT on the other side. So, this is somehow for the So, for the homological integral, you get a group-like element by looking at the right side. And in particular, you can also show that the homological integral is an invertible object in the Minodo category. So, this is basically a generalization of that for weak-algebras. So, that's number one. So HS is sure. So it's the image of the map epsilon S, which and epsilon S sends H211 times epsilon of H12. So I don't think that's going to help. So, I don't think that's going to help you, but it. So, HS and HT are both there, but they, in fact, you get one from one to the other by applying the antipode. So basically, if you know one, you know the other one. But they don't have to be equal. Okay, so two. Okay, so two, suppose H is Ethereum. Then we get a version of the Vandenberg condition, which is something that came up in Chenchi's talk. So let the He be the enveloping algebra. Be the enveloping algebra H tensor HOP. So a left HE module is the same as a HH by module. So if we look at this Huckshell homology group, so X over HE from H to He, we get zero when I is not D. When I is not D, and we get U an invertible H H by module when I equals D. So this is, we can call it the Vandenberg condition. So basically, Art and Schelter regularity is now known to be equivalent to twisted or skewed collabial for connected graded algebras. So this is something closer to the twisted collabial condition for H. And so For age. And so it's something that's more or less, well, it's more like a, sorry, a twisted Claviel-Gorenstein condition. So we're not assuming finite global dimension. But these sort of conditions are usually closely connected to the sort of ones that we get in the Gorenstein condition. And this is happening here. So, moreover, S is automatically by S is automatically bijective. S is the antipode. So we didn't assume that the antipode is bijective in our work. It actually falls out when we have an Ethereum condition. And there's a long history of results like this. A basic question about infinite-dimensional Hof algebras is: does the antibode have to be bijective if you don't assume that? And so this is a version of a theory. And so this is a version of a theorem that was proved by Liu O, Wang, and Yu about the bijectivity of the entipode. And we're generalizing it to the weak case. And then finally, we can look at the functor, which is tensor on the right over U. U is an invertible HH by module. So this is some auto equivalence from the category of write H modules to itself. Write H modules to itself. And this is expressible in terms of the integral. So the left integral is some right module. You do the tensor product in the monodal category of right modules. And this is the functor that twists by the square of the antipode on the right. So, this gives this functor as a combination of other auto-equivalences. You have the auto-equivalence that's pulling back by s squared here. S is an automorphism. And then you have the tensor with this invertible object in the category of write modules. So it's an explicit way of thinking about what this auto-equivalence does and tying it back to the integral. And this, again, generalizes work that was already known for homological integrals. Homological integrals. This goes back to work of Ken Brown and James Zhang, a version of this for homological integrals. Okay, so right now our main theme is, I mean, it was a lot of work, but it's kind of a theory in search of something to do with. And so the obvious thing that one would like to do is, for example, Is, for example, understand some interesting classes of Wyckoff algebras of low GK dimension. So, this is kind of a basic question. I thought it was in progress. Can we understand weak Hof algebras of GK dimension one? Dimension one under some hypotheses. Okay, so I mentioned earlier there's this beautiful classification of GK1 Hof algebras, well, with more restrictions. Ethereum prime, I think affine. Prime is important. Regular. So for sure, we'd want to say regular here. So we assume finite global dimension and probably prime. And probably prime. So basically, what new things do we get in the weak world when we move away from just Hof algebras? But this classification in the Hof algebra case was hard, so making any progress here would, I think, be interesting. And let me just close just with an example to show you. To show you that this is not kind of an empty class, so let W be a finite-dimensional Wiek-Hoff algebra. So for example, this could be a groupoid algebra. And let's assume that we have sigma, a Wyckoff automorphism. So that just means. So that just means what you think it does. It's an automorphism of the algebra and co-algebra structures. Then we can construct a GK1 Wyckoff algebra kind of an obvious way by taking an OR extension with X being group-like. So we take the Rant polynomials over W. Laurent polynomials over W twisted by sigma. So this is a Wiekhoff algebra with GK dimension 1 where we take X to be group-like. That also forces the antipodes at X to X inverse. So in fact, So, in fact, what is the integral in this case? So, we can calculate it. So, it turns out to be equal as a vector space to the integral of w. So, as write w modules. But this is supposed to have some write h structure, so I could. Structure. So I can also tell you how x acts on this. Oh, right. Where for some lambda in that integral, how x acts on the right is actually just by applying sigma inverse. So this is some kind of easy to produce class of algebras of GK dimension one that are Rikov algebras, but there's probably much more exotic examples out there. So I believe I am basically out of time, so I will stop now. Thank you.
