Thanks, Christoph, and thanks all the organizers. As I look back in the last two decades or so, I realize that I come to Banff for major workshops once every 10 years. I was here in 2004, was a workshop organized by my late colleague Tom Hood, Daniel Sander Falklands. Daniel Zarifos, Philip Prater, and Lane Houston. And I was looking at the list of participants yesterday. So we had like Walter Schachermeyer, David Heath, Steve Freed. You know, you go on, it was a veritable who is who in math finance. And I was a young puppy, so I was like, who is he? when I was giving my top. But anyways, so I have very, very good memories of that work. Very good memories of the workshop. Then in 2014, I'm sure the workshop was also very good, but the only thing I remember was Uly Horse jumping beside me at the pub when Germany won against Brazil 7-1. So the rest of the workshop is a blow. I got thoroughly depressed. They had to send a search partially working for me at the Polo Reaver. So I'm sorry. And so I'm sorry if you were at that workshop. I don't remember your talk. I don't remember. I only remember that episode. So now, you know, 2024, I'm enjoying a lot more. There is no reason to be depressed. I'm enjoying, and in particular seeing young scholars. And the contrast with the 2004 workshop is visible. You can just look at the list of participants, look at the list of participants now. So I'm expecting a lot from many of you here, and there's a lot of good things coming. The particular talk that I'm going to give is also kind of reflecting back on an obsession of mine for the last eight years or so, maybe more. It's this idea that, so I read some time ago in this book by Kindelberger. In this book by Kindelberger and Hallebert. So, Kindelberger was the main author there. He was a great economic historian. And this is the best book I ever read on the history of financial crisis. And he has this quote there. Most increases in the supply of credit do not lead to a menu. So there are times when you increase the supply of credit and there is no menu. But nearly every menu has been associated with a Has been associated with a rapid growth in the supply of credit to a particular group of borrowers. So it is a historical fact, and it goes back to the tulip bubble, if you like. You know, the tulip bubble reached its peak with people betting on futures on tulips in things called colleges, which were nothing but like drinking clubs and taverns in Amsterdam. And they were doing that with credit money from the tavern. So the tavern would say, yeah, go ahead and bank. And then it would just increase your credit. And then it just increases your credit. And so, to some extent, this happened in every single financial bubble, and then it crashed afterwards. So, I decided to see how one can have a model about it. If it's a historical, established historical fact, let's try to have a model. So, I turned to conventional macroeconomics, in particular, dynamic stochastic generic Libra models. Librant models, and the answer was not there because this has to be something to do with the dynamics, the contraction and expansion of credit. And in many models, the private credit is not even present in the models. And many of you know this, and if you don't, it might come to us as a surprise that many of the macroeconomic models that are actually used by people in central banks, for example, don't have banks. The purpose of a central bank is to regulate banks and to use microeconomic models that don't have banks. So I thought that was strange, and I wanted to look into more about that. So if the macroeconomic models per se don't have credit, then there's very little chance that the more microeconomic models that relate to the literature of financial bubbles would have that connection with credit as well. So they have all sorts of So they have all sorts of asymmetries and frictions and things that could lead to a financial bubble, but this role of credit is also not there. So I set myself on a road to try to fix that, but with different types of models, and then took a big detour, and maybe I'm going to talk in the end with some of the related literature. It was mostly fixed in like a decent economic model that I was satisfied. Economic model that I was satisfied with, and then connection with financial markets would put it on pause, but decided to kind of take that back on. But so, my co-author is Julian Guain, who is now in Montpellier, he was a postdoc at Macrasu when we started this work in the interview. So, starting with what kind of economic model I have in mind, so this goes under the framework of stockflow consistent models. It's a strain of macroeconomic models, not very popular. Macroeconomic model is not very popular, but it's becoming more popular, in particular, because it has got the attraction of people dealing with climate finance. So it became something that could be a framework to tackle climate finance. But it was there before. So the framework consists of looking at the economy as not a representative agent, not a couple of representative agents, but as sectors instead. And you might ask, what is the difference if you have one representative agent per sector? If you have one representative agent per sector, is that in the sector you're looking at average behavior? A representative agent is kind of a delta function on the sector. This has a lot more flexibility in the behavior of the constituents of the sector. Once you divide the economy in sectors, you want to understand three things. The first thing is who owes what to who. So what are the balance sheets? So, what are the balance sheets? So, the balance sheets are kind of the opening position. So, these are the assets and the liabilities. So, anything that appears with a plus sign, an implicit plus sign, there is an asset. A minus sign is a liability. So, for example, for a bank, their assets are the loans that they make to the private sector, which then will have those loans as their liability, and so on and so forth. They add up to zero if they are financial ISIS, because every time there's an issuer and other Is an issuer and a buyer of that financial asset. But real assets, capital, things like factories, tractors, tables, computers, they are not liability for anybody, so they're just physical assets, so they cannot respect capital K. Then... And why there is no loans for households? That's just an assumption of the model. So I'm just simplifying because here the bulk of the activity, which is going to be... The activity is going to be by firms that are going to be borrowing from banks to speculate. And of course, households can do that too, but they do that in a much smaller scale. So that's why I'm ignoring. We have financial crisis. But the mortgages are considered. So when you have a mortgage in the financial national accounts, the real estate is considered as part of. Considered as part of this special category. You are like a sole proprietor of a business that is your house. That's how they differentiate. So that's part of the firm. So a household that owns a house is a firm. So in real estate, you're either paying rent to a landlord, a proper landlord, which is then has a business, or you're not paying rent to yourself, so you're saving in that range. So that's how financialism. So that's how financial is a macroeconomic account in a real estate. But very well observed, this could be part of this framework as well. So once the balance sheets are set up, then there are transactions that happen between those sectors. So for example, households consume, so that pays to the firm sector. Firms have to pay wages to their workers, and there are many transactions about interest payments that go into different directions. Once you add up all of the Once you add up all of the transactions with the pluses and minus, then you arrive at the balance for a sector, which sometimes is called a saving for that sector, which just saves what's available now to reinvest in the existing financial assets. So this balance here will be redistributed according, so it's going to increase or decrease your position depending on whether the balance is positive or negative. So if you're a negative balance, you're going to be increasing the row. Negative balance, you're going to be increasing the loans. If you have a positive balance, you're going to be increasing some border passage. Now, a little dot there is the time derivative of that. So, now you can see that by linking these transactions with the financial balances, you have a way of generating coupled systems of differential equations, which is going to be the engine of the model. Very well. So, just a few more definitions for the macroeconomic model. For the macroeconomic model, so y is going to denote the output, so total production, and we're going to take a simple formulation of that that says that production is a multiple of the installed capacity. So there's the capital in the economy, and there's a capital to output ratio that is constant. Everything in the talk that has a bar on top of it is a constant parameter. Everything else changes in time. So this is called a Leontiev production function. And that, in turn, And that, in turn, tells you how much employment there is in the economy because there is a productivity per worker, A, that says how many units of output each worker produces. So once you take that into account, you know how much employment there is there. And then if you divide employment by the number of available workforce, you have the employment rate. Okay. The next line is about profits. So this is going to be kind of the key state variable. So for the firm sector, how do they generate profit? Or the firm sector, how do they generate profits by selling stuff? So they sell production at a price P, and then they have to pay a whack of things. So they pay wages at some wage rate, they pay depreciation, and then they receive interest on their deposit account and pay interest on the loan. And there's a different interest rate, and that's going to play a very important role in the market. So just dividing, normalizing it all by total output, you have this intensive variable pi. This intensive variable, pi, which can be written in terms of all these other intensive variables. So, whenever it's a lower case, it means like the big macroeconomic flow divided by GDP so that you have kind of a ratio in small magnitudes. But taxes is not part of that. Not yet. So, I could have, and that's what I said, other related work. So, you could have a government sector with taxes and with government spending, and that is just going to. Spending, and that is just going to create some other dynamics in the model. But I want to concentrate here strictly on the speculation and financial level dynamics. But if you like, you can think of taxes now as the household sector incorporates the government sector. The household sector is connected with the government sector. So any dividends that are paid from the firm sector to the household include the taxes. So anything that is Include the taxes. So, anything that is not kept in the foreign sector or paid to banks, is paid somewhere else, is part of this flows outside of the foreign sector. It's great to have someone that pays attention to the dark. The engine of the dynamics is investment that is done by funds, and that is encapsulated in this behavioral function, Kappa, that just says, you know, dependent on how much profits the firms have, they're going to invest more or less. Going to invest more or less, and that will tell you how much capital is going to increase, which then feeds back to the increase in GDP. So that's the key dynamics, if you like. And this is just like how the inflation enters in the model through a markup over labor costs. And this is a bargaining for the labor costs. That also takes into account the states of this attack, which should be E for unemployment rate. And as Sebastian knows, no, he's not hearing it. Knows, oh, no, it's not here. I told you in my life, hack, you leave your PDF, your tech file for your talk over your computer. As soon as you finish the talk, you go there and you click correctly title. Okay, so that's there. But now, I want to now focus on some more specific behavior of the firms in terms of what do they do if they don't have enough money to invest. So they have some desire to invest. If they have enough profits to invest, that's fine. To invest, that's fine, but if they want to invest more than their profits, then they need to increase their net borrowing. So now their net borrowing consists of the difference between loans and deposits. So now I need to see what goes into the deposit account and what goes into the loan account. So the assumption here, and it's typical in this macroeconomic model, is that you first put every receipt of your sales and things in your deposit account. So you put, you know, all of the sales minus the weight. The sales minus the wages that you're paying minus the depreciation plus the interest that you're receiving on the deposit account stays in the deposit account. Similarly, the loans, they increase first by the interest that you're paying on the loans. Okay, now this term shows up there and there. That is your investment, net investment, investment minus depreciation. So we are assuming that a fraction of that is done by increased borrowing, and one minus that fraction is And one minus that fraction is paid off what you have in your deposit account. Typically, this is close to one. So you wouldn't leave a lot of money in your deposit account. You're going to try to move it out. So you need to pay for additional investment from loans. Okay. This is the repayment rate for loans. So whenever you want to repay a loan, you need to pay it out of your deposit account. And now come okay, this is dividend, that's that money coming out of I say to the household or government. I say to the household or government. And now comes the key thing: F, it's a flow of speculation. So, this is extra borrowing that some firms are doing in order to purchase things that belong to other firms. So, if I'm a firm and I borrow from the bank and now I buy stocks from you, it increases your deposit account. So, it shows up in both my loan account and your deposit account. So, the net position is the same, but now because there are different interest rates and loans and deposits, Interest rates and loans and deposits, it creates more financial instability for the sector as a whole. And how does this financial flow change in time? It changes through another behavioral function that depends on the growth in the economy. So if the economy is growing, speculators say, hey, you know, there are opportunities to make money here, let's just borrow for that. If the economy is not doing that, then they're going to remove this from the speculative markets. From the speculative markets and try to do something else with it. Very well. So that's the economic setup. So, now how do you connect that with the financial market? So, this is just to show how it translates as a system of ODEs. So, it's a five-dimensional system, and I want you to pay attention to this. It's the fraction of GDP that is a flow of speculation. So, if this is 0.1, it means that 10% of GDP. means that 10% of GDP is going to this speculative purposes. Okay, so what speculative purposes? Well, you can do this. So you can speculate on real estate, you can speculate on artwork, Rolex watches. But one thing that you can speculate in is in commercial paper or paper that is or stocks that are issued by the firms themselves. So that's what we're going to do here. And it has its origins in some other work that people, you know, the most kind of The most kind of fundamental insight in economics is that money needs to go somewhere. So, this is the oldest equation in economics, the velocity equation of money. So, it says that there's some money supply, there's money up there, money circulates with a certain velocity, this has to do with transactions that are made. What is done with that is price times the amount of goods that are being purchased. So, this is the velocity equation. Is the velocity equation of money only dealing with actual goods? So this guy, Werner, extended that, kind of separated that into, okay, but now there's money that is going to speculation. So similarly, you have this flow of money into the real economy, and there's a flow of money into speculation that has got to have some effect into the quantity of transactions in the financial part of the economy and the price, the individual price of those stocks. Of those stocks. Okay, so other authors have modeled this exact type of behavior. So, for example, there's this paper by Corsi and Sonet, where they say, all right, let's just postulate that there is a quantity of money that you can measure somehow going into the financial market. And that is, its drift depends on the price of assets. Because now, if you see assets going up, you're going to try to divert more money to the financial market to speculate in those assets. To speculate on those assets. And then the asset price itself goes up if there's more money coming in. So this becomes kind of a reinforcing mechanism. And then they analyze the system. In our language, the F would be this DM over DT, and then we would have, in the deterministic case, this kind of evolution for the stock prices. The problem is that this is too singular. It leads to a finer time blow-up in the deterministic case, and it's hard. In the deterministic case, and it's hard in the stochastic case to prove that there are no finite time blowouts either. So, I don't like that very much. So, I prefer to do instead the following. So, just to say that, so it's kind of in the same philosophy, but technically modeled differently. So, I'm going to model a stock price that, in the absence of jumps, has just geometric ground motion behavior with R being a With R being a kind of baseline lending rate. So, this is how much it costs on average for people to borrow money to do transactions. So, that's not the interest rate on deposits. That's a little higher interest rate for borrowing. You'd be thinking it was a stocking tax. That's a broad stocking debt. Now, there's their jump. Their jumps. So the jumps enter here in two ways. So there's still some rationality in this market. So you maintain kind of a local margin gale property in the following rate. I'm concentrating on large downward jumps only, not like just replacing the dynamics with a bunch of little jumps. I say there's whatever dynamics, baseline, and then there are very large downward jumps that occur infrequently, the intensity of which depends on. Intensity of which depends on the flow of speculation. The more speculation there is, the more you anticipate that sometimes in the future this thing is going to crash with a larger intensity. And because of that, investors demand compensation in the form of a compensator. So this is a levy compensator for that jump that is going to occur. And this now produces the sort of super-exponential increase in stock price. So you have both the So you have both the run-up to the bubble and then the crash. So that's from that two bubbles. Now let's do the back because I said there's a back effect as well. So what is the back effect? It's that when those crashes happen, it should become somehow harder to continue to borrow, to invest in speculation. So that interest rate that the banks are charging, so the banks now Banks are charging, so the banks now have some behavior in the game, that interest rates should rise. So, first, we thought, okay, let's just make it a function of the stock price. That's too crude because the stock price can take too long to crash, then it's not scale-free. So, let's create some other variable that tracks what the stock price is doing. So, it's a market tracker. So, it's kind of a mean reversion process that Reversion process that tries to revert to the market trend. But that now can go up or down. So there are times when the market trend is doing very well, and there are times when it crashes down. So that becomes now the variable that banks utilize to move the interest rate up or down, and that's done by this type of function. So it's like this. So, if the market is doing relatively well, then the interest rate is going to be about down here, and that's close to the RL bar. But if the market crashes, then the interest rate can have some sudden jumps, and we bound it for two reasons. One is because it's the only way that we can prove the existence of solution of the system. The other is that there is some regulatory incentive not to have this kind of predatory land. To have this kind of predatory lending, so we postulate that a central bank is going to say, Hey, you cannot have more than 100% instantaneous interest rate, or something like that. So, those are my two motivations for that. But when you say interest rate, you mean the central bank interest rate? No, and that R bar is okay. No, I mean the actual effective lending. So, it's the effective interest rate that banks are going to be charging to a speculator. So, that's going to be R bar or is it? No, it's R. Okay, because in your Okay, because in your stock market for the index, right, you have a return or more L. Right, so the idea is dependent on the yeah, so the idea is that that one is kind of it's it's the it's the average one down here, right? So the R bar enters in here, it's where the interest rate mean reverts to in the absence of this crash. So if you didn't have crashes, then the R, the effective rate, Then the R, the effection rate, would mean revert to the R bar, which is on average what you would expect the stock market to increase because that's the expected return on your borrow. But there are instantaneous fluctuations, and the instantaneous fluctuations now send the interest rate up, make it more difficult to borrow, and should have an effect on the whole economy, and in particular on the flow of speculation that goes into the financial market. What I'm talking about is risk-free rate plus risk premiums that come volatility and jobs. And right here, that has the risk-free rate plus an average risk premium. And then that average risk premium is not instantaneously incorporated into the stock price. That's just like a long-term valuation of whatever. So R Par L is not the Is not the policy rate. It's already higher than the policy rate, and then things fluctuate around. Okay, so now I'm coming to just show you some pictures about this. So one thing that can happen, so we adjust now the intensity of the jumps and the size of the jumps. So we're talking about a big crash, 20% instantaneous crash. And point one is the thing that is going to be multiplying the F. The F, which is the flow of speculation. So here we're talking about very, very rare jumps. So it's 0.1 times 0.1, there's like one jump every 100 years. And in particular, in this trajectory here, the stock price, you don't see any jumps. So we simulate 100 years, there's no jumps in there. This is the market tracker. And down below that is the interest rate fluctuation around that level of the RL bar. But sometimes there are jobs. So even with the same. Sometimes there are jumps. So, even with the same parameters, you just do another run of the same with a stochastic system. So, here you saw a big jump somewhere 50 years down in the interval. And what it does is that it does provoke a spike in the interest rate, which translates in the real economy to some higher cost of borrowing. It sends the borrowing up, but the levels in which the economy was before the jump happened kind of allow you to converge back. Allow you to converge back to the equilibrium. So that jump didn't send you too far from the basin of attraction of that equilibrium. But you can try to do worse, so now it's a higher intensity, so you see more jumps, and you see more times in which the economy kind of gets out of whack, but it still converges to its long-term end. And all of them have a special state where if you have too many jobs, then you know it's. It does. So, you're going to see in a minute. So, the economic model is not a unique equilibrium model. There is a way to push it so far from the interior equilibrium that it converges to a boundary equilibrium that is a collapse. So, now you keep doing that. So, this is now smaller jumps, but much more frequent. So, in particular, you see here that I never reached the upper bound, the 100%. But again, so you're just seeing like this economy fluctuation up. Economy fluctuating up and down, and eventually collapse or convergent. But now push that further, and you can get so now even more, and now it's becoming a little bit more erratic. And here's an example where it collapses. So it collapses exactly because at some point there's not enough production to pay back for what's being borrowed, and then both borrowing and for speculation and non-speculation goes rampant. And what it does is bring down. And what it does is bring down employment and wage share. So if I see this graph here, but with the other variables, so not showing the employment and wage share, the financial variables are all exposing to infinity. So now the game is how often does that happen? So you can now simulate this for the same parameters many, many times and see the probability that there's not a jump. A jump, I know what the probability is, and it will happen. But the probability that. And they will happen. But the probability is that that jump will occur in a situation that will lead the economy to crash. So that is what I'm going to define as a crisis. So, for example, here you can vary the RL and for each of these points is 2,500, not yet, 2,500 simulations of the model, and we calculate for each value in what proportion of the simulations crash and do not crash. Crash and do not crash. And you can see clearly here that this is kind of a bifurcation parameter. There is a value in which you don't really know what the properties are going to be, but for low enough R, it always converges. For high enough R, it always collapses. And you can do that for many of the variables of the model and we're collecting that kind of behavior to tell a story. But what you can also do, not just with parameters, you can do with initial conditions. I should say this is not the most recent version, so I had to update. Most recent version, so I had to update that to put it in the paper or whatever. But this is like a picture for initial conditions. So, again, this should be E for the employment rate, not lambda. And this just says that for high initial conditions and employment rate and low debt levels, you have very low probability of crashes. Low employment rates, high debt levels, you have very high probability of crashes. So, that's the end of the results. That's the end of the results. So, just a survey of related work with inventories, with monetary policy, and explicit government debt. And I was moving that base range, and then everything else moves with it. Work with debt and whether or not that has any influence on income and wealth inequality. And then, like I said, this is now being picked up by people doing climate models involved in that effort as well. In that effort as well, most recently with kind of monetary policy for preventing climate collapses, what we call green quantitative is. So that's the end. That's just a summary of what I just presented to you. And in the interest of time, I just think. It was 7-1. Don't even ask me if it was a different result. Don't even ask me if there was a different result. I was about to ask, but then I skipped that question. Thanks for the lively conclusion. Now, I'm not a professional economist. I guess one thing they might ask is what can this model explain that other models cannot explain? What can what, sorry? What can your model explain? Oh, their models cannot explain any of that. Their models don't even have financial crisis. So, show me a DSD model that has a financial crisis. DSD model that has a financial crisis. Anyone has one that doesn't, right? So it's a completely different modeling paradigm that in particular includes, for example, the possibility of a collapse, a model with distinct equilibrium. Like even in the recent climate modeling, like the baseline models are models with a unique equilibrium, exponential growth. And no matter what, and we stress that model a lot, like more. That model a lot, like more climate averages and so on and so forth. It always goes back to the exponential growth equilibrium eventually. Like, so you know, you can even have like 10-degree increase in temperature and a lot of averages, just wait long enough, have very low consumption for a while, and it's going to converge back. So, it explains a lot because they are not even looking at that kind of model. It's outside of scope. Yeah, maybe a quick question about the interest rate and the equilibrium setting because I don't know whether the market clearing conditions for such type of problems are usually important in the interest rate. I want that you show it. So it's an endogenous outcome. For instance, in standard representative agent economies, where you have consumption equals to output or dividend, et cetera, or the risk rate is zero net supply. I wonder where is I wonder where is this condition in your setup? It's not that. So, again, it's a kind of an orthogonal modeling methodology that it's the understanding that banks have a lot more flexibility in these models than market clearing models that set interest rates, like loanable funds and so on. That's not how banks operate. Banks operate in a much more flexible environment of endogenous money. This now has 80 years of tradition. 80 years of a tradition of kind of critique of exactly the type of equilibrium loanable funds view of how banks operate, which is empirically at odds with what happens in practice. So here it's a much more kind of a phenomenological determination. So you look at the behavior of the interest rate and what the banks are doing, how they set up rates in terms of recinux or borrowers and so on and so forth, but don't try to cost. And so on and so forth, but don't try to close the system as an equilibrium or equipment situation. So I know it's uncomfortable for traditionally trained economists, but hey, I get uncomfortable and everyday stuff too. So it's neutral. Yeah, thanks for this very live presentation. So I have rather a technical question or comment. I mean, your jump process tends to revert to the To like invert the initials quickly. So maybe it makes you make sense to short noise processes so that you develop. So if I understand correctly, the economy tends to develop to the initial level quickly and this was disturbing you, so you profit by increasing the intensity of jobs? Oh, I was not disturbed by that. I think that you know the the economists do and markets do tend to revert to some uh uh To some returns quite quickly, even in the presence of big financial crashes, right? The daily return, like you could have take longer to achieve some level than you were before, but the daily return on the stock markets, even the day after the 29 crisis, the day after the October crisis, and so on, that does revert quite quickly too. So I'm not too bothered by that. Okay. Okay. Then let's make the question.
