Listening to all the work that has been done on this amazing system. And today I'd like to tell you some of our work on twisted balayography in magnetic field, and in particular what happens with interactions. I'm going to start with a warm-up and that is an analysis of an experiment on twisted bileographene which happened to be at one point three eight degrees. 1.38 degrees, which is away from the magic angle, as all of you know. But I hope you to convince you, I hope to convince you that it's actually interesting. This work was done in collaboration with Xiao Yuang, who is at the Magnet Lab, a visiting scientist there now, visiting faculty scientist, Jiam Kang, who is a faculty at Trump High Tech, and David Golhaber-Gordon's group at Stanford. And for those of you who are interested, And for those of you who are interested in these results, it's been recently published in this proceedings paper. And then I'll talk about the main part, which is the theory of correlated turn insulators in finite magnetic field. This was done with Xiaoyu, and it appeared on the archive yesterday. So, for those of you who are interested, you can find it there. More details on the care. Okay, so let's get started. Okay, so let's get started. Here is an experiment from David Gohaber-Gordon's group on twisted balliat graphene, which they determined to be at 1.38 degrees away from the magic angle. The panel A shows the actual device. This is a long whole part device with many contacts along the side. And the trace over here shows that as you sweep the density from As you sweep the density from completely empty to completely full, no longer so narrow band, first of all, the bands are still isolated from the remote bands. You see the resistance shoots up here. So this is a band insulator here. It's a band insulator over here. Near the charge neutrality point, even at fairly small magnetic field, they see quantum oscillations. But then there's a broad window of density near. Near, let's say, minus three here, or maybe minus two and a half, and around two electrons per unit cell, where they see extremely strong magnetoresistance. And this is an unsaturating magneto resistance. So just to give you an idea, it goes from 100 ohms to 10,000 ohms by applying two Tesla magnetic cube. And that happens over a range of densities. It doesn't have Range of densities, it doesn't happen at just a single density. The plot C here shows this magnetoresistance as a function of the magnetic field on log-log plot. And you see that it's a straight line with a slope that is actually 2. The dashed line here corresponds to slope 2. So the magnetic resistance grows as d squared. And instead of saturating at higher fields, you start seeing. At higher fields, you start seeing chromosomes. And so, one of the questions, there are many other interesting results in this paper at higher magnetic fields, but one of the questions that they pose in this question is what causes this striking magneto resistance? So, you know, at this angle, you're not seeing any correlated insulators as you would at the magic angle. But, nevertheless, this is still kind of a remarkable phenomenon, which Ben. Which begs for explanation. And so let me remind you what happens to twisted bilayer graphene, and we're going to use at the beginning the minimal continuum model, the BM model, in the presence of the heterostrain. So heterostrain, as was discussed earlier in this workshop, means that the top layer is strained by a different amount relative to the bottom layer. This is not something that. Layer. This is not something necessarily intentional that the experimentalists put into their devices. This just happens during the sample preparation quite often. So imagine that we now modify the BM model by including this type of a heterostrain. So what happens? So in the unstrained case, these are the contours of constant energy for the conduction band, so the band above the Dirac points. The stars mark the Dirac points. The direct points. This marks the maximum in the spectrum. And then there are three Van Hoff singularities in here. For those of you who are aware of this, this can be also understood via Moore's theorem as critical points of a surface where I can think of the minima and the maxima, let's say, as vortices, and then the saddle point as anti-vortices. And in this case, because it's on And in this case, because it's on torus, I have to have the same number of vortices and IP vortices. So that's why the number of Van Hoff singularities is the same as the number of maxima together with minima. So three maxima and minima and three Van Hoff singularities. Okay, and in the unstrained case, there's a three-fold rotational symmetry which pins the location of the Van Hoff singularities and pins them at the same energy. The same thing happens to the direct points, as you all know. Direct points, as you all know, they're pinned at the same energy. But if you apply the heterostrain, which in this talk we're going to mark by epsilon, and it's a very small amount, it's only 0.2% of the heterostrain, there's actually a magnification that happens on the Morais scale. The change in the Mora unit cell unit vectors is actually not 0.2%, it's 8%. So that So that's actually a rather strong deformation of the band structure. And what happens is that the Dirac points no longer sit at the same energy, they get displaced in energy, and they're no longer sitting at the high symmetry points, they get displaced from the high symmetry points. Because the C2T symmetry is not broken, the valence band is still connected to the conduction band via these two Dirac points for each spin and valley. And then the And then the Van Hoff singularities are also dependent from the isoenergetic position. It's an extra displacement due to the gauge field, so that it acts around. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, this is included. It's included, Baco. The vector potential is included. Pseudo-vector potential is included. So there is a displacement of the direct point in a momentum space. I said that. The Van Hoff singularities are no longer at the threefold symmetric points and they're also no longer isoenergetic. And they're also no longer isoenergetic. So you're going to have Van Hoff singularity, which is the closest to the maximum, the one in the middle, and then the one which separates the close contours in the vicinity of the two direct points. In this particular case, there's the green one. And you can track them, for example, here as a function of the energy and as you change the orientation of this strain holding the magnitude fixed. So this top Lanhoff simulation. So, this top Lanhoff singularity will have this trajectory, the bottom one will have this one, they will interchange in energy, and then the Vennholes II will move like this. Now, what's interesting is that what used to be, so now imagine filling this up, for any filling, these would all be closed Fermi surfaces in the absence of the strain, but in the presence of the strain, between the highest energy The highest energy Van Hoff singularity and the middle energy Van Hoff singularity, the surfaces are actually open. So that's what we mark here by these open Fermi surface window. And then it turns out that if you just do Boltzmann theory on magneto transport on this type of band structure with open Fermi surfaces, you naturally get B squared magneto resistance, which does not saturate. Does not saturate. And so the theory with strain and the BM model with the relaxation time approximation at a finite magnetic field without making the assumption that the magnetic field is small, shows the longitudinal resistivity along the two principal axis here. So one of the principal axes is marked by the solid curve. Resistivity along one of the principal axes is marked by the solid curve. Resistivity along the other principal axis is marked by the diaspora. Other principal axis is marked by the dashed curve, and it's along one of the principal axis that the resistivity does not saturate and grows like V squared. Along the other one, it saturates. This is the actual experiment. And then if you were to look at the Hall number, which was mentioned to measure the carrier concentration, it's a little bit more complicated than that if you have open Fermi surfaces. Fermi surfaces, this Boltzmann theory can give you access to the whole number. The theory looks like this, and the experiment looks like this. So, even though the three Van Hoof singularities have been split, the sign change of the whole number happens only at a single filling, and it happens at a window of densities, which is between the two Van Hoff singularities in the open Fermi surface window, which they also see in the experiment. So So now, why would the experimentalists see non-saturating B-squared magnetic resistance? Well, if the principal axis in their experiment are misaligned with the current flow, then just simply projecting the electrical field and electrical current density along the current flow, so along the principal axis, this would look like. Along the principal axis, this would look like the resistivity tensor would look like this, with the off-diagonal part being the whole part. But if you project it onto the current flow, you'll get an admixture of the resistivity along both principal axis, depending on the angle miswidened. And so if one of these saturates with magnetic field, but the other one grows as B squared, the one that grows is going to dominate, and so generically you expect to see B squared magnetic resistance. Expect to see B squared magnetic system. So we think that this is what's happening in this experiment. Now, one of the things that this simple theory predicts is, of course, that there should be a third Van Hoff singularity. That the experimentalists are observing the two, where the experimentalists see the non-saturating B squared magnetic resistance. That's the energy or density window where we have open Fermi surfaces, but there should be a third Leimhov singularity by the argument I gave you. And that one sets. And that one separates two closed Fermi surfaces from one closed Fermi surface. So, one way to look for it is to go back to the quantum oscillation data and then reanalyze it in light of this insight. And the way this is usually done is that you plot the resistance at a fixed density as a function of one over the magnetic field, and then you Fourier transform. And the frequencies that you get from that Fourier transform are. That you get from that Fourier transform are related to the areas of the Fermi surfaces. This is something that we teach in solid state one in graduate course. So, this is exactly what they did. They changed density, and here are the frequencies that they observe. And indeed, you see that near the Dirac point, there are two small frequencies plus their sum. And then they terminate. And at this termination, which is what we associate with the third Van Hoff singularity close. Third Van Hoff singularity closest to the Dirac point, you only see the sum of these two frequencies. In other words, you only see the bigger pocket. The two pockets have disappeared. And so that prediction has been borne out by this experiment. Now, the other thing that this theory predicts, which was not tested by the experiment because of the geometry that they were set up in, which I think is kind of interesting, is that, remember, in this theory, Remember, in this theory, this is an interacting problem with the relaxation time approximation, so the bands are rigid. But because we break the C3 symmetry due to strain, there's nothing that pins the principal axis. So in principle, the principal axis can rotate as a function of filling. And this is indeed what we find in the Boltzmann calculation, that in the window of open Fermi surfaces, the principal axis points along one direction, but as we go towards One direction, but as we go towards the Dirac point, because of the rotation of the Fermi surfaces, the transport principal axis should actually rotate. And this is not a small amount, this is 90-degree rotation. So this prediction has not been checked yet, experimentally. But there are ongoing efforts to do this in a very clever sunflower junk. Now, the other thing that's interesting about this experiment, in my opinion, Experiment, in my opinion, is that if we go to higher magnetic fields and now we color plot the longitudinal resistance as a function of the density and as a function of the magnetic field, we see the Landau fan emanating out of the charge neutrality point. There are Landau fans emanating out of the band maxima and band minima. There are particle hole asymmetric, and I'll come back to this in the theory that I showed you because it's based on the Because it's based on the minimal continuum model, it would be particle-holesymmetric. Someone has to go beyond this. But what's interesting is that the lambda-level sequence that they observe near the charge neutrality point starts with the main filling factor 4. The next one is 8. And the next one is 12. And then similarly on the whole side is minus 4, minus 8, and minus 12. That's not what you would get in the unstrained case, as I will show you. Case, as I will show you. Okay, so I showed this at Flatiron meeting earlier this year. Jiang Kang and I have collaborated on developing a theory beyond the minimal continuum model, starting with an ab initio DFT, and derive an effective Hamiltonian for graphene bilayers by systematically expanding in real space gradients of the slow fermion fields and the atomic displacement. Slow fermion fields and the atomic displacements. This can be done for arbitrary inhomogeneous smooth lattice deformation, including a twist. And this gradient expansion you can carry it out in the so-called Eulerian coordinates, which was introduced by Leon Ballance in this paper. And we go to second order. So just for comparison, I think the displacements were shown yesterday. I think Professor Kushino showed them for the them for the twisted bilayer. If we now plug in this configuration into the ab initio-derived continuum model and compare it to the brute force tight binding model with 10,000 or 11,000 atoms, if you go to second order in gradient expansion at the magic angle, you get a match. You would not get that match if you stopped at first order gradient expansion. So anyway, so this theory can be extended to finite magnetic field and finite strain. Field and finite strain. And so in here, we consider this twist angle of 1.38. We adjust the magnitude of the strain, and this phi here is the rotation of the strain, and plot, as before, what happens to the region with open Fermi surfaces and what happens to the direct points. And you see they undergo these trajectories. The dashed lines here are the experimental data from the Stanford group. So you see that roughly at around this phi of point. At around this φ of 0.6, 0.7, you can actually get a pretty good match to the location of the critical points in these surfaces. So, this would be open Fermi surface, this is the third van Hoff, here are the Dirac points, this is the next, on the whole side, third Van Hoff, and then the open Fermi surfaces. Now, by the way, notice that this automatically captures particle hole asymmetry. If we apply magnetic field on this, which we know how to do now, on this beyond the minimal continuum model, we get the Hofstad. Continuum model, we get the Hochster butterfly. So the y-axis is the energy, the x-axis is the flux through the Moray unit cell. This is converted to Tesla up here for these values. What you see is that out of the charge neutrality point, there are two lambda levels. This is per value per spin, and this picture does not include Zeeman for clarity. And these two lambda levels are basically zero lambda levels of the energy displaced direct. Of the energy displaced direct points. So they are already split. And then you see the lambda levels coming out of the top of the band and the lambda levels coming out of the bottom of the band. But because it's asymmetric, the gaps are bigger on the small mass side, on the larger mass side. Okay, and then from this type of plot, you can compute the so-called Vanier plot. In other words, you trace these gaps. Or basically, you plot the density of states, so in the gaps, the density of states would be low, and these gaps have to remain in these gaps as you change the magnetic field, you have to change the particle number. So that's shown here in the absence of the strain, all the way to full flux for this full model. And if you look carefully at the vicinity of the charge neutrality point, you see that the lambda level sequence is. You see that the lambda level sequence is 4 and 12 with the 8 missing. Although, experimentally, the 8 was there. And similarly, on the whole side, you only see minus 4, okay, this should be minus 12, with the minus 8 missing. And the reason why this happens is because the direct points are isoenergetic, and then if you make small on-sagar orbits near them, you're going to pick up extra double degeneracy. However, in the strain case, the draft points are displaced in energy, they're also displaced in momentum, and then if you compute. Momentum, and then if you compute the Vanier plot, Vanier diagram for this, first of all, you see this region with open Fermi surfaces, open Fermi surfaces, where the Landau feds sort of terminate. Eventually, you start seeing quantum oscillations, just like in the experiment. And now the Landau level sequence indeed includes height, and that's due to the displacements of the diaphragm. Okay, so that concludes the warm-up part of this. Part of this talk, and now I want to talk about a new work that was just posted. But maybe I can pause and see if there are any questions about this. Okay, so now we'd like to extend this and include electron-electron interactions. Everything I told you so far was without the electron-electron interactions, which should still be included because I think they still place number all at 1.38. They just do not cause correlated insulators at zero field. Correlated insulators and zero field. But as you saw, you can understand a lot of qualitative features of these experiments simply by studying the non-interacting model beyond the minimal continuum limit at 1.38. Okay, so now on to the new part. So just to remind you about the formula that we saw several times during this meeting, the famous Strato formula, in order for us to remain in a gap. In order for us to remain in a gap of a churn insulator with the churn number T, the Moray unit cell filling, which in our case spans minus 4 to 4, should satisfy this formula where the numerator here is the magnetic flux through the Moray unit cell, the denominator is the flux quantum HC over E, and for example, the Landale. The Landau fans you saw from the charge neutrality point would have S equal to zero. This is the limit of zero field intercept. But of course, if you have interactions, the S could be non-zero, it could be fractional. And then T itself, if you have slater determinant type states, would have integer T, for example, and for fractional turning slators, as we heard yesterday, the T would be fractional. Okay, so we're going to study. So, we're going to study, we're going to look at some of the experiments on twisted bilayer graphene and I'd like you to remember this way of thinking about it. So, S and T correspond to the intercept at zero field and then the churn number. So, for example, this is the data from Ali Azdani's group on STM, where they studied the gaps as a function of the filling factor. Here they call it new, and the flux through the unit cell. You see the Landau fan. The unit cell. You see the Landau phan emanating out of the charge neutrality point. So this would correspond to s equal to zero, all of these, and then t equal to zero, one, two, three, four. And then they see prominent states which have s equal to let's see, this is s equal to three with t equal to one, s equal, sorry, s equal to one with t equal to three, this is s equal to two, t equal to two, and then. equal to 2, t equal to 2, and then s equal to 3 and t equal to 1. And they see almost particle holes symmetric image, but not quite on the whole side. Now this is not the first time that this type of Landau fan has been seen in twisted bilayer graphic near metric angle. This is the data from Andrea Young's group. It sees essentially the same thing in transport. This is the data from Pablo Jarilo Herrero's group. This is the plot of the chemical potential as measured in the Plot of the chemical potential as measured in decompressibility. Essentially, the same story. This is the data from Ben Feldman's group at Stanford from the local scanning tunneling, from the local single-electron transistor. So measuring inverse compressibility, again, you see the Landau fan emanating out of the charge neutrality point, and then you see these turn states coming in from higher fields. Again, it's particle hole asymmetric, but the slopes are the same as they are here, and so are the intercepts. As they are here, and so are the intercepts. Of course, there are many other states which are seen there. For most of this talk, essentially, for the rest of this talk, I will focus only on the main sequence. Similar results were seen from the Caltech group, from the Caltech group of Stevan and Nachoperge, and also from Dmitri Aveto's group. So, this is one of the things that reproduces experimentally in these systems. So, so far, there's no theory for this. So, I'm going to start by showing you a self-consistent Hartree-Fock study on twisted barrier graphene using the continuum model, so this is a McDonald's model, in the presence of heterostrain. The amount of the heterostrain is of the order that you saw in the previous experiment. And the angle phi here was fixed to zero. And this will be done as a function of the magnetic field, as a function of density. This is magnetic field, this is density. Magnetic field, this is density, and as a function of the angle. So the plot on the left is at the high angle, and what is being plotted are the major gaps. So the gap along, for example, along this line corresponds to the radius of this circle. And 10 MEV gap for these parameters would have a circle with this radius. So you see at 1.38 degrees in the presence of hetero strains. In the presence of heterosex, we indeed see already the. Oh, I should also say that because this is all in the BM model, it's particle holes symmetric, so I'm not showing the electron side of this. I'm going to focus on the whole side, but you can just imagine a mirror image of this on the electron side. Okay. So from the charge neutrality point, we indeed see the, so all of these are s equal to 0 and t equal to 0, minus 1, minus 2, minus 3, and minus 4. 2 minus 3 and minus 4. These we understand as quantum Hole Fermi's. We have access to the wave functions, so we can check that. We don't see much happening in the middle at low fields, but at higher fields, you can start seeing the development of s equal to minus 3 and t equal to minus 1, s equal to minus 2, t equal to minus 2, and s equal to minus 1, t equal to 3 states. And they get more and more prominent. And they get more and more prominent and dip deeper and deeper into the low field regime as you lower the angle. All of these are straight calculations. At the high angle, you also see the Landau fan pointing towards the charge neutrality point from the band maximum, just as you saw in the Stanford experiment. But that gets weaker and weaker as you go towards the magic angle. And this is also seen in the experiments. The undel fans are mainly seen. The undel fans are mainly seen pointing away. So, the question is: there are many interesting things in these plots, they're extremely rich. I probably will not get to it, but for example, in the strain case here, we see states which have fractional S. Technical question. So, when you go to the little field thing, do you make a certain cell larger and larger? Yes. So, so, okay, this is a very good question. So, we are using Landau gauge, and we use the unit cell. And we use the unit cell. So, all of these fluxes, as you probably could have guessed, are rational. So, they're P over Q fluxes. And so, they are Q unit cells along one direction and one unit cell along the other direction. All the calculations are done for that. This will actually become important for a point I want to make a little bit later. And the size of the Q is? So, the lowest Q we, sorry, the largest Q that we go to, the lowest magnetic field we go to is 1 over 12. And the highest in this state. And the highest in this study is one half. So we scan P over Q in that window with, so Q is 1 over 12 and P is less than 12. Q is 12. Q is 12 and P is less than 12. But I think that's enough. You can already start seeing the patterns in this picture. Okay, so there are these interesting churn states with the fractional S that are developing over here. That are developing over here. I will not talk about them in this talk. I just want to focus on the main sequence, the sequence which is marked by these red lines over here: 0, minus 4, minus 1, minus 3, minus 2, minus 2, minus 3, minus 1. And the reason why I want to focus on that is because this sequence has been argued by some to be the evidence of essentially liberating the zero field churn bands, magnetic field liberation of these churn states. Field liberation of these churn states. As you know very well, for example, if you go to the chiral limit, you can decompose the two bands into churn plus and churn minus. Away from the chiral limit, you can also do that, but you have to sort of ignore the kinetic energy. And perhaps the interactions would like to indeed polarize into one of the turn bands, although there are other competing states. And the argument has been that the magnetic field actually helps these turn states. And so since we have this calculation, we can look into what they are. We can look into what they are. Now, you can already probably guess that they are not the strong coupling churn states from this picture because they're occurring already at a high angle. So, what are they? So, to study them, again, in the presence of the heterostrain, we start with the high angle, 1.38, where you saw that they just come in at high fields. So, the picture on the left is the Hofter spectrum of the BM model with strain in the normal. The BM model with strain in the non-interacting case. You see the two isolated lambda levels coming from the split Dirac cones. These two lambda levels carry churn number one each. The total has churn number zero. So the band composite, the magnetic sub-band composite shown by red, has to carry churn number minus one. And since this is particle holesymmetric, the gray composite carries churn number minus one as well. So this composite is churn minus one. This composite is turned minus one, this is one, one minus one. Okay, so this is the non-interacting case, and this is what we find as a function of the field from the Hartree-Fock. At high fields, you see a gap, and that gap collapses at some critical field, and you go into essentially a compressible state. The state that we find here has pretty high overlap to a state in which you just simply populate this. Just simply populate this minus one churn band composite. It's not exactly that, as I will discuss in just a second, but to zero-of-order approximation, that's what it is. Now, if we study the density matrix of these states in the non-interacting Hofter basis, we find that it looks like this. It's mainly diagonal, basically populating mainly the red bands, although Mainly the red bands, although there is some spillover and admixture into the nominally unoccupied upper Hofter subbands. And then the states after the collapse of the gap, the compressible states, oh by the way, I should also say that this just favors a population of one valley and one spin, the spin that aligns, the magnetic moment of the spin, which aligns with the magnetic field. That's a spontaneous symmetry break, as far as the valley is concerned. And then beyond the collapse, the compressible states, they basically have almost equal population of the lower part with some magnetic systems. Okay, so if we were to now plot and focus only on this main sequence in the density versus magnetic field plot, we indeed see that. We indeed see that the minus 3, s equal to minus 3, t equal to minus 1 line shows gaps, and then there is a transition into essentially compressible states over here. And that's a first order phase transition. Similarly, at minus 2, minus 2, and I will show you the density matrices for the minus 2, minus 2 states, they're basically two copies of this. You populate the same spin in the two valleys. And this one is the minus, s equal to minus one. Minus, s equal to minus one, t equal to minus three, you populate three copies of this, and this is the charge neutrality point. Okay, so that one persists to the lowest fields that we can access. So as promised, here are the density matrices for the other S and T values. They are basically the copies. Now, one way to analyze these states, or another way to analyze these states, is to check how well are the is to check how well are the sublatis polarized. Okay, so as you well know, if you go to a particular valley, in a chiral limit, a churn state would be perfectly valley, it would be perfectly sublatis polarized. Now we are not in a chiral limit, so the best case scenario is this dashed line over here. That's the maximum sublatis polarization you could get if there was a strong admixture of the unpopulated bands. Now, if you simply populated Now, if you simply populated the non-interacting PM bands at finite field, the sublatives polarization would follow this trace. And the actual result is here. And that's because there is some admixture of the unpopulated bands, even at this high angle. So the Servatis polarization is not quite at a strong coupling limit, but it's not quite simply the so-called Hofter-Sap-Ben ferromagnet, where you only populate. Magnet where you only populate the lower non-interacting subbets. Okay. So, subman, you mean layer or? I mean this. I mean, so imagine you didn't say sub-lattice. I thought you said sub-lattice. I did. So, what does sub-lattice refer to? The A-B sub-lattice. There are two layers, right? Two layers, right? That's right. So without regard of the layer, you just sum up the two layers. I wonder what the 0, 4 mean. So 4 means that P for the 4, which means trend number is 4. Yeah, that's right. That's this one. And 0 means the intercept, the 0 magnet flux is 0. Exactly, that's the charge intralegative points to the. But then also it shows that n, that corresponds to n equal to 0, which means charging traffic. Which means card infinity. Yeah, exactly. Infinity is the turn number before. Yeah, it's finite field. Remember the Landau fan seen from all the experiments? They see Landau Fan emanating out of the charge neutrality point? There is a churn number 4 and minus 4 state there. That's that state. So, in these non-charge neutrality ones and the strong coupling theory, they're formed by. And the strong coupling theory, they're formed by, as you know, like flavor polarization. Like, you fill one transector completely, and then you just choose on the other transceptor. So, here you're contrasting with those. Are these also breaking a flavor rotation symmetry? I will get to that. Okay. Okay, so this is at 1.38 degrees with strain. And this is one way you can tell whether you're going towards the strong coupling case or not. By the way, there's no physical. By the way, there's no phase transition between them. So, one way one can actually understand this is to remember that in the presence of the hetero strain, the charge neutrality point with interactions is not gap. The interactions renormalize the Dirac points. They can move them around from their non-interacting location in the Berryland zone, but they won't remove them. At least that's what's fine in many Hartree-Fog calculations in the presence of Hadro. Calculations in the presence of Hetero strain. And so now imagine that you Landau quantize this interaction renormalized spectrum, you will get some magnetic subbands from that. And so therefore, if we express all of these non-zero S in terms of the density matrix of the states at 0 minus 4, which emanate out of this at 0 field, we find that they are basically diagonal with no spillover. With no spillover. So, the way we understand, therefore, these states is that we're basically populating the lower Hoftender subband of the interaction renormalized charge neutrality point. And then we select valley and spin. Okay, so if we were to lower the twist angle, this is now the non-interacting bench structure, this is the interacting bench structure. We don't see the collapse of the gap, but we see the onset of the interval coherence. Onset of interval coherence. So the blue here corresponds to density matrices which show interval coherence. Now, in this higher field, and of course the transition happens now at a different magnetic field. At higher magnetic fields, the density matrices are still predominantly populating these states, but the spillover to these is stronger. That's because the narrow band. That's because the narrow band the band is more narrow and the interaction is able to excite into these unpopulated states better. And then the corresponding Hofter Vanier plot would look like this, where the blue corresponds to the onset of the interval coherent order. And in this particular, for this particular set of parameters, we find that that happens at a higher field at minus 3, minus 1, than at minus 2, minus 2. And again, the charging trial decor. And again, the charge neutrality point just persists, as it should, because even at the magic angle with strain, the charge neutrality point is a gautless semimetal. Okay, so at this lower magnetic field, if we were to plot the sublattice polarization, we see that at the high angle, they are basically just these compressible states at low field. But then there's a transition into the Into these correlated Hofstadter fair magnets. Okay, and again, the density matrices at the high field are essentially diagonal when expressed in the basis of 0 and S4. Okay, so what happens in the absence of the heterostrain? We can do the similar calculation in that case. At large angles, it's very similar to what happened in the presence of the strain. In the presence of the strain, there are differences as you approach the magic angle. Since I see that the chairman is already standing up, let me just quickly go through the part to address the question that was asked. So if we now remove the strain and that we study the sublattice polarization as a function of the angle for a fixed field, this is fairly low field, we find that at high angle these states are basically compressible at these low At these low fields. But then, as we lower the angle towards the magic, you see they develop into these correlated Hofstadter ferromagnets, and the sublattice polarization starts approaching the strong coupling limit. And now, however, at very low field, it should become It should become just Landau levels of the zero field insulators. So, for example, if your zero field state is an IDC, at finite field it's going to have some lambda levels, and at low density, that's just what you need to populate. Above a critical density, that can change. And we see that the field at which this happens depends sensitively on the ratio W0 to W1. So the collapses that we see over here of this sublattice polarization is actually Polarization is actually due to the interval coherence that kicks in. Okay, so again, to contrast it, so without the strain case at low angle, you can indeed stabilize the zero-field turn insulators or really their finite field generalization. But in a strain case, we are sort of in this intermediate window. All right, so let me just stop here, flash the summary of this talk, and thank you for your attention. Do you have a question why do we need to be set up here for the next talk? Just kind of a basic question. So, I mean, so you have this heterose trend, and is that expected to be consistent across samples? Very good question. It's ideally something you would image, something you would measure.
