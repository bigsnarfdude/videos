Yeah, let me start by thanking the organizers for putting this together and for giving me the chance to talk. I will talk about joint work with three people. Actually, all I talk about is material from the PhD thesis of Laura Kanzler, who has defended recently. Who has defended recently? But the idea for this work goes back to some earlier ideas together with two other former PhD students, Sabina Hitman and Angelika Manhattan. And the part of this work is with all three of them. And then there is a part just with Laura. This, what I talk about is motivated by biology. So myxobacteria is a certain type of bacteria and Type of bacteria. And what I will talk about is models for colonies of these mixobacteria and for their behavior. The terms in the title, reversal alignment and so on, I will explain in a minute. And I put extra brown enforcing in the title because this is a meeting of diffusion. So that will play. That will play a role. So let me. I have a problem. Okay. So let me talk a little bit about motivation of this. Myxobacteria, when you look them under the microphone, you see that they are rod-shaped. If they are longer, they can be bent a little, but that we will ignore. So for us, they will be little rods. They will be little rods. The experiments, all the experiments which we are interested in, have been done on flat substrates. So, this is why we will do two-dimensional models. Another thing to say is that these bacteria communicate with each other. However, the signals they exchange are only local. So, at least that is what is known, that there is an exchange of signal of Is an exchange of signals, but only when they're really close together, when they meet. And what happens when they meet? There are two types of results of interactions. As you can see already in this picture, there are groups of more or less parallel bacteria, so they tend to align. But the other thing which you only see in a movie is that they also might reverse direction. So if bacteria meet others coming Others coming in the opposite direction, basically, then they tend to reverse their direction, which is actually, from a biological point of view, very interesting by itself, because they have a funny movement machinery, which is not really well understood. They have a really a reverse gear. So when they reverse that direction, it's not that they kind of turn around, but they just move backwards, like if reverse gear in a car, and it's not well. In a car, and it's not well understood how they do that actually. But in our modeling, where we want to talk about many of them and do a very simple model of one of them, we will not need any of these details. And why are we doing this? Because when you look at the macroscopic picture, if you look at colonies of these bacteria from a distance where you don't see the individual bacteria, you see structures. You see structure, you see emergent phenomena. One of the phenomena, the best known one, is so-called ripples, which are counter-propagating density waves, which you can see in this picture here. So with the information we have from the experiments, we try to come up with a kinetic model. The assumptions of the kinetic model are that we look at the 2D picture, we don't look at the situation as you saw. The situation as you saw in the picture before, but at the verified situation where we can expect that typically only two of them interact. So we will talk about in the terms of terminology of kinetic theory, we will talk about binary collisions. And between collisions, we will assume that the bacteria move with a fixed speed. So there is one fixed movement speed of this bacteria. And interact. And interactions, yeah, model this binary collisions. And we will not always, but sometimes have a diffusive term in choosing the direction. So the result of these assumptions is a two plus one dimensional kinetic model, 2D for the position, and 1d because of the fixed speed, just 1d in velocity, so it's only the direction is important. Direction is important. So we talk about an angle in the 1D torus. And for simplicity of analysis, we put the position in a 2D flat torus. So periodic boundary conditions. The equation which we then get is you can expect. So we have the typical kinetic left-hand side with the velocity which Velocity, which where we have already scaled the speed to one. So we have a vector of length one here for the velocity with depending on the direction. And on the right-hand side, we have diffusion as announced with a non-negative diffusivity. So we allow the situation, we will also be interested in the situation without diffusion. And then these two types of collision operators, as I said, binary collision. As I said, binary collisions. So you look at these operators, it looks from the distance, it looks a little bit like Boltzmann. But there is these two types of collisions. We assume the following, when the bacteria meet and they are already going more or less in the same direction, where with more or less we assume that the angle between them is acute, then they align. So maybe you can see this from this. Maybe you can see this from this formula here. So the pre-collisional directions phi tilde and phi star leads to the post-collisional direction phi. And phi is just the arithmetic mean. So it's the simple alignment. These are the alignment collisions. But if they meet more or less head-on, that means under an obtuse angle, then they reverse their direction. And here you have this reversed direction theory. This reversed direction, phi reversed is just the opposite direction. And so these are these two collision operators. And there is a collision cross-section, little b, depending on the incoming and the pre-collisional directions. And it is dependent on the shape of the bacteria. So for the rod-shaped case, which we are mostly interested in, what you get is this B is. What you get is this B is the sine of the difference of the directions, the modulus of that. Since the model is complicated and the analysis is complicated, we have looked for simplifications. And one simplification is to use what we call Maxwellian mix also, so where this collision cross-section is equal to one, which actually has also an interpretation in terms of the geometry of the bacteria. In terms of the geometry of the bacteria, this you get for circular bacteria, which is of course unrealistic, but at least you can have a picture in mind. So if these bacteria are little circles, then this collision cross-section is just constant. Again, this one here and the one in front of the sign just shows that we have scaled already everything and we are in a dimensionless situation. Models similar to these have been looked at by different people. A while ago, groups of physicists basically have, with the same motivation of mixobacteria, have written down genetic models, typically without a complete detail of the model. And they have some, yeah, there are some kind of formal Some kind of formal analysis of these models. And then a bit later, mathematicians have become interested in similar models. Actually, all of these are models of alignment. So kinetic models, particles undergoing alignment. So the difference to our model is here that we also have these reversal collisions in the In the model. What I will give you is, I will give you an overview of some of the results which we have obtained. You will see that the situation is a bit rather incomplete. So our results are in a way only partial. So this problem is far from being completely complete. Being completely solved. So, let me start with the spatially homogeneous model. Actually, concerning existence, it's easy because our choices of collision cross-section are bounded, and that makes it easy to make an existence analysis, existence theory in L1. So, we have global solutions, continuous in time, and L1 in the angle. In the angle for the spatially homogeneous problem. The next question for the spatially homogeneous problem is then, of course, equilibria. And here I've written for you the set, the complete set of equilibria. Actually, it's a three-dimensional set where equilibria consists have the form of the sum of two deltas with opposite directions. So it's two opposite. Directions. So it's two opposite groups. And each of these groups can have a different mass. So that means we have three parameters: the two masses of the two groups and the nematic direction, basically. So that's the set of equilibria. You see, it's delta distributions, which maybe makes the existence theory a little bit unsatisfactory because it's in L1. One would hope for an existence theory. One would hope for an existence theory in the space of measures. This is not really possible. It's not in terms of measures, the problem is not really well posed. And the reason is simple. It is because of our assumption that we have this jump from reversal to alignment collisions at the right angles. And that creates a non-smooth behavior, non-smooth. Non-smooth behavior, non-smooth dependence. So, what we didn't look at, what could be done possibly was to smoothen this change from reversal to alignment collisions. And then one could maybe get measure solutions also. However, what we still can do is we can look at L1 solutions and ask the questions: do they converge in any sense to this measure equilibria? Unfortunately, there is a problem, and the problem. There is a problem, and the problem is we have a three-dimensional set of equilibria, but we only have two conservation laws. One is conservation of mass, total mass is conserved. That is obvious. The second one is a bit less obvious. There is a kind of conservation of a mean direction in a way, whatever mean direction on the torus means exactly, but that is what we have. But this is only these two conservation laws. And so it is in general impossible, or at least. Is in general impossible, or at least we don't know how to completely determine this equilibrium solution from the initial data. We can do something for special initial conditions, and these special initial conditions are where the support of the initial conditions is just in two opposite cones of opening angle p over two. Because what do you have in that situation? That within these cones, you only have alignment collisions and Have alignment collisions, and between the two cones, you only have reversal collisions, and that keeps these two cones invariant. And the consequence of that is that we have a third conservation law, which is the masses of the two cones separately are conserved. In this case, the equilibrium can be determined completely from the initial data. And in the case, at least of Maxwell. Maxwellian mixos, we have a convergence result in terms of the waste and two metric. Maybe I should say something here, what I didn't say before. This problem is, as you already see from the equilibria, it has some relation to the dissipative Boltzmann equation. And one of the properties it shares is that there is no entropy. So the question is how to get some stability of solutions, and one is in terms of variant. One is in terms of variance, and variance is, of course, related to this Wasser-Stein-2 distance. So, for the Maxwellian mixos, we can prove exponential convergence to equilibrium in terms of the Wasserstein-2 distance. For the rod-shaped bacteria, the situation is more complicated. We don't have a result for initial data in both of these cones. We only have a very partial result. If we have initial data support. Data supported just in one of these cones, then we only have alignment collisions. And then we have a convergence result in terms of the Vasserstang 2. The convergence is not exponential, it's like 1 over t squared. And for the experts, this is no surprise because the collision cross-section here degenerates when all the directions go to one. You see it in phi minus phi star. Than phi minus phi star, because all the periods will go to zero. So there is a degeneration. And that situation is well known from the dissipative Boltzmann equation. And the result, like we have here, is called half's law there. And so we can prove a half law also in our situation. Actually, what I didn't write here is that there is also a lower bound by a term like this. So that means we can prove that the convergence is actually not faster than this one over t squared. Faster than this one over t squared. Okay, so that is the situation for the homogeneous, for the homogeneous equation. Here, I have a short, I don't want to spend much time with these. These are simulations for this problem. In the first line, I have two simulations which correspond to these special initial data. Here you have equally distributed density in both of these sectors initially. Initially, and what you get is just concentration in both of these sectors. So that is no surprise. Here's a little bit more interesting. We start with two concentrated peaks, but they are too close together. They are not opposite of each other. So what you get is first only reversal collisions, which produce the outer peaks. And then as soon as you have those, you get aligned collisions filling in between. And in the end, it looks like the picture here. It looks like the picture here. In the second line, we have a situation which is not covered by our theorem because here we perturb the constant steady states by a random perturbation. And here, for instance, it is impossible basically from the initial data to predict where these two peaks will be. So that is one an example for this situation where we expect a convergence to the same kind of Same kind of equilibrium solution, but we don't know how to compute it from the initial data. And here is a similar result where the perturbation is basically just at one point. And again, by reflection, you get the reflected point and then these two peaks. Now to the problem with diffusion. So that was the problem without diffusion. Now the problem with diffusion. Now, the problem with diffusion, I mentioned always, so I wrote the equation here. I look for equilibrium solutions with a given mass. I mentioned already in the simulations before that there is a constant solution which was perturbed there. The simulations already showed there that for zero diffusion, this constant solution is unstable. It also exists here, of course. So a constant. Course, so a constant with the right value coming from the given mass is a solution. But what you can do here now is do spectral analysis, spectral stability analysis. And you can do this by Fourier and you can do all the computations explicitly. And you see that you get the bifurcation at a certain value of diffusivity, depending on the mass. Depending on the mass. So, if the diffusivity is above this value, then the trivial solution is stable, spectrally stable, I should say. This is how we just compute eigenvalues of the linearized problem. And one eigenvalue changes sign when the diffusivity becomes smaller than that. So, that indicates that there should be non-trivial steady states. And actually, when you complete the bifurcation analysis by looking at the non-linearly state, Analysis by looking at the nonlinear terms, you can actually compute the approximations for non-trivial steady states. And here I've written the formula. So what is interesting, you see you have a square root of the perturbation parameter is something, a parameter which is equal to zero at this bifurcation point. You see the square root, which indicates that we're talking here about. Indicates that we are talking here about the Peachfork bifurcation, and you see that the profile of the bifurcation is a cosine 2φ, basically. So, what you get, you get a bifurcating solution which has two peaks. And the interesting thing is now it's two peaks, but two peaks of equal height. So, the height of these two peaks is this factor in front. And it's the same for both peaks. So, that means a different So that means a difference to the situation for d equals zero. Now we just get a two parameter family of equilibrium solutions. One parameter is the density of this, the height of these two peaks, and the other one is the direction, like before. We have the rotational symmetry, so we can always choose the rotation. So actually, this is an interesting situation. Now, the question is how to connect the The bifurcation, which happens at the positive diffusion, to the situation for small diffusivity. And here we have only a very partial result. If we look for symmetric solutions, then this is again the problem written down. Now, for solutions which are symmetric, with a reflection symmetry, and we look at what happens for small diffusivity. At what happens for small diffusivity, then we rescale the angle with the diffusivity, and we get this formal limiting problem, which is now on all of R, an integral differential equation. And the only rigorous result we have here in this business is that this equation actually has a solution. We can show that it has a solution. A solution with, and this can be shown by a fixed-point iteration, where when you plug in the right-hand side a probability density, then the solution of this equation is again a probability density. And actually, by the fixed point iteration, also the variance is conserved. And so that allows to show the existence of a solution here. However, what we don't know is if What we don't know is if there exists a solution of these, which is approximated by the solution of these, and another interesting question which comes up here is, of course, now we have produced such a solution with two equal peaks. What about these solutions for d equals zero with peaks of different height? And the conjecture is that actually, when you have an unsymmetric mass distribution, then you will have. Then you will have something which is close to a steady state, but will, however, for small diffusivities be metastable. So you will have a very long evolution which produces the symmetric stable states from the unsymmetric ones. But all this is a speculation and a conjecture. How am I doing time-wise? Pedro? You are muted, so I don't understand. I'm sorry. So, you you can go ahead, like another two, three minutes. Okay, so then I this will be my last slide. Actually, we had spectral stability of the trivial steady state. You remember for diffusivities which are large enough. This result could actually be extended to non-linear stability. To nonlinear stability of the trivial steady state. So, if you remember, we had the value 1 over 6 for these where the bifurcation happens. Now, we have to assume that this is large enough and that we are close enough to the trivial steady state. In this situation, we have the result that there exists a global solution of the full spatial inhomogeneous problem. Homogeneous problem, and that the solution of these actually converges exponentially to the trivial steady state. And yes, unfortunately, if you look at the condition here, we are way off the bifurcation. So the value this large enough means a value quite a bit larger than the bifurcation value. So our result has quite a gap in this sense. This is not such an easy result. This is not such an easy result. Why? Because we are in a hypercoercivity situation here. We have a dissipation in the angular direction, but we only have transport in the position direction. So we need a hypercoercivity result. So what we do is just a few words about the proof. We produce an L2 Japanov functional for the equation without the collision operators. So just for the operator. Operators. So, just for the operator, diffusion in the angular direction and convection in the direction. So, that is rather standard. We use the approach, our approach together with Jean-Bourgo and Grimar Moore, which is an L2 approach, basically. So we construct an entropy functional, a modified entropy functional, which is equivalent to the square of the L2 norm and which is a Lyapunov functional. However, However, in order to deal with a nonlinear problem, we need to control the nonlinearity. So, what we do is we take this functional and apply it to all the derivatives up to order two, which gives us something which controls the L infinity norm. And then for these Lyapunov functional, we can show a differential inequality like this. And that already shows that if we start with a G such that the Such that this Lapudo functional is small enough initially, then it keeps decaying and actually decays exponentially. So that is the proof. So in the yes and my final slide, which I had prepared, I skip. So thank you for your attention. Thank you very much, Kristen, for your talk. Is there any question? Probably have just time for one question before moving to the next speaker. So, may I have just one quick question? So, you have been, so the result that you have. Been uh so the results that you have uh shown so far are for the homogeneous case. Uh, do you have any results for the when you add the drift term? A drift term? Yeah, so to the um in the previous case you had the um the results for this rates of convergence one for the oh yeah maybe I don't know if I understand exactly what what I would say about this is we have these verification results. this bifurcation results um so we would even for the for the inhomogeneous problem uh we would expect uh stability of the bifurcation solutions okay uh this is one of the uh of the problems we want to work on or we work on which is to extend the whole hyperclassivity approach such that it can be used for bifurcation process So, kind of to produce a center manifold, by the way, where a one-dimensional center manifold by the hyperpossibility approach to show that all the other modes decay exponentially. But that is not been done. Okay, good. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Roger. Okay, so
