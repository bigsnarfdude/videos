One of my yeah, one of the strands in my work, which is derived scary routes of singular varieties, mostly for some specific fun of threefolds. And much of this is joint work with my former PhD student, Nibor Safavich, who is now postdoc in Hanover. So what is the plan? So there are four things I'll talk about. First, there'll be some geometry, namely the pets of threefolds, which are particular case of Which are a particular case of Fano varieties. Then I'll speak about karmatic decompositions. So a term which I introduced with in some previous work. So a specific type of decomposition for singular varieties. And then as often in mathematics, we have abstractions and constructions. So abstractions, for existence, will be about algebraic K theory, specifically K minus 1 group. And for threefolds, this will boil down to Picard group and class group. To Picard group and class group and so-called defect, and constructions will come from geometry, namely, will be blowing up nodal curves in nodal freefalls. Right, so there's this mixture of derived categories, algebraic K-theory, and rational geometry. So, I'll start with the geometry. As I said, the pets of threefolds are a particular case of final varieties. Fano varieties, namely, what we ask for is a funeral threefold such that canonical class is divisible by two. So minus k is two times h and h is ample. So in particular, minus k is also ample. So it's fano of index at least two. And normally people can see there are some such guys, but we will be interested in singular ones, specifically nodal, which means they have ordinary double points, simplest kind of isolated singularity. Simplest kind of isolated singularities. And in classification of Fano threefolds, this play a special role. They are just easier to classify than Fano varieties of index one. So classification is quite short and will remind you classification of the types of surfaces if you've seen that one. So by the degree, they are sort of as follows. So we go from From larger degree to smaller degrees of larger degree are easier. So the first one is P3 minus K is 4H. That's obviously a dots of threefold. Then we can blow up a point on P3. And if you know the adjunction formula, for blow up, you would verify that it's also a Dilpezo threefold. The next thing is are related to Dilpezo surfaces. So degree six, we can obtain as a linear section of P2 cross P2. intersection of p2 cross p2 of dimension three so p2 cross p2 sits type p8 by sig rare and then uh if you take hyperplane section you get a threefold and again computing by a junction formula you get a dot-petzo threefold then there is uh p1 cubed again uh fano of index uh two and then the last five guys are specifically have to do with the pets of surfaces so there's linear Plats of surfaces. So there's a linear section of Graspanian 25 in P9, intersection of two quadrics in P5, cubic hypersurface, many people's favorite. And two most complicated guys are of degree two and one. So one is a two-to-one coupler of P3 branchial aquartic, equivalently a hypersurface in a weighted projective space. And V1 is a certain degree hypersurface in a Is a certain degree hypersurface in another rich projective space. So they have the least geometric description and for many reasons are the most complicated ones. So yes, what's good about this, it's very geometric and smooth and nodal are all in the same families. So what kind of questions do we have about these threefolds? We would want to know derived categories. So specifically, I'll be talking about singular ones, but let's first review. ones. But let's first review what's known in the smooth case. So if we look at something quickly? Yeah. Sure. Is there a question? Can you hear me? Yes. Just what does the indexing refer to? The one, two, three, four, five, and so on? That's just. Four five and so on? That's just this thing, the cube of the generator of the Picard group. Okay, so for V1 it is one? Yeah, so if you, for example, if we look at V8, right? So canonical is minus 4h, and you divide by 2, and then you take the cube, so you get an 8. Okay. Yeah, so it's like for L Pets of surfaces, which are hyperplane sections of this. Which are hyperplane sections of this, uh, that's also the degree of the hyperplane of the beta surface, which is hyperplane section. Okay, yeah, we could just take cube of k, but then there is this always multiplied by two, so that's a natural quantity to consider. Yeah, thanks. No, for example, if you, yeah, let's say intersection of two quad of two quadrics, that's that's a canonic, so that's half canonic. That's a canonic, so that's half canonical embedding, and that's degree four. That's kind of the embeddings presented here are half canonical embeddings. So the degree five, degree four, degree three, degree two, degree one. May I ask a question? Yeah, sure. This list, is it in any way related to the linking diagram E8? So, so Del Petso surfaces, are they related to? Surfaces are they related to this Dilinkin diagram? So, yeah, I suppose so. So, maybe you can go through hyperplane section to Dulpezzo than to Dilkin diagram. But there's no degree nine. So, there's Dilpezo surface of degree nine, and there's no Dulpezo threefold of degree nine. That's one of the numerical abstractions Zyskovsky checks. So, basically, this boundness is kind of some kind of Birkard boundness, if you know that, like certain fun varieties. Like final varieties with bounded invariance and bounded singularities form finitely many families, and that's an example of this phenomenon, if you like. So for this six, you have two families, right? Yeah, that's right. But actually, V6 prime won't be of interest. It's smooth, and we'll do nodal ones. And V6 can be one nodal. It will appear in what we do. So you see, some of these guys are. So, you see, some of these guys are smooth, like for example, these two, but smaller degrees allow singular degenerations. Yeah. I mean, this V6 and V7, V6 prime seems to be exactly the branching of the E8 Dinken diagram. Okay, sorry, sorry. Yeah, I'm not sure about that. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, we can discuss that later. It's interesting. I don't know. Yeah, we can discuss that later. It's interesting. I don't know. So let's look at the derived characters of the smooth threefolds. Right, so as a warm-up, so we look at again such a thing, canonical class divisible by two. So note that H is very ample for D at least three. So in the previous list, when I was giving embeddings, they were half-canonical embeddings given by H from three and higher. So, yeah, so for various degrees, they were studied starting from the 90s by Vondolor or Loff and then systematized by Kuznetsov. So, the story is there's a certain decomposition of the drives category because it's index two, there are two semi-orthogonal exceptional line bundles O and O1. So, this vanishing of the homology means that they are semi-orthogonal, there is no homology. Means that they are semi-orthogonal, there are no holmes backwards. And then the orthogonal complement is some subcategory which carries some of the information about the geometry. Right, so it's kind of this is just a formality that we split off what we can, and then there is the bit which carries some information. And then somehow the study is what is that subcategory. And so the interesting cases are degree four. So then it goes back to Bondel Nerlov that the job. Wonderland of that the geometry of this del beta surface has an associated genus to curve, and then this p-square is equivalent to the derived category of that curve that we blow up in a birational model coming from projection from a line. And then when D is at least five, that was saying that, so we'll see this phenomenon that when degree is large, geometry and algebra is easier. So this is generally. Is easier. So, this is generated by an exceptional collection. So, the whole category has a full exceptional collection. And then, for smaller degrades, it's more complicated. So, you don't have to understand the specific geometry here. That's just an idea that like kind of almost everything is understood in the smooth case. And what we'd like to do is to understand this better in the singular case and see what generalizes, what doesn't, and what kind of interesting new phenomenon. And what kind of interesting new phenomena there are. And there are some interesting new phenomena. So, specifically, we are asking to replace the decomposition into exceptional collections by decomposition into finite dimensional algebras. And this is what we call charmata decompositions. So, any questions or comments about the smooth case before I do more complicated things? So, I didn't define semi-orthomological position properly, just maybe briefly that it's a bunch of subcategories. So, this is the right category of coherent sheaves, and I have a bunch of subcategories such that there's no homes backwards, and that they generate the whole thing. And that's same orthogonal decomposition. It's called differently in different fields of mathematics and algebra, it's called Ericoleman. So, now we do singular varieties. Singular varieties, and specifically we look at Gorenstein projective variety. So, Gorenstein is, for us, it means that canonical class is a line bundle, so lots of homological algebra will be almost as good as in the smooth case. So the definition of a karmatic semi-orthogonal decomposition is an admissible decomposition as a technical condition into categories of the following form. So the first category. So, the first category, so we kind of think of the biggest one in some sense, is sitting in the perfect part of DBX. So, for a smooth variety, there is the single derived category attached to it, and now we have a singular variety. So there's bounded derived category of coherent sheaves defined as usual. And inside there, there's a subcategory of perfect complexes defined as finite complexes of vector bundles. And in the similar case, there are two different. And in the similar case, they're two different categories, and we require this bit to be contained in the smooth part sort of of dbx. And then each of these CIs is equivalent to a derived category of finite dimensional modules over a finite dimensional algebra. And these algebras will be in general non-commutative. So, how do we think about this notion? So, there are two ways to think about this. So, the first thing is to think of So, the first thing is to think of A taking care of non-singular part of X, and each of those little algebras having to do with singularities. We'll see examples of this form, how the CIs tell us something about singularities of X. But the other extreme is to put A to be zero and then just have a bunch of fine-dimensional algebras and to think of them as generalizing full exceptional collections. So, I know. Exceptional collections. So I know that there's something similar going on over non-closed fields, where you want to generalize, in a smooth case, exceptional collections to some kind of etal algebras. So that's similar generalization in a different direction. Instead of etal algebras over perfect fields, we look at in general non-smooth algebras over, let's say, complex numbers or other fields. Yeah, and so I said how to think about this. Yeah, and so I said how to think about this. And now there are two examples. So the simplest example is if x is smooth, we can just formally take the first category to be the whole thing. So the smooth case, this to train the late category coincide. And okay, it's kind of a silly example, but in a way, that's an example. And more interesting case, in the kind of the most basic phenomenon for what we're going to study is this. You look at P112, right? You look at P112, right? So, what is P112? It's the singular quadric surface. So, the talk is about threefolds, but surfaces are good to compare these two. So, no double quadric, it's a simple ordinary double point at one point. And then it follows from classical works, maybe Kuznetsov or even earlier than that, that O and O basically there's an commutative decomposition of the following form. So, you can look at Following form. So you can look at O and O2, which form an exceptional collection, and then you can look at the complement. And the complement happens to be equivalent to a quadric of two dimensions less, right? So that's a singular quadric of dimension two, and that's a single quadric of dimension zero. And that's something, yeah. So one can also think of the sotoric surface, and it's also known how to do it for toric surface. But in any case, that's what I was saying about this little category. Saying about this little category having to do with singularities of X. So clearly, this algebra has something to do with the nodal point of this. Can I ask something quickly, Evgeny? Yeah, sure. Is this some sort of chlorar periodicity here? Yes, absolutely. It's kind of a generalization of chlorophysicity in the sense that if you look at the singularity category, then they are equivalent between singularity category of this, singularity category of this are equivalent because these guys are smooth. Because these guys are smooth. And then indeed, adding two squares going from here to here is kind of an enhancement of that. Thank you. Yeah, so specifically, even dimensions mix together and odd dimensions mix together, but even and odd don't mix in this business. Okay, so, and kind of we'll we want to construct decompositions like this for singular varieties and for surfaces. Varieties and for surfaces. It was done in some previous work by myself, Kuznusov, and Kermazin. And here we do threefolds. So I explain some formal properties of these decompositions and how to make abstractions for these properties later on. So once again, I put the definition down. We get a bunch of finite dimensional algebras and a perfect bit. So what are the properties? So, what are the properties? So, firstly, the Algebra Sagorenstein. So, that follows formally by having a share functor, which would induce a share functor on the perfect parts of these categories, and then you reduce the Algebra Sagorenstein. So then another thing is, I said there are two categories, DB and DPERF, and we can choose which one we do. But if we start with DB, we can induce using admissibility, which I asked for, we can induce the composition of dperf. That's kind of the best we can have. That's kind of the best we can hope for that there are two decompositions which respect each other. You didn't require R I I mean it follows that R I are Gorenstein algebra. So if X is Gorenstein, d perf X has a ser functor, then d perf of each of these guys have a ser functor, but you work with Kapranov, I suppose. Functor, but by your work with Kapranov, I suppose, right? And then if dperf has a serfer, it's equivalent almost by definition to R being Gernstein. All right, okay, thank you. It's using this, this property, actually. And then we can quotient one by the other. I think that's what Andre asked about. So we can look at singularity categories. So to relate to neuroperiodicity, we can just quotient all these bits by all those bits. And the first bit is gone because it's the same, it's perfect. And then for each of them, we get a singularity category. them we get a singularity category and we can um in this sense these algebras know something about the singular singular points of the variety and even more interestingly okay okay so right so before that uh algebraic k theory makes the first appearance so uh we'll care like there's this property of idepoten completeness which is important for these quotient categories whether you have it or not Quotient categories: whether you have it or not. In this case, we do have it, and the reason is that we have it for each of the little guys, and then we make semi-orthodox position, it's still a depotent complete. So, one can work in terms of adipotent completeness, but then formally it's equivalent to an algebraic K-theory invariant of x being zero. So, I don't define this, all this higher and lower algebraic theory, so it vanishes in the smooth case. In the singular case, it produces something interesting, which is exactly about this category. This category. This goes back to, I guess, Thomas and Schlichting and Orloff, these kind of observations. And right, so finally, if singularity isolated, then we will have a complete decomposition, not just semi-orthogonal, but fully orthogonal. And this has to do with, it's known by the work of our slanter that these categories are Kalabi-Yau. So every semi-orthogonal decomposition is completely orthogonal. Is completely orthogonal. All right. Can I ask something also? Does it follow that this little r is equal to the number of isolated singular points? Yeah, good point. I guess it depends how you package them. So probably, first of all, you can take direct products of this and make fewer summons, right? But I guess you want some kind of decomposable. You want some kind of decomposable things. So, for nodal singularities, definitely so. And when I'm not nodal, it's not very no, let's see. Yeah, that's a good point. You're asking if there are isolated singularities? So, my question, to be more precise, is the following. Let's say my variety has exactly n nodes. Can I guarantee that I can find the decomposition with R equals? Position with R equals to L. So here it put in completeness comes in. If you do complete your category, then you do get exactly what you are asking. If you don't complete it, maybe there's no chromatic decomposition like that at all, and there's nothing. But after completion, you get n algebras. Okay. Complete by definition? Sabine? Singularity category is complete by definition. So we'll, no. So we'll do Virtia quotient. And then even if both categories are important complete, Virtia quotient doesn't have to be. And that's kind of a big deal here. So of course, DP and G perf are complete, but the quotient is not. Right. And K minus one is the next term in the exact sequence which prevents this from being. No, I'm asking, you said. asking you said then maybe i misunderstood yeah i thought you said that then you have this completeness in the force i mean if we have such a decomposition then we earn uh completeness and ah okay yeah so if we have a decomposition like this yeah so it's a bit it's a bit subtle i think you would expect uh this r to be equal to the number of This R to be equal to the number of singular points. But maybe sometimes these are not quite complete the way you want them to be. Maybe some of this will be glued, so you won't get, you can get less, basically, I'm saying. Yeah, so this was exactly my question. So there are examples of, for example, three faults which have ODPs, but which do not admit credit. Admit crap and resolutions because one of the ODP is related to another one of the ODPs. So, my question is if this phenomenon shows up also into this decomposition. Yeah, the similar phenomenon. Existence of a Crepant resolution is similar to the necessary conditions for this decomposition. So, we'll see some of this later. We want enough whale divisors for this to happen. Maybe some of this will become clearer. So, let's exactly. So, it's kind of a subtle. It's kind of a subtle global geometric properties of X which control the existence of this. And it's similar to Cremon resolutions. So there'll be three slides on constructions for Kawamati decompositions, and then I'll speak about abstractions and then that's the threefolds. So first, let's go two dimensions down. Let's speak about singular curves. And then the theorem of Bourbon, which actually predates the whole concept of converted decomposition, is that if you look at Is that if you look at so what's your typical singular curve? What's the best one? The best one is nodal, so ordinary double points, and all components being P1s. So, and so furthermore, you ask other, is it a tree or not? So, what's the dual graph? Is it a tree or not? And then, if it is a tree, then it behaves like P1. So, you separate the exceptional object from a certain finite-dimensional algebra. Finite dimensional algebra, which Bourbon writes down explicitly. So, specifically, the algebra is a path algebra of a quiver constructed from the dual graph in a certain way. So, basically, you take the dual graph, you double every edge, and put some obvious, some kind of relations on those. We'll see examples later for a chain of two P1s or three P1s. So, and this generalizes. So, and this generalizes P1 case when we just have O and O1, and then the corresponding algebra is just k. So, the proof is an explicit construction of a Tilting object. You just need to sum line bundles or to something like this and show that it works. So, what I want to emphasize is that this tree condition is important, and it happens to be necessary and sufficient. So, later on, we'll see why without being a tree, this won't work. Without being a tree, this won't work. So it's if and only if in for nodal curves. So, what's the simplest example, which is not a P1? It's you glue two P1s transversely in one point. The dual graph is the A2 quiver. And then, as I said, you double the edges. So, make A and A star going the opposite ways. And then the relations are as printed, as written. So, compositions are zero. Zero. So I'm not an algebraist. I don't, yeah, I just give this algebra for reference. I'm not doing much with these algebras. So that's a first source of examples, nodal curves. And that's kind of a well-understood algebraic story. So the next example is we want to relate different dimensions. And so we want to blow up nodal curves. So more generally, we want to blow up To blow up, um, want to blow up LCI sub-varieties. Specifically, there's a version of Orlov's blow-up theorem that works for locally computed intersection centers. So, when your centers are not necessarily smooth, but given by like the number of transverse equations, the number of equations, which is equal to the quadimension. And we do the blow-up, and then we claim that if both. Up. And then we claim that if both the base and the center have commuted decompositions, then so does x tilde. Right? And if you know our love's blow-up formula and you see the definition of commodity composition, it's kind of obvious, right? So you put two things together. So you use the blow-up formula. So you repeat the center several times. I don't try the functors here. I use the slotty notation where I put a category without specifying a functor. A functor. And then we plug in chromatic positions for x and z. And then we, using admissibility, we reorder them to get a chromatic composition for dbx tilde. It's kind of a formal thing. So maybe you wouldn't necessarily think of these things, but it's convenient to blow up nodal curves in smooth threefolds and get smooth nodal threefolds. So let's see. So, what's an example of this? So, for example, you can look at So, for example, you can look at one of those nodal curves in P3, so union of two P1s, and then just blow up this curve. So, it's a local intersection blow-up. And actually, if you look at the local equation, you get a threefold with one node over the node that you were blowing up. And it's a version of neural periodicity. That's how I understand neural periodicity. It's just a blow-up of codimension to sub-variety, giving you a nodal variety of two dimensions more. But in any case, schematically, we can say that here bourbon for Z. So decomposition, like karmatic decomposition for this guy and building so on for P3. So four exceptional objects imply karmatic decomposition for this one nodal threefold. So kind of we have several exceptional objects, namely five, four from here and one from here, plus this bourbon algebra, which was on the previous slide. So the same algebra. Slide. So the same algebra in dimension one for node and in dimension three for a node. So at least in this case, Andre's suggestion works out. We have one node and one algebra comes in. So that's the second bit of constructions, blowing up nodal curves. And later on, when we work with nodal del Petsos, we will use blow-ups and blow-downs like this to relate various categories. Relate various categories. So it's not just a silly example, it's used in more interesting cases as well. And the third sort of construction comes from small resolutions. So like how do we decompose, how do we do anything with a singular variety? We can resolve it in characteristic zero and then try to descend the composition from upstairs to downstairs. So we know a lot about decompositions for smooth varieties, and then the question is. For smooth varieties. And then the question is: how do we do this descent? And this method sometimes works. And for example, if you look at a nodal quadric threefold, so previously we look at nodal quadric surface, now it's a nodal quadric threefold. So one ordinary double point. And the decomposition is this. There are three exceptional objects corresponding to the index plus derived category of the algebra. And actually, it's the same algebra that was in. And actually, it's the same algebra that was in the previous examples, the same algebra which keeps showing up for nodes. And the way it's done is: so quote itself just does quadrics and Kavamata looks at small resolution and then does the descent from a small resolution, which is like a projective bundle over a projective space. And I start emphasizing Picard group and class group for my threefolds. So Picard group is Cartier divisor. Picard group is Cartet divisors, class group are Vale divisors, one always sits inside the other, and when they're equal, variety is factorial. Our varieties often are not factorial. Specifically, if you think of nodal quadric, its Picard rank is one, but its class group rank is two. So there are two Vale divisors who sum as a Cartier divisor, but separately they are not Cartier. And kind of this difference will be important for us as we study. Will be important for us as we study threefolds in detail. And another example, more interesting, that Kalamata does, and this is where the name is coming from, why we call it this way. So if you look at V6, so this nodal threefold of, nodal, that's a threefold of degree six. So if you remember, it was some kind of intersection of P2 times P2 with the linear subspace. And if you take this linear subspace tangent to it, then you get one nodal thing. It, then you get one nodal thing, and then the statement is Ka Mata. Okay, it's known what the small resolution is. The resolution is isomorphic to blow up of P3 into points, and then you know the blow-up form and you have an interesting exceptional collection on the smooth guy, and then you do some work to push it forward to the singular guy. But it's not very systematic the way Kalamata does it. So, in any case. Color method does it. So, in any case, there are okay. Also, I record class group and Picard group. Notice that they again different. So, there are two Cartier divisors and three Bell divisors. And the resulting answer is that there are certain exceptional line bundles plus direct category of the same algebra, which keeps showing up by neuroperiodicity reasoning. Okay, so this is the third method constructing using the small resolution. Constructing using the small resolution. And now, after explaining all this background, I'll state the main results of the talk. So, the main result is: so, we just explain what happens for Deltetso threefolds, for no Deltetzo threefolds from the very first slide of my talk. Okay, so and it's kind of if it doesn't leave, so it's kind of quite quite satisfying. So, if you look at degree up to four, so V1, V2, V3, V4. So V1, V2, V3, V4. So I said these are more complicated, but they never admit karma decompositions I'm asking for. So there exist such novel things, but they never can be decomposed in the way you want. They can be decomposed in different ways, but not separating a smooth component from a bunch of algebras. And on the other hand, V5, V6, they is the abstraction in K minus one. Yes, Alexey Grevich, I think you've heard a very similar talk in the past. So you, yeah, so. Similar top in the past. So, you, yeah, so yeah, it is K-minus one indeed. And I'll be explaining this soon. Exactly. Right. And what about others others are smooth? So V6 prime, V7, V8 are smooth, so there have no degenerations. And somehow, these karmic decompositions that we construct, they form a natural family. So there's, if you remember, I told that starting from five, the smooth guys have. The smooth guys have a full exceptional collection. And now I'm saying that the singular guys have a charmatic decomposition, and those charmatic decompositions can be thought as a limit of exceptional collections from the smooth fibers. If one does decompositions over the base, they all become in a family. It's kind of degenerations for semi-orthogonal decompositions. So, some remarks. How many nodes? So, it's kind of a curious question how many nodes there are. How many nodes there are. So, right, so let's see. So, here I list degrees and here list the number of notes. So, one node is for V6. So, for this guy. Sorry, it's only for one node. Then, V5 has three notes, and so on. So, V1, the most complicated one, has 28 nodes. And this was done by Prokhorov. Just a short question in rational geometry: how many nodes your hypersurface or double cover can have, and there are various interesting ways of doing this. Is interesting ways of doing this, and it's good to know it for the questions we are asking. Then, about moduli of those. So, again, for small degree, they are large moduli spaces. For large degree, they are rigid, and there's everything in between. But in any case, V5 and V6 are rational and rigid in the sense that they're single one V6 with a single node, aptoisomorphism, and. With a single node, aptoisomorphism, and single 1v5 with one, two, or three nodes. So basically, it's like a theorem about four of these varieties and like some family of other varieties. Yeah, so how this statement about the V5 is very strange. I thought that imposing one node condition generally drops down the dimension of the deformation space. Down the dimension of the deformation space by one. So if you're telling me that with three nodes there's one, then with two nodes I would expect a one-dimensional parameter family. Yeah, excellent, excellent. It's stakey. So the smooth one is unique. Therefore, this argument doesn't apply, right? I see. So there's a unique smooth one. Yeah. Oh, okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. I guess one can make sense of this in stacks, but I'm not sure how actually. Right. So yeah, so nodal v6 is this example by Kavamata that I showed two slides ago. So we actually have to do V5. And now what's different about V5 and V6? So, like, the varieties can be rational or not rational, but furthermore, and starting from V4, these guys are rational. From before these guys are rational, but furthermore, if your variety is rational, you can ask: so, what kind of curve do you need to blow up to make it rational? And in a sense, V5, V6, and later ones are very rational. Not only is it rational to P3, but you keep blowing up rational curves in the process. As opposed to in V4, you have to blow up a genus 2 curve. That's kind of why P5 and 6 are different. They are rational with irrational associated curves. Curves. And that's kind of why they have exceptional collections, also, as opposed to some kind of curve inside their derived category. Okay, this was a bit of philosophy. Yeah, I think I need to speed up a little bit. So now comes kind of abstraction. So basically, to prove the theorem, we need to prove one and two, and there are different methods. So first is abstraction to chromatic decompositions. And indeed, we use k minus one of x. So So, right, so that's this Schlichting, Thomason-Trabot K-group, which Thomason-Trabot K-theory defined for varieties, and then Schlichting defines them for DG-enhanced triangulated categories. And then there's this K-1, which we treat as an abstraction. And right, so I mentioned previously that we care about the vanishing of this abstraction. And what's even more interesting is that. What's even more interesting is that this k-theoretic abstraction is geometric in small dimensions. So, for curved surfaces, threefolds, that's a geometric abstraction. So, what's the result for abstractions from our previous work with Pavich and Kalik? So, we have a variety admitting quantum decomposition. So, recall that. So, a big smooth part and lots of singular algebras of finite dimension. Then, k minus one is zero. And then, I already mentioned. And then I already mentioned that, but furthermore, now we translate it into particular cases. So if x is a nodal curve, then this means that x is a tree with smooth components. So as I said, the dual graph has to be a tree, kind of fits a necessary condition for those things to work out. And for nodal threefold, it's a bit more subtle. So you see, no. I didn't understand. I didn't understand where it follows that it is a tree, where it follows. That's a theory, right? So it's kind of follows on the proof of the theorem. From which conditions it follows? From k minus one. But this is, you say then. But I say furthermore, assuming this. Wait, wait, you said k minus one is zero. It follows just from Göringstein. Just from Göringstein? No, no, no, no, no. So the key thing is kavamata decomposition. So you have a bunch of fine-dimensional algebras that control your variety, and then you deduce all these properties. So it's a smooth curves, they don't need to be rational? No, so just no little curve. And we don't know about rational. So if you glue two elliptic curves. Rational. So, if you put two elliptic curves in a point, it's more problematic, it's not clear. So, it's not yeah. Oh, sorry, no, finish what you were saying. Ah, so there's a question in the chat. So, yes, excellent. So, it's known that dperf in general doesn't admit a bounded destructure, and the abstraction is the same k minus one. But whether there's a relation, I don't know. So, I guess, yeah. I guess. Yeah. Okay, cool. Can I ask also something? Sorry. Is it important here that your finite dimensional algebra is all concentrated in homological degree zero? Yeah, yeah, I think so. There are more general versions for DG algebras. So I think this can be worked out for finite dimensional DG algebras. Sorry, go ahead. But for, I just am not completely sure whether for finite dimensional DG algebras, singularity category is still a demotant complete. Right? So there are some technicalities, but probably it's okay to allow if they are finite-dimensional DG algebras. The reason I'm asking is because I know that there is a finite dimensional form of DG algebra just graded out. ET algebra, just graded algebra, whose derived category is the nodal cubic, which is not a tree. Nodal cubic curve. Yes, or every any I n curve. But you're saying that derived category of nodal cubic curve is equivalent to a finite dimensional DG algebra. Yes. We can discuss this because I find this very surprising. We can discuss this because I find this very surprising. Yeah, okay, we should definitely talk. Yeah, okay, okay, yeah, absolutely. Um, yeah, but so far, formally, this is for algebras. Yeah, and then for threefold, the condition is that this here come class groups. So what is this map? It restricts the real divisor to a little formal neighborhood of the singular point for each singular point. Now, this class groups of the formal Class groups of the formal completions for nodes are just Z. Divisor has one invariant. And then for each of them, we put a Z. So basically, we have this map. And we ask that all these spaces realized by the class group. So, actually, on the next screen, I'll show an exact sequence which will explain why we call it It maximal and factoriality. Right, so what we're talking about is Picard group, class group, and this bunch of local class groups for a nodal threefold. Could be projective or not, just nodal, quasi-projective threefold. And then, so what we asked for is that this map is surjective. Is surjective. And the defect of X is defined as the coconut of this map. So I'm kind of playing with this exact sequence, right? So this being subjective or not has to do with what's the coconut. And so in rational geometry, the effect of a nodal threefold is the difference between class group run and Picard group. Class group rank and Picard group rank, which I was emphasizing before. I don't say the rank of them because they can be infinite dimensional, but the exact sequence says that the quotient is finite rank and the rank is the same for this guy as for the image of this. So, what is the language here? So, obviously, this defect is bounded by the number of singular points. By the number of singular points, because that's the image. And furthermore, as we know, factorial by definition means all Val divisors are Cartia. So that's an isomorphism, in which case the image is zero, if and only if. So delta being zero. But in fact, what we care about is maximally non-factorial. So when the difference here is as much as the local class groups allow. Allow. So we took some time coming up with terminology. So, kind of, we're used to factorial being a good thing in minimum model program. Here, factorial is a bad thing, and maximally non-factorial is a good thing. So, class group should be bigger than Picard group for these things to take place. So, would this be equivalent to all of these? Would this be equivalent to also saying something like that the variety admits exactly two to the power n of flops where n yeah exactly right so existence of a flop means that every digit here is hit that there are enough value divisors to do the blow up right and and everything being hit independently means that sorry existence of a small resolution means that we can hit every entry We can hit every entry so that we can blow up enough field divisors. And the existence of a flop means that we can, yeah, the existence of all flop means that we can hit everything here. Yeah, thanks, it's exactly right. So you want a small resolution and all flops being algebraic. That's right. All small resolutions to exist. But we're not using this kind of way of thinking about it. So we have this invariance or defect difference. Invariance or defect difference, and then for varieties we care about for hypersurfaces, double covers, and so on. There are formulas in geometry how to compute this, and they explain some of them because then we'll need it for abstractions to show that there's no decompositions that we care about. So, there's like a bunch of people who were doing these kind of things, but basically, you for example look at hypersurface in PN, or sorry, P4, or more generally in a Or more generally in a weighted projective space. So you assume that it doesn't intersect the singular locus, and then you want to know what is the class group and what is the PKI group and what is the difference. So there are some formulas now. I think I won't explain them in detail. I'll rather say that there are some formulas that the defect is computed by certain homological data about About linear systems on the ambient variety. But maybe the example I want to give is that if you look at nodal quadric, and let's say, how do we know that class group is not the same as Picard group? So according to this logic, we put this all in the formula, and this is becoming zero, and this is one. So the effect is one as opposed to zero. And then plus group is one more than Picard group. So the effect is the difference. Than Picard group. So the fact is the difference, and we get this. So that's kind of one example when it is maximum non-factorial. But now, yeah, so the point was that this L for a quadric was negative. And now the way I want to use this defect is that if the degree of L is positive, so fx is high enough degree. Fx is high enough degree, then defect is less than the number of singular points. So my variety is not maximally non-factorial. So kind of this should become, okay, we have quadratic, but next case is cubic threefold in P4. And we ask, okay, so can we see what is the class group? And this kind of result allows to do it. And furthermore, class group is never as big as the local abstract. As big as the local abstractions allowed for. And right, so I explained how it works, but maybe I'll just do examples of the cases I want to do. So I want to show that V1, V2, V3. So V3 is the nodal cubic and V1, V2 were more complicated guys, have no charmatic decompositions. So I'm saying that they are not maximal and factorial, so they don't allow. Not maximum and factorial, so they don't allow enough whale divisors, so they have no chromatographic positions. So, here is the table for you. So, what's happening here is this is the ambient weighted projective space my guys sit in. This is their degree, so that's a cubic, that's degree four, degree six. That's the canonical class of this guy. So, if you don't know, canonical of a weighted projective space is the sum of the weights, so minus eight, minus six, minus five. Minus eight, minus six, minus five. And then that's the line bundle we care about. And the degree is positive in the cases we ask for. And so there's nothing. So there's not enough failed divisors to admit these decompositions. Yeah, so not maximum factorial, thus k minus one is non-zero, and thus no chromatic decompositions. So it's kind of a bit abstract and maybe lacks, if you see it for the first time, lacks some kind of context. So I keep giving geometric. Some kind of context, so I keep giving geometric examples. So, if we study nodal cubics, right? So, then the maximum number of nodes is 10, and there is a unique 10-nodal cubic called Sigret cubic, which Sigret studied. And then using these formulas, you can see that defect equals 5, which means that P car is Z and class group is Z to the 6. But to make it maximum factorial, we should make Z to 11 here, but it's not Z to 11, so it fails. Yeah. And that's how it is in other cases as well. Is in the other cases as well. Okay. Yeah, so you see, it was abstractions and now constructions. So now I need to explain how in other degrees we can construct the decompositions we care about. So the geometry of Del Patso surfaces is done with projection from a line. So here is the construction. You look at a smooth or a node of Del Petzo. You look at a smooth or a node of the that's a threefold, so it sits in a projective space, and this d plus plus one by Riemann-Roch is okay one larger than this d. And I would take a line in a smooth locus. You can prove that always exists, even if your variety is singular. You find the line, many lines in a smooth locus, and you blow it up. So it is still a nodal threefold nodal at the same points where the original one was nodal. And then And then basically, now you have another contraction. So, another contraction which resolves the projection from that line. So, you kind of project from the line. In other words, you blow up the line and see where you map to. So the linear system is H minus the line. And then the claim is that the resulting image is a threefold in the space one-dimensional. Space one dimension less. So you see when you project from a line, the dimension drops by two. And okay, the degree drops by three somehow. And then this is what you get. So you make a link from your variety you care about, which was maybe complicated and not very clear, to something which we like. So P3, quadric, or P1 times P1. This is very straightforward. So we want to analyze the geometry of original variety through this link. So you see the methods are completely different from what we did before, where we did. Completely different from what we did before, where we did algebraic key theory and singularity which now we do actual geometry. And furthermore, the claim is that this other map on the other side, so I'll show the diagram on the next slide, is itself a blow-up of a nodal curve. And we use this decomposition to control this side. So you see, once again, what happened is here is my del Petza. I project from a line, which means I blow up a line, and I have A line, which means I blow up a line, and I have another contraction which is one of these nice guys, and then we claim that that's a blow-up. So we are in good shape to analyze first this derived category and then this derived category. So hopefully this makes sense to derive category people because that's kind of what one thing we can do to control a direct category by somewhere bigger and then try to do something with that via different map or something. So here is the data. So, here is the diagram. Yeah, specifically, let's look at V4. So, as I said, V4, you blow up the line, you blow down something in linear system H minus L. And this blow-up is exactly the genus to curve I brought up previously. So, what is this V4? That's an intersection of two quadrics in V5, right? And so, every geometry knows it's rational. How is rational? By this construction, and the associate curve is the. Associate curve is the certain genus 2 curve in P3 of type 32 on a quadric. So, right, and from here, what we can deduce when V4 is smoother nodal, this decomposition. So, two exceptional plus derived category of the curves. So, I attributed this earlier to Bondolar Lof in the smooth case, but the same works for nodal case with the same, more or less the same proof. So, this method. So, we have an associated curve here, and furthermore. Curve here, and furthermore, so you see, if you remember, before was a bad guy, we want to show that it doesn't have charmatic compositions, and yet now I kind of contradict myself and show a charmatic composition, but it's not a charmatic composition because we wanted a smooth bit plus some algebras. This are okay, but this is a curve which is singular in general. So, that's not what we allow. We want to concentrate the smooth bit away from the algebra. So, that's not one. The algebra. So that's not one. In any case, we claim that k minus one is non-zero because it's k-theory is additive for semi-orthogonal decompositions. It's equal to k minus one of c. And then for c, we know how to compute it. It's like a cycles in the dual graph. And then it's non-zero. So there's nothing again. But kind of for different reason why there was nothing for v1, v2, v3. Yeah, and as I said, depending on the configuration, so depending on the type of the curve that you blow up, you can get k minus. The curve that you blow up, you can get k minus one z or z squared, unless c is smooth, but we don't care about the smooth case. So I ask for no lule. Okay, so I am short on time. So I won't tell you about the most nodal before. You can ask me later. So kind of, as I said, okay, I'll just say one thing. Like the most model cubic. Like the most model cubic has 10 nodes, the most model v4 has six nodes, and then one can analyze everything about this and enjoy both model curves and nodal threefolds. It's Toric and it's fun. And it's also supposed to modulize space, but in the nodal case, not clear what kind of moduli spaces we're talking about. Okay, so that was the overview of this slide. Let's do V5, which is kind of the new thing. Right, so the claim part of this Ethereum is that all modal V5. Is that all nodal V5s, which means one nodal, two nodal, three nodal, admit a chromatic composition where we separate as always two exceptionals, O1 from a couple of out, like this time a couple of algebras. And I'll tell you what the algebras are. It's not very important. They are certain fine-dimensional algebras coming from nodal curves. So eventually from bourbon. Okay, and I sort of numbers or not. Ah, those quivers, okay. Yeah, they're quivers, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, quivers. So, and I think I kind of quickly, but I told you all the sort of all the ingredients. So, let's see. So, first we use the geometry. We blow up a line and project and go to the quadric, and we blow up some curve on that quadric. So, quadric can be smooth or nodal. That's part of the game we're playing. Now, what is the C? So, C is a smooth or nodal curve of arithmetic genus zero and degree. Curve of arithmetic genus 0 and degree 3. So it's basically a P1 or a chain of P1s. That's what it is, genus 0 nodal. And of certain type lying on a quadric surface. So I also explained that since the quadric and the center admit decomposition, so does this big variety Y. And then we need to compare these two, and this is done using Kuznitsov's techniques of mutual. Done using Kuznitsov's techniques of mutations. Or maybe, yeah, even going back to Bondorlov, but Kuznitsov developed these techniques of mutations. You need to align this decomposition with this decomposition and get what you want about this variety. And specifically, where are the algebras coming from? So they're coming from two places. One is the singularities of the curve, right? So this kind of bourbon thing, nodal three of P1s, admit an algebra being the orthogonal to. Being the orthogonal to the structure sheaf, and another algebra is coming from a nodal quadric. So, again, orthogonal to some exceptional objects give you another algebra. So, what we're doing, we're doing blow-ups and blow-downs of nodal threefolds with centers nodal curves and the mutations to compare everything together. Yeah, so this is more or less the final thing in the proof of the theorem. Let me just state. Of the theorem, let me just state the algebra, so it's not very, um, uh, very important. So, okay, this was two p1s, this is three p1s. So, just like the graph A3, double and put the relations. That's verbal algebras. Yeah. And specifically, what's interesting is there are choices in the constructions. If there's one single point, yeah, actually, now we are answering Andre's question. Actually, now we are answering Andre's question finally. Very good. So, that is, yeah, let's see. So, for one node, we get one algebra like this. Now, for two nodes, there are two options. We can either take two algebras to single verban algebras or what we call a double bourbon algebra. So depending on which geometric model I choose, how do I project, which line do I choose, we can either end up with a smooth quadric or singular quadric, and then we either get two single algebras like this, or one double algebra. So it could be less than the number. Algebraic, so it could be less than the number of points. And finally, in three nodes, there's no choice, we always get one single algebra and one double algebra. Okay. Yeah, so kind of in a way, it's both yes and no for Andre's question that we can make it two algebras, but we can also make it one algebra, right? Yeah, just to emphasize what's the difference, you see, you make your projection from a line and you end up on a quadric. If your quadric is smooth, it means that all your singular points come from this guy, from the singular curve. If your quadric is singular, it means that it carries one algebra and the algebra comes from the center that you blow up. Okay, it's a bit confusing, but that's how it is. All right. Any comments or questions? We are getting to conclusion and then we'll be done. Conclusion. Okay, so the way I think about this, we are generalizing exceptional collections from smooth varieties to singular varieties. Singular varieties cannot carry full exceptional collections, but what they can carry are these little singular algebras which compose everything, but not always. And we have the substructure from. And we have this abstraction from algebraic key theory, and we interpret it for curves, actually, surfaces as well. I didn't talk about this, and threefolds. And we have quite geometric conditions in these dimensions. And like very satisfyingly for Deltato threefolds, type of Fano threefolds, constructions meet abstractions. So small degree, never maximally non-factorial. So no Kaumata decompositions. V4 has an interesting decomposition, but not a Kaumata one because the associated curves. Because the associated curve has cycles in the dual graph. And finally, P5, P6 have covalent positions. Okay, so this was index two, but the next case is index one. There's much longer list, much more interesting geometry, and we are currently doing it with Husinsov, but I'm not ready to report on that bit yet. All right, so that's all from me. Yeah, that's the end. And you can ask questions now or also send me an email if you have any comments. We have any comments for Hepginy. Yes, may I ask a question? So you can see the started from the global situation, but if you consider local, just say isolated singularity. You mean complete local ring? You mean complete local ring? Yes, for instance. So, here, just local and complete local make a big difference. So, local is almost like complete local. I think there's no abstraction. So, for example, k minus one of a complete local ring, or more generally, Henzelian ring is zero. So, there are no abstractions. And can you prove that you have this decomposition saying the perfect category? Say in the perfect category and something finite dimensional. But you see, we prefer to work with proper varieties. Otherwise, homes are infinite-dimensional, and there's no, it's difficult to talk about similar togman decompositions, right? You still can speak. So you want to decompose modules over a complete local algebra. A complete local algebra. Probably it just won't be decomposable, right? DB of that. I think it does. I mean, after all, you have decomposition, you can restrict it to some open set and complete. No, no, no, no, no, but decompositions don't restrict. I think Sasha Kutnitsov told me that if you have a fine variety, it never has semi-orthogonal decompositions. So did this algebras or modules of these algebras are they supported at this point or not? No, they are built by reflexive shapes supported everywhere and they're reflexive at the singular point and the bundle outside the singular point. It's kind of duality here. They're not supported at the singular point. Yeah, okay, I didn't fall. I understand they are not supported at the I understand they are not supported at the point, but I didn't follow what you said. Do you agree that affine varieties don't admit semi-orthogonal decompositions? Which varieties? Affine. Spec R. Single ones? Yes, any small ones. Right, right. That's correct. Yes. Yeah, I mean something else. I should think so. It's already two o'clock in Japan. What I mean. What I mean again, can I um so do you want to talk in about five minutes on a private uh chat, on a private Zoom meeting about that uh nodal curve? Sure, sure. If you send me an email, we can meet. Uh, if there's a break, you can send me an email and we can. Yeah, we have 25 minutes now, so maybe in five minutes we could meet. Okay, yeah, cool. All right, thanks. All right, thanks. Do we have some other questions? Okay, if not, let's thank Evgeny again. Thank you very much. Yeah, thanks for listening. All right. Hope to see many of you in person at some point. All right, bye-bye. Bye.
