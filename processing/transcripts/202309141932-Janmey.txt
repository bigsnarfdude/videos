are new and different for us. And this is work that was kind of like start or at least kind of inspired when Allie was in in the lab and when an experiment she showed you. But it's almost all the work of this guy, Fitzroy, Jeff Piefield, whose idea it was to mess around and start seeing if we can understand the mechanics of the nucleus in the same way using fiber networks and occlusions and whatnot that seems to be useful for tissues and cells. So I want to ask just two questions. How stiff is the nucleus? Ask just two questions. How stiff is the nucleus, whatever stiff means, and what determines that stiffness? And then the second thing is: what is the balance between elasticity and dissipation when a nucleus gets to be formed? And I'll show you immediately why this is possibly an interesting question. Okay, so here's what we're sort of familiar with seeing. Here is a cell stuck on a piece of glass or a stiff substrate. The actin is kind of on the cortex. The actin is kind of on the cortex, microtubules, nobody cares about it in these cells. And the green, the beautiful green thing, is the intermediate filaments that make this page around the nucleus. And the nucleus is round. It's usually quite round in a cultured cell that isn't moving or touching any, but it's smush. It's not a sphere, it's like a pancake. But if you take a cell out of 2D and you put it in 3D and it moves around, and the nucleus deforms. Moves around and the nucleus deforms a lot. And so, what this is is a control cell that Allie may have showed you a couple days ago. It's a fibroblast with GFP on nuclear localization signals, so the GFP is in the nucleus. And the fibroblast is moving through a 3-milligram per milliliter collagen gel, which has a shear modulus at the most of 200 Pascal. Even if the strain stiffens and may Even if its strain stiffens, it may get up to you know a thousand. But most textbooks and most papers remind us that the nucleus is the stiffest organelle in the cell. It has an elastic modulus of 10 kilopascals. So here's a question. So, and I show the other thing to keep in mind is that fibroblasts, they're strong cells, but these are not myofibroblasts, nor are they muscle cells. So their traction stress. So, their attraction stress on a deformable substrate is like a kilopascal. So, you have something that's pulling with kilopascal, and it's moving through a matrix that's 200 Pascal. And, oops, are we, okay, and here's what the nucleus looks like. It's this little sausage that keeps getting contorted. So, how did this happen? How do you get a 10-kilopascal sphere to deform? Sphere to deform into the sausage if it's embedded in this really soft medium. Yep. Sorry, just back to the stiffis organelle thing. How stiff is a mitochondria? Because that's supposed to be... How stiff is a mitochondria? Yeah, that's supposed to be a bacterium. Less stiff than a bacterium, but it's probably stiffer. But you'll see. Of course, it doesn't have the usual wall. It doesn't have a bacterial wall the same way it is the external. Because I think it's that bacteria stiff. So it's not a bacterial. Cell that's not a bacterial. It used to be. But I'll show you that there are things in the cell that are as big as a nucleus, but that are at least as stiff. Okay, we'll get to that in a bit. Okay, so what does the nucleus look like? Here's a really nice kind of, not exactly, or certainly not the scale picture, but it shows you the basic ingredients of the nucleus by this, you know, a review of people who know about this. So it's this spherical. Well, it's this spherical collection of DNA arranged at the euchromatin heterochromatin with different histones and stuff. It has a two-dimensional sheet of lamin, an intermediate filament that makes a 2D sheet, a single molecule thickness two-dimensional sheet, which for computational reasons also, as far as I know, where's Christoph? That nice calculation he did for the salt. Nice calculation he did for the cell cortex. As far as I know, no one has calculated what happens if you make a two-dimensional sphere out of nuclear laminates, where we know everything. We know the mesh size, we know the persistence length, we know the geometry of the network, but no one has calculated how stiff this object is. Amazing. Should be doable. Okay, so that's what this red thing is. It's a two-dimensional sheet that lies in between the DNA and the inner. And the inner of the two lipid bilayers that constitute the nuclear membrane. So the nuclear membrane is different from most other membranes. It is the same thing topologically as endoplasmic reticulum. So it's two different lipid bilayers in the middle of which are potentially interesting things. Yep, sorry. Well, I thought your colleague measured the mechanics of that. Fisher, right? Entity metric? Oh. Oh, yeah, that's why. Who? It is. Oh, yeah, it does a lot of that stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But what what's not measurable? I thought the mechanics had been measured. Of the nuclear well, you can measure the nuclear lamina of a while it's attached to the nucleus. The question is, what happens if you just make a sheet? It's kind of like, you know, yeah, you know what I mean? The intrinsic stiffness. And I'll show you later why this might be interesting. And I'll show you later why this might be interesting. But the other thing is that it cannot be, I don't think it's a continuous sheet because this nuclear membrane has these big openings, these like 50 to 100 nanometer openings, which are the nuclear pores. So little molecules go in and out here for free, more or less, including ions and whatnot. Small proteins go in and out for free. Bigger proteins have to be transported in and out, right? So that's a whole other thing. But okay, so that's basically the idea of. But, okay, so that's basically the idea of what we want to look at. And it's very difficult to measure the mechanics of that object in an actual cell because it's surrounded by this much bigger three-dimensional polymer network. And if you screw around with the polymer network in various ways and you poke on the cell with an AFM or something, it's very difficult to separate the mechanical contribution of the three-dimensional cytoskeleton from the mechanical contribution. Cytoskeleton from the mechanical contribution of the nucleus. It's also a terrible idea. I'll show you in a minute. Well, not a terrible idea. But it is a confounding thing to just rip open the cell and isolate this thing in a batch of PBS because stuff leaks in and out of those pores and you might be losing interesting stuff. Okay, so all right, so we so this is entirely this guy, Jeff Byfield's idea a few years ago to go back and look at this wonderful. Look at this wonderful paper where this Goldman is Bob Goldman, the intermediophobic guy when he was even youngster. And they did this very cool thing. And other people had done it as well. And it turns out that the nucleus is about 10% denser than the rest of the cell, more or less. So if you culture cells on a cover slip here and have them face down in a centrifuge tube, and then you centrifuge Centrifuge to, and then you centrifuge it. The nucleus gently comes out of the cell, just like old ideas of how the moon came out of the earth as it was spinning around before the crust formed over. But I imagine it looks like this. It comes out, and it comes out slowly. It takes minutes for it to come out at about a couple hundred times G centrifugal force, and it comes out of the nucleus. Out of the nucleus, I'm sorry, it comes out of the cell and it wraps the plasma membrane around it. That's really important. It's not a naked nucleus where stuff goes in and out of the pores. The thing that is left behind has a plasma membrane around it with a little bit of cytoplasm, but no organelles. And when people did it way back when, they did it to see whether the so-called cytoplast, right? This thing is called the karyoplast, whether the cytoplast is capable. Whether the cytoplast is capable of dividing or moving or doing anything else. And secondly, could this sort of minimal cell, which is just a nucleus, cytoplasm and a membrane, could it rebuild an actual cell? The answer to the second part is no, but the cytoplasm, as you probably know, can move around a lot. Okay, so that's what we've been doing and studying. And it's a really beautiful, and so I'm going to show you one really interesting. So I want to show you one really interesting thing about the intermediate filaments, which is a little hard to understand. So the main impediment to getting to the nucleus to come out is this perinuclear vimentin cage. The rest of it is okay. It can plow through the rest of the cytoskeleton. But it's difficult to get through the vimentin cage. And I suspect that it only succeeds when a cell happens to be in its center. The cell happens to be bringing its centrosome up because the place where the centrosome and the ER come out of the nuclear membrane is a defect in the perinuclear vimentid cage. And anyways, but what's kind of aesthetically nice is that when you succeed, if you centrifuge too slowly, you get something like this. What's left on the cover slip are a bunch of I meant. Cover slip are a bunch of vimentin-stained cells. These two things don't have nuclei in them. There's no Gapi or Hook staining in them. These ones we did not succeed in enucleating. If you spin a little bit longer, a little bit stronger, you can get a lot of these cells to just lose their nucleus. But the remarkable thing is that the mimentin cage is still there. It didn't get destroyed. It didn't get assembled. It's just there like a ghost for hours. And we have. All right. And we have to make things easier, we have been centrifuging nuclei out of fimentanol cells that we got from John Erickson's lab, just because it makes the nuclei are identical to normal nuclei, but it's just easier to get them out. Okay, I'm just going to skip over this of how easy it is. When the yes. So if they're if they're in caves, you said like it's very hard for the beginning to get out there. So if do they make a hole? Do they make a hole in the cage? Or like how do they get out and make the method stay at that? Okay, so I imagine the way they get out. One thing that is missing from here is somewhere here comes out the endoplasmic reticulum, which is a big tube. And the vimentin cage is everywhere around here on the outside, except where the ER comes out. Except where the ER comes out. That's gotta be a big defect, a little place where you could push this enormous thing through the birth canal, right? So you can, that's kind of what I imagine is happening. But no one's filmed it to be filmable by now, but that's how it works. But it's a very gentle process. It takes a long time, you don't kill anything, everything survives. All right. And then we And then when you're done, when everything succeeds, you get these beautiful spherical objects. So if you look at it by bright field, they're just 10 micron spheres. If you look at them by a Hexter or Napi staining, the blue, at least on a resolution of a regular inverter microscope, the blue area is almost identical to this area. There's about 500 nanometers of cytosol in a lipidon. Of cytosol in a lipid bilayer. The fact that there's a lipid bilayer, the plasma membrane left is great because it still has integrins in it. So we can put these on a polylysine or a fiber active-coated surface, and they stick like a little mini cell. In fact, there's even like a little adhesion energy inspired by traction force measurements and the stuff that Michael did with looking at the traction forces. Looking at the attraction force that an adhesive vesicle puts on a gel. These guys do the same thing. They put a little bit of attraction force, not because they're pulling, but because they're adhesive. Anyway, blah, blah, blah. So the nucleus that was first lifted out of the cell was like a pancake. And in the 20 minutes it takes the nucleus to come out, it's a perfect sphere. So it's locked, so the surface area volume ratio has changed. Consequently. Oh, the pent tag happens when it gets fattened on the bottom surface, right? Yep. Gets flattened on the bottom surface. Yeah. So if you spin more gently or so that it might not be so bad, right? No, no, no. As soon as it comes out, well, I'll show you something related to that in a minute, in a bit. But typically the cells, in order to do this, you need the cell to be very well adhesive to a surface, which is typically easiest to do if you put it on a glass surface. Because you're putting a centrifugal force on it. And what you want to do, the reason this is so hard to do, is that you want to get the condition. Do is that you want to get the condition so the cell doesn't just fall off the glass, but the nucleus comes out. And so, right, it takes, you got to practice. But once the nucleus comes out, it does not remodel the nuclear lamina. The nuclear lamina is this, so the thing itself is spherical, but the nuclear lamina, both lamin B and lamin A C are just wrinkled up. So, and here's something I really appreciate. Yeah, really appreciate being yelled at or corrected. I think this means that when we see a restoring force, it can't be from the nuclear lamina because it's just collapsed. It's bubbled. Okay, anyway, there's that. So what we've been doing is this. We take a fluorescently labeled or not a little spherical nucleus gently adherent to a surface so it doesn't roll away, and we take a flat AFM pen. And we take a flat AFM cantilever, move the thing, park it right on top, and then what I'm going to show you is a movie in almost real time. I think it's sped up a little bit. The cantilever is moving down either 0.01 micron a second or 0.1 micron a second. It takes about 10 seconds, and it's going to, once it touches the top of the nucleus, which is 10 microns high, it's going to keep pushing until it reaches the maximum. Until it reaches the maximum force on the AFM, and it's going to squish the nucleus down until it's five microns big. So it's a big, big deformation because that's what the cell does to it. All right. And if the movie plays, I hope this is what we see. And resolution is not great, so go yell at me, but okay, once, twice, three times. Three times. And that little shifting to the left is just an aberration. But, and we don't have great resolution, but it does look like the chromatin got a little bit, you know, the hex staining looks a little bit different once it gets pushed on. But what's important, and I'll get back to that later, is that the radius completely recovers. And it seems to be a completely elastic object, right? You push it three times by a big strain, nothing breaks, you know, it just comes. Breaks, you know, it just comes back to working. That was real time, so that was almost real time. It was sped up a little bit. Nothing breaks. I mean, we know that there aren't. My understanding was often squished there. You get holes from them. Yep. Yeah, that's not happening. That's not happening. How do you know that that's not happening? Because we don't get, well, partly because, well, you see, because the mechanics don't change and the nuclear lamina doesn't break, and because Doesn't break. And because if something broke and things died, I mean, a little nuance is we know these things are metabolically active because the lipid asymmetry of the plasma membrane is maintained. So if you look at phosphatidyl serine exposure to the outside, there's zero phosphatyl serine for about 24 hours. If we got disruption of something, there'd be bubble in phosphatidyl serine on the outside. But just what I'm understanding, again, was right, even with the cells that you compress them, you get those ruptures that they can recover and occur. That they can recover and occur. Yeah. But a telltale sign that that happened is Foster Alsirian on the outside, which we don't see. But I mean, yeah, I don't know. There could be leaking in and out. What we're looking at now are things like calcium transients and stuff like that. But so far, the answer is no. Just seems like an elastic thing. And like, you know, let's see what happened here. So if you have an AFN, you can't not do that. Have an AFM, you can't not do this. You measure the force as a function of the amount of deformation. From the force compression curve, you get this beautiful line, which you can fit to a Hertz relation. And there's been a lot of this kind of stuff. And we get what pretty much everybody gets, somewhere between 5 and 10 kilopascal, depending on the cell type, you know, this and that. But you could fit really nicely the first half micron. Nicely, the first half micron, so the first like 10% compression pretty well. Why Earth? It's a flat pit? Well, because we're taking this, we still need to account for the fact that the area in contact with the thing is constantly increasing. We have a sphere that we're touching with a flat object. It won't follow Hertz the way it ended in touch with the curve, surface touch. Okay, we can talk about that later. Turns out it doesn't matter. But the data is the right dot design, right? The data is the dotted line, right? The hertz is the light. The data is the dotted line, the fit is the black line. It's always more rising up faster than we would expect it to. Okay, and if you do that and you measure that over almost three orders of magnitude difference in frequency, you get basically the same number. So anywhere between 0.01 hertz and 10 hertz or 9 hertz. It's always, you know, between 5 and 10 kilopascals. Between 5 and 10 kilopascals. It looks like a really robust, you know, reproducible thing. Okay, but it can't possibly be this stiff and elastic. Here's the other reason it can't be this. So here's a little sign of the demise of Western civilization, that everybody's liver is filling with fat, and that there's this amazing statistic because we've looked at a little bit. Fenton has a Bit. Benton has a center a little bit on the physics of liver cancer. It used to be people got liver cancer if they had a stiff liver from intoxication, viral infection, or something like that. And stiffness, the elastic modulus of the liver is by far the best prognostic indicator for the biggest risk factor of getting liver cancer five, ten years down the line. There's no molecular marker. It's all stiffness. And that's changed because many people who develop hepatocellular carcinoma. Who develop hepatocellular carcinoma have very, very soft livers. The reason their livers are soft is they're full of fat. And the more fat you eat, something really remarkably creepy happens to your liver. This is a slice through a non-fat liver. These little red dots are places where fat accumulates. It's a stain that goes into fat. Here's someone with fatty liver disease. And if you look at an individual hepatocyte, not from a patient, but from animals. From a patient, but from animals that are fed lots of fat. A normal hepatocyte is this big, actin-filled, not very contractile, not very pretty cell, but it's big. It doesn't move, but it's big, and it's got this nice actin cytoskeleton, very little stain for fat. If you feed it fat, it makes these big fat droplets. And here's this is work from Abby Wonaker in Techni Wells' group that Vivek did a lot about. That Vivek did a lot of modeling of. And there's this very, really interesting result, which is that even though the liver macroscopically is stiff, the nucleus is mechanically stressed. And it's stressed by being in an almost close-packed, maybe close-packed array of fat droplets. And so look at these images of a slice. Here are a bunch of spherical fat droplets impinging on the nucleus. Impinging on the nucleus. So you take the 10 micron fat droplet, put it on next to a 10 micron nucleus, push the two things together. The one that deforms is the nucleus, not the fat droplet. It's just an oil droplet. And those deformations are big. So every place there's an indentation of a nucleus here is where a fat droplet pushed on it. And I thought this couldn't possibly be true because I did not appreciate how stiff a test. How stiff a 10-micron object with the surface tension of a lipid droplet is. And the surface tension of an actual lipid droplet from the liver is modified. It's not just like the oil droplet. It has surfactants on it. So the surface tension is lowered a little bit, but not enough. Again, if you look at a Z-stack, you'd see how fantastically deformed the nucleus gets by these little oil droplets. And the only reason this thing is not a sphere is that it's touching the bottom of the cell. Is that it's touching the bottom of the cell, which has a little adhesion energy for the, so this is flat, not because it got pushed on, it's flat because it adhered. But it's really doing a number on the nucleus. And so people, my hypothesis is that you develop a patocellular carcinoma because the nucleus is always in this mechanically stressed state. Very similar to what would happen if you had a fibrotic liver, but for different reasons. Okay, so how does that happen? So the other peculiar thing I mentioned before. Peculiar thing I mentioned before, oh my god, that hepatocytes are not very contractile cells, and we can measure how contractile they are. They put a contractile stress of 200 Pascal on the lipid droplets that are pushing on the nucleus. So even if the lipid droplet was a polystyrene bead, it's still questionable how it can deform the nucleus because it's only feeling 200 Pascal of stress pushing it. 200 Pascal of stress pushing it in. All right, so that's what we've been trying to explore. So the first thing, this is just my misunderstanding of life, but we purified, or David Lee and Abby purified some lipid droplets from a liver. And you can capture a few of these lipid droplets and do the same thing with an AFM. You can push on it and they're retracted. And here's something really helpful for later. Helpful for later. So here the AFM cantilever is coming in, in the blue part it's making contact, the force is rising, and then we pull the cantilever back, the force comes down. This tiny little negative blip is because of a little adhesion energy, but it's almost perfectly elastic. Had there been viscous dissipation, there'd be hysteresis between the blue curve and the red curve, and the area under the curve is some measure of the work dissipation. Some measure of work dissipated. And there's basically zero work dissipated because the stiffness just comes from the surface tension, which cannot relax unless you pump surfactants or something into it. And if you do the Hertz fitting or something similar, you get 10 kilopascals. And nicely, the apparent stiffness decreases with the size of the droplet, you know, consistent with the picture. Consistent with the picture that is just surface tension. But the amazing thing is that this little lipid droplet is way stiffer than I would have thought. I guess I should have known that, but I didn't. But it still doesn't explain why the nucleus deforms. Okay, so what determines the stiffness of the liver? And if, yeah, I guess we're running out of time, so I can't have an audience poll. But I already told you the punchline. This was always my picture of. Always my picture of the nucleus. It's just like a ball of yarn where a large volume fraction of the stuff is DNA, and all these chromatin terrain cords. But it turns out, and it's easy to convince yourself of this, that only like 1% to 3% volume fraction of the nucleus is DNA. It's piddly. It's a tiny minority. And the rest of this stuff is there are things like the Hallbody speckles. Body, speckles, nucleoli, things that are liquid-liquid-b-mixed, you know, things. And a bunch of other stuff. There's motors in there, there's ribosomes maturing, there's all kinds of stuff going in and out, but it's not DNA. Furthermore... Well, do you count the histones? The histones plus DNA? Okay, so let me jump forward a little bit. Well, the next slide. I want to show you three things. How important is the DNA for the nuclear mechanics? What happens with osmotic swelling? What happens with osmotic swelling, and what happens when you grow things on hard and soft substrates? Kind of to get at your point: what if the nucleus isn't so flat when we start? Okay, so here's a really nice study from Jorke and Basser a very long time ago. Well, not that long, 20 years ago, and that we have basically repeated. And these guys are very good at optimally cross-linking double-stranded DNA as efficiently as they possibly can. As efficiently as they possibly could, and then measuring the shear modulus. So, this is the concentration range that's relevant to the nucleus. And if you cross-link DNA as well as you possibly can, you can get maybe 800 Pascal out of it. You can't get 10 kilopascals out of it. How is it possible? Sorry? How is it DNA in Haxen? So, either chemically or with divalent cations or Or they tried various things. And we've tried the same sort of thing, no matter how well you cross-link it. The other thing I should mention that they don't show there, a cross-link gel of DNA is beautifully elastic. G prime is an order of magnitude bigger than G double prime. Very little mechanical loss. It's just a semi-flexible polymer network. So you might say, oh, okay, well, the DNA is not the thing in the nucleus. It's chromatin fibers, which must be much stiffer. So that's wrong, I think. That's not helpful for two reasons. That's not helpful for two reasons. If you have a limited amount of polymer, I hope I'm not misquoting Fred, but you would expect for this system, right, it's going to depend on the square of the bending stiffness. And so you might think, well, this is great. If I make a chromatin fiber, it's got to be way stiffer. But as you recruit material into these big, fatter chromatin fibers, the mesh size goes up. And here's the mesh size, which is fiber. And here's the mesh size, which is fighting against the stiffness change. And even worse, people have measured, there's really nice single chromatin measurements from Bustamante and other people. They've measured the persistence length of chromatin. A chromatin fiber is about three times as stiff as a double-stranded DNA. So it's hardly helping you at all. Okay. And then there's this other thing. Perfect. Okay. Perfect. Okay, what happens if you get rid of the DNA? If you get rid of the DNA, which we can do by gently permeabilizing the plasma membrane with the jitonin, which permeabilizes, makes tiny little holes in the plasma membrane, doesn't touch the nuclear membrane. We can float in things like enzymes. If you float in DNA 1, which will slowly digest the DNA to nothing, something interesting happens. One, you can maybe see by this, the nucleus gets smaller, but it doesn't collapse. Gets smaller, but it doesn't collapse. The hex staining DNA all goes away. And so the size, the volume goes down a little bit, way more than it would just from this 3% volume fraction that we've removed because there's swelling pressure and whatnot. But the other thing is, instead of getting the nucleus to be softer, it's now way stiffer. It's three times stiffer. All right, so I'm running out of time, so I'm going to. So I'm running out of time, so I'm going to. It's stiffer, but it's smaller. It's smaller and it's stiffer. And it's a lot stiffer. It also swells and deswells osmotically, but never mind that. I did want to show you this thing, which we completely don't understand, but I think other people have seen. If you culture cell, I've been showing you only things that are cultured on glass. If you culture the same cell on a softer substrate, you can still centrifuge. You can still centrifuge the nucleus out. The nucleus still has exactly the same volume, but it's softer, even after we take it out of the cell. So something in the nuclear configuration remembers that it was living in a soft world. All right, the last thing I want to look at is the difference between elasticity and dissipation. I showed you before this movie, and I showed you how reversible it was, but I. You, how reversible it was, but I showed you, but basically, we've been looking only at these rising parts. The retracting things have this huge hysteresis in them, that most of the work of compressing the nucleus was dissipated. And yet, it returned exactly to its original state. So, if you look at the area of the nucleus during every one of these imputations, right, as we squeeze it down, the area is going to come out. Area comes up. Going to come out. Here it comes up, comes down, cantilever leaves the surface, squeezes it again. We don't lose distension of the nucleus the way we would if we had popped the balloon open. So it does seem like a recoverable thing. But we don't know where this dissipation comes from. It can't come from the DNA, because it's not dissipative. And to just sort of I'll skip over the stuff I've already told you, but I want to show you two last things. I want to show you two last things. One is that if you now do something more gentle, oh, actually, no, I do need to stop, pop back, and tell you one thing, which I think I've glossed over. Yeah. Which is this. This curve doesn't matter if you do it at 0.01 hertz or 10 hertz. The stiffness is the same, I already showed you that, but the dissipation. Already showed you that, but the dissipation also doesn't go away. It goes away a tiny bit, not very much. So, whatever is dissipative doesn't seem like it's a viscous thing. Yeah. Why can't it be that you're squeezing water out of the nuclear? Ah, because we're maintaining volume, right? We know we're maintaining volume because of this. If we squeeze water out of it, well, two things. It's really hard to squeeze water out of. Really hard to squeeze water out of DNA, out of a nucleus. I think Sean Son and other people have shown that you cannot get water out unless with osmotic pressure. You can't get it out. Sorry? You got rid of it. Well, I don't know what happens if we get rid of the DNA. It's an interesting question, whether we can. This is the regular old nucleus. That getting rid of the DNA was a one-shot trick. So the volume completely recovers every time we do this. We do this. But if you have, like, if you squish it and you're, it's sort of a poor elastic network, then the water could be displacing or you could be squeezing the water out of... Then it should be frequency dependent. There should be a frequency. Yeah, there should be, and there isn't. So there's two things working against water release. One is that thermodynamically, it can't happen at these kinds of pressures. The second is we know that the volume recalls. The second is we know that the volume recovers. And the third is that it's not rate dependent. At least, so it's not rate-dependent on the rate we can access. Right. Okay, so the very last thing I want to show you is this curious thing. So we thought, oh, it's got to be active. And at first, I tried to kill the activity with azide, which was a stupid idea because that's not how they make ATP. They make ATP by glycolysis. So we inhibited glycolysis, and then something really interesting happens. Happens. If you inhibit glycolysis in this isolated membrane, so you deprive the nucleus of ATP, it maybe gets a little bit bigger, nothing really special. For sure, the chromatin has to move around, you just can't see it, but nothing special. But what does happen is two things. Here's a normal, here's a control, and here's the sister cell of the same batch of cells. The dissipation almost completely goes away. Dissipation almost completely goes away and it becomes way, way stiffer. So that's where we are. We're now trying to figure out what the motor is. So if you have a suggestion for which motor we should look at, yeah, please. We're just trying to inhibit things one by one to see what this is. But globally killing the voters gets rid of all this dissipation and stiffens things up like crazy. Okay, so anyway, that's the conclusion. And yeah, thanks a lot. Conclusion and yeah, thanks. This is the lab that did it, and almost all the work is done by this guy and inspired by Allison, whose birthday it is today. So, if you haven't found your thing, then please do so later. I heard you say that the DNA can't be responsible for dissipation. Yes. It is a I mean, certainly. I mean, I certainly could imagine there could be some viscosity there. So even your evidence points against this viscosity. But both in Jorge's measurements and in ours, if you take cross-linked DNA and measure G prime and G double prime over a big, you don't see any, you see a very little, it's not as good as active, but it's not bad. Okay, so it should be crossed. But it's not bad. Okay, so it should be cross-linked. It has to be cross-linked. Yeah. Yeah. Is it possible that when you deplete ATV from a cell that you screw up like ion homeostasis and pH and those type of things, and that somehow you have some generic effect of that? Right, maybe. But if that were, yeah, if that's the case, then what will happen? And what will the that might be why the nucleus gets a little bit bigger. Why the nucleus gets a little bit bigger. But everything we've done, whatever makes the nucleus get bigger osmotically makes it softer. That's a slide I skipped. Maybe I can quickly go back to that. But these guys are hypersensitive to, oops, I'm going the wrong way, to osmotic stuff. Yeah. Oh, it's not showing anymore. Sorry. But anyway, that's basically it. If you make it slightly hypocrite, the more hypothetical. Make it slightly hypoosmos. The more hypoosmotic you make the medium, the more the nucleus swells, the softer it gets. If you make it hyperosmotic, it gets stiffer really, really fast. But in the case of the ATP depletion, the nucleus gets bigger, but it gets stiffer. So it doesn't seem to be consistent with messing up ionic stuff. If you want to watch the nucleus, If you want to watch the nucleus come out of your cells, we should talk because we have more of a center for you. Oh, okay, fantastic. Or come tomorrow morning and learn more about it at 8 a.m. I will do both. I thought that we would just be able to put a cell phone camera in the centrifuge tube and do it, but we just never did it. Yeah, okay. I'd love to do that. That would be so pretty. Question while so when you get the DNA, a DNA gets pushed up, chopped up, and DNA flows out, but the nuclei get smaller and stiffer. So tell me why this is wrong. What I think that to me seems like the DNA is being chopped out is the, so it's the smallest certain size of the dog of automotive pressure balance, right? And then these little bits are leaving, so you're going to get water flowing out the balance. Water flowing out the balance to be able to reaffilate cosmotically. And now, so that causes the shrinkage, but now whatever is holding that nucleus in the hydrogen body and stuff, now these bonds are closer together, so like you're smarter. That's what I think, but but but but what is all that other stuff? So yeah, what are all those things? Like, I don't know, or maybe it's no, I don't know that like the nucleolus is particularly stiff. I don't know. Stiff. I don't know, because these are all liquid-liquid B-mixed things you can screw around with their formation and disassembly with like acoustic sexolex. John Harper did some things where he pulled on chromatin and treated it with DNAs, and it still wasn't elastic after he removed the DNA because of the protein matrix. I don't remember the paper exactly, but I've always been afraid to make that word because people, you know, there's all these ideas that there's an act and framework. All these ideas that there's an act and framework in the Aquamizen, and people work on that. Everybody seems to hate each other and yell at each other about whether it's. So I really, really hope that when we hibit myosin, this goes away.
