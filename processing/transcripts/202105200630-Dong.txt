The next speaker is Professor Dong Yuxing from Sudan University. The title of his talk is Prescribed Vibros Carcurigance on Compact Sodo Hermitian Manifold. Please, Yu Xin. Thanks, Hen Song, for the introduction. I would like to also thank the organizer for the invitation. This is my This is my title, the outline of my talk. So first, I would like to introduce the background briefly. So around 1974, Costa Werner investigated the following basic problem in Niemania geometry. So let M be a compact smooth manifold, K a smooth manifold. manifold k a small function can we find a Liberia metric on M such that its scalar curvature is the given function k actually Castle Warner investigated this problem in the frame of conformal geometry let the GG given remaining a metric on M they ask if K can be realized if k can be realized as the scalar curvature of a metric g1 pointwise conformal to g this is the pointwise conformal we denote this problem by p1 or can be realized as a scalar curvature of a metric g1 conformally equivalent to g this is a conformally equivalent so up to conformal equivalent so up to a different morphism we denote this problem by p2 actually it is obvious p1 imply p2 and imply p so let's consider two special cases of the above problem if the coordinate scalar curvature function k is constant of course the p1 is the well-known yamabi problem another special Another special case is the domain manifold is the n-dimensional sphere. And if k is any smooth function on the sphere, then the problem P1 is also called the Lilenbohr problem. There are huge literature about these topics. We know that there are many formal similarities between conformal and CR geometry. conformal and CR geometry. So in this talk, we will discuss the problem of prescribing Webster scalar curvature on CR manifolds. So let me recall some notion and notation in pseudo-commission geometry. We know that a CR manifold is an abstract model of real hyper surface in complex manifolds. So this is this manifold. see this this manifold is of order dimension so this is definition so let m be 2m plus 1 c infinity manifolds hm is a rank 2m sub-bundle of the tangent bundle g is an almost complex structure on this bundle which satisfy the following formula in formally integrable condition, then the pair Hg is called a CR structure, and the triple is called a CR manifold. The dual description of the HM, HM, we recall the CR distribution or horizontal distribution in following. So the dual description of HM gives a trivial line boundary, the cool normal boundaries uh bound E so at each point uh omega is an element in the Coulombian space initiate the vector space of HM so since it is a trivial line bundle so it exhibits globally known weir vanishing sections so any such kind of section C da is called a pseudo-committing structure Is called a pseudo-humising structure. The control is referred to as a pseudo-Hamitian manifold. The exterior differential of zeta gives the levy form, which is symmetric and j-invariant. If the levy form of is positive definite on HM, then this then this CR manifold is called SN2 restricted pseudo-convex. In following, we will always assume this condition, which implies that the pair HML CEDA is a two-step subliminal structure on M Let me give a simple example. The older dimensional sphere in complex Odinear space. complex ODNIA space induce nature CR structure and standard pseudo-humising structure from RBNTS space. So this is the simplest compact pseudo-humising manifold. So we come back to abstract CR manifold. So let M be a CR manifold. So NA2 are pseudo-Hermitian structure. the Homesian structure since E is a line bundle so are related by this formula for some nowhere vanishing C infinity function U. So consequently, they are leviform are related in a conformal way. So on the other hand, we know that this also introduces a restricted conformal class of Fifth Man magic on the canonical circle boundary over M. Circle boundaries over M. So this leads to a resemblance between CR and conformal geometry. So we can adopt a similar terminology from conformal geometry. So the CR conformal class of the pseudo-committee structure SETA is given by this set. Since CETA is contextual. Uh, Seta is a contact form, so it determines a global vector field called the Lieber vector field by these two relations. We also have a useful Liemannia metric, the Webster metric on a pseudo-commission manifold. This is its volume form on a pseudo-commission manifold. On a pseudo-commission barifold, there is a canonical linear connection, lambda, which generalizes the turn connection in Hamitian geometry. So this Linux connection satisfies the four conditions. So we only explained the previous three. The first one means that the connection preserves the CR distribution or the horizontal distribution. horizontal distribution. The second one means it is a metric connection. Third means the connection preserves the complex structure. So anyway, the four conditions determine uniquely a linear connection, which is called the Tanaga-Wex connection. Then we have the curvature tensor. In terms of local unitary frame field of the distribution of type of Distribution of type 1, 0. We can write the curvature tensor in terms of its component. Then take a trace, we will have the pseudo commission in each tensor. Take a further trace, we get the Webster scale curvature. For two pseudo-commission structure with conformal with conformal factor u 2 over m their website scale curvature are related by this formula a nice formula here laplace zeta is so-called sub-laplacing which is defined as the divergence of the horizontal gradient of a function here the corresponding gradient Here the current gradient is the projection to H of the usual gradient vector field. We also have the generalizing sublife space compatible with this sublap passing. This is a degenerate elliptic operate. Such kind of sublime space are called foreign stand space. and stand space. I'll skip the detail about the definition. The definition is similar to the usual subliff space, but just we take the derivative along the horizontal direction. Now, for a smooth map between two pseudo-CR manifolds, it is called a CR map if it satisfies if If preserved the CR distribution and also commute with the complex structure. Furthermore, if F is a diffomorphism, F is said to be a C R diffomorphism. For our pseudo-commission manifold, we say that another structure, H hat, J hat, C d hat, is C R conformally equivalent to the original one. the original one if there is a diffomorphism phi and a positive sig infinity function such that the following three conditions are satisfied. So the first is just a deconformal. The second and the third means that the map of phi preserves the CR structure. In particular, if the map is identical If the map is density, then we say Hg theta hat is said to be point-wise CR conformal to HgA theta. Now we consider the CR analog for prescribing scalar-Webster curvature problem. So let M be a compact pseudo-homission manifold with a Webster scalar curvature law. For R, given smooth given smooth function, one may ask if log hat can be realized as the Webster scalar capture of Hg C the hat, which is point wide CR conformal to the original one, or the structure H hat G hat C the hat, which is the C R equivalent to the original one. So we denote the first one by PC problem. PC problem, the second one, the CE problem. So the corresponding PDE is given by equation PC or equation CE, respectively. For convenience, we will set PC C denotes all the smooth functions which can be. function which can be realized through PC. CEC does can be defined in a similar way. Simple observation tells us that if rho hat belongs to P C theta, then any alpha rho hat alpha is a positive constant belongs to P C theta for C the similar property. is a similar property host so so let's denote l the differential operator on the left hand side of the pc equation then lambda one be the first eigenvalue of l this is analytical invariant we have also a geometric invariant the the cimrv constant is C i MRV constant is a CMI invariant, Ci invariant given by this calculation. So we know that the lambda one and Ym have the same sign, which helps us to calculate the catalog of the CR conformal class. So let's also see, consider the two special case. The first special case is if the row hat is constant. The low hat is a constant. The PC is the well-known CI-Yamabi problem, which was solved by Jerry Sun Li, Gamala, and Yaku. So another special case is the domain is the CR sphere. There are also many research work on this topic. This is also called the CR inevogler problem. I only list here, but I'll skip the detail. but I'll skip the detailed description about this result. This is Professor Tsung's result, custom warner type necessity condition for you and the rule hat. And also, Michelle D. Ozoni using the perturbation method proves an existing result where we had it close to a positive constant. There are other many. There are other many people have contributed to this topic. So a further generalization about this PC problem is considered the PC problem on spherical pseudo-humbision manifold. So a CR manifold is called a spherical if it is locally CR conformal equivalent to the sphere. The gamma and the gamma and the emblem of gamma etc using the theorem of critical points gives an existent result for PC problem on three-dimensional frequency R metaphors. The following group gave some existing results for PC problem on spherical CR metaphors or with optionally. or with actual dimension. Now let's see the PC problem on general pseudo-commission manifolds. There are only a few results about this topic. I just mention who get the following result in 2013 using Using the geometric flow for prescribing Webster scalar curvature problem, he proved that M be a three-dimensional pseudo-commission manifold with the negative Yama B constant. If row hat is a negative C infinity function, then he using the flow method to prove that the rho hat belongs to P C theta. So that means it can be realized as the web scale curvature. as the web scale coverage. Recently, we find that using the upper and the lower solution method, we can generalize the host result to actual dimension in a relative simple way. So the first we need the following lemma. So let M be a compact pseudo-commission manifold, F or C infinity. Now, FR C infinity function, that we consider this equation. So if exist u plus and u minus satisfy following inequality respectively. The first means that u plus is an upper solution for equation three. The second one means u minus is a lower solution for equation three. And u minus equal to less than equal to u plus then we can find a smooth solution between this u plus and u u minus and u plus so let me give a sketch of the proof first we uh comparison result we know that whenever we have a comparison result we can apply the Apply the upper and lower solution method in general. So let lambda be a constant large enough such that the f the is increasing in u. Now we consider this kind of equation by the iterating procedure. So using this iterating Using this iterating procedure, we get a serious for approximating solution, U minus, U1, U2, etc. This is increasing series of approximating solution. Then take limits, we can get the required solution for the equation three. Now, our first result is Our first result is to generalize whose result to optimal dimension. So let M be a compact pseudo-Hermitian manifold, the following standard equivalent. This is the first eigenvalue, Yamabi constant. So we only show that if the Yamabi constant is negative, of course, equivalent to the first eigenvalue is negative, then. active, then any negative smooth function belongs to P C theta. So a simple observation tell us if alpha is a positive constant large enough, then it will provide us an up solution for equation P C another observation is that if let P C be the first let passi be the first positive eigen function of L set u minus equals beta passi with beta constant small enough satisfy this condition then this will provide us a lower solution then using ul s lemma we get a c infinity solution for the pc problem so in this way we can generalize So in this way, we can generalize who's result to arbitrary way, optional dimension. Related result, Nago-tsung get the following result, and they also consider compact aceto commission variable with negative Yamabi constant. Suppose rho hat is a non-positive such that the set of zero Of zero point have has a positive measure, then they give sufficient and necessary condition for a small function to be in the PC theta. So, here the lambda row hat is a constant determined by this function. So, we can also So we can also establish another result using the ULS lemma. So let M be a compact pseudo-humising manifold with a negative Yamami constant. If rho hat belongs to P C theta and rho1 hat is smaller than rho hat, then we can prove that this function belongs to PCC. function belongs to PCC. Note that in our theorem, low hat is not assumed to be nectar. For the PC problem, on general pseudo-commission variables with either lambda one equals zero or positive lambda one remains less understood. So now we consider the C. the the c e deformation problem so first we express the the equation equivalently to another form by move the the u power to the left hand side and write the equation into an abstract way the t u equals ru hat so where t u is given by this formula so we try to use Then we try to use an inverse function serum to find more solution. So we compute the linearization of t at a given function. This is given, its linearization is given by this formula. Now we can establish the following result in terms of CE deformation. I mean the CR conformal equivalent. Come see a conformal equivalent deformation. So let M be a compact pseudo-humision manifold. Then for the negative Yamabi constant case, the CEC dot consists of all smooth functions, which is negative somewhere. For this case, the second case, the CECLA consists of two sets. The first is a zero. is a zero. Next is all smooth function which changes sign on m for the third case the positive Yamabi constant C theta consists all a smooth function which is positive somewhere. So in following we will only give a sketch of the proof for the first result but the other Result. The other two cases can be treated in a similar way. So, first, we know that this case we have a Yamabi solution. So, for any positive constant C, that you wouldn't be a Yamabi solution, which attains the negative constant scalar curvature. So, you wouldn't be a solution of this equation. Ulimpia solution of this equation. We need the following inverse function theorem for the sub electric operator. So if we are lucky that T prime U0 is invertible, then we can find a solution in the neighborhood of U0. That means exist a small episode such that for NAF in epsilon neighbor of TUZ. of t u z u zero there is a solution of the equation however in general we don't have this property for for the this travel solution in some sense then we can establish a perturbation number this lambda enables us to find positive positive function u1 which is actually close to u0 such that its linearization is invertible so as a result t u1 can be actually close to tu0 so we try to apply inverse function theorem at u1 So now we needed to check if the prescribed function belongs to our epsilon neighborhood of U1. However, this is of course not the case in general. So following the idea of constant one, we can use the different morphism group action to move this prescribed function, try to move it to the to the epsilon neighborhood of Tu1. This can be done there is a criterion if and only if T U1, the value belongs to this interval, a minimum and maximum. So now let's consider the condition of our theorem. If ru hat is negative somewhere, then we can find a constant c such that the minus c such that the minus C belongs to this interval. Since the perturbation lamb enable us to find T u1 close actually to C minus C, then T U1 belongs to this interval. Now hence we can apply inverse function C L at u1. So using the diffomorphism to move the header. To move Lu hat to a neighborhood of U1, then we can prove that Lu hat belongs to C E zeta. I skipped the detail about the converse direction. In the above argument, we get a weak solution by using the inverse function theorem. To get a smooth solution, we need using the we need using the shoes regularity result for quasi-second order sub-library equations. There is a simple color of the above result. For all three cases, we find that this set of functions contains a common subset that those functions which change signs on M. With change signs on M. So let M be a compact pseudo-commission manifold. So if a row hat changes sign on M, then we can conclude that row hat belongs to CE theta. So thank you for your attention. Good. So thank you. Thank you, Professor Don's very let's talk some questions and comments. Yes, I have a question. Yes, I have a question. Yeah, so have you, I mean for the PC problem, have you considered the prescribed function is a sign tangent for PC problem? Yeah, at present we are unable to prove such changing sine function for the PC process. The PC properly. Yeah. Probably this is there is some necessary condition, right? Yes, there's a reminding case. There's some, I guess, there's some necessary condition. Not always solvable, right? Yes, not always solvable. But we can only establish our existence for the negative smooth function. Uh, smooth function this gives a simple way to trying to generalize the host result. Yeah, this is our purpose, but we don't know how to treat the more general function which changing sign. Okay, so more questions so if a lot more more questions. So, if allow more questions comments, let us thank it, Professor Yu Chin Boon's talk.
