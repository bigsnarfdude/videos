We start with a reminder what I did yesterday. At first, we constructed for any topological space a rational differential graded commutative algebra, which is a replacement of the Replacement of the algebra of differential forms that we know in smooth manifolds, but this applies to any topological space. And the crucial property is that the cohomology algebra of this co-chain algebra is isomorphic to the rational cohomology of X. The nice feature is that this algebra, the multiplication is. Algebra or the multiplication is graded commutative, which is not the case in the singular co-chain complex. Then, secondly, we studied a particular situation, namely a principal vibration over a space base B, which is classified by a map into an iron-bechnic-lane space. For group pi, which is finitely generated abelian. And so over this Eimacli-Lane space, we have the Python fibration with contractual total space and fiber, a k-pi k-space. So, this is the situation that appears in the inductive step if we write down a Posnikov decomposition of a space which is simple. And in this case, we can relate the commutative code chain models of E, B, and the fiber. And this was what I called the Hirsch lemma. It says that It says that we get a map from the co-chain algebra of B tensored with the three differential grade commutative algebra over the dual space. Of this abelian group, so the homomorphisms to Q rated in degree K. And here we have the code chain representative of the mapping used in cohomology. So remember that F represents a cohomology class with coefficients high on B in degree k plus one, which is the primary obstruction. The primary obstruction to finding a section of this fibration, and because we have fiber k1 space, this is the only obstruction. And so the homology, the rational homology of this space in degree k plus 1 is exactly given by the homomorphism from pi to q. And yesterday we saw that this differential graded commutative algebra is exactly graph is exactly the homology ring of the fiber k pi k with coefficients q and from this algebra we get a map to the commutative co-chains on e which induces an isomorphism in homology so um So, one interpretation is that we, instead of writing down the spectral sequence and studying the E2 term, which involves the homology of E and the base B and the fiber of it and the transgressive differential, we have now a description of this situation on the cold chain level. And so, I didn't give the proof of this fact. Um, so I didn't give the proof of this fact. Uh, you can read it in the notes. And I prefer a proof, or my preferred proof, uh, uses um the language of simplicial sets, because then we can very nicely use an adjoint functor pair. On the one hand, we have the simplicial differential-graded commutative algebra applied to some space, and on the other side. To some space. And on the other hand, we have a functor which we call the simplicial realization of co-chain complexes. And these two functors are adjoint to each other. And this helps us to construct the map from this algebra into these co-chains. So you can read that in the notes. And I think this proof is somewhat shorter than what we, for example, see in the book by Griffiths Morgan. But in the end, this whole description here and this approach to Retroharm. Description here and this approach to rational homotopy theory is, of course, very much inspired from what's written in with the small differential forms in rational homotopy theory. So if X is simple, meaning that X is path connected, pi one is abelian and acts trivially on the higher homotopy groups, and pi star tensor Q, the rationalized. Of Q, the rationalized homotopy groups are finally generated in all degrees. In this situation, we find a sequence of co-chain algebras where the kth co-chain algebra is constructed. algebra is constructed from the kth minus the k minus first co-chain algebra with a twisted differential and here we again adjoin the free algebra generated by the homeomorphisms of pi to q sitting in degree k and here we get a map to the The four chains on the k stage of the Postikov decomposition. Here we have an inclusion of k minus one, and here we have the corresponding map from the postnikov decomposition of k. So here we have the dual map or the induced map by the kth projection from Projection from xk to xk minus one. And this diagram commutes. And furthermore, these two maps are so these induce isolated homology. And so from this, we From this, we can write down a model. So, this is called a model of the co-chain algebra A script A of X, which is just defined as the collimus of these models. And here we get Get a map to the co-chains on X. This induces an isomorphism in homology, and this algebra here is what we called the Sullivan minimal algebra of X. And it can be computed step by step by joining new generators to the model that we have already constructed. These generators correspond to a basis. Correspond to a basis of this vector space. Very nice description. And now I would like to derive from this code chain models or small code chain models for torus actions. This is what we are interested in. interested in so we take for g the group as one to the r in r torus we take for x a g c download complex which is simple as a topological space so that we can write down the or we can perform this construction here for the space x and x and again pi star of x is finally generated in all degrees for example this is um this is i have to assume that this homotopy groups not the rationalized homotopy groups are finitely generated in all degrees here uh this is the case for example if in any dimension we have just finitely many cells And so now I kind of perform the same construction here, but inside or relative to the base of the Borel vibration. So we get a posnikov decomposition. And now I write it in this way: that I take this vibration, of vibration, and we apply the Posnikov decompositions of this space, of the fiber and the total space, at the same time relative to Bg. And what we get here is then on the right-hand side, I have my space BG all the time. All the time, like this. Then on the left, we have the zeroth stage of the Posnikov decomposition of X. And here I have, I just apply the Posnikov decomposition to the fibers over time. So this means in the middle, I get in the zeroth stage the space VG spaces are equal. These spaces are equal, and here I have an inclusion, and this now can be performed in higher degrees as well. So, this is the projection in the first Posnikov stage. And here I get Xg1. And actually, so this second row is again a vibration with fiber X1 and so on. And so on. So here I get Xg2, and here I get X2P2, etc. And now, so why I'm writing it in this way, the point is that I, I mean, what I could do, I could just write down the Posnikov decomposition and make this construction here for the space Xg rather than X. This is well possible. This is well possible, but we have a better control on the form of this algebra that we get here if we perform this construction along this diagram. So this Postnikov decomposition of Xg relative to Bg. And so what we get from this is By performing this construction here, a commutative diagram with all arrows reversed. So here we get the zeroth stage of constructing a minimal model of x, which is just the rational numbers. Here we get the zero stage of the corresponding construction, but for the space BG. So this algebra I call E0 and this is actually equal to Q also T R, which is equal to the minimal Sullivan model of the space E s1 to the R. So that we have seen yesterday. And these elements here, these generators are sitting in degree two. And I get the first possible. I get the first Postnikov stage and the second Postnikov stage, and so on, and the same in the middle. And here I get these arrows, and here I always have inclusions of this algebra. Okay, so this is the situation that we get here. We get a sequence or we get a tower, which is not just a tower of the single algebras which are constructed for the space X, but in the middle we have these algebras which belong to These algebras which belong to the space Xg could be Borel construction. Now I will apply this construction in a specific situation, namely when we study the toral rank of products of spheres. So, the situation is as follows. We have the theorem, this is well known, classical. Let's take dimensions of spheres and one to n pay. So, let's say that x is a finite. Is a finite TCW complex, which is homotopy equivalent to the product of k spheres of dimension N1 up to dimension NK. And G is the same group as this one. So it's a torus group acting freely. I should have written that. And then the number or the rank of the group that acts must be smaller than or equal to the number of odd degrees mj. And actually, this is a stronger conclusion than any Kalperin conjecture, because if we compute Because if we compute the total Betty number of the space, and this is 2 to the k. And here it's just the number of odd nj. So the even spheres, they do not add anything to the degree of symmetry or to the symmetry rank. Okay, so I I show you the essential steps of the proof of this fact. And this uses this construction of small cold chain models for the Borel space. Of course, it goes up to the top. So we get algebras. algebras E star and n star. So these are differential graded commutative algebras over Q. Both of them are free from certain generators and these I describe now. So we see here that this M must be a minimal Sullivan algebra of the fiber in the Borel construction. And so this we know because Uh, so this we know because I wrote down yesterday in the example the models, the minimal models of odd and even-dimensional spheres. Here we just have a product, and so here we get generators tau one up to tau ke. So this is the number of even mj and then we have eta one up to eta. One up to eta ke. So this is still the number of even nj of even dimensional spheres, and here we have other generators sitting this number of odds, mj. And now I just uh explain so the degrees of these generators to one up to t ke, so these the uh corresponding. Ke, so these correspond to the even njs. The degrees of the sigma one up to sigma k odd correspond to the odd nj's. And here we have additional generators that, if you remember, appear in the minimal model of an even-dimensional sphere, namely the differential of eta j is equal to tau j squared. This is the only differential that we see here. Differential that we see here. And then, secondly, we know that E is just the tensor product of M star with a minimal model, co-chain model of classifying space of S1 to the R. So this is S. The R. So this is as graded commutative algebras. Sorry, I have to write the generators as graded commutative algebras. And so the degree of the Ti is equal to two. But the differential here is not just the product differential. Differential. It is the product, it is just the differential up to higher terms in this polynomial rate. So what we know here is that DE is linear over Q1 up to TR. This is because here the differential is trivial and these maps are co-chain maps. Code chain maps. So the differential is zero of the image of this algebra here. And what we also see here is that these projections are cold chain maps. So the map from E star to M star, which evaluates these generators Ti at zero. So this is a co-chain map. Code chain there. And in this way, we understand the differential in E. Namely, if you take a tensor product of an element in M with some polynomial, say one, then this is the differential that we see in M up to terms of higher degree in this polynomial ring that disappears here. And lastly, the homology. Lastly, the homology of E star is isomorphic to the homology of Xg and in particular it's finite dimensional because the action is free and then the Borel construction is homotopy equivalent to the quotient and now. And now, so how does the proof continue at this point? So, this is now a purely algebraic situation. So, this is all the information that we have. We have An algebra script E, which is a free TCGA over a certain number of generators. And we know its cohomology is finite, finite dimensional. And we have some information about these differentials here. And I claim that with this information, Claim that with this information, it follows that the number of even degree generators in E must be smaller than or equal than the number of odd degree generators. Why is that? So, the intuition is the following. If we have an even degree generator like T1 up to Tr, so these are even co-cycles because the differential is zero. So, these elements represent homology classes and their powers also represent non-zero homology classes up to an arbitrary high power. Up to an arbitrary high power. So we see a polynomial ring contained in the cohomology of E star if these elements are not killed by something else. So if we just take the polynomial ring. But here the differential, the homology must be finite dimensional. And this means that intuitively, all these, I mean, powers of these elements. Powers of these elements must be killed by differentials of odd-degree elements, and we need enough odd-degree elements in order to kill enough of this polynomial algebra. So, this is the idea. So this is then very close to results in commutative algebra. But here, the situation is a little more complicated. And the point is that. And the point is that, for example, the elements tor1 up to tork, so these are even-degree generators, but they do not necessarily represent cohomology classes in the cohomology E-star. So the differential could be non-zero. And therefore, one makes one massages the situation a little bit. And this is an interesting technique which was developed by. Interesting technique which was developed by Halperin in his paper finiteness in the minimal models of Sullivan. So the essential steps are as follows. In step one, we deform the differential in E, which I call the E. These to a new differential and in some way we create new homology classes, namely this new differential vanishes on all the even degree generators on touch. Even degree generators on tau1 up to tau ke, and of course on the generators t1 up to tr as before. So this means I declare all these generators to one up to t ke to be co-cycles in the same way as they are co-cycles in the algebra M already, but maybe not in the algebra and secondly I Secondly, I say what happens to the odd degree generators, like these generators sigma or eta. Yeah, so if you apply a differential to them, then you get an even degree code chain. And this may involve generators of even or odd degree. But we just take But we just take those elements that can be written as monomials and even degree generators. We erase all the odd degree generators artificially. And this means that I declare the differential del V of sigma j to be the projection. I say in a second what projection I mean. And there'll And del of eta j is equal to pi del E of eta j. So this pi evaluates these odd degree generators eta i and sigma eta. sigma beta j and sigma a zero so uh what remains is if we apply this differential to an odd degree generator then we get um a sum of monomials which just involve even degree generators and no odd degree generators have been involved and this is what hyperin calls the construction of a pure tower associated to a given tower so these things are To a given tower. So these things are called towers in this paper. And then in step two, one proves that all the even degree generators that we see here actually represent, I mean, they represent homology classes because this differential vanishes, but actually they represent new potent homology classes. homology classes. So these PI and the class taught taught J's. So these are classes, homology classes in the homology of script E, now with the perturbed differential, and one shows that these classes are neutral. This is good. I mean, somehow we did something bad here. we did something bad here because we created new cohomology in the in this ring here and possibly so this makes this homology infinite dimensional right so this could have happened but it doesn't happen unfortunately these elements still represent nepotent classes homology classes this is a fairly elementary algebraic calculation using the Using the concrete description of these homology algebras together with this differential. So, for example, we see that tor j squared is a co-boundary, of course, up to some element, up to high-degree polynomials in the T1 up to TR. And then one has to analyze this situation, what happens. Analyze this situation, what happens if we pass to this perturbed differential here? But so this situation can be treated ad hoc, and we need not look into the old paper of Python for doing that. So what do we gain here? In particular, the dimension of this homology ring. The ring is still finite dimension. This is good because now we have a situation that we can analyze in the following way. We look at the ideal which is generated by all the differentials applied to odd degree generators in my purified tower. Tau so we have the differential um beta ke and then we have also the off-degree generators sigma one up to sigma k odd. So this is a um an ideal in the polynomial ring. In the polynomial ring, generated by the even-degree generators, because the differential is defined in that way: in T1 up to TR, toll one up to toll KE. And it turns out that now, I mean, the differential on these generators is zero. And so, all these elements that sit in here. All these elements that sit in here are co-cycles. And now we also see which one of those are killed, are zero in the homology, and those that lie in the IB of I. And this means that this quotient of this polynomial algebra by this ideal must be Um, must be finite dimensional because it sits in the homology of E. So this is finite dimensional. And now a fairly direct argument from commutative algebra shows that the number of generators of the ideal I must be at least Must be at least as large as the number of generators in this polynomial ring. So, this is because we can take a minimal prime ideal containing this ideal I in this polynomial ring. And when we divide this out, then we have a finite dimensional vector space by this condition here and a principal ideal domain. So, this must be then the ideal generated by all these generators here, which has height. has height R plus Ke. So by the crew height theorem, we know that the number of generators of this ideal must be at least as big as the number of generators in this polynomial ring. And this means that we get K E plus K O is larger than or equal. Larger than or equal to R plus KE. And this implies our calculate, this implies our claim that R is at least as large as KO, the number of odd-dimensional spheres. And I mean, this argument works fairly directly. You can read it in the notes. It is actually so this theory. It is actually so. This theorem is a special case of a more general fact that one proves using these small cold chain models for torus actions. And this involves the so-called homotopy Euler characteristic. So we take the sum with sine plus and minus of the dimensions of the rationalized homotopy groups of our space, assuming that the sum is finite. Uh, the sum is finite, we have a well-defined number, and then a theorem of Halperin, proven in his paper about uh finiteness in the minimal models of Sullivan, says that the symmetry rank or the toral rank is bounded above by minus this homotopy Euler characteristic. And now, if you analyze the situation, we see that for each even-dimensional sphere, we have an even and an odd-degree generator. So this. An odd degree generator, so this doesn't add anything to the homotopy Euler characteristic. Whereas for odd-degree odd-dimensional spheres, we get a generator in this odd dimension, which gives us a minus one. And so the negative of the homotopy Euler characteristic of this thing is exactly the number of all-dimensional spheres. And so, this theorem that I proved here is a special case of the theorem of Halperin, but here we can. Of Halperin, but here we can give a more direct proof. And I mean, it's well worth studying. The paper of Halperin is very interesting. I think it's a really great and important paper, but it's really subtle. It's quite technical, and one can avoid most of the technicalities here. Okay, so now we have the degree of symmetry or the toral rank of products of spheres. And now I would like to pass to the To pass to the P-core rank of products of spheres. And so this is the third chapter, Jenkins-Porter theorem. And the initial observation is that if we take as the group G, now the elementary abelian P group of rank R, and we want to study free G space. Free R free G spaces, then we observe that the rational homology of this space is equal to zero, right? Because this is a finite group. And so we cannot work with rational coefficients here. We should rather work with coefficient rings where the prime p has not been inverted. And now we have to analyze and we have to understand what may go wrong in our different. What may go wrong in our different steps of our construction? And so let's go through these steps point by point, namely in the Sullivan algebra, so we can still write down polynomial forms and we can also consider polynomial forms with non-rational coefficients. Not with rational coefficients, but maybe with integral coefficients whatsoever. But in the Sullivan-De-Ram integration that passes from the Sullivan-De Ram algebra to the singular co-chain complex, so this creates denominators. For example, the integral over the interval. Over the interval 0, 1, which we consider as the one simplex of the form t to the n t to the k minus 1 dt is equal to 1 over k. Right? So this polynomial here, this form has integral coefficients, but after integration, we have a denominator here. And so at this point, there is not much hope that we can. There is not much hope that we can describe the integral singular co-chain complex by means of these polynomial forms, because the integration map, the comparison map doesn't preserve this integrality of the coefficients. But there is a very interesting result due to Jenkel and Porter from the 80s. And this says that if you are a little bit more This says that if you are a little bit more careful in this construction, then you can describe even the integral homology of a space using polynomial forms. And this has to do with understanding what denominators are created here. And we see here this depends on this power, this exponent here, which is k minus one. And so let's define the weight. The weight of a polynomial form on the n-simplex. So we have t0, alpha 0, dt0, epsilon 0. And we have t n alpha n d t n epsilon n. So alpha, the alpha i are non-negative exponents and the epsilon i And the epsilon i, they are numbers either zero or one. And I define the weight of such a form as the maximum of overall i of alpha i plus eta i. And now if the weight of the form is smaller than or equal to q, To Q, then it turns out that if you take the integral of such a form over either the interval or even a cube of some dimension, then this is a number contained in Q, little Q, and this is equal to Z, and we invert all primes smaller than or equal to. Smaller than or equal to yeah, so this um it's interesting. So, even if you integrate a product using the Fubini theorem, then you just multiply numbers in this ring here. So, this is fine. And then, so what Schenkel and Porter do, they define a replacement of the Placement of the Salivan-Deram algebra of a space X. So remember, this is the Salivan-Deram algebra of the space X, but now they introduce as a second parameter filtration degree. And this algebra consists of forms on singular simplices in. Singular simplices in X of weight at most Q, but of some degree. And actually, from a technical point of view, one has to work with the cubical decomposition of these simplices. This is a very important technical point in the paper by Chenkel and Porter. And then it turns out that, so we have our integration map. Which goes to the singular co-chain complex of X with coefficients Q, little Q. And the induced map in cohomology then is an isomorphism. So this is an isomorphism. So this is an isomorphism for all q at least one. Okay, so this is quite amazing since, for example, I mean, sure, if such a form should give a non-zero number here, then the form must be. Um, the form must be a form of degree n. So we have n okay, so I could take some k here. This is not the same n as as we have here. Some form of degree k. And it is very well possible just by taking the product of dt0 up to dtk to have a form of weight one, which gives a non-zero number here. Which gives a non-zero number here. And so, this whole setting makes sense. And so, we can describe the homology, even with integral coefficients, by this co-chain complex. Why do I say co-chain complex? Because we have a multiplication here still, but the multiplication map, this adds degrees, weights, not just degrees, but also weights. If you multiply two such forms, then the new form has The new form has weight smaller than or equal to the sum of the weights of the single forms. And so this must be taken care of. But if we do that, then this is compatible with the multiplication map of forms. So we have a multiplication of forms of weight. Of forms of weight q1, and then we have forms of weight q2, and they give forms of weight q1 plus q2, or weight at most q1, at most q2, and so on. So, this gives actually, so this weight thing gives a filtration. We have a weight filtration on this co-chain algebra, and by definition, in weight, if we take filtration. In weight, if we take flaturation degree Q, we consider polynomials of weight at most Q with coefficients in this ring. So if we pass to higher weights or to higher filtration, you've been muted. We have to. What are we going to do? I think everybody can. I see. They're trying to fix it and they put it in the face. Hello, yeah, you can hear me. Okay, great. Okay, um, good. So, this is a very clean statement. It's the best that we can hope for because of the nature of this integration here, right? So, this is exactly what we can say with coefficients different from Q. So, again, maybe this was muted. So, infiltration degree Q. It so infiltration degree Q by definition, this algebra consists of polynomial forms of any degree but of a weight at most Q with coefficients in this ring here. And if we pass to higher filtration, then more and more primes are inverted. And this means if we multiply forms, then we have to pass to a Q with a higher little Q. So this is the first thing. This is the change in auto. change the bottom four and now we need to look at a good replacement of the hirsch lemma and here we have um a new fact that has to be taken into account namely if you recall then for If you recall, then for the Hirsch lemma, we used the computation of the Einbeck-McLean spaces for finitely generating abelian groups with rational coefficients. But now if we want to pass to other coefficients, then such a simple description is no longer possible. Possible. And this is because, again, looking at the papers by Caton and Ser, if P is a prime, then the homology ring of an Ironbeck-McLane space, say of the This is a free differential graded commutative algebra over Fp, one generator in degree K, but unfortunately only up to a certain degree, namely up to degree namely up to degree k plus two pi minus one p minus one minus one. Why is that? This is because the so if you compute this commodity with Fb coefficients, elements in this ring are stable commology operations or commodity operations here and unstable commodities. And unstable commodity operations. And so we have the first reduced power operation, steamroll power operation for the prime p. And this raise is degrees by 2 times p minus 1. So we get new generators in degrees K plus 2 times P minus 1 and higher degrees. But below that degree, we still have the oldest equation. And so this means that our favorite computation from yesterday, namely, From yesterday, namely that the uh so if we are interested in the homology of these of this Einbeck-McLane space with coefficients q little q then this is again isomorphic to free algebra over qq generated by a vector space equal to the homomorphism from pi to q. Q sitting in degree K, but only up to degree K plus 2p minus 3. This means if we work with a fixed coefficient ring, QQ, then we can control the homology of these building blocks in the fibers of these principal fibrillations. Fibers of these principal vibrations that we are interested in in the Hirsch lemma up just up to a certain degree. This is all we can, all we have here. So there is no chance to write a Hirsch lemma in this situation, which looks as simple as the Hirsch lemma for rational coefficients. And so I just describe roughly what we get here. Here. So with coefficients q into q, the map F gamma F in the Hirsch lemma can just be can only be an isomorphism up to a certain degree which I call K of K. K of Q. So, this is a degree which depends on little Q. And in the best of all worlds, and this is actually the case, the best we can hope for is that if we let a Q go to infinity, then these degrees also go to infinity. So, this is the best we can hope for, and such a theorem. such a theorem such a theorem actually holds so we have um a kind of tame hirsch lemma and you can look in the literature for a precise formulation of this theorem and a proof it's a pretty technical And approve. It's pretty technical because one has to introduce filtration functions and one has to make sure that the state of Q, up to which degree we can control this isomorphism or the algebra that we are interested in, this has to be adjusted in such a way that later on we can move along the Postenkov decomposition as we did in the rational, in the case of rational coefficients. And for this, And for this, one has to choose a very subtle or delicate filtration function, as we call it, to make sure that this also. So this filtration function says this is more or less this K of Q, up to which degree we want to control certain commodity G rings in this Hilsch lemma. But the most important point is really this one. Important point is really this one that with coefficients different from q, this computation just holds up to a certain degree. And when we put this all together, then we can compute the stable free rank of symmetry of products of spheres. This is a theorem of mine of two thousand nine. So So we let we take the group Z mod P to the R. Then we take a finite GCW complex, finite free GCW complex, which is homotopy equivalent to a product of k-spheres. And then If P is large enough with respect to the dimension of this CW complex or this space of the product of spheres, then the number of so the rank of this group is bounded above by the number of odd dimensional spheres. Spheres in this product. And in fact, P bigger than three times the dimension is sufficient. And so in the proof, in the proof, we work, we construct a We construct a model E star. This is a free differential grade of commutative algebra over FP, which looks as follows. So E is again the tensor product of a minimal Of a minimal model of the product of spheres, which looks exactly the same as before. And now we have a polynomial algebra in even degree generators over Fp, but the homology ring over Fp of the classifying space of this group also has odd degree generators. So those also have to be taken into account. So this is. So, this is these are generators in degree one. And the differential on this algebra is linear over the tensor product of this polynomial ring and the exterior algebra. And again, the projection onto M is a co-chain map. This is all the same and And then I also have the fact that each monomial in the T1 up to TR of degree at least dimension of X plus one represents the zero class represents the zero class. Represents the zero class in the homology of this algebra. However, and this is now the big difference, this algebra is not isomorphic anymore to the homology of the Borel construction of Xg in high degrees. So this is in high degrees. In high degrees. And this is due to the fact that we saw already here. If you just write down this simple algebra that we see here, this describes this cohomology just up to a certain degree. And this is exactly the same situation here. So we have this algebra which has a simple structure, but it does only describe the homology ring of our Borre construction. Of our Borre construction up to a certain degree. And now the situation is almost the same as in the case of actual torus actions. The first step is that we take this algebra E star and divide out the algebra generated by the S1 up to SR generator. So the differential is linear over those anyway. And so if we divide this out, then we have a new algebra, which I again call script E. Which I again call script E. And then exactly the same steps in the proof that I gave here for computing the toral rank of products of spheres applies. So one deforms the differential to a differential curly E, script E on script E and shows that these elements here represent Neil Potenteen homology classes. Represent deep protein homology classes. So the homology ring of this is still finite dimensional. And then we consider the same ideal. So the S's have been erased anyway. And then I apply the same commutative algebra argument, not over polynomial rings over Q, but over polynomial ring over F. And so this grid, this approximation. This description, this approximative description of our chromology ring of the Eilegmicler of this Borel construction here up to a certain degree is enough to run this argument here. And so this proves the stable that the stable free rank or stable free P rank of a product of spheres is equal to the number of odd dimensional spheres in this product. Spheres in the product. But as we see here, this method does not tell us anything for small primes p. And so there is still a lot to do in this direction, as we already saw in the talk by Alejandros. And so I thank you for your attention and would like to finish at this point. Are there any questions from the online participants? Yes, I have a question. Hello, Bernard. So this technique of bounding the symmetry rank by the omotibi-Eula characteristic, it applies to more spaces in the rational case, right? So for instance, you can prove the total rank conjecture for compact homogeneous spaces using this. So do your techniques generalize to give like Generalize to give like stable p versions for more general, yeah. This can be uh, this is very likely. Um, I mean, I mean, I make an indication in my paper, I never worked out the details. Um, I think so. So, one has to study the paper of halperins to a kind of larger extent than I did last time, a couple of years ago. And I'm pretty sure that then you get a similar. And you get a similar upper bound of the stable P rank in terms of the homotopy Euler characteristic computed over the rationals. So this should work. Yes. So this is very likely. Actually, let me point out before I forget it, there is an annoying type in my notes. So I removed it where in the notes, I wrote that the cohology of this thing is isomorphic to this cohomology. But this is exactly wrong. Is exactly wrong, yeah. Right. So, so, um, we have to keep that in mind if we work with these coefficients, and this just holds up to a certain, yeah. And right, yeah, so I hopefully I answered your question. Yes, you did. Any more questions? Bernard, I missed what you said about why this homology of Easter is finite dimensional. still is finite dimensional um of this of this thing here yeah yeah um of course i um i didn't really give the proof here of this fact that um uh these uh these two homology classes generated by Ti and tor J, these are homology classes with this perturbed differential. So these are Neopotent classes. So this can be proven. So, this can be proven. So, we prove that if we raise this to a certain power, and this represents zero in this homology ring. And now, if, okay, let's see, if we now we can study all the monomials that can possibly represent non-zero classes in here. And we see that these monomials, so that the exponents that occur here for the ti and the tor j. The Ti and the Tau J, so they must be bounded because these elements are nil potent. And so the odd degree generators generate something finite dimensional anyway because of the graded commutativity. So we know that the square of the sigma j's and the square of the eta j's is zero in this homology. And so once we know that these even degree generators are nilpotent, rather than creating Than creating or generating polynomial sub-algebras, than we are in business. So that works even in characteristic P. Yes. Okay, that's what I guess. Thank you. Yeah, so concerning characteristic P, to which extent could one maybe try to run this machine where you instead of sort of free commutative to free in E infinity or something like that to? Yeah, I mean, it would, of course, be. Yeah, I mean, it would of course be the next step. I haven't really thought about that. I mean, people have studied, as far as I know, good algebraic descriptions of homology rings with even with integral coefficients, passing to this kind of higher homotopy notions. And I'm not sure what kind of applications we have of this theory in the theory. This theory in the theory of group actions for, say, elementary abelian p groups. I know that, for example, Leo and co-authors have maybe worked in that direction. I don't know, where you look at A infinity algebras and so on. But maybe this goes in a different direction than this one. I don't know if one, if anybody has used these. Has used these kind of more complicated code chain models that we see if we do not want to invert all the primes for calculating or estimating P ranks of spaces. But maybe I'm not just up to date concerning the literature, and maybe someone else in the audience can say more about that. Yeah, I mean, probably, yeah. I mean, probably, I mean, so Mendel's theorem and things like that didn't have a lot of applications early on, but somehow this technology is progressing fast. So it might be. Sure. I mean, in the end, I mean, that's the basic philosophy of algebraic topology, of course. We reduce our original problem to an algebraic situation that we can handle. And here, if we work in the spirit of rational homology, In the spirit of rational homotopy theory, we get these commutative code chain models, which are very small algebras, just free algebras generated by some elements whose degree we understand. And so we can then directly apply methods from commutative algebra to the situation. And in this respect, it's exactly the philosophy of algebra topology that we apply here. By the way, I should mention that in the book of Olde in Puppet about About transformation groups. There are two chapters, two and four, which explain the rational homotopy theory and its applications to total rank estimates in a very nice way. But again, let me stress this or say this again. In my talks yesterday and today, I really wanted to emphasize that most of rational homotopy theory Most of rational homotopy theory, especially the equivalence of the rational category or the homotopy theory of rational spaces and commutative graded differential graded commutative algebras, the equivalence of categories is really not needed here. So most of kind of the great theorems in rational homotopy theory are not needed here. What I need here is the method. Need here is the method how to write down a relatively small co-chain model. That's all. And this is the Sullivan-Diram algebra plus the Hirsch lemma plus the Posnikov decomposition. That's all we need. And this is maybe even if you look at the paper in the book of Aule and Puppe, so they also mention all the other theorems of rational homology. All the other theorems of rational homotopy theory. And so one is maybe a little overwhelmed at this point. And here I want to encourage you to just concentrate on the aspects that are needed for estimating oral ranks of spaces. I had maybe a second question. Like, so, so in your so so in in your theorem and and the old theorem of alprin it it it helperin it's only the um it's only the even dimensional spheres which play a role what is what is
