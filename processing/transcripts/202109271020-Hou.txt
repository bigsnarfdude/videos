The three D Euler equations and the nearly singular behavior of the three Navier-Stokes. Thank you. Thank you. Now, I would like to thank the organizer for inviting me to this very interesting workshop. And today, I want to report a joint work with some of my previous collaborators, including Dr. Guo Luo, my current PhD student, Judge Chen, and my former. Judge Chen and my former PhD student De Huang, who just finished last year. So, for this audience, I don't need to say too much about the background of the 3D Euler on our equation. And Menwa just gave a very good introduction and background to the 3D 2D and 3D Euler equation. So, this is the 3D incompressible Navisto equation. So, use the 3D velocity field, piece of pressure. Velocity field piece of pressure, and if you had the viscous turn, that's the Navy still equation. So, incompressibility is reflected by the fact that velocity field is divergent free. And if you define the vorticity as the curve of velocity field, then your vorticity is satisfied by this equation. So in three-dimensional case, you get the extra water stretching term, which is absent in the two-dimensional case. So you can recover the velocity field from the vorticity through the Birasois law. The Bio-Soir law, but grading U, it is at the same order as the vorticity through the Wies transform. So grading U can be formally bounded from above and below by the vorticity in Lp0. So formally, this is a quadratic non-linearity. And for that reason, many people conjecture that the 3D Euler on our stow equation may be. Narcissual equation may develop a finite time singularity for large initial data. Okay, so for that. Okay, so there have been a number of theoretical studies for both 3D Euler and Euler equation. For the 3D Nausel equation, global regularity is only known for small initial data, small in this sense, either LP for p greater than 3 or in this product, which is dimensionless. A product which is dimensionless. And there was various number of criteria due to various people like protein and survey. They impose this condition on the velocity field. If the L P norm in space and LQ norm in time, if P and Q satisfy this inequality, then there's no problem. So basically, this condition in the critical case was proved us later, figure three. This basically, this condition ensures that you can treat this non-linear term as. Can treat this non-linear term as a perturbation of the heat equation, the diffusion equation in some sense. So there's a well-known partial vagarity result due to Verico-Muumber, and there's a simplified proof by Fan Hua Lin, which say that the host of dimension of the singularity set, associated with singularity set in space-time, has measured dimension zero. So 3D Euler, there's a well-known Builkaddon-Meidat criterion, which is say that the solution, if the solution Say that the solution, if the solution blows in finite time, then what this has to blow up more will have to blow up in this fashion. So, my earlier work was inspired by the work with Konstantin Fevereman-Meider in 1996. So, they pointed out the importance of the vorticity vector. If you have some regularity in this fashion, in the domain that in the order one region that contains a maximum vorticity, plus the condition the velocity remains bounded, and there is no finite time singularity. Finite time singularity. So we derive with Jen Deng and my former PC student Sing Ma Yui, we derived a Lagrangian version of this result, which is more localized in space. So we replace this condition, geometric gravity, by this condition on a water-slide filament that contains a maximum vorticity, but the arc length of this filament can collapse to a point at a single time. And then we place this condition by the velocity, maximum velocity along this. Maximum velocity along this water slide segment is time integral in time. There's some very exciting results due to Terry L. Guindi two years ago, where he proved a surprise result that's really as a symmetric Euler equation with a very low regularity class, C alpha, with alpha very, very small, has no blow-up, it has finite times regularity for initial vertices have no small, which the reason is surprising because if you have a C C1 initial. C1 initial data for TCD, we know there's no for 3D systemic oil with no smoke, it cannot borrow in finite time. There has been various result effort, people trying to look for a numerical evidence for finite time singularity. This is a partial list of a lot, a very long list of effort in the past two, three decades. And in particular, I mentioned a result by Bocker, which provides strong evidence. Provide strong evidence that two and the parallel vortex two may develop a finite time singularity. And together with Ruo Lee in 2006, we tried to reproduce a bulk curves result using the highly spectral method. And we observed only a double exponential growth. So in 2014, with my formal postdoc law, so we presented a new scenario for potential Euler singularity. So basically, the singularity So basically, the singularity occurs at the stagnation point. So, and it is asymmetric. And the present of the boundary is very important. So, basically, the singularity is driven by large swap. So, initial condition, it says large swap in the angular velocity field, but the other two velocity field is set to zero. So, this is the geometry. So, you have a solid boundary at argument one periodic in z direction. This is an odd symmetry in the angular velocity, angular stream function, and angular velocity field. Velocity field. So the top flow swirling downward and the bottom one swirling upward create a compression along the boundary. And the singularity occurs right here at R equal 1 and Z equals 0. So then if you try to fit whether or not the growth rate of maximum TC satisfy the view-catalider block criteria, then you see that actually blow up in the rate with an exponent gamma 2.45. So then it's not integrable. Four five, so then it's not integral in time. So, in the same paper that we proposed, a simplified one-dimensional model at arg1, which is the boundary, boundary played a very essential role, and also the offsymmet along the boundary as a function of z played a very important role in generating a stable blow-up at this symmetric point. So, if you let omega theta to be omega and then u theta. Omega and then u theta squared to be a rho. So you can divide like a one-dimensional Business equation along the boundary R1. And then you can use this reduced Bureau-Star law to close the system. And this is a completely well-posed system. Okay. So together with Kisilev and his former two-post doctor Choi and Yao Yao and Vladimir Sverek, and so we have been able to prove this one-dimensional. Dimensional HR model develop finite time singularity with smooth initial data. So, for some time after that, we found that this dwarf scenario is very robust. Various people are trying to develop further theoretical result, including Kisela-Seric. They prove this 2D Euler equation, the gradient of vorticity, can achieve maximum growth rate of double exponential in time. So, we would like to see if we can. So, we would like to see if we can prove this scenario vigorously by using a more computer-assisted approach. So, we would like to derive it using a dynamic scaling approach. Some people call it the modulation technique. So, basically, you want to introduce a scaling parameter, Cl, which is stretch the support of the blow-up support. Then you have a focusing blow-up, then the support of the vorticity will collapse to a point in space. So, you want to So, you want to this is a 2D boostness equation use that as an example to illustrate the idea. So, you introduce a stretching parameter Cl so that you want to have a maintainer finite support and introduce a diameter parameter so that the vorticity will not block in infinity by the blow singularity time but remain a finite amplitude. So, basically by introducing this stretching parameter C L and the damping parameter C omega and C rho. So, we would like to turn the question of finite time cell similar blob into the Of finite time cell simulablum into the existence of this steady and then non-trivial steady state of the dynamic rescaling equation by rescale the time as well. That's tau go to infinity. Then if this has a non-trivial steady state, and after appropriate rescaling, you will recover a cell similar profile for the 2D Pussiness equation in the physical space. And this rescaling parameter has to satisfy a linear relationship to be equivalent to the original 2D Pussiness equation in the physical space. So let me briefly outline this. So, let me briefly outline the strategy. So, basically, you have two dynamic variables: the T C and the density, for the 2D boost net. You can write it as a dynamical system. Of course, the right-hand side consists of abrasion turn, the water stretching turn. It's a non-local quadratic naninear functional, it's functional V. Of course, we don't know whether or not this dynamic scaling equation has an untrue status, say, as to the scaling time to infinity, right? But you can compute it. But you can compute it because we from our experience that the blow-up, the cell signal blow-up seems to be very robust. So, you can using a high-order numerical method, since after the viscading, the profile becomes smooth, does not blow up. So, you can resolve the, you can obtain an approximate cell similar profile we call V-bar with a very small residue, like a 10 to minus A, 10 to the minus 10, depends on how much resolution you can afford. So, that is the starting point you have. So, after you genuinely measure. point you have so you after you generate numerical profile you can interpolate in the whole space using some numerical basis and then you would like to construct a perturbation so that the sum of the two becomes the exact solution of the dynamic scaling equation you can derive the equation for u tilde which is the perturbation so you have a linearized term linearized around the approximate steady state which we have control and then you have a quadratic and linear term because the non-linearity for the 2d personnel or 3d or only is quadratic in nature and this Is quadratic in nature. And this is the residual error due to the approximate steady state. So then you would like to analyze the linear stability. From if you drop this linear term, drop the error term, that is, you want to see whether or not the approximate steady state has some kind of stability. You also want to analyze the linear stability due to this weak quadratic nanovity. So the key difficulty is to establish linear stability for linearized operator around V-bar. Operator around V-bar using some weighted soft left norm. And we have a damping term. Stability means that you have some, it's like attractor, right? You have some positive lambda here, so that you can come damping when you do energy estimate. And you have non-linear stability, it means the coordinate linear term can be bounded by the same norm bounded by the square of the perturbation multiplied by a finite constant. And then you can write this perturbation using the ohmo principle, using this linear and linear stability. You can turn this. The linear stability, you can turn this into a groundwork-like inequality due to the damping of the linear by so operator. So, if the initial perturbation are in a small energy ball of radial A, A is the same order as epsilon, A has to satisfy this inequality. And then using a bootstrap argument, you can show the perturbation can never leave this energy ball because of the time being here, right? So that you can prove this is true for all time, which is sufficient to prove the existence of a singularity, finite time singularity. Finite time singularity. Furthermore, if you can also differentiate this perturbation in time to kill this error term, this error is time-independent, v-bar is time-independent, then you can further show that actually the solution will converge to a exact steady state as the tau go to infinity. So that is the whole accent of this approach. So using this idea, we have been able to prove three results. This result published in CPA. These results published in CPAM early this year. This for the 1D degrigori model. So basically, it's like it's a more complicated Constantine Fefferman, Constantine-Lex-Meiter model. You add the advection term here. When this coefficient is going to one, there's a tremendous cancellation between the advection and the word adjustment term. So when you have a periodic boundary condition, a lot of people conjecture there's no finite time singularity, right? But we proved that when you work on the whole line, the whole, whole, whole, whole wheel line, Whole whole whole wheel line. There will exist a compact C infinity initial data with compact support that will develop an expanding self-similar block solution in finite time, which is kind of surprising. And inspired by the work of Terry El Guindi, so we are trying to prove the scenario that Golo and I computed back in 2014. So we work on a very weak class of initial data, a C1 alpha initial velocity with finite energy. So we're using the machinery I just described. So we are I just described. So we have been able with Jaja Chen with this paper published in Communication Mathematical Physics earlier this year. We showed that for a family of C1-alpha initial data, we'll find out energy in the personal boundary. So this is completely driven by large SWAR. It's very different from the work of L Guindi, which have no SWOR. So then you develop a finite time signal for both a 2D Business and a 3D as a symmetric Euler equation. So we are currently. So, we are currently making an effort to try to see if we can do it for C-infinity initial data with finite energy, like the one that we use with computer with Gore Law. So, we are making a lot of progress. In particular, we posted a paper in June for the 1D HR model that I mentioned earlier, which is along agreement one. So, by using this philosophy, you can construct approximate steady state and analyze the linear and linear stability. So, we're currently trying to extend this. So, we're currently trying to extend this idea to the 2D Business equation with smooth initial data, and we have made a lot of progress, but modular some technical difficulty we need to still need to track. So, we hope that we'll be able to succeed in closing the gap for the COC infinity initial data with final energy in the present boundary. Okay, in the remaining time of my talk, I want to before some recent computation that I did in these two paper I posted. In these two papers, I posted on the archive in the middle of July. So, the work I talked, I mentioned earlier, relies very essentially on the present of the boundary and some symmetry along the z direction. So, but that singularity, that singular scenario computed by Golo and myself does not survive the viscosity regularization because the partial vectority results say that in the asymmetric scenario, That in the asymmetric scenario, the 3D non-still, the singularity, any potential singularity must occur at r equals zero. So we would like to try to look for another block scenario in the interior domain, not rely on the present boundary. We failed with many, many attempts because it turns out that there's a strong stabilizing effect due to the avection and water structuring. There's competition between the avection turn and water stretching turn. So when you get very close to Internet, so when you get very close to the eye of zero, then you find a way to escape. So, uh, so we use this formulation that we always use: that we introduce a change variable. So, u theta, omega theta, and posi theta are the angular velocity, angular velocity, angular strain function. There must be an off-function of r as long as the solution is smooth. So, you can make this change variable, you get the equivalent set of equation. So, we use a very simple initial data, which is completely driven by Lars War. So, it's a tense, it's a tensor product. So it's a tense, it's a tensor product function of R, which have rapid decay at R to one. So we penalize the effect at the boundary. So we want to favor a block at R to zero. This is an R function in Z, periodic in Z, right? Very similar in some set, in some sense, similar to the kind of initial condition that Golo and I use, except that we favor, we penalize the boundary, because we do not want to have a singularity at the boundary. So we impose a very rapid decay. You impose a very rapid decay at Ranaging very rapidly. So the main driving mechanism for this potential new Euler singularity is due to two anti-symmetric water stipends. So this is the flow field of the in R and Z direction. So two anti-symmetric water vorticity, this omega theta, and then you generate a negative velocity radio velocity field to push the Velocity radio velocity field to push the solution towards argument zero, right, instead of pushing towards argument one, right? So, this is this schematic flow that is like a hyperbolic flow. And if you look at this, the first quadrant, right? So, the flow rapidly pushed down near Argo zero and then get pushed away from zero zero, right? So, because it cannot hit the wall, like Argo zero is like an impenetrable wall, right? So, this is the maximum position of The maximum position of U1. So that is very important scenario. There's a circulation zoom here, right? The float over here with being transported, pushed towards zero zero to create a large gradient because the off function is function of z. And then events get sufficiently close to zero zero and they get transported by the negative radio velocity field. And then it's like a relay run, right? So you relay race. This guy first pushes the flow very close to z equals zero. Very close to zero zero, create a very large gradient for u theta, and then it this anti-symmetric water stipulation will carry the flow, generate a negative velocity field, radio velocity field, and then we push the flow towards the origin. If this does not push high enough, we get pushed away from zero zero, right? We'll not settle down at the origin. So many of my previous attempts, we're trying to get very close to the symmetry axis, and then it slips away. And then it slips away. Then you don't get a stable, a sustainable cell signal focusing mechanism. So, this shows you the cross-section of U1 and Poisson sub Z. This we call this the equation for the U1 and the omega 1. So, the water stretch in turn is reflective for U1 is reflected by this product, right? So, this R cross section, you can see that it generates a traveling wave that the permanence of C is relatively flat near R0, right? So, then they lift up this. Right, so then they lift up this value for u1 between either zero and the maximum of u1 to generate a traveling weight. And then beyond the maximum u1, you can see percentage of z drop rapidly, become negative. So it pushes down to generate a traveling weight. So then Nanino water stretching term itself already generates a traveling way pushing towards R0. In addition, that the radial velocity also generates pushing the flow close to R0. Close to R zero. But the rate, the Z direction has the opposite effect because the Z direction, as you get close to the R to zero, the transport, the X flow is trying to push away from zero, zero, right? So we want it to stay close to the origin. We don't want to be transported away, right? So then you can see these alignments become very important. So the maximum percentage of this is always achieved at zero, zero. You can somehow show it. So you can see the stability. somehow show it so you can see it's a relative flat region and then it again has the effect of lift after u1 near between near zero right so then then it as it achieves the maximum and that has a sudden drop and become become negative right so then so the nanin water stretching generate a water trolling wave but push the flow the maximum u1 along the z direction towards zero that's how it maintains the large gradient or u1 here right that generate a large vorticity u omega one through Vorticity, u omega 1, through the gradient of U1, right? So you can see that there's a strong competition between the traveling weight induced rather than water stretching for the U1, and then there's an upward transport to push the U1 away from 0, 0. Okay, so that's why we were able to generate a trolling wave that's the potential singularity that eventually approaching to the origin. Approaching to the origin. Sorry, this is a car alarm outside. Hope it will stop soon. Okay, then you try to monitor how fast the U1, maximum U1, omega 1, and Mautistic grow as a function of time, right? So you can see that indeed it's a very rapid growth as a function of time. And you want to make sure it's not only grow double exponentially, like in our computation of Balkers and two anti-parallel watters tube case. You can see the double lock. Case, you can see the double lock of maximum U1, maximum morticity, omega1, and maximum morticity indeed firstly, certainly grow much faster than linear. You want to see how much the vorticity can amplify dynamically a function of time. So this is the 3D Euler equation, you can see that by the end of the computation, when we still can reasonably resolve, you get the 5000 factor of amplification. In order to check whether or not the mu-catalomita number criteria, it is satisfied. It is satisfied. We check the integration of maximum morticity as a longer time. Again, you can see the very, very rapid growth. So, in order to resolve this potential singularity at the origin, so this is a physical space, the u1 as a function of r and z, you can see developer focusing singularity at the origin, right? But we need to use a highly adaptive mesh to transform the mesh from R and Z into a computational mesh, rho and eta. And eta, this computational coordinate, then you can do a uniform mesh to compute a solution in the transform domain using an analytic mesh map. You can see that by using this change variable, this focusing singularity becomes unfolded, become a very smooth function with large support. So a standard uniform mesh will be able to resolve this commutation. And then you can see that we indicate the second order convergence. This is using one way. I just use one way. Using one way, I just use one way to illustrate maximum vorticity, you can get more than second-order accuracy. And then we want to try to see what kind of scaling, blow-up scaling, that this solution may develop. So we check the maximum vorticity at some point in time. You can see that indeed, like a one double capital T minor T. So that certainly just violated the Bucketta minor criterion. And the maximum velocity, we plot the one over U maximum square, which is also scaled linearly. Which is also scaled linearly. That means that maximum velocity field itself scales like a square root, which is kind of the same scaling in the Lawrence Stowe equation, which is very, very nice feature that I have not seen such a scaling that observed for the 3D Euler in the interior domain. So this is a charting weight center at the R equal to capital R and Z equal to capital Z. And zero capital Z. So you can see both R and Z seem to scale like a square root of capital T minus T. So Z, it is smaller scaling. This is the center of the Charlotte way. So this is another evidence that looks like we get a scaling compatible with the Nauristo equation. And it also looks like a self-similar. So this is the U1 as a function of time in original physical space. But if you take this change variable, dynamic change variable, we scale to center. We scale to center shifted R to the center of capital R and Z still remain shifted to zero, but capital Z is a small length scale. Then you can see that when you plot U1 as a function of this cos C and eta, this is almost like a steady function. That's not changing time. So given the fact that we observed the Euler seem to develop a potential singularity with scaling property consistent with the 3G Names equation, we were able to. The 3G Naim Still equation, we were curious to see whether a non-Nausill equation may survive such a singularity. At the beginning, I tried to use a very small viscosity because I was afraid a large viscosity may destroy the potential Euler singularity. But to my surprise, when you take a very small viscosity like 10 to the minus 5, 10 to the minus 6, or 10 to the minus 7, you recognize the Euler singularity, but then you also generate a lot of small vortexes. You can generate a developed turbulent flow structure. So you don't get the focusing mechanism. So, you don't get the focusing mechanism. Then, I gradually increase the vorticity to see whether or not that helped. To my surprise, indeed, very relatively large viscosity are using 5 times 10 to the minus 4 for a short time until the maximum vorticity increased by a factor of 500. And then I increase the viscosity by a factor of 10 to 5 times 10 to the minus 3 from that time on. Turns out that this relatively large viscosity tend to stabilize the Euler singularity and lead to a very long phase. And lead to a very long phase of strong laminar alignment. So you can see that the water stipulate structure is still maintained for the 3D Naurus equation with constant viscosity. This is at the time when the maximum of T C al would increase by 10 to the power 4. And this is by the time maximal T C increased by 10 to the power 6. And this is what I mentioned earlier. So we want to check the non-linear water stretching, whether or not that's still intact. Throughout the computation, Intact. Throughout the computation, we see that the word that's stretching is dominated with scale term. And this at the end of position of U1 actually, the maximum, we monitor what's the ratio between perceived of Z and U1. You can see that there's a relatively stable flat region as a function of time. This is an early phase. This is the late stage. You can see that they remain quadratic in a linearity alignment for a very, very long time. That's responsible for the very rapid growth dynamically. So again, I passed the maximum. So again, I pass the maximum U1 omega1 maximum morticity as a function of time. This is the double log. And to give you a sense, compared to the Euler growth, so you want to compare the ratio between maximum morticity versus the initial maximum morticity as a function of time at the end of the computation, when we still can resolve the Navy still solution. You can see that we get the amplification by a factor of 10 to the power 7. I have never seen such a large amplification for 3 now still for such a For three and still for such a relatively large viscosity coefficient. I have not seen such a, it's very hard to get, in fact, by the increase by a factor of 10, so it would be very hard for Nairobi with such a large viscosity. And again, you check the Bukadomita criteria, right? So you try to integrate a maximum thesis function time. That also seems to indicate, so it seems to have a very strong likelihood that it may develop a singularity. And the nature of the singularity race is this. The nature of the singularity race is this inherent Euler singularity nature. It's this tornado type of singularity. That is this 3D streamlined plot. So you can see that if the initial position at this position, then it gets stuck into close to the symmetry axis and then they transport it upward and then going downward like a periodic structure. This is another initial position and then you have a more periodic like structure. But when you get very close to the center of this, the symmetry x. Of this, the symmetry axis, then you don't get much swirling. So it's like the flow to get carried up, right? It's like they were here, near the center, it just goes straight up. There's not much spinning. It's like when you sit in the center of the tornado, you don't see the spinning. It just gets sucked up. A very important feature of this flow, I mentioned over here, is that you have this circulation region, this circulation region, because this circulation region. So this plays a very important role. On one hand, you suck the flow on. Important role. On one hand, you suck the flow on outside in the far field, very close to the z go zero, and that gets transported by the negative radio velocity field, right? So, this is play a very important role. So that you keep, it has the role of keeping the majority of the mass of U1 or omega-1 near this region, in this circular region, without being transported away from this on zero zero. So that is what you see here. So, that is what you see here in this 3D plot, right here. You have this circular region, right? So, the flow inside this near the maximum u1, you get this guy's kind of circulating spinning, but not being transported away, right? So, this is a very important feature. Again, we do everything on the trans using adaptive mesh by constructing a adaptive map from time to time. So, in the physical domain, you can see that now we can, with the regularization of this constant term, you can compute it much further, much. You can compute it much further, much closer to the origin, right? It's like a delta function like singularity or u1. But in the transform domain, because we also tend to regularize the solution, you get a much nicer profile in the function rho and r, so you can resolve it much better. Again, you get the more than second-order accuracy when you refine the mesh in the rho and data domain. And the scaling for the maximum vorticity and the maximum velocity has very similar scaling as the Euler that I mentioned earlier. The scaling, that's the Euler that I mentioned earlier, except that you have the slightly locked log correction for the maximum voltage growth in the good direction, right? So that still looks like it will violate the Buketo-Meiner condition. And we know that the maximum velocity scale like this is now still scaling. And again, we want to see what is the collapse of the small scale of Z, right? This capital Z, you can see if you look at it long from T from early time all the way to the end, again, you observe this square root of capital T minus. Again, you observe this square root, capital T minus T scaling. But you can see if you're zooming this tail part, you can see the slight deviation from the square root. And if you're using the data only near the end point, you can see that you pick up a minor logarithm correction. So slightly faster than square root capital T min T. And in fact, that is the thing that eventually ruined or prevented the Ottawa equation from blowing up because you break this square root scaling, the cell simulcast. Cell similar scaling in the late stage. So, again, you have the cell similar structure. When you transform to this C and Ata variable, this is the U1 as R and Z. This is in the transform variable. You can see there's a steady kind of cell single picture for both U1 and omega 1. What this is another important variable that is essential for the Nazi equation to blow up. So we plot the 3D pressure profile near. Profile near the final time of our computation, you can see the maximum negative vorticity going to minus infinity as they approach the origin, right? If you're trying to fit how fast it approaches minus infinity, it looks like it has a linear, one over maximum pressure block like linearly, going to linearly to zero. That means the pressure itself blocks one over capital T minus T. This is all consistent with a potential block of the Naurist equation. Potential blow of a Naurish equation. But unfortunately, due to this small minor two-scale structure, the log rhythm correction of the capital Z, the Narcissa equation eventually escaped the finite time singularity, the viscous term eventually dominate. So in order to demonstrate that, we check another two block criteria. One is prescribed by the growth of entropy, one is the maximum velocity, velocity to the L3 norm, right? Of view to the L3 norm, right, due to the spheric and collaboration. So the entropy is very interesting because that's a very important physical quantity. So you can, if you're trying to plot the growth of L2 norm of vorticity as a function of time, L2 norm square, this entropy, you can see the very rapid growth. We know that for 3G now, now it's still equation that if you have control of the L4 norm in time of the L2 norm in space of vorticity, then there's no problem. But if you're trying to integrate this. Right, but you can, if you try to integrate this function in time, you can see it still looks like a very rapid growth. But with very careful examination, near the end, review that the growth will slow down. If you're zooming the time by plotting the lock time, right, but going to slow motion, you can see it's actually 10 to the saturated, around 10 to the power 8, which is still a huge number, right? So that shows that the Nausso equation due to this mild two-scale structure developed in the late. This mild two-scale structure developed in the late stage, it just barely escaped the finite time singularity. And the maximum, the L3 norm of the velocity also show a similar picture. On the other hand, the L3 norm, number of criteria, is based on compactness arguments. So this growth rate does not translate actual growth rate of the maximum morticity. So this one is more physically revealing. So given the fact that we observe Nars equation. Narshi equation almost blows up, but that somehow escapes due to this mild Lockwood correction of the length scale, lead to the viscous dominant eventually. So we would like to see if you can modify the viscosity so that you have a mild decay, which is have a solution-dependent decaying factor, so that you can make sure that the water structure in terms and the viscous term must always balance each other. This water structure in term for U1, if you add the viscous, you have a dis decaying factor. Decaying factor. So, if z does not have this log rhythm correction, you know the percentage of z is a scale like abundant capital t minus t, this product will be remaining order one. But due to this log rhythm correction, so this will have a slow decay like a log to the power three. So then if you multiply this factor, then you will you maintain the balance. So we only multiply by this decaying factor at a very late time, when at the t1 when the mass of T is already grow by 10 to the power 6, then we turn on this slow decaying factor. On this slow decaying factor, then you can see that the competition between water's charging turn and the viscous term, the water's charge in turn always win, right? And the decay of the solution-dependent viscosity factor is grow like a log of log time to the power three, the inverse of the viscous coefficient, right? That means the viscous coefficient itself would decay like a log to the minor power three. It's very mild decay. Basically, from the beginning, it's like a 10 to 5 times 10 to the minus 3, drop to about 10. 10 to the minus 3 drop to about 10 to the minus 4 at the end of the computation, but then the maximum vorticity will grow by a factor of 10 to the power 9. You can actually keep going as long as your adapter mesh can resolve the potential singularity. But the dipole structure is still intact, right? And all the scaling problems I reviewed earlier is still the same at the same thing. The Z and R have its log correction, I mentioned earlier. R also has a log correction. Earlier, R also has a log collection. The cell similar structure is still intact, right? The same thing. So, in summary, so in the first part of the talk, I review some older results that due to Goloi and myself and some analytical effort trying to provide a vigorous justification of the computation that we did back in 2014. In that case, the present boundary played a very essential role. Played a very essential role. So, then in the second part of the talk, I present some new computational evidence for potential singularity in the interior domain, more precisely at the origin for the 3D Euler equation. And an important feature of this new potential singularity is that it has a scaling, block scaling compatible with the 3D Naurus equation. So, as a result, we observe nearly singular behavior of the 3D Nausil equation using a relatively large viscosity with maximal TC increase by a factor of 10 to the power 7. Power seven. But due to the mild two-scale structure that developed in the late stage, that the NASO equation just barely escaped the finite time singularity by multiple by applying a very slowly decaying solution-dependent factor, which decay of roughly of this order. We observe that the 3D NISO equation with this slowly decaying viscosity seems to develop a finite time singularity. So, if this is really the case, that seems to suggest that maybe the Seems to suggest that maybe the non-blow-up equation for the kind of nature condition we consider, maybe just in the borderline case. So that's something we would like to further investigate in the future. With that, I start. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for the very interesting talk. Are there questions? Yes. Yes, there are questions. You have to unmute yourself. Unmute yourself. Jun Cheng, if you want to ask a question, you have to unmute yourself because you are muted. Yeah, no, no. Okay, so I yeah, I asked the question before. This in the for the oil, why the R and Z the same water? And they are the same order, that's kind of uh strange, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, yeah, yeah, that's something I cannot explain fully, but I think the important, I think maybe due to the isentropic feature, right? Because you want to have a one scale, right? Yeah, for the oil, actually, the R scale scale, like a scale happen much later. In early time, I don't get a very clear scaling, so I don't trust the R scaling so much. The Z scaling is more stronger, yeah. Scaling is more stronger. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Right. So, okay, okay. For the nice store, I can communicate much longer. Then the R scale, I see that it is more, it is like a square root also. Yeah, but the late stage has a correction, has a log with a correction. So why now you don't see this late stage correction for R? Because we cannot compute it long enough. Because we cannot compute it long enough, it's very hard to develop. I think it may also develop, but I just cannot push far enough to pick up the asynchronous because I have to use for now. Now, still have to use a very late stage fitting to get the fit, right? To pick up this logarithm. For Euler, I cannot push far enough to have enough data, significant data, to get the scaling properly. But for Euler, you are. But but but but for Euler you are sure pretty sure about the the the zeta of t. Yeah, right right. I think that's where you said the fact that nice oil can can grow so much is an indirect confirmation that the oil scale should be square root of t for the majority of the time except the very late stage I cannot know for sure right I think it may it may also both oil and iso may suffer from this lock correction in the very late stage This log correction in the very late stage. So that could be a sign of instability. There's some kind of the self-sumopa we're trying to compute may have some kind of structure instability in the very late stage. So that it may not want to stay in this square root scaling region forever, without the law. Once you have the law, that can destroy the balance. It's not exact cells you lose. And what happens? Because you are considering viscosity, large viscosity. Yeah. Right. And that is counterintuitive because I first try small viscosity. Then I find that it cannot get this focusing magnet. And then develops an edit, like a small edit develop and the large structure lead to smaller eddy. You get a lot of turbulent structure, which is very hard to resolve numerically, and you don't have this focusing mechanism. You get a lot of energy cascade, right? Lot of energy cascade, right? So, to counter our intuitive turbulence, not good for blow-up. You need a focusing self-singular sustainable mechanism to build up this blow-up. Yeah. Okay, thanks. Are there other questions? Well, if not, let me thank you. Let me thank Thomas Ho and all the speakers of this morning. Thank you very much. Thank you.
