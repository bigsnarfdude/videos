I hope you all had a really nice lunch. It's a beautiful day and I hope it continues with this beautiful weather tomorrow. So today's professional development session is about listening. And so right off the bat, maybe some of you are thinking, oh my goodness, why are we going to spend 30 minutes talking about listening? I've been listening my whole entire life. I'm listening to you right now. Why do I need to learn about listening? Well, About listening? Well, I'm going to argue that while many of us think we're listening, we're actually not. So, two common scenarios that I find myself in, and maybe some of you have as well, is when someone is talking to me and they say something that sparks an idea. I'm holding on to that idea, like, oh my gosh, I really want to share this. And instead of like listening to this person, I'm like, shut up, person, because I want to speak. I want to share my idea with you. Speak. I want to share my idea with you. Right? So that's a common situation where instead of listening, we are focusing just on myself and my idea, and I want to share my brilliance with this person. Another common scenario is when big name professor comes up to me and starts talking, and I'm like, oh my gosh, it's big name professor. What do I say? How can I keep this conversation going? I want to make a good impression. There's silence. How do I fill the silence? How do I fill the silence? What do I do? Right? That's a common sense. So instead of listening to Big Bang Professor, I am focusing on having a conversation with myself in my head to try to make an impression on someone. So that's not really listening. So if any of you, if that description describes any of you, you're not alone. I'm right there with you. So there are three levels. Three levels of listening. The first level is the one that most of us listen at, and it's listening for facts. So you are listening to the person just listening for the details. What are they telling you? And this is the most superficial kind of listening, and it's the one that most of us are used to. There are two deeper levels of listening. So the second one is the emotional level of listening. Level of listening. So you are listening for feelings, state of mind, mood. So you are listening, for example, when someone is telling you the story, instead of just listening, what details are they telling you, you're listening for, huh? They sound really happy or sad or anxious or huh. I wonder, you know, what's holding them back? Kind of thing. The even deeper level of listening, which very few of us get to, is listening. Is listening for values. So you're listening for ideals, morals, principles, ethics, worldview. So for example, when someone is sharing their story with you, you're listening, you're hearing, wow, this person really values growth. Or wow, this person really likes certainty or, you know, shaking things up all the time. Right? That's the deepest level of listening that I don't know how many of you actually, like myself, I have trouble. Actually, like myself, I have trouble listening for so we are going to actually practice listening to at each of these levels. Okay? So we're going to do an exercise where you have these slides with you in the Google Drive, but you can also take a picture. And I encourage you to take a picture because you're going to do this. So, what I want you to do is, I know that now everyone gets to know each other, so maybe no one is new. To know each other, so maybe no one is new at this point. But I'd like you to pair up with someone that you maybe don't know as well. And you're going to do two rounds. So in round one, person one is going to take two minutes to answer this question. If you had unlimited funds, what would you do and why? Person two is listening for facts. So you're one of a piece of paper or something. I got to have a piece of paper or something, and you're just going to write down the facts. What are they telling me? What are the details? You and also person two, you're the timekeeper, so kind of cut them off when it's two minutes. And afterwards, you're going to share the facts with person one, and person one is going to tell you whether you got that right or wrong. Did you actually listen for the facts correctly? Then you're going to switch roles and repeat. So, what this means is each person is going to do round one. Each person is going to do round one both as the speaker and the listener. Does that make sense? Okay, so round one is you are listening just for facts. Round two, the same thing, where person one is going to take two minutes to answer this question. What is something you've done that really intimidated you, but paid off in the end? And now, person two, instead of just listening for facts, you want to listen to the fact that you're not going to Instead of just listening for facts, you want to listen, what emotions or values are you hearing? And afterwards, you are, so again, you're going to be the timekeeper, so cut them off at two minutes. Afterwards, you're going to share those emotions and values that you heard with person one, and person one is going to tell you whether they agree with you or not. Do they really have those values, those emotions about them? Okay? And again, you're going to switch roles and repeat. Any questions? Any questions? Yes, Layla. So, unlimited funds, do you mean like research? Yeah, anything. Research, like money. You had unlimited students, anything, whatever resource. It doesn't have to be work-related. This doesn't have to be work-related. So, for example, if you had unlimited funds, you could quit your job today, what would you do? And why? Okay? So, it can be work-related if that makes more sense. Can be work-related if that makes more sense to you. It doesn't have to be. Other questions? Okay, so I'm going to give you 15 minutes. So what is that? What's 136 plus 15? 151. 151. All right, thank you. So 151 or 152. Come back and we're going to have a discussion. We're going to talk about how this applies to grants and stuff. Okay? So you can either stay here, go out in the room, but 152. Go out in the room, but 152, come back. Okay? So pair up with someone. If someone doesn't have a partner, I'll be your next. I have no idea. Yeah, so hold on, hold on. It helps. I encourage you when you're listening for facts or listening, take notes so that you remember what emotions and values, okay? We don't have to test ourselves. Have to classify. I may have one in my card. Does anyone not have a partner? Actually, I kind of think it's a good idea to say, so. So, can we make everyone have a partner? Who does not have a partner? You know what he means? Yanya. Okay, do you have a partner? We are doing this exercise. Okay, so maybe Ingrid and Yanya can carry out. Okay. Sorry, do you have a partner? Yeah, you have to go.   I would just comment on this. You would definitely hire a large team. Yeah, But I can get some drugs and you know. And then you have to draw and eat a lot of my technical technology. You've got like the lights. I think it was a lot of short time. I think I love short time. Like once I can like long damage. And then like five damage on my body and my head as I was like a pleasure like a like like a my main friend or whatever. Mike Maintenance or whatever, but it's crazy. Any dedicated stage from the book and also. So we're not like what I feel like I guess it's a little more walk from here and then I'll just I remember I was like, I was sharing that. I thought I walked into that and so at one point I ran away from the light. At one point I graduated on the side of the site, but I think I mentioned one of the most pushed it in. You see the title and you're okay.    So, my themes are like, okay, so I'm going to go ahead and do that. I noticed that I have said it on the other side. I didn't know how to explain solving. I know that I'm gonna see how. But um I know a lot of their public challenge. But then he's gonna enter stage.  Yeah, so you're not here to have a lot of things to be fine. But I think that was the area of the dollar.    Oh, it's gonna be fun. And then, okay, actually, right? Oh, and oh, and every day, like that late, and then I'm like, okay, I'm not like, then I'm just gonna be tight.  But I learned so much. Then we started seeing the buttons and they had to do it.  Okay, I think you may have told me. It's okay, it's okay. I know that's fine. But just for sake of text, we'll keep it in the middle of the week. Thanks for that. Alright, I know probably some of you didn't get to do the full exercise, but I hope you still got something out of it. Just for sake of time, I'd like to move forward. So just I'd like to have a little discussion. So my first question is: so when you took on the role of listener, how did it feel? How did it feel when you are listening for facts versus emotions and values? How did it feel to you when you're the listener? Much easier with facts. Much easier with facts. Totally. Totally agree. Anybody else? Yes, it's all a lot more interested about the emotions and values because that is also getting like we were connected from the first one. I was just like, okay, then he can. Yeah, yeah, that's true. Yeah, yeah, that's true, right? So, yeah, so more connection when you're listening for emotions value, but definitely much easier to listen from facts. Yes, because I'd say with the facts when I felt like I was learning about her, but when I was the second one, I felt like I was getting to know her. Wow, that's important. That's powerful. Anyone else? Anything else to share? Yes. I think facts is that we can take notes. Yeah. Emotions did not. Yeah, that's right, right? Like, facts, it's so easy to take notes, but emotions just sit. To take notes, but emotions just sit there trying to think of something. Yes, patient is pension, so we have some information. So, I think, in terms of facts, I think someone helps information just need to be close. But when you want to understand others' emotions, probably I will consider the I will be how I cope with these facts. So I will consider it. So then it's probably easier to return to. I like that. So, Pajan suggests what I'm hearing is: you know, how would I feel in? You know, how would I feel in this situation? So, that's a way to tap into the feelings and maybe values. Moving on, so now for the people that were listened to, how did you feel when someone heard your stories for facts versus emotions and values? So when someone told you, hey, I heard this about the facts and emotions, but how did you feel when you heard what they heard? Like, do you know what I mean? Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. How did it make you feel? Like pleasantly surprised. There were like emotions and values that Anna got after so few minutes of those. That does feel right, but I would not have acknowledged that as I was delaying it. Yeah. Yeah. So they heard things about you that you didn't even know were in you. Yeah, like Asian heard confidence from me, and I'm like, oh my gosh, I didn't even say that. And he got in. Others, like, even knowing that she was listening to emotions really. She was listening to emotions versus values. I feel like I was talking differently. Like I was telling her more in-depth stuff rather than like telling her how I was feeling. Share, share. I kind of felt seen and hurt. Wow. Seen and hurt. So more connection with someone. Interesting. Others. Yeah, I thought that when I was it was easier for me and that was to provide the facts. Yeah. That was, you know, we could do it in these two minutes. You know, we could do it in these two minutes, and it was however when you had to just go through the other part with emotions and values, it wasn't easy to do it in two minutes because it was just going back and forth. And I guess that's why, you know, when you have to explain something that is difficult, then perhaps you don't even have the right words, which is for the right words for the emotions or values you have. Absolutely, absolutely. Absolutely, absolutely. So, yes, I totally agree. So, I think, so the things that you shared are what other groups have shared when they've done this exercise. So, facts are very easy to listen to, but listening for emotions and values, it does create this sense of deeper connection with someone. So, this, like you feel like, oh, I have a friend, I have an ally in this other person. Which imagine if we could do in our departments when we're interviewing candidates or, you know, between our colleagues, like, wow. Between our colleagues, like wow, if we listen to each other at the motion value, maybe we'll be like really close friends with people, right? That's a possibility. So, a couple things I want to end with. So, some helpful tips. So, I shared earlier that I have this issue. Like, when I hear an idea, I'm like, I want to speak. Like, person, shut up so I can say something. One thing that I found helpful, and others, this comes I found it helpful in others. This comes from a leadership program. If you are a person that tends to want to jump in, like maybe interrupt someone or like jump in with your idea, for some reason, some strange reason, it works for some people, at least for me, putting your palms up, there's something about it, like you just can't really lean in and start interrupting someone. So just if that's your tendency, you know, like in department meetings or something, like someone to speak up and like interrupt people, you know, open your palms. Interrupt people, you know, open your pumps. It will block you from wanting to speak. In terms of the values, sometimes it's hard to know, like, what am I listening for? What is my connection? So, the psychologists have identified that humans, to survive, we have six human needs. So, there is certainty, we like to know things will happen in a certain way, uncertainty and variety. Uncertainty and variety. We don't want every day to be exactly the same. We like to shake things up every now and then, right? Otherwise, life would get really boring. We like to feel important. We like to feel significant. We like to have connection with other people. That's a human need. We like that. Growth. We like to take on challenges. If we don't do challenges, life's going to get really, really boring. And finally, we like to make a difference. To make a difference, we like to make an impact, contribution. So, what I'm saying is, I'm not asking you to memorize these six human needs, but you can use these six human needs if, for example, I use these when I'm interviewing postdocs, actually. So when they're saying something, I'm identifying, huh, which of these human needs do they actually want? Right? Like listening at the emotions and values. Like listening at the emotions and value level. And is this something? I just want to is this something that I actually want? For example, I am a person that really likes growth. So if I'm hearing someone and talk about they like growth, you know, I'm hearing the sense of growth, that's a person I'm really interested in. Whereas if I'm hearing significance, like they want to feel important all the time, for me, that's something I don't know if I'm capable of. I'm capable of making them feel important all of the time. That's something that kind of turns me off. So I'm saying that this, like, I use this actually to try to help me see what human needs they want. We all want these human needs. It just varies throughout our life, which one is more important. I want to say, I want to end with this. I think that listening for emotions and values can help in many different situations, networking, sitting in a grant fellowship panel, sitting in a group. In a grant fellowship panel, sitting in department meeting, collaborating. For example, getting back to the grant and fellowship panel, for example, and combining that with the six human needs. So this can happen either when you're listening to other faculty members talk about a proposal or even when you're reading your summary statement. So, for example, someone, so actually, Jiwei had this nice example earlier, or I shouldn't have said. I shouldn't have said something, sorry. So he had mentioned, you know, he had written this proposal, and the reviewers had said, you know, it's too technical. It's too much. I don't understand what you're doing. How does that relate? Well, so one thing is you can think, oh, that means I just need to cut things out, like cut a bunch of stuff. But really, like, my opinion, this is just my opinion, by putting in too much technical stuff. Putting in too much technical stuff, and the person said, I don't understand what you're doing, you are reducing their significance. You're making them feel less important because they don't understand. They feel like they're, they might feel like, I'm smart, but I don't understand this text. You're making me feel dumb. People don't like to feel dumb. Okay, so how is a way to make people feel smart when you're reading a proposal? This goes back to Kyle's comment yesterday. Comment yesterday: when the writing is clear and simple, and people just get it, that makes people feel really, really smart. I can read this, like I'm a smart person, I can easily read this. That boosts their significance big time. Another common, and then I'll stop. Another common one I hear is, for example, like a reviewer says, okay, I'm not sure that this, like this method will work in this setting, or this setting has the authors consider this or this. Have the authors consider this or this or that. And a common reaction is: okay, I'm going to include in my proposal like more tables, more figures to show every single setting that the people had said, I don't believe this, right? What that review, in my opinion, the reviewer is wanting certainty that the method works. So, does it mean include a billion simulations or many simulation settings to say that? No. Say that? No. Instead, if you can identify, hey, they want to know my method works, they want certainty, they like certainty. What is the one or two key settings that I can include to show my methods works? Like this is the hardest setting you're going to see, and look how well my method works. That's going to convince them that this method works. Okay, these are just my opinions. Anyway, I am done. I know I'm over time. I'm happy to take any questions about this during the break. Happy to take any questions about this during the break or later. But yeah, I very much hope that all of you can start listening at these deeper levels of emotions and value. You can practice it here in this workshop, right? As you're talking to someone. What are their emotions and value? All right, thank you everyone. We'll take a break until 2.10 and then get started. Oh, yeah, that's what it's good. I'm good for you.
