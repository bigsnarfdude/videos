Talk about a minimal model that integrates these kinds of competition. So, in ecology, we often talk about exploitative competition, which is the indirect competition between two consumers for a mutually shared resource. And this is a basic building block from theoretical ecology. And it forms what's called R-star theory and the R-star rule, which I'll briefly describe. So, imagine this one consumer, one resource module. A resource module. If you run a simple model, you would find that the consumer and the resource would come into some equilibrium. And we call the equilibrium abundance of the resource set by the consumer its R star. And this R star is sort of a metric of fitness and also corresponds to the minimum resource requirement for a consumer, mathematically. And presumably, you could do this for both. You could think about this metric for both consumers. And if you were to run And if you were to run, consider the situation with both of these consumers buying for a single resource in a simple kind of minimal model. If one species has a lower R star, it says if it can persist at a lower resource level, it will competitively exclude its competitor. So this is called the R star rule. It's a really basic building block in a huge swath of ecological theory. And it's based on exploitative competition. But in nature, organisms also interact. But in nature, organisms also interact directly in competition for resources. And in this paper, I'm going, or in this talk, I'm going to combine and think of the interactions of interference competition and exploitment competition. Now, everyone here probably knows about the Hawk Dove game, where you have things about competition between two types, an aggressive type Hawks and a non-aggressive type dove. And a non-aggressive type, a dove. And the hawk in contested resource, the hawk gets some benefit for getting the resource, and the dove will always run away. If the hawks compete against each other, they get the benefit half the time, experience cost half the time. And if the doves fight against each other, they'll split the resource or one will get scared and run away with no injury or anything. And the upshot being that you can get to coexistence of the types. You can get the coexistence of the types, or basically the dog doesn't get excluded if the costs exceed the benefits of getting the resource. So great model. One limitation about it is it has the resource is implicitly modeled, no explicit resource dynamics. Some people have done advances in recent years that do integrate that, but my bone of the pick is it's not really been integrated with this kind of basic. Been integrated with this kind of basic ecological theory and R-star theory. So, a major goal here is integrating these frameworks. And another related framework in ecology is the so-called the dominance discovery trade-off. Other people would call it the competition-colonization trade-off. And it thinks about coexistence of two species or types that experience a trade-off and their competitive and colonization abilities. Basically, imagine we have two species that compete for a resource. Species that compete for a resource. If type species one runs into species two, and we're assuming it's a better competitor, it'll boot species one off the resource, kind of like the October game. And the way this model imagines things is in a quasi-spatial way. And the idea is you have some species that are better competitors, and some species that are better colonizers of the resource. And so, in a cartoonish way, sort of. And so, in a cartoonish way, sort of expect the better colonizers to more rapidly get to the resources. And ecologists have referred to these as fugitive species. And the idea is you have some dynamic of rapid colonization and then the better competitor booting them off in dynamic. Okay, so in this talk, I'm going to think about, I'm going to ask how does interference competition affect resource use and requirements for consumers? So it's integrating interference competition. Consumers, so it's integrating interference competition into R-star theory. And how does interference competition change our conclusions about resource density, R-star coexistence, and competitive exclusion? Okay, so let's go through sort of a pictorial version of the model. So we're considering some kind of community that has resources, and I'm going to represent them as patches here. We have empty patches, we have consumer individuals that are searching for resources. Individuals that are searching for resources, resource-rich patches, occupied patches with resources that are being utilized, and contested patches, like two consumers buying for a resource. And I'm just going to go through the model dynamics because all of these will come up. So empty patches will renew at some rate. A searching consumer runs into resources at some search rate A, begins to utilize them. Consumers utilize resources at C. Consumers utilize resources at some handling time, and reproduction is assumed to be proportional to how many resources you utilize. And finally, consumers that run into other consumers begin the contest, and individual consumers within those contests have some giving up rates. Well, they'll run away from the patch, and the other will begin handling the resource file. Okay? Simple enough. Simple enough. And so we're going to apply sort of the logic of a hawk dove framework on top of this model, where we might consider type one that might be more hawkish with a lower beta, a slower giving up rate, and a more dovish type that gives up more quickly. And just as a summary, so we have a sort of expanded model with resource competition with interference. And just as a sanity check, if you were to sort of And just as a sanity check, if you were to sort of blow up beta to infinity with two types, all the interference would collapse, and you mathematically get the R-star rule once again. So just a sanity check. And I just want to note that there are a few papers in the past that have used similar consumer resource-like frameworks with a hawk dove-ish idea in mind. So I wanted to give credit to them. And so, okay, now we're going to begin recasting this model. To begin recasting this model sort of within our star theory. So, how does interference competition affect resource use and requirements? And so, let's go back to thinking about a single consumer. What does adding this interference change? So, there's sort of a tale of two R stars. So, I talked about the R star in classic R star theory. And it turns out that interference changes the equilibrium resource density in a meaningful way. So, this plot here shows the giving up. Here shows the giving up rate of a consumer on the x-axis and the equilibrium resource density set by that consumer. And the red line here is the R star that you would get from traditional R star theory or from exploitative competition. And this R star, what I call R star I, interference R star, is what you get when you add interference in this sort of dynamic of contents. This sort of dynamic of contexts. And the key implication of this is that the equilibrium resource density set by a consumer is no longer equal to its minimum resource requirements. And that, it turns out, will have some important implications for quote systems. A second aspect that's potentially important when we are considering interference competition is intertype interference. And just going back here at a moment, this is what we This is when we were considering a single consumer, and so this is all intra-type interference, and that creates negative density dependence, and that's why we get this result. Should mention that quickly. But when we have inter-type interference, once again, when we only have exploitative competition, no interference, the ambient resource level always has to be greater than R star, or it has to be greater than consumers R star. Greater than a consumer's R-star for it to be able to persist. But resource theft and interference changes this conclusion. For hawks, you can steal resources from doves handling resources, and that sort of increases the swath of resources you have access to. If you're a dove, the opposite is true. Even though the ambient resource level may be high, you still may be competitively excluded due to experiencing interference. Okay, so that's a setup for everything. So, how does interference, competition change our conclusions about resource density, or star coexistence, the catalog exclusion? And what we're going to sort of try to do in this section is go through the results and then show how it kind of gives a synthesis of these sort of disparate models from community ecology and evolutionary game. So, let's first consider a simple case. Consumers, we have interference competition, but consumers have identical Competition, but consumers have identical exploitative competitive ability, meaning that they have, say, identical search rates and identical resource use rates or resource handling time. But they might differ in how quickly they, how hawkish or dovish they are. And so this is a plot that's basically based on mutual invasibility. So the x-axis here is beta 1. It's the giving up rate of consumer 1. Beta 2, the y-axis, is the giving up rate of consumer 1. Axis is the giving up rate of consumer two. And long story short, you get regions of coexistence and competitive exclusion. And in short, you sort of need some sort of, there's a region of coexistence that requires some sort of sufficient difference in hawkishness and doggishness of the two types. There's a paper I found that had a similar looking result, also credit. But what I care about in terms of this result is what it means in terms of using R star as a metric. So this plot here. So, this plot here, the axis, the x and y axis are the same, and the z axis shows the R star, the equilibrium resource abundance set by each of the two consumers. And just like, we can just focus on the upper triangle part here because the plots are symmetrical. But the key implication of this plot is you see these regions of coexistence correspond to the regions of greatest difference in our star. So, sort of contrary to. So, sort of contrary to classic ecological theory, you actually get more coexistence when species differ the most in the equal resource they set, rather than that being a factor that's preventing coexistence. Case two, what about if species differ in their exploitative competitive ability? So they might differ in, in our example here, in either search rate or handling time, count. So, this is the plot from before. So, this is the plot from before, just as a comparison. Here is a plot where the two consumers differ in search rate. Basically, there's a slight shift in how coexistence looks and the region of competitive exclusion, but at least for this particular value, it's sort of just a perturbation from it. So, and it's a not, and then I should note: this is a non-trivial difference in fitness between the two types. So, interference competition is. So interference competition is quite important, even in the context of our differences in exploitative competitiveness. But interestingly, in this plot here, the consumers differ in exploitative competitiveness by the exact same amount, but they differ in resource in handling time instead of search rate. And you get a very, very different result where you have a largely diminished region of coexistence. And this has to do with how different How differences like handling time is interacting with interference competition. Like if you handle your resource quickly, you're less likely to get interfered with, for example. And as a sort of extreme example, we have a case now where here consumer one is a much stronger exploitative competitor, but it's a stronger exploitative competitor because it has a higher search rate, whereas consumer two has a slightly Consumer 2 has a slightly larger or modestly shorter handling time, but consumer species 2 always excludes consumer 1. So in short, with these two results, the point is that the classic conclusions of R-Store theory really don't hold. The equilibrium resource density set by a consumer doesn't tell you anything about who will win. And also, the exploitative RSP. The exploited of R star also doesn't tell you anything necessary. They're part of the story, they don't tell you anything. So you can do some analytical work, and that's kind of non-trivial, but you can get a coexistence condition for two consumers. And you can partition it into two key parts: one relating to the relative exploitative competitive ability of the two types, and then two terms that. That sort of characterize the impact of interference on invasion of a tech. And so basically, if this inequality, if these inequalities are fulfilled, you get mutual invasibility. And in this model, at least that corresponds to coexistence. And so this sort of goes in, this inequality allows us to look at the relative impact of exploitative interference competition in particular results and outcomes. And outcomes. So imagine we're considering competitive exclusion. One consumer might be predominantly excluded because it's an inferior exploitative competitor. And behind the scenes, there's a way that you can sort of quantify the relative importance of each of these terms. And that's what I'm talking about here. Or it could be that the more dovish type is predominantly excluded because of the impacts of interference. Conversely, the more Conversely, the more hawkish type might be excluded predominantly for interference effects. So we have three distinct mechanisms by which one of the two consumers gets competitively excluded. Also, we have different two distinctive mechanisms by which coexistence can happen. In essence, you could have what I argue is a hawk dove-like coexistence, where each of the consumers or each of the types predominantly invades due to interference. Due to interference effects. And mathematically, what is going on behind the scenes is one consumer benefits primarily from stealing resources, the other benefits primarily from the bloated equilibrium resource density that's caused by the negative density dependence of hawk-hawk interference. Alternatively, you can have a situation where, say, the more hawkish type invades predominantly due to interference effects due to stealing resources. Effects due to stealing resources, but the more dovish type, sorry, this is, this should say dovish type, the more dovish type invades predominantly because it's a superior exploitative competitor. And especially if you look at the limiting cases, the math of it almost precisely goes to the classic competition colonization or dominance discovery trade-off models. And so what's cool about this is we can sort of take these, say, results and sort of partition what regime you're in based off of the parameters. Regime you're in based off of the parameter space. So, for example, in this case, we're exploited the competitive ability is the same, perhaps not surprisingly, we have a region for the hawk wins, a region where the dove wins, and a region that corresponds to optive coexistence. But when you have these differences in exploitative competitibility on top of this interference structure, you get a kind of non-trivial partitioning of the relative regimes you're in. I'm not going to go into the logic of exactly why you're in each of these regimes, but you have like Of these regimes, but you have like some world, some world where the some part of the parameter space where the R star rule is important, some part where parts where pop dove dynamics are important, parts where the dominance discovery or competition colonization trade-off is important. I should mention that I put dominance discovery here in square quotes because there's sort of two flavors of it within the model. You can ask me about that, but it's a little bit subtle for a 15-minute talk. And in this sort of third In this third example, I'll just note that in this plot, I'll remind you consumers differ in search rate, and in this plot, consumers differ in handling time or handling rate. And the regime that you're in and the way things look are quite different depending on which trait you differ in terms of exploitability. So, in conclusion, our star theory. R-star theory, important building block of ecology, still an important part of the puzzle, but doesn't account for the full swath of these key parts of competition. And interference competition can qualitatively change some of our conclusions about, for example, how resource density corresponds to competitive outcomes. And so my main goal for this right here was a synthesis of ideas from evolutionary game theory and community ecology, trying to get these different ideas. Trying to get these different ideas that are talked about, I think, in the same framework, often within the same kind of tractable model. And the point we're going from here is we're sort of slapping on some adaptive dynamic types model, and there's some interesting questions in the eco-evil sphere that's even thinking about the evolution of traits. And so that's where we're hoping to go from here. But hopefully that was clear. But anyway. But anyway, thank you for listening. Thanks to the lab, funding, and thanks so much for having me here. It's been very fun. Okay, thanks. I'll take your time for questions. Yeah, nice stuff. I'm interested, do you recover the basic logic of the whole game? So you've got focus on? Is there a way I can use it with chalkboard? Is there a way I can use it with chalkboard? Do you see braces in the gets a C V yeah so yes and no? Like it's sort of framed in different ways. Just use the trope code. Yeah. The power will follow. Okay. So like in the classic hop dub game you have like some sort of abstractly defined cost, right? And an abstract benefit be and you get an analogous term term in this model where you sort of have like we have our two R star we have stars we have like a we have the interference related R star and the exploitative related R star times a constant or this basically has to be less than another value like this here greater than one and so in the model I will argue the cost chart With the cost term. This is to get coexistence. Yeah, to get coexistence. And in this model, I would argue that the cost term is captured somewhere in this ratio. And so this ratio is basically the increase in resource density due to the negative density dependence of the hawks. And that's pretty much, that's very similar to the costs. The benefit term, I think, is a little bit less obvious from it. This term here that I've written in this equation is basically the probability that a dub by It's basically the probability that a dove doesn't get interfered with during while it's exploiting a resource, which is not so directly equivalent to the Hawk Dove game. And I think the reason is because you don't have this well-defined benefit in the classic user-reader source dynamics. I think you can sort of, if you sort of hack at it enough, you can sort of squint at it and get similar logic, but it's a slightly different initial thing. Different initial thing. But for me, it's interesting. I mean, it's an important question: if you make these things more ecologically realistic, is there something you missed by the fundamental kind of logic of having coexistence of very aggressive and non-aggressive strategies? Coexisting, that was the key insight that that it generated. The question is, does that key insight persist, or the reasons why you get coexistence persists? Get your distance with this, you know, roughly. Yeah, I think, I mean, to me, sorry, the key insight to me in the HawkDub is more that's the negative uh frequency dependence of rights that the hawk experiences. And there's the, I think that, I think that's the key aspect that we're getting in terms of the resource, in terms of whether other aspects of the model corresponded. It's a little bit more like in TV ecology, when it was introduced, it was really important because people. Really important because people intuitively expected domination by aggressive types. So, for me, it's like that insight isn't the realism of the Hall Duck game that's important. It's that it gives you some sort of reason why you don't get a dominance everywhere by hyper-aggressive, hyper-competitive situations. And if you lose that, then the fundamental reason for having it when you make these. Describing it when you make it realistic, when you have insight that we might be something that we thought about seriously or a comment on a question, a community ecologist would approach this question of coexistence by saying how do they split the niches between what are the multiple niche axis that really Reach access that you're utilizing in a different way that would allow them to coexist. So I'm suspecting that their one type's increased ability in handling time, decreased time, the other in search time probably would translate to different axis. I mean, you could probably portray your results in terms of niches and coexistence as used in community ecology. In community ecology, yeah, I think so. Yeah, and like there's sort of different methods different ecologists use about this kind of presentation. Like they're like some like in some frameworks, like niche differences are sort of a quantification of the strength of negative frequency dependence. And that's closer to what we've done here. But yeah, I agree with you. Like there's a way to sort of explicitly cast this in terms of a quote-unquote hawk. Like a quote-unquote hawk niche and a quote-unquote dove niche. Although I think there's, since there's sort of a continuum of different mechanisms, it's maybe a little bit more subtle than that.
