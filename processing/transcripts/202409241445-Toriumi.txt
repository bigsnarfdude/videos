I'll tell you about these random tensor models with mixed symmetry of unitary and orthogonal group. And my talk will be a little bit parallel to, sorry, it's a bit too loud. A little bit parallel to the theme of this workshop, but there are some suggestive There are some suggestive, some keywords, etc., in my talk. So, hopefully, you'll find something interesting. So, let me see. And let's see. So, so let me, sorry, okay. So, let me introduce you to random tensor models. I don't know how many of you are familiar with random tensor models. So, let me just go through it. And let me introduce in rather Me introduce in rather hopefully general terms. So, um, and I'll introduce it in the kind of field theoretic way. So, we consider a field theory defined by a complex field phi. Here I'm talking about complex field just as an example, but it doesn't have to be necessarily complex. But let me say, and then where G is a complex Lie group admitting Peter-Weil decomposition. Meeting Peter Weil decomposition. In this way, I can perform a Fourier transform of this phi. And in turn, it gives us an order D tensor. So order here means the number of tensor, number of indices of these tensors. That's the order. So I have the number of indices of these tensors. And here, this bold P. And this bold P is a multi-index. And so I have little D number of indices. And P1 dot up to P D, they take the integer values. And then because I'm doing complex field theories, then I do have a complex conjugate phi bar. So the partition function can be written in this way. And I'm doing in a physics way. So I have a kinetic term and the also interaction term. And kinetic term is made out of basically quadratic terms. And the k is a kernel of your choice, but trace denotes here that I'm summing over all indices of these tensors. These tensors. And of course, I can also absorb the kinetic term into the measure, Gaussian measure, with a covariance, which is basically the inverse of this kernel K. And then I can also have interaction terms. And in principle, I can have as an infinite number of terms here. So the new there is the convolution. The convolution, so I could have anything. So again, I'm have sorry, sorry, I have this trace denotes basically that I'm contracting these tensor indices. And then each term may come with this coupling constants, lambda. Okay. And each of these terms in the interaction, I can maybe represent it in graphical. Represented in graphical representation. And so here I'm representing the tensors as vertices of these graphs, and then the edges represent the contraction of these indices of these tensors. Okay, and I'll actually tell you about more about this counting of this each term. So we call it tensor invariance or sometimes bubbles. I'll tell you about the counting. I'll tell you about the cap counting of these tensor invariants later. So, if we do after V contraction, it generates D plus one edge colored Feynman graphs. For example, I give you kind of an example of these Feynman graphs. And these, I have actually three tensor invariants, and the dotted lines denote the this is. The after this is after the wing contraction, so propagators. Okay, so remark here is that this k kernel, if it's a trivial delta function, then this model is a statistical model. And we call them these random tensor models. Whereas if I could also have a non-trivial degree of propagating degree of freedom. Propagating degree of freedom, and for example, in this form, and that will give us kind of a QFT rather than a statistical model. And this kind of QFT can be thought of as generalization of these gross Valkenhau models. These are come kind of stemming from the non-commutative geometry, actually. Rhymer. Sorry. Okay. Sorry. Okay. So just again, so after V contraction, these models generate D plus one H colored Feynman graphs. And so these D plus one H colored graphs, sometimes called them in math gems, and they are shown to be dual to simplifial triangulations of piecewise linear D-dimensional pseudo-manifolds. Okay, so in other words, we can say that these random tensors. Say that these random tensor models generate discrete pseudo-manifolds. And if you take this path integral formulation, then it gives us a way to sum over all possible such discrete pseudo-manifolds. Okay, so in this sense, we can say that these random tensor models, these are relevant for random geometric path integral approach to quantum gravity in dimensions. Gravity in dimensions is equal to three or higher. Okay, and also it is well known that in the D, when the dimension is equal to two, which corresponds to matrix models, and it is very successful model where it corresponds, it gives us this two-dimensional level quantum gravity. Okay, so because of that, we can say that random tension models Random tension models is models are promising for this kind of approach, the quantum gravity in dimensions three and higher. Okay, I don't know if it's okay. And if one can also take large n limit where n is a size of tensors, and they're in the leading order, graphs like these don't. These dominate in the leading order, so in the large and limit, and these are called melons, okay. And as you can see, they have kind of a recursive structure, okay. And these melons are quite interesting object, actually. So these melonic two-point functions actually are generating function of fus-catalan numbers. These fus-catalan numbers are generating. Numbers are a generalization of Catalan numbers, for example, and they also correspond to the numbers of Lana D plus one area trees, some example here, and also they correspond to numbers of non-crossing partitions of the certain set, and I give you some example here. Okay, and also suggestively, the Fascadana numbers also count. Numbers also count the moments of free Bessel laws. So there may be some kind of relationship, free probability. So anyhow, they're interesting objects, but at the criticality, it has been shown that the melons fall into the universality class of something called branched polymers. And branched polymers. And branched polymers are basically like a tree-like geometrical object. And so in the context of this random geometric approach to quantum gravity, they are thought of as undesirable. Because in the case of this kind of random geometric quantum gravity approach, Approach. Criticality corresponds to basically the continuum limit. And in that limit, one hopes to get something like our universe in the random geometric quantum gravity approach. So, but in our universe, we think that it's something more connected and large rather than like a tree-like geometrical structure. So, in that sense, these melons are undesirable. Okay, so. Okay, so sorry. So I want to, sorry. So what I want to actually, as a recap a little bit, an approach to quantum gravity can be given by these random geometrical path integral formulations. And I want to a little bit revisit matrix models a little bit. So in the dimension is equal to 2k. Dimension is equal to two case, partition function of quantum gravity can be given by matrix models. So, and the large n expansion of this matrix model partition function is controlled by this topological invariant genus. So, and in the large end limit, g is equal to zero, the genus is equal to zero. In other words, the sphere dominates. And at the And at the criticality, it is shown that they correspond to this Brownian sphere. This is rigorously proven. And furthermore, one can take something called a double scaling limit, in which where you take a large end limit and tune into the criticality in a correlated manner in this way, where kappa of this ratio. This ratio kind of combination is kept constant. And one can basically have all the contributions from all the genera. Okay, so one can take this kind of double scaling limit as well in the matrix model case. On the other hand, if you look at the tensor models, large n limit is controlled by some quantity called grow degree, which is Quantity called grow degree, which is denoted by omega. Okay. And one can see that again, similarly to the matrix model case, when omega is equal to zero, then these class of graphs dominate in the large n limit. And they are again called. So these are called melons. So melons have omega is equal to zero. Okay, and actually these melon, this omega is not a topological invariant, unlike the genus. And so they're actually these melons are subclass of sphere. And one can also find the critical behavior of these melons. And they actually, again, as I said earlier, they correspond to this branched polymer. Yes. So in the way that, so large and limit is basically controlled by this degree, but they are, I don't know if I answered your question, but they mean it. Question, but let me say, so, but they are not topological invariant. Does it make sense? So, I don't know if so, it's kind of analogous to genus in the, so let me say, matrix model case, just like in the matrix model case, sorry, sorry. Yeah. Um, so here, genus is the expansion parameter in the matrix model case, but um in the In the tensor model case, the omega, the growth degree, is the large n expansion parameter. However, genus is topological invariant, but the growth degree is not a topological invariant. So in some way, so if you go to, I don't know if I answered your question. So yeah, in the sub-leading order, there are still some spheres in the sub-leading order in diagn limit. Darge and limit. Does it make sense? Okay. I don't know if. Sorry, yeah, I kind of wrote and I didn't explain. So this is a number of vertices of a graph. Yeah. Sorry, 2p is the number of vertices of a given graph. Sorry. Sorry, I wrote it, but I didn't want to really go into it. Yeah. Going to yeah, so it is still difficult actually, um, unlike the matrix model case, um, to go beyond these melons or subleading orders in this large n limit is difficult. Okay, so then so one of the key questions in random tensor models in the context of quantum gravity is that how do we go beyond this melons? So that's kind of one of the key questions in this. That's one of the key questions in this research program. Okay, so outline of the talk. So motivated by the question of how to go beyond melons and how to escape from melons. So one of the things I have studied is random tensor models with mixed symmetry of unitary and orthogonal. Unitary and orthogonal group. And I'll tell you about the critical limits of some multi-scalings and also some classification of these Feynman graphs of these models. And then I'll generalize a little bit. So instead of two copies of UN and one copy of OD, I'll generalize to the arbitrary number of copies of this unitary orthogonal symmetry. And then I'll tell you about counting. and then i'll tell you about counting of these invariants actually yes these tensor invariants okay so the first part is based on the study with uh dario benedetti sylvan carozza and guillaum vallette and then later on uh with remy avo and matthias vanquoyer nest we also studied some more of these random tensor models Random tensor models. Okay, sorry. So if I have two copies of UN and one copy of OD, we can think of it as n times n times d tensor of order three. So I can also think of it as a collection of d number of matrices of size n times n. Okay. So in this sense, this So, in this sense, this is still a random tensor model, but one can expect that there may be some affinity to matrix models. So, I can also denote, again, these tensors as a vector of complex matrices of size n cross n, where mu runs from one to d. And then I may be able to write in an index notation. To write in an index notation with A and B, where A and B runs from one to n. Sorry? Yes, that's true, yeah. I need another n times n. Times n maybe. I don't know yeah, okay, sorry, yeah. Does it work? I don't know. Sorry. So, and we have this mixed symmetry and these tensors, or which I denote by X mu transforms in this fundamental under fundamental representation of O D. And then I also have independent unitary matrices in distinct UN. So I have two these distinct unitary matrices. Unitary matrices. So they prof uh does it transform in this way? Does it make sense? I don't know. Okay. They're independent, yeah, they're distinct. Okay, so these tensor models admit an expansion in two parameters, which we'll call GNAS G. We'll call genus G and grade L. This is due to the presence of this N parameter N and D actually. And it will give us, as you will see, the more refined classification of Hyman graphs generated by this model. Okay. So in this way, so we are motivated by this fact and kind of we were hoping. Kind of, we were hoping for looking at seeing the possibility of finding a new universality class rather than melons, for example, or melons as in branch polymers. Okay, so this was kind of our motivation. And also some more background in physics is that so these tensor models with these two copies of UN and OD symmetry share similar properties with something called SYK model. Something called a SYK model, which is a holographic model. And this is a toy model for kind of understanding, describing black holes. And also, string theory can interpret this large D limit of these tensor models as the limit of large space-time dimension D in GR. And apparently, this also can keep some important. Can keep some important features of classical black holes. Okay, so this is kind of a physics motivation. So, our model, so I give you a free energy where the action or the weight is given by quadratic term and a quartic term of certain contraction. And sorry, I'm giving you three different kinds of representations of these. Of these Feynman graphs. So one is a stranded representation, and the middle one is a Feynman graph representation. And then we also have colored representation, which I used it earlier when I introduced you the random tensor model. Sorry. But mainly in this talk, I will focus on this Feynman graph representation, but sometimes I have these ones as well. So, but stranded representation is But stranded representation is kind of a straightforward generalization of ribbon graphs. So here I'm doing a tensor model with a tensor. I'm dealing with the tensor with order three. So I have three strands and the middle one is mu nu is associated with the OG and the external ones are associated with the U sector. The youth sector, okay, unitarian group doesn't make sense. Yeah, sorry, yes, sorry, yeah. So I haven't made up the whole graph yet. Sorry, this is just the top row is a propagator and the below is this interaction, the contraction of these tensor indices. Sorry. Okay. So. Okay. So it has been shown that this free energy has expansion in this form with two parameters. One is genus G and the other one is grade L. So this genus G is coming from the ribbon graph associated with the UN sector. And then the grade L actually knows about the OD part. Okay. And Okay, and in this way. So I give you an example of the Feynman graph. This is a simple one, sorry. But this is the this graph, Feynman graph has L is equal to zero and G is equal to one. And suggestively, I draw a torus. Okay. Okay. Yes, so L, you can compute it from sorry. Computed from, sorry, so this V is a number of vertices, and then this VA is a number of OD loops. Kind of skip, yeah. Should I? So for example, this graph has actually OD loop one, two, um, three, sorry, four, actually. And I can compute it from here. Okay. And And as a check, if I set D is equal to N, then this becomes a kind of standard tensor model. And a certain combination of G and L will give you a growth degree. And we can reorganize further, and we will find this certain ratio of N and D appearing. And this we define it as an M and this. Define it as an M, and this is a double scaling parameter, can serve as a double scaling parameter. Okay. Sorry. Yeah, so grab degree is not topological invariant. No, it's not. Yes, exactly. Yes, exactly. So, and if we take this, we can see that we can do this. And if we take this double scaling limit, which is defined by sending n to infinity and big d also to infinity, but keeping a certain ratio of n and d finite, then we end up collecting only l is equal to zero graphs. So in this paper, we have characterized l is equal to zero graphs for any genus. For any genus, and then we also looked at the critical behavior of these L is equal to zero graphs, okay. And then also we looked at this something called triple scaling limit, where we take this M certain ratio of N and D to infinity, but also keeping the coupling to, sorry, sending the coupling to critical coupling value and keeping And keeping a certain ratio finite and fixed. And then, in this way, we can actually, I'll show you that we can actually resume over all possible genera in this limit, triple scaling limit. This is kind of analog of the double scaling limit in the matrix model case. Okay. And then later on, this was actually motivated by Was actually motivated by trying to find, maybe trying to see if there is a topological recursion structure in this bundle or not. And then we characterized a higher L graphs, and I'll talk about it a little bit later. Okay. So, just to give you the taste of what we did, so these are some key objects that we used. So, we used all We used so we used also insertion and removal of melons, and this will keep actually L and G invariant. And another important quantities in this study was something called dipoles. We have three different kinds of dipoles, but what is important, so dipoles are the ones that has actually a loop of length to different kinds. And especially the important one is the Especially the important one is this endipole. Topologically, they basically are like a one handle. Okay. And if you add in a series of these dipoles, we have some objects called basically ladders of different kinds. And we worked on something called scheme, which is different from this growth index scheme, which is the name that we. Just the name that we use scheme, which is equivalent classes of Feynman graphs that keep LNG invariant. Okay. So some important ideas that we relied on is that these Feynman graphs, each of them has at least one OG loop with lengths two, okay, both of them. And the corollary of that. And the corollary of that is that each Feynman graph there exists always at least one end dipole. Okay, in return, this lets us allows us to recursively construct our graphs by order in genus. So, in other words, we can construct higher genus graphs from lower genus graphs recursively. Okay. Okay. And in order to do that, these are the important moves. So insertion and removals of what we call non-separating end dipoles. So if I, for example, look at this end dipole and then I remove this end dipole to this way, then, or I insert n-dipole, I keep L invariable. L invariant, but the genus would change by one. Okay, so this is kind of an important move that we rely on. And I'll show you, sorry, so before I go on to the higher genus graphs, I'll show you this planar. So G is equal to zero, genus is equal to zero graphs. And the top is L is equal to zero graph. And sorry, so this is the Feynman graph representation. So, this is the Feynman graph representation, and then equivalently, this is the stranded representation, okay, on this side. And the second row is the L is equal to one graph, and L is equal to two graph look actually like this, and L is equal to three graph look graphs look like this. This is an exhaustive list, so they all actually represent the sphere. Sorry, okay, because this is planner. Okay, because this is planner. Sorry, just to give you, yeah. So, and then one may wonder what about higher L graphs? We were, sorry, this looks a lot, but we were able to only say something about certain higher L planar graphs. It's quite a simple realization, but we notice that there is a one-to-one correspondence between four. One correspondence between four regular planar graphs and alternating knot diagrams, and so one can, but only we look at this when graphs which have only one OD loop, okay, and you can just look at the alternating knot diagrams listed in roughs and not table, and then you can also perform something called tape fliping moves. Something called tate fliping moves. And you can get these planar higher L graphs with only one OD loop from these moves that are, sorry, 2PI means two particle irreducible or in the graph theory language, it's called bridgeless, I think, bridgeless graphs. And then if you want to get the 2PR graph, so two particle. Graph so two-particle reducible graphs, so they are with the bridges. Um, you need to do perform a connected sum, or also you need to perform a right meister move one. Okay, so this is a nuts coming from Roths and NUT table. And for example, this one is L is equal to zero graph, and then this one is L is equal to three, L is equal to four, etc. Okay, so just some small zero. Some small area. Okay. And then we can go also. We found an exhaustive list of G is equal to one, but L is equal to zero, one, two graphs, and they look like that. And all of them basically represent genus one graphs. Okay, sorry. And basically, topologically, what we are doing is we start out with some. Is we start out with some kind of graphs which represent one manifold, and then by inserting kind of an end-dipole, which acts like a kind of gluing of one handle, we increase the genus by one. And then you can also combine these two graphs and you can create bridged graphs or something called. graphs or something called 2PR reducible, 2 particle irreducible. And if we look at the just L is equal to zero schemes and try to sum over them, it's actually still too hard, but one can go to the kind of sub look at the subclass of these schemes called dominant schemes that contribute the That contributed the dominant singularity, which arises from actually looking at this resumming of these melons. So, this two-point function of the melon actually exhibit square root singularity. And in return, so this is a resumation of these melons, and then they have singularity, and in return, they also the dipos have some singularity. Dipoles have some singularity, and then these ladders also exhibit some singularity. And so we look at this just a subclass of these schemes coming from this melonic singularity. And we have shown that these dominant schemes of L is equal to zero graphs are one-to-one correspondence with the plane binary trees. And this is an example of what. And this is an example of what a kind of a graph that looks like. Okay. And because they are plain binary trees, they are counted by Catalan numbers. And we can resume over all genera. And actually, we can also compute the expectation value of this genus. And actually, they happen to divert. It happens to diverge. Therefore, in the triple scaling limit, large in the sense of large genus random trees dominate. And if you look at actually two particle irreducible dominant schemes, actually they correspond to planar maps. This is an example of such a graph. And one can also And one can also again resume these Planag maps. And in this case, the expectation of genuses happened to be finite. So to summarize, in this study, we studied double and triple scaling limit and we characterize LEZ equal to zero graph any genus. Any genus. And also, we looked at the triple scaling limit, which corresponds to the continuum limit, and we found that we have universality class of trees, again, just like melons. But also, we also found the 2D quantum gravity universality class, this model. And then later on, again, we characterize higher L graphs, and we are still wondering if they. We are still wondering if there is kind of a pattern that we can find a topological recursion in this model. Okay. Okay, any sorry, I don't know if how much was, yeah, if there's any questions, please. And otherwise, if I have time, I'll go into a little bit of enumeration of this more general model. Okay. Okay. Oh, yeah. Um yeah, I guess it was kind of interesting. Yeah, I think it's we kinda yeah right right. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. I think the answer that I can because we can. And so we wanted to see what happens. But I don't know if I if there's any better answer or deeper. Sorry, physical motivation to it. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. You can okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Uh so this this is what you're talking about. Uh okay yeah indeed um indeed yeah maybe we can think of it. Um so here so let's see. So let's see if I can have. Yeah, sorry, I'm going around. So indeed, we can maybe, so for example, yeah, okay. So for example, this one has OD loop, one OD loop, okay. And this one actually also has, sorry, I didn't really explain, so I don't think you can maybe tell, but this one has one OD. But this one has one OD loop. This one also has one OD loop. This one, for example, has three OD loops. So, indeed, if we were trying to connect to links, then this would be one such. I can talk about links here. And we haven't actually thought about it so much. So indeed, that's a good. Yeah. So we may be able to actually indeed. So, we may be able to actually indeed. Right, you can do yeah, right mice to move. Right, right, exactly. So, this one we, I think, so it was so I feel like this is now very deep in a sense of because, sorry, because some prime nuts are and alternating nuts are already listed in the Rothson nut table. So it was easy for us to actually find the higher L L graph. So we are like, oh, okay, rather than try to find all of them, at least if i is equal to one case, sorry, the OD loop is equal to one case, we can find what they look like. So it was, I don't know if I'm not explaining very well, but it was just an easy way to try to see what kind of graphs are there in higher L. Yeah, so this, yeah, but I have to, of course, our graphs are, you know, we have to turn the crossing into vertices. And so we lose a lot of, I mean, it's really quite superficial here. Sorry. We don't really have information of like, you know, not really. It's just, we are just using this rows and not tape. Ross in that table in some way. I don't know if. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, we don't have this. Yeah, we don't care about this information. Yeah. No, yeah, we don't care about the overall under. Sorry, it's quite superficial, this one, sorry. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so I think I have still a little bit of time, right? Yeah, okay. So let me just also talk about. So I just, am I going the right, yeah? So this is, so I just want to talk about another aspect of these random tensor kind of models with mixed symmetry. And so again, this is a work with Remy Avo and Joseph Benjelon. And Joseph Benjelon. Okay. So here, actually, so let me just say. So I'm generalizing the earlier case, which was now I have arbitrary number of U's and arbitrary number of Q's. Oh, sorry, not Q O's. Okay. Okay. So just to tell you the kind of summary of the main results. So we enumerated this Enumerated this mixed symmetry of UNO tensor invariants. And our enumerations actually give us kind of wide array of new integer sequences, which were not previously known in OEIS, for example. And the general order of R and Q. So I'll tell you that the counting can be interpreted. Tell you that the counting can be interpreted as the partition function of TQFT. And in return, so these countings also have a correspondence with countings associated with the covers of some topologies. And then also at the lowest order, when the r is equal to one and q is equal to one, we have found that the number of these invariants correspond to the number of cells. To the number of certain circular words. So there may be some application to linguistics potentially. So it's kind of interesting, it was a kind of interesting problem. So let me try to be a little bit more specific. So we consider a tensor T again transforming under the action of the fundamental representation of this Lie group U. This Lie group mixture of U and O. And in a similar way as before, these tensors transform in this way. And here, actually, this N doesn't have to be the same, and it can be different values. And also, this D doesn't have to be the same D's everywhere. It could be different. But for the purpose of simplification, I may just. Of simplification, I may just not write different ends, n1, etc. Okay. And I may call them UO invariant. And these UO invariants are constructed by contractions of complex tensors of order plus Q. And so, in this way, we can say that, so this is precisely kind of the terms that appear in the Appear in the interaction action that I introduced in the very beginning. Okay, and I can also represent this UO invariant in an algebraically manner. And K is just a kernel composed of a product of Kronecker delta functions, which match the indices of these tensors. So this tensor contraction can be represented. Can be represented by an edge-colored graph. And in turn, this edge-colored graph, we use it to label these tensor invariants. So I give you a diagram of this contraction of n tensors. So I have n number of tensors labeled and then another n number of tensors. Number of tensors T bar, the complex conjugate. Okay, they are labeled for the moment. And the I they represent the indices in the U sector and the J represent indices in the O sector. And sigma represents the contraction in the unitary sector. And then I also have taus that. Also, we have taus that represent the contraction of indices in the orthogonal sector. Okay, so if we focus on the specific case where r is equal to 3 and q is equal to 3, I have permutations sigma 1, sigma 2, sigma 3, and then 3 taus. Okay, but actually I label these tensors so I'm overcome. I'm overcounting these tensor invariants, so I need to remove these labeling. So, in order to do that, I need to introduce another more permutations, gamma one and gamma two. And then I actually also introduced auxiliary vertices to talk about orthogonal sector. So, I also need to remove these labeling and I need to introduce more permutations which are labeled by rows. Okay, sorry. Okay, sorry. So the actual so the equivalence relation that I'm we are working on is given in this way with sigmas, gammas, taus and rows, okay, to count these tensor invariants okay. Yeah. Uh right um yeah. So I guess it's kind of because so the raw Yeah, yeah. Right, so indeed, yeah, sorry, yeah, sorry about that, yeah. worrying about that. Yeah. Yeah, I believe, sorry, I believe we can, this can be switched, but yeah, sorry. Okay. Okay, using this equivalence relation, we can have the counting expression for the counting of UO invariants. Of UO invariance, and it looks like this. So, this argument of this delta means that so this is a condition where this has to be, this product has to be identity. Okay. And that is coming from this. Sorry, in just a second. Sorry, I wanted to go back. This equivalence relations, again. Sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. And so this is an example of enumeration of these tensor invariants in the specific case where R is equal to 3 and Q is equal to 3. And so the number of these tensor invariants actually really rapidly increases. And this is an example where I have four. example where I have four number of tensors and so if you sum all of all of them they sums up to they sum up to 108 of them okay it's just a kind of representing the contraction of these tensors is it okay okay yeah it was not we couldn't find Yeah, it was not, we couldn't find them in the OEIS. Yeah, it's really quite fast. Yes. Okay. And so I want to talk about the correspondence with the TQFT of these counting. So let me just kind of introduce you what we mean by TQFT here. So we consider a cellular. So we consider a cellular complex X and we assign a group element to each edge or one cell. And then also we assign a certain weight to each placket or just two cells. Okay. And then the partition function of this, what we call lattice gauge theory is given in this way. Okay. P is a placquette. And this theory is topological because it is invariant, this partition function is invariant under refinement of the cellular decomposition. If you consider this group to be symmetric group, in other words, or permutation group, then in this paper, for example, they have shown that it has some applications to QFT combinatorics. I won't go. Won't go into the detail. But also, this partition function here, a topological space X, actually, it counts equivalence classes of homomorphisms from the fundamental group of this topological space X to a symmetric group. And this also actually counts equivalence classes of covering spaces of X, actually. So as an simple example, So, as an simple example, let's consider a torus realized as a rectangle. And so, then the partition function of this lattice gauge theory is given in this way. Again, this argument of this delta function should be equal to ID, which is kind of given by the fact that we have this two-cell. Okay. And so, and this gamma And so, and this gamma and sigma are the generators of the fundamental group of the torus. And so, this partition function actually counts the covers of the torus. Okay. So, recalling what the expression for the counting of our UO invariants of arbitrary order looks like, actually, we can reformulate our enumeration of these tensor invariants. Tensor invariants in TQFT. And actually, this is a special case of when R is 3 and Q is 4. And they correspond to, actually, we are talking about this cellular, specific cellular complex X. Okay. And we can further massage this expression of the counting of your invariants. And one notices that. And one notices that actually there are so there are actually our number of sigmas. So we have our permutations under this conjugation. And in the group generated by these R generators, the sigmas, they are subject to one relation given in this delta. So this has to be equal to identity. And we can say that this actually corresponds. This actually corresponds to the fundamental group of the two-sphere with our number of punctures. Okay, so in this way, we can say that our counting or your invariance actually corresponds to counting the covers of the R-punctured sphere. So, okay. So, the conclusion here in this enumeration of your invariance is that. Of your invariance is that we have found new sequences, integer sequences. And also, we so there are some studies earlier by Joseph Benjelin and also Remy Avob and other people on the just simply unitary case and orthogonal, simply orthogonal case. And also, our case was a UO mixture. Case was a UO mixture of UO, and all of them we found that our countings have correspondence with the covers of either the sphere or the torus, actually. And so we are curious what kind of tensors or kind of transformations may possibly give us this counting of the covers of maybe non-orientable manifolds such as. Maybe non-orientable manifolds, such as maybe the Klein bottle. So, this is our kind of future potential curiosity. Okay. Sorry. So, this is the end. So, sorry, yeah. I just wanted to kind of introduce you this random tensor models with mixed symmetry. Thank you.
