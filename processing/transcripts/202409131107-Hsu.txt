Introduce you. It's my great pleasure to introduce Alcon Schu and we will talk about stochastic completeness of the tangular space. Thanks for the invitation. I won't say that this is one of the very fascinating and nice conferences we have and I have. And I always find it's an honor to be the last talk. I started with David a long time ago. I sent him my abstract late and Attract late, and I was given the last talk. I thought that's a punishment. But then David told me it's order. Okay, so here are two things, okay? The gas continuous and the Tai Chos space. So my job is to tell you what these two things are and how to combine them and do something about it. Okay, um okay, the stochastic completeness, if you want to say it in a very simple word, simply means that Browning motion is going to run for all time. Lifetime Browning motion is going to be infinity. And that's a problem that not only probabilists are interested in, analysts and geometers are also very interested in. As a matter of fact, the first major As a matter of fact, the first major sort of theorem was proved by Meow in 1978. It proved that if a complete manifold curvature is bounded from below in negative constant, the heat kernel is conservative. Okay, so Brownian motion, I'm not going to tell you the fancy way to define Brownian motion on manifolds. I'm just going to say that if you have the heat equation, the We have the heat equation, the standard heat equation, you know, the standard heat equations like that. And I actually noticed that some of our fellow problems, they put the provovia factor one or two and put the ground in motion, square root two, ground. We should stand firm on our ground, not to the problem, to the analyst. Okay, so here. Okay. Um and P here okay. So uh and P, no T X Y and no, you can't take something like that, and T equals to zero is the, no, it's the delta function and X Y. Okay, so this is the heat equation. As long as you have a Caplacian, you can talk about this equation. Can talk about this equation, and you're talking about positive solutions. And among all the possible solutions, which actually correspond to various boundary conditions, there is a smallest one. The smallest one usually intuitively corresponds to the Durich boundary conditions. Okay, so let's find the positive, positive. Positive, minimal, no solution, and that's the heat kernel I'm talking about. And this, as long as you have a Riemannian manifold, it doesn't have to be a complete, just any Riemannian manifold, you're going to have a positive minimal solution. Okay, so you can have colour just y. And Brownian motion simply means a diffusion process that takes this as transition as a function. So you can say P x brownie motion at T in set A is precisely given by the integral of C of P m t x y. Okay, so this is the definition of The definition of remaining brown emotional manifold. I'm going to take. Okay, so well, if you want the details, you can see, see my work, I have like a more, you know, better way of defining this. Okay, so well, then clearly that there will be cases where the brand motion will not be around for all time. Okay, suppose that you are at a bounded region, you know, you start. Region, you know, you start with the Brownian motion. You know, this boundary region is a remaining manifold without boundary, right? If you really think that way, okay, you have a brownie motion, and then there's a lifetime. The first time it hits the boundary, you cannot go beyond that. So, this, okay, every diffusion process on manifold comes naturally with a lifetime. Okay, so this is the lifetime, you can say E of X. E of x, okay, is the lifetime lifetime of, you know, x. And that's a random variable associated intrinsically with any Riemann manifold. Okay, so this letter E. Okay, so the question is whether this Random variable c equals infinity with probability one amount. Okay, so the key observation is this. Okay, the probability is start from x, okay. dx is greater than time, okay, greater than time t, is actually equal to the integral, m of t dxy dy. So without any assumptions, this number can be strictly less than one. Can be strictly less than one. You can actually show that if this is equal to one for one pair of XP, it's going to be true for all T. So the stochastic completeness, so we say M is stochastic complete means that the total integral. Okay, integral m p t. You can see, you know, this is quite the way that geometers will talk about. Okay. Oh, in geometry, they call the conservation of the heat current. Same thing. That's for all T and X. For all T and X. Just for all T. For one, T and X. For one T and X will be then implied by morphological property for all T and X. Okay? Because you know, you know, this is true all the time. You get P M T X Y less m okay, so this is the question. If a manifold is stochastically complete, means that this integral is means that this integral is equal to 1 and the equivalent for us you know for me at least it means that that e of x is 1 is equal to 1 so stochastic completeness is different from geometrically completeness okay geometric completeness means that the Riemann manifold as a metric space is a complete metric space this is not a complete metric space This is not a complete metric space, okay, because boundary doesn't count. Okay, you have an open manifold. It's not a complete metric space from geometric point of view. Can I point to me means the brand emotion is going to run out all the time. Okay, so one thing I all the theorems, you know, before I prove that many others, you know, worked on this problem. Others worked on this problem for like 30 years, okay? Until I'm not took my horn, I give the sort of last word to the problem. Okay, so usually, all the theorems are proved under. Under the assumption under the assumption that M is geodesic complete. So geodesic complete means geometric complete. So probably I should describe these two sensors do not necessarily imply Necessarily imply each other. Suppose you have done R2. R2, if you take a point out, that's not a geometric complete, but it's probability complete because the brown emotions are going to hit that point. But this geometric problem about completing before always proved another hypothesis that might come. Okay, so just to intrigue me, the Me, the whole thing starts to intrigue me. Then I find out that Tai-Smirla space is a space of reaching curvature boundary below above by a constant if it's complete. The theorem would be obvious. But this Teister space, the curvature does not have bound, but the reach of curvature has the right bound. To the reacher curve, you have the run power. Okay, so that means that, but you know, Tachemo space is not a complete metric space, so you can't really quote the theorem. Okay, so that's why I got into this. And here's a good example that you have to deal with non-completeness. You have to find some way to prove that you cannot use curvature to prove that you can use the curvature of body to prove that. Okay, to prove that the manifolds say probabilistic complete. Okay, so now I'm done with the definition of stochastic completeness. Now I have the hard job to tell you what the type smaller space is. Okay, so it took me a long time to actually try to get into this subject and try to understand what people have done. To understand what people have done, and this is a huge project. People spend their career on this, you know, title-million-space theory. So, I can only sort of just try to Google and find out what they know and what I can use from them. Okay, so let me just tell you what the task force space is, and then I tell you how you're going to show this tashmar space. It's incomplete. It's incomplete, minor, manifold, but you know, it's not going to be why it's still stochastic complete. Okay, so high school space is a way to parametrize reman surfaces of a fixed genus. Okay? What does genus mean? Okay, what does genus mean? So you have a circle, you have a ball, genus equal to zero, you have a torus, genus equal to one, and then you can just add more holes, you know, things like that. You get two, things like that. And this is equal to two in the ground. Okay, so there's a classification theorem telling you that every enclosed-oriented, you know. You know, two-dimensional surface is one of these. Okay? And all of them can be put a complex structure. Okay, that means that it can be, you know, put a complex structure means regardless as one-dimensional complex manifold. Okay, so Riemann had the idea that let's consider the space of complex structures on the fixed space like that. Like that. So Riemann says that this whole space of complex structures has the six finest C, six parameters. So here's what Riemann thought. Riemann thought that the space of complex structures, let's say, a surface. Let's say a surface of gene is G. No, for maybe you say 4G, okay, is 6G minus 6. Okay, that's not precisely correct. At least, you know, this is for gene that's equal to it. This is trivial. This is calculatable. Once you've got this, you have to resort to abstract theory. Okay, so I basically ignored this. Basically, ignore this, you know, and this may be tell you a hint of how this can be done, and the hard thing is. Okay, so this problem has been studied for many, many years. Okay, so here, here what the Teism space is. Okay, so you are given a reference manifold. S is a reference. Reference, reference surface. And then you look at, okay, you look at this picture. I have S and F. So this would be a complex manifold of dimension one. Okay, G, G is fixed. Okay, G is fixed. And then F is what? So S is a surface. Okay, use a surface as a complex manifold when you say surface it has to be paraphrased of dimension one and genus G okay. And what is F? F is the Is the map, a different morphism? So the way to make this rigorous, this has been done for many, many years, is not just to consider an arbitrary one, but consider this pair. So each pair like that is a point in the complex structure. Of course, there are complex. Okay, of course, their complex structures, they are the same. Same means there's a different morphism between the two. Okay, just that different morphism not only is a different morphism, it's actually a holomorphic map. So you say S1, okay, S2, then you get a map. S0, F1, you know, F2, oh, here, 0. F2, oh here, zero, okay, F2, okay? And this is the picture here, this is the picture, if you can find a holomorphic map here, you identify these two pairs. So you say that S1, F1, the same as S2, F2. If this picture holds. So, I mean, this is just a Okay, so I mean this is just a way to to uh to to uh identify two main complex structures and make sure that the equivalent ones are down. Okay. What kind of map does H have to be? Where? H? Any homomorphic complex? Holomorphic map. This is a complex, this is complex. If you have this map, okay, so this would be called this would be equivalence here. Equivalence here. Okay, so here is the terminology. Mg is equal to the space of complex structures on M modular this relation. Okay, this is called a modulus. Okay, now this space turned out to be very bad. It's not even a manifold here. Okay, so people thought going a little bit further, okay? Make a slow. Further, okay, make it slightly larger, and maybe the structure will be better. Now, it says that if Tg, okay, this is called a modular space. Monte space. And this is called the Heishmurler space. Heichrella space simply means that not only this picture, okay, I want to impose a further picture, a further condition, to make space larger, okay? Make space larger. So, Heismüller space means same stuff here, but a modular, you know, zero here. What does that zero mean? Okay, zero means that this map here, okay, so this, okay, zero means, okay, if you go from here to here to here, right, so you have like what you go after one, okay. Like what? You've got F1, okay, H, and F2, inverse. Okay, see here, okay. This becomes a map from here to here. Okay, you insist that not only this is a nice map, it has to be smoothly movable to identity maps. This is the idea of Ashmergle. If you read biography with Ashmerler, you know he's not a good person. So yeah, yeah. I mean he died when he was 30, but between 25 and 30 he was so active in Nazi Party after Germany almost lost wall. He volunteered to go to the East Front to fight Russians. And then he just disappeared, okay? So that's now the Lord's apart, but he only lived the thirty years and he didn't run for Years and he didn't run for T. Okay, so if you insert the condition that this map, okay, what he calls homotopic to the identity map, then it's this. So this relation is larger than this. These are smaller pieces. That means that this guy is smaller than this. This is really the thing amazingly that make the whole thing work. Amazingly, that makes the whole thing work. Okay, you have Teishmore space is a quotient of Teism space. So this is more restrictive relation, therefore this will be a quotient. Okay? So that means that, you know. That, you know, modular space, okay, is Touchworld space quoted by something, right? Okay, quotient by something, okay. Now, this is amazing object I only learned last year, okay? It's called mapping class group of, you know, um, of GNSG. Okay, so this guy, oh, maybe I just ignored mapping class group. Okay, so M C G is called mapping class group. Mapping class group. This is discovered at the end of 20th century? No, 19th century. What is this? Okay, mapping black group is all the diffromorphism of S0, modular ones that can be smoothly moved to identity. Okay, modular homotopic to identity. Okay, so And, okay, what people know is that there is a natural remaining structure. Okay, so good thing about the modular space is that it's actually a very simple topology. So here, here, here's a fact. TG is a Okay, is a you know is it connected? Okay it's actually you know homeomorphic a region of C 3G minus 3 okay and um um exactly topologically above. Slightly topologically evolved. Topologically evolved. Very nice space. Okay, so you see, that's why 6, 3g minus 3, okay? Because Riemann conjectured that the space of complex structures is described by 6 minus g real parameters, and then it's the complex parameter. And then that's the count. Okay, and okay, um, mg, okay, is now now that's good. Okay, this is certainly a nice complex manifold of dimension 3g minus g, okay? So that the whole point here is that mg is not a complex manifold, okay? It has some certain bad points, okay? So this is what they call orbifolds. This is what they call order folds. And this is something I learned. Okay, now you all know the definition of a manifold, right? Manifold means at every point it's homeomorphic to Rn. What Oberfork means is that at every point it's not homomorphic, not necessarily homomorphic to Rn, but homomorphic. Homomorphic to Rn, but homomorphic to Rn modular finite group. It can have a corner of a multiple of that is 360 degrees, something like that, right? So it's not operator, that means this manifold can look like something like that. Okay? And here's a corner, 300 pi over. Pi over, you know, six, let's say. Okay, so, and then you turn around 12 times. No, this is approximate. Three, three, we did that together. If you turn around six times, it becomes the whole thing, right? Oh, okay. So that's an orbital, okay? It's not a manifold, okay? But, you know, I later find out that geometers really love to. Geometers, you really love to study orbit for plastic and stuff like that. They all come up. Okay. Next thing is a big industry is to study various compatifications of time-member space. You see, a time-member space is only a region, right? So that means that it has a boundary in this region here, right? So as we Here, right? So, as we study Martin boundary, they want to study what happened to Riemann surfaces when you approach the boundary elements. So, boundary theory is the motivation of the whole thing. Even that's also the motivation I have long studied brand emotionalization of the space. Okay, well, what you need to have, okay, is. To have, okay, is that you need to have a Riemannian metric, you know, to do Brownian motion, right? Okay, remember that each point here represent a Riemann surface, represent a complex structure on that. So when I say running Brown in motion on this, I'm saying that every point of the Browning motion particle represents a Riemann surface. Okay, as it moves. Greenland surface. Okay, as you move along, it just gives you a different structure, complex structure on the group. Okay, so here is the remaining metric. Okay, it's called a bio. Here's some metric. Usually, you know, they write this as W by E. Bio-Petersymmetric is a God-given natural. God given natural metric on the Teismur space. There are, I check, there are seven or eight natural metrics on that. Geometers are study, you know, many of them, like Yao in minus three of them. Okay, and there's a Teischmüller metric done by Teismüller. There are all kinds of metrics here. Then I asked them, saying that, you know, why? After saying that, you know, why people don't study this metric. Okay? Well, they say this metric is neglected because under this metric, the manifold is not complete. This is the main reason why they don't like this metric. But there are at least one person who wrote a book on that. I think I'll put it in Dr. Will. Not very book. I too heard pretty much gets from this book. Okay, so, and this metric is a good metric from our point of view because it is a Riemannian metric. Okay? It's a Riemannian metric. Not only it's Riemannian metric, it's Riemannian metric on a complex Complex manifold, it's actually calorimagic. Whatever that means, okay? Because if you read all these complex analysis or several kinds of papers, they always say, you know, assume, you know, I'm going to say Taylor Alan Fox. Okay, so Taylor make really nice, okay? Taylor Manafo. Okay, unfortunately, these are the good points. These are the good points. There are many good points. Oh, I actually forgot. There's a lot more. Invariant. Because you really want your metric to descend from this to here. It has to be invariant under the invariant under mapping class model. Okay, so this has all the good properties for us, except that I cannot code my old theorems to show this is. Theorems to show this is complete. It's got complete simply because this is not even metric. And this is known for a fact. Not that people try to prove that's complete. They actually prove this is not stochastic. Okay, so that then is this. These are good. That is not, you know, T G under Um under the S squared, it's not, it's not, okay? It's no, not not complete. Of course you want to run the brown emotion. The first thing you want to prove is to show the brown motion can run for all time, okay? And then you can talk about norms and boundaries and things like that. Okay, so this is basically This is basically what I learned last year, and then I, you know, to ask people, you know, they know anything about the brown emotion, blah, blah, blah. And I thought the first thing, you know, I need to show this is not, this is a list, Casi complete. So I started to dig, okay. Now, lucky for me, okay, all the ingredients I need is actually been known. Okay, all we need is to find. Okay, all we need is to find out. But then, one expert is not enough because one expert knows this far landslide. You really have to ask many people and find out and combine the knowledge. And finally, I find the problems not that hard. Okay? Well, after you do this. So let me write down the ingredients I need for the proof. And once you see that, you can almost say your theorem is solving. Say your theorem is logics. Okay, well, I mean, the effort is that really to find all these ingredients here. Okay, this also shows that if you do stochastic analysis and geometry, if you know a bit of both, you know, if you plus together one plus one equals three, you know, this actual one is your theorem. Right? Okay, so here are the key facts. The key facts. The key facts make the whole thing work. Remember that this is not a manifold, but this is a manifold. So there are bad points there. My whole point is that the bad points are so small. In my old days, my advisor was posted, this is a polar set. Polar set simply means a set so small that your process will not see that. Okay? It is there. See that. It is there, but it's not going to see that. So, here is the ingredients you need. And basically, that's the proof. You just simply combine them. So, the first thing is how big is the set, is the bad set. So, you have this Mg, well, Mg. Mg is called modular, okay? Modular space. Modular space. Modular space is really the space of complex structures. No, Titanual space was introduced to study modular space. Simply go Titan space and larger behaves better. Now, modular space has a singular part. Modular space is orbiform. At the point where it's not a manifold, there is a group acting on that. Acting on that. Just based on that, there's this fancy theorem called 64 theorem. No, 84 theorem. There's this, of course, 84 theorem shows that no matter what, the degree is always bounded by 84 g minus 1. So that means that you really, you know, although the point can be bad, the order of bad points Of with the bad points is finite. Not only that, so here's the first fact. So you make out of D singular points, which means that if you take D off, if you take D off, it's a good manifold. You may create many holes, but here, unfortunately, not only points, you may take away a whole sub-manifold. Okay? So the first Okay, so the first thing is that D has co-dimension at least two. I actually think they actually proved that's exactly two, but that's not. Okay, now, codimension two, it's complex. That means that it's going to be re-dimensional actually four, okay? Which means that if you look at Which means that if you look at brown emotion, if something is four degrees below, you're not missing it. Okay, so that's really hopeful. Okay, so this has a very small, you know, the theorem is actually Mg is an algebraic variety with singular sub-variety. Okay, two, this is something I spent so much time to find out. Find out I pin down. And finally, I pinned down a complete proof, only done in 2007 or something. Okay, a very beautiful paper. But this fact has been known. It's that very important. Under my Peterson metric, Mg has finite volume. So Mg has finite volume. Why is that important? If you have a Markov process, If you have a Markrow process, it has an invariant finite volume, which charges the whole space, it's recurrent. Recurrent means lifetime is equal to infinity. But you have to make sure that the bad sides are small so you won't be sucked into these bad sides, right? Okay, so that's an but remember, I actually want to do ground in motion here, you know. Browning motion here. This is my Brownian motion. And this is just the projection process, right? This is just projected. So the best set here is small. It may be big here. What is the next thing you need to have? Well, you want to make sure your group is not too big. Well, that's been known at the end of the 19th century. Known at the end of the 19th century, it's countable. That's the countable group. So, this mapping class group is countable. I think this is proved by Fricker or something. This is very, okay? This is a countable set. Okay, so here will be the. So here will be the picture, right? If you're wanting to get rid of all the bad points, you have a perfect projection map. You actually have a covering, right? So, okay, so here will be this. Okay, PG, if I get rid of this map, these best sets would be pi inverse of D, okay? And then I have pi here. Pi here and then it goes to mg minus d here. This is a polar, okay? This is countable, it means when you go up, you know, at most, it's a countable union polar set. Okay, when I was graduating, I even knew, you know, countable union polar set is still polar. Good. Okay, so that means that. Okay, so that means that D, okay, so the consequence of these, okay, is that D is polar, okay, you know, D is polar because it has a very low dimension, then D star is polar, okay? That's because the component is polar, okay, you go up. Okay, so that means that if you're willing to take away these. Will you take away these bad sets? If you have a brown emotion here, you project your brown emotion here. Now, this will not hit, this process will not hit that. That means you actually, if you take away these points, you have a brown emotion on this smooth part of the Of the modular space. That smooth part module space would not see these things. These are not just points. These can be a line, can be a sub-manifold. But the thing is that the space is so big. This is really small. So that means that. So pi XT, okay, has Okay, as infinite lifetime. Okay. Infinite lifetime. Okay. Based on the fact the remaining volume measure, okay, is a smooth measure on a space. It's invariant of that. That's the definition of Brownian motion. Brownian motion has the E kernel as the transition density and the volume measure. The volume measure is measured. Okay? And then if this has infinite lifetime, this has this projectile. So that means that XT has infinite lifetime and that's the field. That's the few. So, modular all the technical details. This is what you need. Figure out all these, make sure you find that they're all true and then you find out that this is fine. Okay, so what I'm going to do next, okay? What I'm going to do next is to tell geometers that there's another competitive That there's another competent they don't know. It's called the Martin competent. That means that this Martin competition is tied to the potential theory. So the space can be very complicated. You have this Martin boundary. There's also a harmonic measure on the Martin boundary. So there are all kinds of things you can do. And I'm just the first. I'm just the first thing I want now is to make sure that all the competitions, the 708 competitions, they did, okay? It's not, none of them is a martin competition. That means that you do have something new to work on. The second thing would be every martin boundary point corresponds to a degenerate Riemann surface. The question is how you want to describe. As your ground in motion. Okay, as your brown emotion approaches the marketing boundary point, how is the Riemann surface structure going to evolve until you get something, you end up with a singular Riemann surface? So this is all I want to say. And I really appreciate you guys at the conference. Let's give, you know, talk first of all, thank you. First of all, thank you. Thank you. I think there was excellent research problem here. Any questions before we should have? You did say at one point that the projected process describes this crown motion on the module space. It is you after you take away After you take away, you have to make sure this is not a manifold. This is not a covered map. This is not a covered map. There are fixed points here. There are like a continuum of fixed points. Every point may have an automorphism of degree 2 or 3. The typical case will be G plus 1 case. The Techner modern case is this. Space is this. No. This. Oh, this is zero here. Okay. Tyformula space, one, is the whole upper half. So there are two bad points. Okay. This has to be identified with this, and this part, you know, identify that part. But there are two bad points here. Okay, this is a bad point of order three. This is a bad point of order two. Okay, so here, obvious, if you run a brand in motion, you can. If you run a brand in motion because there's only two points, you won't see that. And for this more sophisticated, you really have to pull from thing once again. So this is not a mapping. This without taking out this malad cover map. Okay, so there's a little bit just technical. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm probably the least human being client in the room, but is that a curious? Just out of curiosity, how do you know, like, you know, D has covered mention at least? This is a hard theorem. Yeah, okay. This is in Sam Donaldson had the book called The Remann Surfaces. You know, I asked so many people, they all say, oh, this is just folklore in the industry there. That's just one thing upon my land. But only, I can only know, I can only say that Seven Downs is very beautiful. 7 downs is very beautiful remote surface quote. Okay, mention that. Say that the code I mentioned. By the way, this is only true for G really quotes 3. For 1 and 2, you have to do something else. So you really have to rely on them. But I actually don't know where to put the paper. If I write this up, I have to trace it down. I was wondering if there is some uh uh way of uh talking about Martin boundary on the mapping class group for some random walk on the mapping class group uh which would be same as this uh oh martin boundary on the oh oh you want to do a run and walk yeah exactly i mean even this is a brand new i don't think people have got the portal of jumping around complex projects yeah but then this may be a good idea when you mark you know When you model another group, you may have some kind of grid there. I mean, the modeling space is like a fundamental domain that you kind of tie using. The whole surface, the whole upper half-plane is tied by this, and the magnet class group, you know, is actually as. No, it's actually SL2Z. This is Mapping glass group. You will see that every point, you know, the fixed subgroup is order 1, except these two points. The fixed subgroup is order 3, order 2. That's off. So that's why the bad points are small. I was wondering how explicit you can be. So you have there are natural coordinates that on the when you look at tables and I wonder what way is the broad emotional hierogeneous case thing? Or are you talking about this case? I mean this is the case. It's just the hyperbolic brownie motion. Although there is a boundary. Well, there is a boundary here, but the round motion is not fit, so the prime is not. So you can cut your. So if you have a genus with geodes, you can cut it like this. Oh yeah. Okay, and that gives you an explicit set of coordinates. The geometer has so many ways of stand-up coordinates on this, okay? But unfortunately, this for them is just a very bad metric. There's no natural coordinates. There's no natural cores they actually use that. But there are other compatifications where metrics they're not, they call it a Finzler metric, they're not Romanic metric, where they have a very nice natural coordinates to work out. But for this metric, people usually, the people in that business don't want to touch this metric. Only one person. Robber, welcome. We have one online question, right? David? Chuckle? No, wait. I thought David... It's different, David. Oh, different. Yeah, my question is, what do you do with this Brownian motion on height motor space, right? I guess it somehow gives you a way to create a surface randomly. And like, what do you do with this surface? What do you do with this surface after you've created it? Okay, so this is precisely what I say. At the end, now I have Brown emotion. I can use Brown emotion to talk about Martin boundary. And the way Martin boundary is set up is that every Brownie motion, Brownie motion, you know, with probability one, converge to a point on the marting boundary, not completely perceived. Not completely precisely. And then I want to study the asymptotic behavior of complex structures. Now, you may ask me why I want to do that. I don't know. All the demographers spend their lifetime doing that. You know, I thought this was a good project from a completely different point of view. Okay, I tested on them. They say that they never thought of doing brand new motion and do the martin bomb. Okay, so now you have. So now you have eight complications. Maybe there's one more complication of that patient. We'll see. Any other questions? A naive question. So if the ground amount of the base base has infinite uh lifetime, then the lifted by the which does it depend on the I think this is a general fact. I mean, I just think that if brand motion dies in finite time when you project, it's going to die here. So if you think this is going to run for any time, the lifting ground motion is going to run. I guess it's the properties of the map tell you that the Brownian motion downstairs is the lift, is projection of Brownian Brownian. Injection for anybody. After you take away all the bad points. And that's where you use it as a bad thing. That's right. Great. Thank you very much. I really appreciate that Masha, Tai, and June Snow. Okay, yeah. And this is really a wonderful conference and this wonderful place. And I have to say that every And I have to say that every talk I want actually sit there and want to know what it's about. So rarely you attend a conference, you have such high attention to all this talk. So I'm pretty sure that everybody who are here or who are gone, I really appreciate you guys having this wonderful conference. And I think they deserve our applause for their great effort of getting us together. Thanks for coming. Hope to see yourself. Like lunch. For those who need to stay. This is probably going to be research. Let's go. I think there is a finish up.
