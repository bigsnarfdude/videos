Okay, so thank you, Edisa, very much for the introduction, and thank you to all the organizers. I'm very sorry that I cannot meet all of you in person, but I'm still happy to participate online. Okay, so I will be talking about kind of two topics, as the title may suggest, that I've been interested into in the past few years, which are moving heterogeneities and/fin heterogeneities of. And or shifting heterogeneities or forced speed problems. You may have heard about it in the different names. And the reaction division systems. So I know that the time is short. So actually, I kind of apologize in advance. So I won't go into any mathematical proof or anything, or even it will be quite light in the results. But I will try to be talking more about how these two topics are related, and especially how the first one kinda tells us how difficult. That tells us how difficult the subantopic Russian division system is. Okay, so I know that probably most, if not all of you, are already quite familiar with this kind of subject. So, of course, production division systems arise in a wide variety of applications. But to fix the ideas, let's picture population dynamics. So, we have a system of several equations, and each of these equations represents the Each of these equations represents the evolution of the density of some species. So we can picture any type of interaction that you want between the species. I will be talking about that anyway again later. So of course these collaboration deficient systems will depend on a lot of what exactly you put in this equation and especially for reaction term f but typically you will have some number of steady states and which may be stable or unstable and we will see some kind of Unstable, and we will see some kind of a traveling front connecting both several steady states. And so, this is, of course, the kind of thing that I am interested in. But more specifically, today I will be talking about the Cauchy problem, the time evolution problem, and the spreading speeds of each of the invading species of such Russian deficiency systems. So, of course, it's very vague when I put it like that, because the Russian defusion systems are many different Russian defensive systems of many types, but this is basically the Systems of many types, but this is basically the kind of things that I want to discuss about today. And so, of course, I mentioned project speeds. I assume that most of you know what we mean by that when talking about Cauchy problem, not just tonic fronts. But let me still briefly recall this anyway, and I will start with the most simple case of not an actual system, but just the case of a single scalar reaction diffusion equation. A scalar reaction diffusion equation. So, of course, there is a very wide literature on this kind of equation with traveling forms, waiting speeds, and all this stuff, starting from those very similar papers by Fisher, Kolmogorov, Peterskin, Piscuno, Francon van Berger, Fife MacLern, and many others. And basically, the core results, which allows me to define what I mean here by spinning speed, is that, again, I'm very, very vague, which will be the case for most of the talk. Case for most of the talk. I'm sorry about that. But, anyways, for many choices of reaction term F and for many choices of initial data, there exists a well-defined real number C star. That's what I call spinning speed, such that if you look at a moving frame with a speed larger than C star, you see the solution converges to some tubular steady state zero, which of course implies that F of zero should be zero. F of zero should be zero for what I'm writing here to make sense. Again, I'm not going into the details on all that, but again, I know that you're familiar with monostable, bi-stable equation, stuff like that. And anyway, if you move it in a moving frame with speed strictly less than the C star, then so here I wrote it in a slightly weaker way, but maybe if we think about monostable or bi-stable, the solution is going to be. The solution is going to be to converge to some positive steady state, which usually we normalize to be one, but let's just stay this way. You converge to some positive steady state. And again, it's actually rather generic. So in particular, I insisted here on this slide on monostable and bi-stable cases, because those are the cases on which most of the literature is focused on. But you can actually extend it for even more complicated linear. Complicated non-linearities, in particular, what I call you multistable. So, when you have a finite but arbitrary large number of steady states. So, in this case, it becomes a bit more complicated because you don't have one spreading speed, but you have possibly several splitting speeds and several transitions, several traveling fonts connecting different steady states. So, this is what my five and mclaude called minimal deep position. More recently, with Arnold Duclan and Hilo Shimatano, we called it Hiro Shimatano, we called it propagating teras, and also this notion was extended by Peter Polochink under the name of system of ways in some even more general situation. So again, I'm staying a bit vague on all these things. What I want to say is that in some sense, the scalar action with an equation is well understood, at least as far as this printing speed issue for typical classes of niches that are. Typical classes of niche data is concerned. And now, what about systems? And so, actually, as far as Calais question goes, the main tool in the proofs of spreading speeds is usually the comparison principle. And so, as a matter of fact, as soon as you have a comparison principle, I mean, what I'm trying to say is that all those results that I I'm trying to say is that all those results that I just mentioned don't rely so much on the fact that it's a scalar equation. They rather rely on the fact that there is a comparison principle. And so all of those results that I mentioned are more or less usually true as long as the, if you consider a system, as long as this system also have a comparison principle. And so the class of fraction deficient systems which have a comparison principle are called cooperative systems, which basically relies on the basically means that the coupling term It basically means that the coupling term are increasing. So, this in this capital F, with old F, each component Fi is increasing, what is non-decreasing in the variables UJ with J different than one. So, it's of course relatively intuitive because basically each species helps the others, so it reinforces the order. Um, the order between the solutions. The computer principle, of course, is that when you have two ordered initial data, the resulting solutions are also ordered. So, the fact that complete terms have a good monotonicity help preserve this order. And also, I mentioned a few offers on that. In particular, as a group around Weinberger and Roger Luis, we did a bunch of papers on this kind of cooperative system, but also from NGO and some. So Farmenjo and some others. Anyway, and you can also extend this remark to some systems which are not exactly cooperative because there are also a few systems that are cooperative up to a change of variables. So the most classical example is the two-species competition system. So here we call it competition because the coupling term in both equations are negative. So it means that U has a negative effect on V and V has a negative effect on U. V has a negative effect on u. And so it does not satisfy the cooperative assumption that I wrote above, but actually, if you replace u by minus u, you write the system in this new variable and it becomes cooperative. And so you have a composite principle up to this channel variable. And you can also construct turdling wave and stuff like that. There are some other difficulties related to the fact that it's a system, but in some sense, we can do spreading for this graph system. I don't want to oversimplify. I don't want to oversimplify. I know that maybe some people in the audience have worked on this and it can be more difficult than that, but it's not the worst situation. I guess we can say it like this. But now the question is, what if we don't have a comparison principle and can we still look at the spreading speed for such a problem? And which most natural example would be a prey predator system. So prey predator, of course, one species has a negative effect on the other and the other species. A negative effect on the other, and the other species has a positive effect on the first. And so, you cannot reduce this problem to a cooperative system, and there is no kind of a component principle for this. So, of course, there are still a lot of works for this kind of system, but mostly on the existence of charge leg waves, which can be done by methods which do not necessarily rely on computer principle, like OD methods, topological degree fixed points. But anyway, so I don't want to lose too much time on this. I don't want to lose too much time on this. So, what I just want to highlight is that even if you know that there is a charming wave, it's difficult to infer information from that on the Cauchy problem because you cannot. Usually, what you would do for the scalar equation is that you would compare a general solution with a traveling wave, thanks to the comparison principle, and get some more information on the large-band behavior like that. But when you don't have a comparison principle, it's not so in some sense. In some sense, not so helpful to construct these kind of spatial solutions. It gives some insight, of course, but as far as rigorous analysis goes, it's difficult to go from spatial solutions to more general solutions. But still, so I'm saying that, but actually, and it was written on my previous slide, but I'm trying to go a bit fast because I don't have much time. So there are still some specific systems. Still, some specific systems which don't have a comprehensive principle, but where we still manage to compute some spreading speeds. And it's not to be narcissistic, but it's the paper that I know best because it's one that I helped write with Arnold and Hiroshimatano. So this is one I choose to talk about. So one case where we cannot compute with spending speed is this one. So this works system with one point one predator. One prey and one predator. So, just to comment briefly on this, so you can see that it is a new predator. So, here U is the prey and V is the predator, because the coupling time in the U equation is negative and coupling time in the V equation is positive. And of the other particularities of the system is that when there is no predator, when V is equal to zero, then U satisfies the KPP equation. So, U grows when there is no predator, which sounds reasonable enough. And on the other hand, when there is no prey, when U is equal to 0. On the other hand, when there is no pry, when u is equal to zero, then the reaction term for v is negative, so v goes to zero when there is no prior, which again sounds reasonable enough. Anyway, I won't go into any detail of the proof, but we can compute the spreading speed in use case. And the two spreading speeds of those two species are given by these two formulae. And you may recognize that it looks with this two square root of something, it looks like some kind of KPP speed. And this is exactly what. speed and this is exactly what what this is so c star u is the equation when you replace v by zero in the u equation linearize it around zero and the speed for v or at least the second term here is what you obtain when you take u equal one in the v equation and linearize it although in this case it was already linar and so when you reduce each equation separately in some sense this Equations separately in some sense. This is what gives you those two formulae. I will try to come back to this in a little more detail later, or again, I will not really talk about the actual proofs. So there are several limitations in the proof. I won't go into all of these. One thing which may be an obvious consequence of what I just said is that we looked at the case where those speeds were linearly determined. Speeds were linearly determined. This is what I just explained. And of course, just like Pavescale equation, there are prepidator systems which have non-linear effects, and so where the speed may not be linearly determined. And of course, it would completely change the analysis. But through this talk, we'll be only talking about situations where the speed are linearly determined. So I won't be worrying too much about this. I'll also mention the fact there is a strong feedback in between the three cursion, but maybe it's. Feedback in between the three cursion, but maybe it's a vague way to put it. But maybe another way, also vague, but another way to put this is that again the proof really relies on the specific structure of the system. And this does not mean that you can necessarily do it for any system which does not have a composite principle. So what I want to focus here is that, and I'm stating in a slightly provocative way because what I want to highlight here that is maybe And what I want to highlight is that it may not sound like a big gap, but it turns out that it actually is. So, what I want to focus on in this talk is that we managed to handle this system of two equations. And so, could we also handle systems of three equations? So, maybe the left one is more natural here. It's just two first equations are basically the same, but I added some second predator W, and the two predators. And the two predators V and W are in competition because of the coupling term between V and W. And another system, so to be already transparent, so I won't be able to give you any spreading results for these two systems because I turned out to be very difficult. So just example of challenging systems. And so another example of challenging systems is the three species competition system. So as I said, two species, you have a composite principle. Two species, you have a composite principle, so you can study it. But if you had a free species, actually, what I said about making a change available to reduce to a comparative system does not work anymore. And so, this is the two free species system, very natural free species system, where we don't have a composite principle. And so, the question again is: if we can study two species systems, even without comparison principle, can we move to a third species? And it turns out that. And it turns out that it's a very, very difficult problem, which is basically what I will try to explain in the remainder of this talk. And so time goes very fast already. So to explain this, I will consider an even simpler situation. So it sounds like a very extreme simplification. I will triangulate, I will look at a triangular free species. We look at the triangular free species system. So, what I mean by triangular is that U does not have complaint terms, so U just satisfies the colour equation. So, you can compute, of course, it depends on the reaction term F, but you can expect to be able to compute the spreading speed for U. And V depends on U, but does not depend on W. So, once you have solved for U, plug in the solution for U into V equation, you can get something on V, and so on. And so, again, it's a It's a very naive approach because, of course, the full system with all the complete terms is going to be a lot more complicated. But I guess what I want to say is that if you want to be able to study the full system, a necessary condition will be to be able to study this triangular system. And what I will try to show is that actually even this triangular system turns out to be much more complicated than what it looks like. Than what it looks like. And maybe to highlight this, so complicated may be not to say the full story. So what I will try to say is that even though we can understand, we can compute some screen spins for the system, what it will turn out is that the system is very sensitive to change-low parameters, which makes it hard to say not too pessimistic way, but it seems Way, but it seems hard to expect that the understanding of this system will actually tell you what happens for the food system. What I want to mean by that is that so basically, maybe I will explain this for the two species system first. So, the proof in our paper with Anna Hioshi is actually very different from what I will explain here, but what I'm Here, but what I'm trying to say is that at least this triangularizing the system in this case gives you some good insight on what's actually happening. Because if you triangularize it, you get this system. So I removed V from the first equation. So U side of the KPP equation. So we know that U is going to spread with some speed C star U, which is here two square root of R times du. And so you can put such a And so you can put such a u into the v equation. And it turns out that this information is enough to get the spreading speed for v. So what I mean by that is that if you take any u which spread with speed c star u, in the sense that I wrote here, so if you move slower than c star u the solution converges to so it's reversed, it's a reverse. So it's if you if you move slower, so if x If you move slower, so if x minus this target goes to minus 50, u goes to 1, and if you move faster, u goes to 0. So no matter what is the exact shape of u, if you plug this into the v equation, this will actually give you the correct spreading speeds for the predator V. So again, it's far from a proof for the full one prey, one predator system. But what I'm trying to say is that it gives you still a good educated guess. Educated guess. And since the result which I gave you is pretty robust, you can still have some hope that it will, and of course, we show that it is the case. So you can have some hope that it will give you the actual behavior of the full system. Of course, in practice, you would have the complete time in the first equation. But basically, what this tells you is that a small change of u will not really affect the behavior in the v equation. And so you can expect that you can kind of cycle from this argument. Cycle for this argument and get some good guess of what the behavior of u and v is actually going to be. I call this a guess because, again, this is in no way any close to a proof, but maybe another way to put this is that if what I wrote here was not the case, it would be very hard to expect that this formula for systar v will be the good one. Sister V would be the good one. If a small change of u would change the formula for the speed of v, you would guess that you would have very little hope in the actual system to get the spreading speeds. And so I knew that it was going to be fast, but it's even much worse than I thought. So maybe I will go already near the end. Near the end of this talk. So now, if we add the third species, can we do the same kind of formal arguments? So for simplicity, so again, I kind of said that we could handle two species systems. So let's assume that we do know that a U spread with some speed sister U, and V spreads with some speed sister V. Some speed C star V. And for simplicity, ignoring some of the coupling terms, we're just going to look at the equation for W as sample of scalar equation. That is, we just plug the shape of U, the shape of V, we put this into the W equation, and we try to guess if we can, I mean, we try to look at if this can give us a good guess of what the spreading speed for the first. Of what the spreading speed for the third species W is going to be. So, of course, this is going to depend on the actual system. So, here, this is a rough viewing of what it should look like in the three species competition system. So, ahead of a propagation of both U and V, there is no competitor for W. So, it should be, it should have very high growth rates. Then, U invades the domain, but not V not invading yet. So, here you should have. So, here you should have a smaller growth rate because there is one competitor for W. And then V also spreads. And so, in the last zone, W faces two competitors. So, you may guess that the situation is more difficult for W. So, in this last zone, sorry, it has even lower growth rates. So, of course, those values may actually be ordered differently depending on the parameters. It may be quite negative. So, this is just It may be quite negative. So, this is just one possible situation. And so, the question is: what happened in these kind of situations? And before I go into this, I want to point out also that this is what I'm trying to suggest with these dotted lines. Actually, we don't really know what's going to happen in the moving frame with, say, speed C star V. Because the spreading speed results on u and V, it only gives you this kind of a plateau here, but this does not necessarily tell you good insight on what happened. Tell you good insight on what happens at the interface. And especially if you think about competition system, you know, that there could happen some segregation. So it could be that at the interface, there is some small zone where there are very few V and also very few U, which may cause actually a bump in the growth rate H for W. So in place of a dotted line, that could actually be a maximum of a growth rate between the two plateau. Between the two plateau. And this started to make things quite unpredictable, as I will show in the next result. So this is the result on which I will try to conclude this talk. So it's a work in progress with Leo Giarda and Hiroshimatano, where we worked for a scalar radio division equation with heterogeneous profit. So it's still KPP, just the... The factor which depends on the time and the space, and it depends on the moving variable. So, s is a parameter here, so it moves with some speed s. And basically, I should have made the training maybe to have been clearer, but so basically the growth rate is everywhere positive, but it alternates between three different values. So, behind the heterogeneity, it's equal to a first value R1. In the moving frame of the heterogeneity, In the moving frame of a heterogeneity on some Baudian interval, it's equal to some value R2. And then ahead of a heterogeneity, it's equal to some third value, constant value, R3. And so the actual result is quite technical, so I don't go into the details. I'm just saying that we can compute the spreading speed in this case. And so W is pointing with some speed system of W, which has some explicit formula. So the formula is quite technical, which is why I limit it. Is why I limit it, but to give some drawing, the spring speed looks like something like this. So, here s is the speed of the heterogeneity. So, for my system, it will be in some sense the speeds of the first two species or something like that. And so, as the speed of this heterogeneity varies, the spreading speed of a W varies. And again, it depends on how the value of R1 are ordered. Here, they are ordered in this way. So, you may get this kind of pictures. So, basically, again, what I want. So basically, again, I don't go into detail, but what I'm saying is that we have an explicit formula and we can draw it in a very precise way like this. So just maybe one last word. So again, what is the purpose of all of this and what is the connection between those two topics? It's that, as I said, so as I try to say, Try to say in the full system, W is going to have an effect on U and V, and so everything is going to influence each other. And so you know that if a small change of U and V changes your behavior of W, you don't have much hope that this kind of formal approach will give you a good guess of what the spreading speed actually is. And the corollary of this explicit formula, which are membered, is that in this Are limited is that indeed in this kind of situation, a very small change of the parameters of this unity, which in the system would mean a small change in U and V, actually does have a non-trivial effect on the speed of this W or in this third species in the full system case. So I'm just going to be to read the first what I call here colourly, but again, it does not follow on the Again, it does not follow from the result that I show, if it follows from the actual explicit formula which I omitted. Anyway, I'm just going to read it. So let's just take one example. So R1 is equal to R3 and R2 is larger than this common value. So R2 is strictly larger, but it will be arbitrarily close from R1 and R2. And the parameter L, which denoted the, so again, so hate something is equal to R1. K tension is equal to R1 on one side, R3 on the other side, but in this case, both sides are the same. And on a bounded interval whose size is this parameter L, the reaction terms growth rate changes and it is instead equal to R2. And so one corollary of our formula is that no matter how close R2 is to this common value R1 or R3, and no matter how small this parameter L is, there is some S, so it's not true everywhere, but Some s, so it's not true everywhere, but there are some speed for the motion of the rhetoric, where the spinning speed of w would be strictly larger than the speed corresponding to R1 or R3. So another way to say this is that you have some problem which is almost homogeneous. You just have a very small interval in the middle where the growth rate does a very small pump and still that is enough to change the... To change the, it is, it can be enough to naturally change the spinning speed of your solution. Of course, the change is going to be small, R2 gets closer to R1 and as L goes to zero, but it's still a non-tilog chain. And the conclusion of all that is that if we try to go back to the full system, it looks maybe I will end on this to reflect what I was just saying. So in the free speech. To refresh what I was just saying, so in the three species computer systems, so this is a numerical simulation. So we do get numerically, numerically, we do observe three consecutive charging waves and so three spreading speeds. So I strongly believe that spreading result should be true in this case. But what our result with Leo and Hiroshi suggest is that to compute the speed of W, so the speed of the blue curve here, we need to know exactly what the red and black lines are. What the red and black lines look like. So, in particular, the interface here, which we didn't really know, even in the two-species case, even a very small change of a red curve or black curve here may actually change the speed of a blue curve here. So, as long as we don't have a much better understanding of these two species case, it looks like we will not be able to completely understand, at least in all the parts. Completely understand, at least in all the parameter range, because of course there is a lot of leeway depending on the parameters here. But we cannot expect a complete result as long as we understand the two species case much better than we already do. And I think I will stop here, and I thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much, Toma. Thank you very much, Tomas, for this very nice talk. Do we have some questions? Yes? Hi, Thomas. This is Yuhong Du. Can you hear me? Yes, sir. On your slide, page 18. Yes. You said that there exists S. So is the S big or close to some special number to have these strict unionology? Street in all of them. So it should be. So actually, so if this happened in this drawing, so the place where Reterni plays a role is, I don't know if you see my mouse, right? So it appears in this decreasing part. And so actually when R1 is equal to R3, and as it gets closer to this homosexual problem, these intermediate parts should Intermediate part should become smaller and smaller, which means, I guess, than this x close. Yeah, to this value here. So, to square root of DWF, it should happen here. Thank you. Do we have some more questions? Yes, yes, to very quickly show the page showing Mondoka playing. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes. And you didn't explain it very well. Yeah, I didn't explain it at all, but in 20 seconds, would you explain what it is? Yeah, so non-local pulling. So this is a term coined by Leo Girardin, who I think is here in his paper with Adelaide Lama, although it was exhibited by other people before. By other people before. So the simplest case is when your growth rate, so you can think of the K-P equation. So growth rate is the derivative at zero respect to your density. And so you take it as a step function like this. So when x minus st is less than zero, it is some small positive value. And when x minus st is larger than zero, it is some larger positive value. And non-local pooling. Value. And non-local pulling is a situation where the spreading speed, so you still have some spreading speed for your solutions, star w. And non-local pulling is when the spreading speed is between those two values, s and two square root of this thing. So maybe it's not so explicit. So what this means is that C star w is strictly less than s, it's in the open interval, which means that the front is located in the left part of the drawing. Left part of his drawing. So, in particular, in the right part of his drawing where the growth rate is large, your solution converges uniformly. So, uniformly on this subdomain, the solution converges to zero. So, naively, you may expect that since your solution kind of exists in the left part, it may look like the solution of a homogenous problem corresponding to the small positive. Corresponding to these small positive constants. But actually, the solution of this left homogenous problem would be this two square root of dw limit at minus infinity of a quarter face. And what this inequality tells you is that actually the spinning speed is larger than this one. So in the end, to sum it up, non-local pulling means that the traveling front is located on the left part, but it still feels the But it still feels the rotogenity from the right part. And to put it in a very short way, the reason is that in the KPP case, as many of you know, the actual spuning speed is, I mean, in general, the spuning speed is connected to the exponential decay of the solution. And what happens under non-local punning is that the exponential decay is kind of modified by the heterogeneity, which in turn makes the spuning speed in the less part. in the left part in the left part uh different than the from the usual uh kpp minimal speed okay thank you very much now thank you thank you very much uh so if you don't have any more questions we can thank thomas again thank you and again thanks to all the speakers of this morning so now we have lunch and we resume at two with the afternoon Read so much with the afternoon talks. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
