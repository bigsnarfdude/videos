About moving pranks for numerical solutions of PDE and their application in meteorology, cardiology, and neurosciences. Thank you so much for invitation. Actually, I was looking forward to this conference, especially for the last few years, especially. This is a shame that I can't just make it to the like a vamp this time. So, and particularly, I really thank like the Francis for sorting out all this talk and. out all this talk and uh help me out on this prep preparing and joining uh this like a conference so the actually the the topic actually preparing for this uh uh this time is about uh the practical application of the moving frames actually i'm actually not very uh yeah i'm sort of like uh the theorists in the view of sort of these uh of applied mathematicians i think i'm sort of like a very practitioner Like a very practitioner, so in this kind of the group as well. So, yeah, so I'm going to explain my like past researches by just using these moving frames and so cardiology and neuroscience. This is, I believe this is one of the like a most like a geometrical, like the topics actually. And so I'm going to explain instead of going too much in detail, so this is a technicality and the numerator. And the numerical schemes, I'm going to explain more like inspirations and about some win frames I just got when applying these moving frames to the like numerical schemes and finding some like some applications and some analysis. And actually, I got some couple of questions actually just about these moving frames. This is almost like I learned this all sort of things by myself. So I think just sort of like some Myself, so I think there's sort of like some gaps in here. So, this is some strugglings to fill. So, this is I sort of like and just introduce my like some applications of moving frame and at the same time just brought some like the questions regarding these moving frames. So, I briefly explained so it's how just I just got to know these moving frames. I just was like a trained as a like applied mathematician, just solving like math classifications. Like a master's stations and numerically. But actually, I just moved to London and the project was like assimilating the electrical signals on this heart and particularly for this atrium. But the atrium is very thin, so we can just approximate it as like the curvature surface. And it's covered with some like a cardiac fiber. So we can just consider it as like a very Just consider it as like a very like a strong anisotropy. So it kind of like a Riemann geometry. So then we should solve like a diffusion reaction equation. So I also like some like developing some like some schemes and considering looking up some like a many differential geometry test book. I just found it out interesting like some like a method by this Katang. So I just adapt this like his method from that time, I think almost like 10 years ago. That time, I think almost like 10 years ago, so I was like, kind of heavily like sort of like involved with this method. But I'm sure you can say that I don't understand all of them. That's for sure. I'm only using the very small part of this mathematics. So the moving frames is that, so now probably the same for now is mostly likely some orthonormal vectors, frames, actually the state. Frames, actually, the staying in the lying on the like a tangent plane of this domain. And the particularly, so moving frame, I think I understand the moving frame is very efficient to represent the very complex material. So the particularly biological tissues like a brain and heart, this is the very, it contains very strong anesthety, which is very difficult to analyze. And it's also the computational assimilation is. Is also the computational simulation is very like tricky. So there was time the strong anotropy in the heart was very fantastically modelled by these moving frames. You can just change the like a size of this is the frames on one frame along this is the cardiac fiber. So that was like a motivation. That was like initiation of this is my like involvement. Well, this is the like somewhere in frames. So I just like solved like a city. So I just solved like a series of partial differentiations on a surface. It's like a general surface. So, but the scheme is very straightforward. So we expand the vectors, appears in the PDE on the gradient, on the like moving frames. So that is just very simple like a numerical scheme. But what we couldn't understand is the we couldn't we see that this is conversion and it's very behavior. Conversion and it's very behavy, and this is very stable. And that was something we could understand. So that is the, I think it took some years to the phrase why the moving frame is working good for these numerical schemes of PDEs. And I think this is something because we are all at the method, the solving PDEs on the surface. So if you publish a paper, you should compare your methods to other methods. So, but I think one thing. So, but I think one thing is other methods can't just do is about how this is the moving frame efficient in representing very complex materials. So like either this is heterogeneous and the anisotropy material. Anastropy is sort of like this, we have a very strong like a conductivity along with certain direction. Instead of this is the propagate or equal opportunity, the probability in all direction. And also this is the And also, this is some, particularly for this Earth case, the Earth can be just seen as like some sphere. If something is the flow is happening only the surface of the sphere, then actually the rotation is happen for this earth. And the wing frame is also very good for mathematical, like the device to represent this rotation of the surface as well. So I started with some. So I started with some conservational law, which is like something like advection happens along the surface. So I think in numerical schemes, we have three big categories, which is that the numerical scheme is either we just judge to we judge to say this is the numerical scheme is a general or this is only just applying can can be applied to the specific geometry. So SPI is So spi is obviously most like a common like a surface we just use for the testing. And irregular is the next level of difficulty because the curvature changes from place one place to the other places. And the non-convex type is known as a very like a challenging case for the numerical simulation of this PDE. Because some method actually using some like a projection from the like a short surface. From the lagacial surface. So, almost half of the currently available schemes can't just apply to the non-convex type like a surface. But we see that the moving frame is really working for all of them without any like some much like some super specific treatment of this numerical schemes. And that was our initial motivations to solve some diffusion reaction locations on the Applications on the like a general copy surface. So that was fantastically done. And we just next stage, we just took a look at this shallow application. So that is like kind of like a two-dimensional version of this is the digest applications on the like a general surface. So that is the where this is the most like the largest community solving like the PDs on the like the cover surfaces. So this is the very Services. So, this is the very practical and very large industry happens here for, I think, I said, only also for this is related to the curved surfaces. So, earth is going to be like considered like the curved surfaces as mentioned. So, the solving these shallow authentications means that you're going to actually put your old numerical tasks to the very largest community and the tested by this lot of people. This is a lot of people. So that was the motivation to do some of these server applications on the, but I think I used to see that this is also working very well. But I'm going to show you like some kind of accuracy and the whole sort of thing. Still, the shout out to the meteorology community, actually, kind of difficult to understand what this is. So they simply just put it as a future, like some application. Like some application emphasis, they have to find some other method, but they don't really have some difficulty. I didn't really fully accept this method for now. And for the like Max verification, the reason we just do a MAC verification is Max verification, we have a very different kinds of these materials in terms of this is the permittivity and permeability. So, and also complex material with a different frequency. It's like a different frequency. That is one of the challenges in the computational electrodynamics. So, this is why we just use the like some moving frames to simulate some like electromagnetic propagation. So, what you see is that we're going to call it like ELF. So, it's an extremely low frequency. Whenever we have some thunderbolt in some place on this earth, then it's actually the flow, it's a kind of low frequency, can't just penetrate. Of low frequency, it can't just penetrate the earth, so simply just propagate in the very thin layer of this air. So it looks like the earth is just kind of become like some very curved surface. So this is the, we just simulate it like a Max classification. So this is actually the summary, the what is actually good for. This is the moving frame. So this is the very like straightforward. So we have a if you in the initially If you in the initially the explaining in the like some finite element text and the Galochian discontinuous Galachian text, so we have like a very like some like some procedures how we can just make like a vectors on the like a surface of this domain. So in terms of that, the constructing this is a orthonormal vectors in this numerical scheme is very straightforward because we have another ways. This is all kind of a device. This is all kind of devices to like differentiate something on the like the domain. But this is the kind of we can just change very a small part of this one so that we can just construct like orthonormal like a basis on every point of this is the domain, even though this is not visible. But we can just create like three vectors: e to the one, e to the two, e to the three. This is the meaning length, and they are orthogonal to each other. Orthogonal to each other. So then the expand the vector, the gradient, the moving frame. Actually, this is all the scheme. So this schematic innovation is very small, but this typical part is how we're going to calculate this is the errors. So what is the error for by the system moving frames? Why doesn't really affect like a discrete error? So we have some constraint here, but actually I didn't explain. Here, but actually, I didn't explain in this slide. The constraint is that we should have a lovely because this moving frame, building or constructing this moving frame means that we're going to use some like some Euclidean like some space, the very like even for the like whole domain is a curve. So, the strong constraint for this current method is that I mean V. this the i mean we uh so coverture in this is that we're gonna call it like it's kind of this small element coverage should be like a relevantly constant so that is the the constant there is the restriction but i think this is another big deal for this uh computational community because i we simply just uh dividing the like uh the area where this is the curvature changing we just make it as a small like element around the area so we're gonna call it like adaptive So, you're going to call it like adaptive grading, something like that. So, it was not a big deal. So, I think we don't really have much like some backfire from that, like a drawbacks. So, one of the like good things about this moving frame is that we only using the required domain instead of using some surrounding space, like ambient space. So, one of the key things for making some like a numerical solution. Making some like a nervous solution of PDs for the industry, it should maintain the very good scalability. So, scalability is if you increase the number of grid points for solving PDs, the rate of this cost shouldn't necessarily decrease dramatically. So it should like increase. So if you see that the moving frame is only the, we can just choose number of this is the like the frame is for expanding like a vector. So we maintain. So we maintained a very similar degree of freedom as actual two-dimensional, two-dimensional, like a plain two-dimensional scheme. And another thing is that we another benefit is that we don't have to use like a metric pencil. I mean, if you use the sub, even when you solve these partial differential equations on the like surfaces, because this doesn't really means that we don't need. This doesn't really mean that we don't need that geometric factor in the soldiering PDEs, but this is all about this shifting the geometric information. Either you're going to put this into like some moving frame at the frames at basis vectors, or you're going to put it into like the coefficient side. So if you take a look at this, like this is one, it's just normally how we're going to actually treat the like some vectors in the same in the like a plane. So then Plane. So then you see that the show, like the geometric factor, like some the magnitude of this tangent factor is going to stay in the u side, the vector sign. But you expand these vectors in the moving frame. So for luminal moving frames, that means the magnitude of this is like a vector. It's going to shift to the like a coefficient. So that is a sort of a simple like some trick, but this is the Uh, some trick, but this is the. I think it's all the like the same philosophy: how why we you prefer to use a differential geometry, but it's just going to save a lot of like efforts and also improves a lot of accuracy in the computational era. So if you use like some like some like a basis actually that has the same magnitude as a tangent vector, you're going to face some like some like a metric tensor type, like some coefficients. Tensor type, like some coefficients that is always like make our scheme like unstable. But this is the, I mean, the putting, you just putting, pushing everything to the like a coefficient side, this is all automatically computed by this is the program, computational program. So we didn't really have to care about this is the magnitude of this is the metric tensor for this problem. So this is going to be another like some benefit we can use by using this is the metric. By using this metric at the beam frames. And another one, actually, one of the very serious problems in the meteorological community is that they solve some equations on the surface, but we have some singularity. This is very well stated by this is the Herbal theorem. So, because normally they use a spectral coolness system. So, then you're going to have some similarity which is conscious differentiate. Which is kind of just differentiate at the North Pole and the South Pole. And they actually derived a very, very schematic and very complex, and just also changing the shape of this tessellation element shape. So I think that this is going to mess. And if you change this one, then you're going to have another problem, another like errors is coming out. So this is one of the like a very difficult task. Actually, faced by this is the Actually, the faced by this is the meteorological community. But the moving frame, so what I think is we can also have a lot of like we can just construct the moving frames in the very different ways. But my preferred like moving frame is I'm going to call it like a local moving frames. So that means that we have a because if you just segment this like a sphere into like some curved triangle, then we can just And we can just for each triangle, I normally construct like some moving frames like discontinuously across these interfaces. So that is the, I'm going to actually call it like a local moving frame. So that actually the same as we constructing like some reference frames like the discontinuously all of this domain. So then obviously the singularity disappears. We don't need to do very fancy tricks. Me to do very fancy tricks to some of these PDS on this SPS closed like a surface. So that is one of the biggest achievements by adopting the moving frames, like this continuous moving frames on the surface. But actually, personally, I think this is one of the reasons the moving frames can actually survive. Also, still, the people actually adapting the moving frame is how this is the consistent. the how this is the the consistency of this moving frame is representing the complex material so that is the i think this is one of the like a very strong like a feature of this moving frame so this is why i'm actually sticking uh uh still using uh moving frames for like a various applications so this is the uh because i uh every like numerical schemes and the scientific computing as well has been all designed for this uh Design for this Euclidean space and isotropy like material. So, but actually, the actual biological tissue and the interesting physical application, they are all like a very consist of very complex materials. But solving these PDs on the isotropic medium and the solving PDs on the anisotropic medium is very different. So, they should change from the bottom to the top. So, they have three. Bottom to the top. So they're actually making your like numerical skin upside down because this is related to like stability and some conversions of this numerical scheme. So, but the moving frame is really that they make this like stuff very like compact and concise and make things quite easier. So for this left-hand side this case, if you use like a Cartesian coordinate system, it's a dotted line and suppose this is like some kind of an actual. This is like some kind of anisotropy. Then you're going to have some like your like a division tensor. It's going to express like a full like a division tensor, three by three division tensor. So this is going to be a very challenging case. So the numerical scheme is also not very like behaving very well. But we just, what we just do is placing moving frames at this point, and then we're going to align this one axis, one frame. One axis, one frame of these moving frames along this anisotropy, so then it becomes like axial like anisotropy, even though we have some like a different magnitude along this diagonal element, but we can have a no like so all the like off-diagonal element becomes zero. So then we can just use the like the same like numerical scheme as the like for the numerical scheme for this isotropic material. Isotropic material. So then, furthermore, we can just change the like length of the system moving frame along this is the anisotropy according to the like a conductive like conductivity like the velocity. Then it becomes simply just anisotropy. So then everything is just very like straightforward. So this kind of a problem is particularly very critical for this computational electrodynamics because we have some very Was that we have some various kinds of material? So, you're going to see that one of the examples is kind of like some invisible, like a clock, kind of this kind of simulation. And the material property is a critical factor, but it's the moving frame. So it's changing the making the angle, changing the angle, and they just change the length of this moving frame. You can just change the domain from this is the like a full like anisotropic domains to the Isotropic domains to the isotropic. So then the new ecosystem is going to be very like simple and concise. Convergence is very guaranteed. So obviously the one actually dimension is that we can just apply this one to the general surface, any sort of like surfaces. But we have also very like some unrealistic like a surface. We have some like a pinpointed like a so non-differential. Like a so non-differentiable any direction, but that's not really happened in the like some physical case and biological case as well. Also, this is the like non-convex type is also not very, it have it may happen if you have some like some unlikely, like some very pathological like a deformation of this hot, and we may have this sort of thing, so we can just consider. Sort of thing, so we can just consider this one. So we have all like some other methods to for particularly for this shallow water locations. So, but you see that I just this is like a short table. So how this is the MMF is short for this moving frames method. But I just also actually claim that this is the kind of a two-dimensionality and there is the convergence is very good, but I think. Convergence is very good, but I think I still should be persuaded more to the people of this methodology. So low application was like the first application. So you see that this is actually the PDs. We actually consider. So we have some several parameters. See here, it comes with one like divergence, and we have one gradient. one gradient and we have some like also differentiation of this is the like some uh the vectors this actually representing so this is the part where this is the we have to consider like a rotation of this moving frames so uh the reason this is the shallow applications in the surface is that like a geometry problem is the quasa we uh model mathematical model this is the the earth the earth has a like a rotating curve Earth as like a rotating curved surface. So rotating means that the Earth is rotating. So this is rotating with a constant like a velocity. So we have, yeah, so, but that means that at each point of this is the we have some very different velocity actually producing like related to like some Coriolis actually the effect as well. But other than that, so As well, but other than that, so other than this is the Coriolis effect, we have also some effects, some flow, the flow pattern changes for say this is rotating. The F is actually the elliptical shape, so slightly like we have some slight more like a radius along this equator than this is along this is like a pole. But we uh but I think we don't really the difference is very small, so we also. Very small, so we also approximately like a uh uh would be less like a sphere. Also, this is surface that means that this is about this is the perspective, how you're gonna actually see the phenomena. But this is the it depends also because we have a for even for this as a meteorology, like uh so weather prediction, we have a very different scales, but if you just uh going to the more like a global like a person. Into the more like a global like a perspective, then it becomes more like a curved surfaces, then we should be able to like ignore this as a vertical movement of this flow. So everything is just going to feel like a flat like a surface. So here is like a very good result. We just the card. So actually the what matter is about how we just compare our like a methods to other methods, which is kind of either they're using like a projection or just some Lagrangian. So just consider like Lagrangian, so this consider like a three-dimensional space, and they're just like projecting it. And they can use solve, like using like a using solving this covariant like a differentiation using like a metric pens. All this is like the method, but this will see. But that was like some result like the six, seven years ago. But currently, like some, we improved like this methods. We improved like this method slightly. So, this is actually much better than this one. So, also we have went through. So, this actually shows the, I mean, that this graph also shows we have no singularity happens for this, like even for this sphere. If you're using like moving frames, like this continuous across like interface. So, this is also another task. Also, this shows that this actually looks like this one is done. Look, like this one is the moving frame, so this one is moving frame. But so, this is the also the lotus method is the it is also solving like a covariant like a derivative, especially uh, but I think that the recent like uh development is pushing this is like a moving frames method, like far like more accurate and stable than this one. So, actually the same, very same result in here. Very same result in here. So the next step is about this will be applying this is the moving frames to the Max Rose equation. So see that we have two vectors in the Max Rose equation. One is like electric field and the other is the H field. We're going to call the H field. So we simply just are expanding this electric field into the like in and expand it to the like moving frames. We just build moving frames. Moving frames. We just build moving frames everywhere, like orthonormal vectors. Then we just expand these vectors so we can just have some this kind of expression. So the numerical scheme changes. So as I just explained here, so we can just for this is a particularly for this permittivity like a tensor, whereas like a full, it's a full anesthropy for some case, but you can just arranging this. Just arranging this like a direction and the length of this moving frame, you can just assault as if this is anisotropy material. So that was the kind of a very like a very convenient and the kind of also innovations to some numerical like a community as well. So we can just directly apply. So we can just do some invisible cloud like a simulation. So that is the order. So that is the also, this is the permittivity tensor becomes very, becomes very unrealistically becomes zero as close to the like a PEC. It's more like a perfect electrical conducting material, like some metal. So close to this one, we just provide like some, like this is like a like a black circle indicates like some our like like some our like uh some clock uh this is the like an invisible clock so from the from the pattern of this is the from the surface of this pmc uh pc or pmc and the to the like that's a black like a circle represents some like uh some uh clocks in here but the permittivity tensor has a very strong like uh direction and also the magnitude changes very uh dramatically and becomes almost null when it comes Becomes almost null when it's close to the like a PEC. So this is theoretically, actually. So whether it's an invisible clock or not, it's either we just have some like a no, like if you so for this naked means that we have the invisible clocks not working. So we have some like waves behind this PC. You can't just see the wave pattern is the almost zero. That means that we can't just see. means that we can't just see someone actually behind like a PC. But if you provide in like an invisible flux in here, so wave pattern is almost like identical from the back to the like the front and back. So that is kind of some theoretical prediction that this is we can just we can't just see this PC and the PMC, the object. But the point is it's also the similar. So we have a very complex material should be used for Material should be used for to make like invisible club. So, numerically, this is one of the very challenging tasks, but these moving frames make things very like stressful and the convenience for the numerical simulation. So, they make it actually possible. So, and so same like the different like a scheme, so we can just achieve that. So, then also this very extremely low like a frequency, like a propagation on the sun. Frequency, like a propagation on the surface of this various surface system, you can see some, like, some very good convergence for here. So, the application, these moving frames, the cardiology was our primary interest. So, this is like some anatomy of this is the like atrium, so, and like some cardiac fiber on the surface of this like atrium. So, one of the like a striking feature is. One of the striking features is that we have a very strong anesthetic. All of this is hard. So the one direction is almost four times faster than the other direction. So we can't just ignore this fiber, but what we actually do. So this fiber direction is obviously the direction where this is the mechanical contraction happens. But electrophysiologically, we are not so sure what this really the direction is really the mean. The mean. So that was like some goal of this research has been actually carried out like last few years. So that was, so I mean, the biological systems, this is not simply just that they don't use like redundant functions because they have limited resources and there should be like limited spaces. So everything should be like considered. But up to now, we But up to now, we couldn't fully understand what is the configuration actually, the means in terms of like electrophysiological purpose. Electrophysiology means the electrical signal. So because electrical signal gives you like a sequence, how the like the contraction happens for each like the cardiac tissue. So then this is the cardiac. So heart is not simply just a pumping, something you just squeeze. Pumping, something is just squeezing same things like from the old side. It's going to say it's very small, like compared to the wall, like a pressure has to be provided for this order blood. So we can just like a squeezing and the twisting. A very complex movement should happen for the heart. So we can just pump your like a blood from the heart to the like a very end of your like a tiptoe. So that is very like a complex structure. So a sequence of this is the This is that electrical signal should be very like organized. So, for this case, we just make some assumptions so that we could say this is all from this is the cosmology and how this is the electro electromagnetic propagation and all about this is the curvature like things. So, I mean, in the cardio happens, so we I explained in here. So, we explained in here. So, what this is that what we normally can just observe in the actual heart from the like images that is something we can just see the like a wavefront of this electromagnetic waves, but we can just translate it as some equivalent concept to the like a trajectory. Like this is what either this is divergent or the convergent kind of stuff. So, make like a long story short. So, what we're just going to do. So, what we're just going to do, we can just trying to make like an atlas of this heart. So, the thing is that the geometry, I think that this is more like the physics is like the perspective understanding like a geometry. So, geometry depends on this is the wave propagation instead of this is the record, just the object F itself. So, this is like a more like a advanced application of this moving frame. Like application of this moving frame. So we're aligning these moving frames along this propagational direction of this electrical signal. So just actually the simulate with this cardiac fiber present. Then you just propagate these waves. Then we're going to align these moving frames along this is the propagational direction. So then we just compute like a connection, which is going to give us probably the angle, but you probably more familiar with this kind of term. I had a very difficult time understanding. I had a very difficult time understanding this mathematical equation. Then, what we're going to also the compute is about this is a Riemann curvature tensor. So, also, I'm also struggling understanding this one. On our equation, it's about this Riemann curvature tensor. So, we can actually compute this one. So, but I mean, the cover is a very mathematical concept, but in the physics and the biology, coverage is actually the real. Biology, covert is actually the real stuff, real thing, means something. It's for relativity. The covert means like some kind of energy and mass. And we believe this is in the heart. It's a covert is related to like some ion density. So this is the very practical parameter we should consider analyzing this electrical, cardioelectrical flow in the heart. So what meta we just consider is about this. We just consider is about this magnitude of this rich curvature tensor. We consider. So, yeah. So, we're going to actually compute this one. So, this is another like a very short like some sidekick is about this is the, so I'm using this is the connection. I'm actually computing this is the covariant derivative using this is connection term. But actually, still, I'm not sure the value actually, the difference. Show the what is actually the difference between these two when I using like orthonormal basis. So, which part is going to be the same, which is not the same? Still, I'm just struggling to understand the difference between these two. So, also using this sort of like a direct covariant like a derivative, we can just do some fancy things. But one thing is doing some Helen or so like horse. Some Helen also like holes hold like a decomposition. So we can just have some certain flow. They can just divide into like some irrotational part and the incompressible part and the harmonic part. So particularly, we just are extracting this harmonic part. This is going to be a very good like some computational tool. It's just very popularly used like robotics. And also we can just use it for many like fantastic applications. Fantastic applications in the cardiology as well. So, hypothesis we just put for this cardiology is that if this connection, some component is too large, that is actually, we believe this is indicating the wave actually that diverging, which is diverging. So, we have some this is related to like some we're going to call like a sync source mismatch. So, ion is limited, so we can't just propagate. So, this ions two. So, these ions to many like the cells at the same time. So, that is the equivalence to the like some cover check is very strong. So, that is also the related to like some connection component is too large. So, we just assume that this is our like a condition. So, cardio babies actually stop. So, we are doing some simulation and analysis. Then you see that we have some like a very strong cover happens in here, but And here, but not just like an aerial, like some large coverage is more like a linear. So I think that this happens because this is the fiber is not continuous. But anyway, so what you see is that the curvature is not this strong. But if you just assimilate the same thing without the fiber, you just get rid of this all the fiber from the like heart, then you just propagate some signal, then you're going to observe like a Then you're going to observe like a very strong signal, essentially close to like a pulmonary vein. So that indicates. So if you have some very strong coverage happens, the pulmonary vein is likely to be the cardio re-entry and the fibrillation is likeliest to happen. So we can just probably the infer from this cardio fiber is likely to prevent some like atrial fibrillation. But this is actually observed in the very large Is actually observed in the very large whale. So, if the size of this is the heart is larger, then it's likely to happen more like some conduction block happens to the like the branches of this heart. So, but strong like anatropy is going to get rid of this kind of like some very abnormal like the propagation pattern. So, this is what we just observed from this one. The neuroscience is our like recent like Our like a recent like development of this moving frame. So, also the same as like the heart. The frame is very, very strong, like anisotropy. So, we have some using like a data, like the TTI images. So, we try to try to track down, this is the like tarot, this is the, this is the, I mean, it's the connectivity inside of the brain, so we can use it for this actual clinical applications. But the problem is that we can't just. But the problem is that we can't just know, can't just figure it out, because the data we just got from this TTI, which is one of the most accurate data in the modern era, is very ambiguous. So it looks like a crossing. We're going to call it a crossing fiber because this is the fox cell of this image. This is not small enough to catch the order, like the direction of this fiber. So the what actually The problem we are trying to see is a neurofiber is also very strongly anisotropic, but it's also really not like a cable. We have two cables, they're actually interacting constantly with each other. So they're making like a very continuous like the wavefront. So it's really not a multi-dimensional like a propagation. It's even though they are all like a fiber propagation, they propagating as if they are. Uh, propagating as if they are actually the multi-dimensional because they're actually communicating with them like very uh closely with each other. So, that actually is the case. You can just consider it as a case, a lot of like a very complex materials should get involved and also very different like a conducting velocity at the same time, very different like a dimension. So, fiber is more like one-dimensional object, but is also this is the propagation involves like the like environment. involves like the like environment as a like an ambient like a spaces but interstitial spaces actually some more like a two-dimensional three-dimensional spaces so uh brain is most like very difficult like uh smodel but i think we should consider this is the moving frame it's going to make this model much easier and convenient uh for the further like inquiries on this study for this neuroscience so actually the question is about this i'm struggling to understand this actually This is I'm struggling to understand this actually. As I mentioned before, I just asked, I'm not totally understand what is the Riemann coverage tensor of the wing frames of this orthonormal basis is so different from this regular. That's what people say is in the general sense of this Riemann cover tensor. And also, if you just compute like a covariant derivative with this kind of a connection with the orphanal basis, then how is this going to be different from this? And how is this going to be different from this is the regular covariant, like a derivative. And also, I'm actually choosing very specific connection for the like moving frames, only along this propagational direction. But we should reconsider other connection for these moving frames for the propagation. It's in the heart and brain. This is also patient. Thank you so much. I'm going to end it here. Any questions from the audience? Yeah, one thing that wasn't clear to me was what happens at an umbilical point where the moving frame is no longer uniquely defined on a surface. Do you get singularities there, or how do you deal with the umbilic points? Yeah, so in the Scientific computing, we normally place actually spreading all the like greatest points, all the like domains. I think that that is something we should assume like the like first of all. So I think there's no like a reason it's not covered by this grid point because that is going to be, yeah, I think we can just, yeah, so yeah, so in principle, so we have some schemes to leave some area, some corner like arbitrarily like missing. Surely, like a missing, but yeah, in principle, we just cover everywhere with some like a grid point so we can just catch the like a surface, the geometry of this domain. No, that wasn't a question. The question was, so for instance, the sphere, every point is umbilic, so the moving frame is not uniquely defined. If you have an elite sphere, the maximum are on zooic points, and you have to deal with the. So, actually, I'm going to use mine like a pen. So, actually, even though we have a single point, so that is consisting with several like some element, some element in here. So, actually, even though this point is the singular point, actually, moving frame is not defined very well. But all the computation happens in this is the each like an element. So, actually, it doesn't really matter. Actually, it doesn't really matter whether this is the globally like a single lab, but we're only just computing things locally in a small element. So, yeah, so moving frame is also defined very like accurately at this whole point individually. So, then we simply adding them together to find the value at this singular point. Well, if there's no other question, let's thank Sion one more time. Thank you so much. This is the, or I should say, this was the last talk of today, so we'll see everyone tomorrow.
