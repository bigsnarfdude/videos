And I direct the aging track there. So I come at this a little bit differently because I am interested in primarily in aging. And about a year or so ago, I was asked to create one slide that I thought should be the future of aging research, which is a big task. And this is what it is, or what I thought it should be. I think, and this I think applies to all scientific research. I think it applies to all scientific research in general, or health outcomes research, is we need to get better at combining the biological, what we call the phenotypic or physiological, and the clinical. Because a lot of times what we measure is down here, and a lot of times by the time we detect these things, especially with cognitive outcomes, it may be a little bit too late. So we need to get better at measuring things earlier. And the point, why I'm telling you this, is because you'll notice I put accelerometry up here in the corner. Because I do think. Because I do think, even though what we're measuring is at the person level, I think we are getting under the skin a little bit. We're looking at movement, we're looking at patterns of movement. And movement is so incredibly predictive of health. So Chiprian actually set me up really nicely for this with what he just showed. But especially as people get older, how much they move, how frequently they move, the speed at which they move, and the patterns at which they move are incredibly predictive of health outcomes. So that is why I'm interested in accelerometry. When I first got involved with it, so I First, I got involved with it, so I guess I should mention I'm a physiologist by training. I worked as a physiologist before getting my PhD. And I started working with accelerometry data as a postdoc. And I really didn't want to, because I didn't know a lot about it, and the data was a mess. And when I started to do this, this is in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. This is not BLSA beta. I think this is, I mean, State Love, this is a slide I got from Tammy Harris. I was frustrated with it because what I saw at that time, this was about 2011. Saw at that time, this was about 2011. What people typically did was draw lines through the data. So, this is quite a while ago. But people would say this is light intensity activity, this is moderate intensity activity, and this is vigorous activity. So anything above that threshold. And when you're working with older people, what that really tells you is they don't do a lot, right? Everybody would get lumped into light or sedentary for the most part. And those that were up here and moderate and vigorous were, of course, healthier. And I don't think that really added to our scientific knowledge. Of course, because of reverse. Knowledge, of course, because of reverse causality. People at age 80 who are active or able to be moderate to vigorously active, of course, are going to have less heart disease, of course, are going to have lower risk of mortality. It's this whole reverse causality problem. The other thing is looking at this data, look at what was being thrown away. This is really rich, continuous data. There's got to be more we can get out of this. So this is when I started working with Chiprian and his group at the suggestion of Karen Vanier, which is the chair of Biosta. Karen Vannier, she's the chair of Biostats. And so we started working with BLSA data. This was a chest-horn device, this is ACTI heart data that measured both activity and heart rate at the minute level. They were for seven days. And the reason, so Luigi Ferrucci was the PI, still is the PI of BLSA at that time, he chose that device because he thought we could get energy expenditure. So ActiHeart back in 2007 when they started this data collection said: the heart rate is going to increase your accuracy of being able to estimate energy expenditure. Being able to estimate energy expenditure. Well, we pretty soon found out that was not true. There were extreme biases because the algorithms that were used for it were created and validated in young, healthy grad students. So of course it didn't work well for older people. So we kind of threw that out the window. And that led to us just trying to sum the activity over the course of the day, looking at total activity counts over the course of the day. And so this was one of our first papers together. And Jeff, I don't know if you did this plot or if Redim did this plot, but I love this plot because what you see is according to Plot because what you see is, of course, accumulation of activity, and you can see all this shading because there's a line for each person. So it's 611 people, not a huge sample. But what you do see here is a tremendous amount of variability in what people do. Tremendous amount. And when we categorize it, we lose that. But Vadiem did put in four data-driven age groups just so we could get a handle on what was happening with this data. And so to give you an idea, the mean or median was around 50 in this green line group. In this green line group, that so it's a middle-aged group, not all older. And I think what we see here isn't surprising, is that the older people are less active than the younger people. But what we were surprised by was the magnitude of the shift from mid to late life. Now it's cross-sectional data, so of course we can't say decline, but what we can say is that between the ages of 50 and about 85 on average, people lose about half of their activity. So about 1.3% per year is what we estimated. And I think it was Vadim's idea. And I think it was Vadim's idea to actually take this data as well and look at this diurnal pattern. And so, this really started a big trend for our group: looking at patterns and looking at diurnal patterns of activity. So, this is again the same data, and this was a 24-hour wear protocol, so we were able to get nighttime activity as well. And so you see, this is just midnight to midnight, and again, the four data-driven age groups. The only difference is this is looking at counts per minute rather than total counts over the course of the day. And we were really intrigued by what we saw here and the shift. By what we saw here in the shift in the pattern of activity between the younger two-age groups and the older two-age groups. And again, it's cross-sectional, so we can't say what happened, but we did see that people who were employed tended to be more active. And we also thought there seemed to be a shift in what we would think of late-day fatigue or fatigability as people get older. So, this led to us expanding this into other studies, but also in the BLSA to look at some of the underlying reasons behind this. And we've done a lot, but I just want to show you a few. This and we've done a lot, but I just want to show you a few of these that were more intriguing, I think. This was led by Amal Vinakutanga, who was my postdoc at the time. He was interested in looking at cancer history and how there's about 30% prevalence of history of cancer in the BLSA and understanding differences in physical activity by cancer history. And what we saw is that those with a history of cancer tended to have lower activity. And when we calculated the difference, it was equivalent to about five years of age. So just having a history of cancer, and these people are pretty healthy. Having a history of cancer, and these people are pretty healthy survivors because they're still in BLSA, they're still coming to see us for three days and staying on the unit. So, it's a pretty demanding study, but there's still a difference in activity. So, again, showing you how sensitive this kind of measure can be. This is data from STURDI, which Yasek mentioned in his presentation on Monday. So, STURDI is a study of vitamin D and falls in older adults. It's a clinical trial, so pretty much nobody's really heard of it yet because we haven't published anything yet, because the clinical trial just ended, and the main results paper. Trial just ended, and the main results paper has not come out yet, hopefully, in the next few months, and then we can talk more about it. But one of the things I did was wrote a supplement to put accelerometers on everybody, because if people aren't active, they really don't fall, or they can't fall. So it's a major potential confounder of understanding this association. So this is just the control data. So I think it's just over 300 people. And this is looking at the diurnal patterns between followers and non-fallers. So everybody in these groups was only receiving 200 units. Groups was only receiving 200 units of vitamin D per day. There were no higher doses in there. But what we see here, I think, is interesting because even at baseline, the people who reported either falling in the past year or a fear of falling were less active than the non-fallers. And we see over 24 months of follow-up that by 24 months, we see that the non-fallers still had declined. But we're at where the fallers were at baseline. So I think we can detect, but well, the other interesting thing is that. Well, the other interesting thing is that the shape of the pattern is still pretty much the same. So I think that's interesting too. We don't really see a difference in are they active in the morning or the evening, but the shape is pretty consistent. And I should mention that this is risk-level data. And so I think we talked about this a little bit on Monday, that the shape of the data looks more or less the same, especially looking at the diurnal pattern. So I think that's interesting to think about. Another big area we're interested in is understanding the brain-mobility interaction and trying to understand. And trying to understand, there's substantial evidence in the literature that shows gait speed, changes in gait and the way people walk, and their speed, and their mannerisms of walking, their patterns of walking, can manifest before a clinical diagnosis of MCI or dementia. And so there's this big push to understand how movement and the pathology of Alzheimer's disease may interact. So we actually have a grant in this area now. This is unpublished data in BLSA. This is only about 80 people because this is a PET imaging subject. People because this is a PET imaging substudy. But what you're seeing here is a difference in physical activity. This again is the acti heart data, chest level data, looking at people who are positive for beta amyloid versus negative for beta amyloid. And again, we see that their activity tends to be lower throughout the course of the day. But the shape is similar. We don't see what we would think of as sundowning. We don't see a big difference in when they arise and things like that. So more to come with this, we hope. The other thing we've been doing a lot with is what we call looking at transitions between. Call looking at transitions between active and sedentary states. So, this is something that is the work of Vadim. It was his idea. We kind of said we want to understand how to model these transitions in and out of activity. What's a good way to model this? What's a simple way and an interpretable way to model this, which is not always an easy thing. So, Vadi went through, I think, a lot of literature, mainly from the sleep literature, looking at different measures of fragmentation to think about how we could model this. And so, he came up with what he calls the actual. He came up with what he calls the active to sedentary transition probability. It has a big name, but it's actually very simple. It's a binary index looking at activity and duration of activity. So going through, this is a sample N. Haynes data that he extracted, and just looking, this is the waist or the hip level data because there's no overnight, but looking at each minute of the day, are you active, yes or no? And looking at the duration of the bouts. So you end up calculating the number of activity bouts over the duration. The number of activity bouts over the duration of the bouts. The idea behind it, trying to get at this. So, a younger person can easily walk for 10 minutes without stopping. It's a pretty easy task. Someone who's older may walk for eight minutes, stop and rest, and then do the next two minutes. Someone who's very old may walk five minutes, stop and rest, three minutes, stop and rest, two minutes, stop and rest. So you can see they're all getting 10 minutes of activity, but it's accumulated in a very different manner. And we think that this could be very important, especially as people get older, for defining kind of this detail. People get older for defining kind of this declining physiological state, trying to understand how people act in the real world, how they behave in the real world, because we can measure their gate speed, we can measure their six-minute walk, we can measure these things in the clinic, but what they actually do outside the clinic may be very, very different. So we take this and we do it across the entire day. I'm just using 10 minutes as an example window. And what we do, and I'm talking to a bunch of mathematicians and statisticians, it's a very simple calculation. So this person's fragmentation index would be 0.1. Fragmentation index would be 0.1 or 10%, second person would be 0.2 or 20%, third person would be 0.3 or 30%. So it's really a very easy calculation. So the reason we chose this is because Medin went through and looked at what was most predictive of mortality in NHANES. And I think they're still working on publishing that paper. I don't know whatever happened to that paper. His graduate student was leading it. But we took it in BLSA and applied it and looked at it with function. And what we saw was for each point line. For each 0.1 or 10% unit higher fragmentation index, people's gait speed slowed by 0.1 meters per second, which is clinically meaningful. It's actually quite a lot in the world of gait speed. Their fatigue ability or perceived fatigue ability after a standardized task was one unit higher of reading perceived exertion, which is also quite a bit. We saw that on average a 10% higher score meant 31 seconds more to walk 400 meters, which is a lot, so they have lower endurance capacity. Lower endurance capacity. And we saw, lastly, that their expanded short physical performance battery score is about a quarter of a point lower, which is also quite large. So, very, very strongly predictive of functional outcomes. Amal, going back to his work, also wanted to look at it with survival. So, he looked at this with, again, this is ActiHeard data that started in 2007, so the time lapse since it was collected is quite a bit at this point. So, he looked at over up to 10 years of following. Looked at over up to 10 years of follow-up how someone's baseline fragmentation index predicted their mortality. And so, what he saw was a 10% higher fragmentation index was associated with a 49% increased risk of mortality over up to 10 years of follow-up. And the really interesting thing was that this outperformed total physical activity. So, this is different than what Chiprian saw in Enhaden's. We're seeing that fragmentation was more predictive of mortality. Total physical activity did appear to be. Total physical activity did appear to be protective, but it didn't reach statistical significance. So, again, what we see here in this specifically older population is that this may be a more sensitive metric. And I guess I should mention it also outperformed total activity for all the functional outcomes that I mentioned as well. So in older populations, this pattern of activity may be more informative than the volume of activity, especially when we're getting down to lower amounts of activity overall. It may be important to more look at the quality or the pattern of the activity rather than just the Or the pattern of the activity rather than just the amount. So I'm getting short on time, so I'm just going to try to wrap it up quickly. Perry, who's my PhD student, is also looking at activity fragmentation and cognition. And this is a work, a paper that's in preparation where he's seeing that their executive function is lower on a longitudinal basis when people are more fragmented at the baseline. We're seeing lower executive function over time. And then I want to finish with talking just a little bit about a depth, with Marta talked about yesterday. So she and Yassik worked. Talked about yesterday, so she and Yassik worked very hard on this. And I was very, very excited about this methodology because, again, as someone who studies aging, you know, our dream is to understand how people move and how they move in the real world. And so I wanted to take this and understand outcomes related to aging with it. And so going back to sturdy data, this is work in progress, very, very preliminary because it's only about 320 people. But Yasick put this together, and I think this is really interesting. So what you see here is looking at two issues. Here is looking at two in-lab measures of mobility or movement versus cadence-free living measured with the accelerometry, and looking at falls, predicting falls at follow-up. So gate speed, measured in the clinic, very simply, a very strong measure in gerontology, did not predict falls at follow-up. Cadence, measured during the six-minute walk in the lab, did not predict falls at follow-up. Cadence, measured with the accelerometry, using the ADEPT technique that Marta Todd. The ADEPT technique that Marta talked about yesterday did predict falls of follow-up, and such that people with a faster step cadence in free-living environments tended to have lower risk of falls of follow-up. So again, this is very preliminary, because again, it's just the controls. It's just about 300 people, but we're hoping to expand it to the whole trial and understand it in more depth. But I think this is the kind of direction that I hope we'll be moving in, because it takes advantage of the raw data. It takes advantage of trying to understand what this data is really telling us. What this data is really telling us, which is at the heart of it, is how much people move. So, Future Directions is trying to take a lot of these measures we've been talking about and apply them across these populations. So, most of what I've shown you is from BLC or Sturdy, but we're also collecting data in ERIC, the Atherosclerosis Risk and Community Study, which is about 3,000 people. This will all be longitudinal. National Health and Aging Trends Study, also longitudinal. Study of Latinos, that's going to be cross-sectional. That's going to be about 6,000 people. It's going to be about 6,000 people. The MACS study, which is an HIV study, about 900 people. And ACHEE, which is actually a hearing intervention study that has nothing to do with physical activity, but if you give people hearing aids, they may actually move more. And we want to know, do they move more if we increase their ability to hear, if they're out in the environment more, more socially interactive, and those kind of things. And that's longitudinal in about 900 people. We're using the same protocol, all ActiGraph, in all of these people. So we're hoping that eventually this will lead to the ability to try to harmonize. This will lead to the ability to try to harmonize some data, especially at the older age of the spectrum, because this is something that's been lacking in the literature. So, with that, I just want to acknowledge everybody at Hopkins that I work with. And Jeff, I know you're no longer at Hopkins, but you were when I worked with you on this, so you're on the Hopkins side. And then, of course, people that I work with at NIA who are generous enough to let us use their data for all of this. So, that's it. Thank you. Question Just curious, of all the people in your patient population, just approximately how many own smartphones and do they carry it with them? So it's something we've been thinking a lot about. And in sturdy specifically, we've been interested in that because can we interact with them about falls and things like that? It's actually quite high. It's somewhere around 75 to 80 percent. It drops off when people are over about 85, but it's actually quite high. In BLSA, it's almost everyone, but there are. In BLSA, it's almost everyone, but they're a very healthy population, so that would be expected. I feel like a lot of people have been asking about the extent to which some of these markers are intervenable upon. And you sort of brought up that question of reverse causality as well. And I'm like, I think this is a hard question that everybody is thinking about, but I'm just sort of curious if you thought about: are there any studies that we ought to be designing to sort of? That we ought to be designing to sort of get it at? Are there ways that we can use the data that we have now to try to answer some of those questions? So, I think this is really interesting because if you look at the people who are really trailing off in the afternoon, can we do something? Most activity interventions are usually people come to the gym in the morning. Should it be in the afternoon? Because clearly in the morning they're already doing something. It's probably mostly related to activities of daily living, things that they have to do. But maybe those interventions should be in the afternoon. To be in the afternoon. Or maybe what I would like to see, physical activity interventions work. We know they work, but the problem is the sustainability because you're going to take somebody who's 70, like in the life study, people who've never been active and try to teach them to be active at the age of 70 is probably not going to stick once the intervention is done. People like the camaraderie, they like to come in, they like to interact, but when the intervention's over, then what? Can we do something with wearables, right, to better improve the chances of that sticking? Can it be, hey, take a look at the internet? Can it be, hey, take a 15-minute walk at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, or go do something else that may actually be more intervenable and actually more sustainable in the long term? I don't know. We think about this a lot. Amal, who I've mentioned twice, is now faculty at Hopkins, and he's very interested in interventions, and he's testing some things with the Apple Watch now. So we'll see. Maybe. I don't know if you can encourage people to be less fragmented. Maybe. Maybe, because it would just be about length. Maybe, because it would just be about lengthening their bouts of activity. It could be like a byproduct. Yeah, it doesn't walk more active, they become less fragmented. Yeah. Maybe. Instead of walking for five minutes, let's try to walk for seven minutes and build that up over time to be ten minutes and so on. Yes. So is fragmentation just a proxy for fitness? Maybe. Possibly. It is correlated with fragmentation, but it seems like muscle strengthening might translate to a, you know. Translate to a, you know, fragmentation? Quite possibly, quite possibly. I mean, we've seen it's associated with endurance, so it is quite possible that it is, we're capturing this, again, this physiological system in decline. Because we're seeing not only endurance, but also balance and strength as well. So just decline overall. But it cannot be just fitness, right? Because you could have two people who are equally fit and one who decides to be to the Be to just stay in bed and watch TV, another one who just decides fitness doesn't mean that they not live with fitness. No, but the activity fragmentation, I mean, as you presented it, was kind of, you thought, you expressed it as reflecting fatigue, you know, yeah. We think so. That's an interpretation. That's one interpretation. There are ways to test this, actually. So, what we did here is just, are you moving yes or no? Right? And so, in NHANES, that's the sedentary threshold of 100. The sedentary threshold is about 100 counts per minute. With ActiHard, it's about 10 counts per minute. But you could change the threshold, and you could make it the threshold for moderate intensity activity, and then look at how much they transition in and out of moderate intensity activity. So we're just using it for activity overall, but you could test it for higher levels of function and fitness by just changing that threshold. I know I'm standing between you and coffee, but thank you. So just a little bit.
