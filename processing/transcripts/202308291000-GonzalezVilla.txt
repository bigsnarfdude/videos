The invitation to speak in this meeting. And apologies for being late or almost late yesterday. Thank you again to Pedro for taking over. Okay, so I want to speak about a paper I published with Delio Jaramillo Velet, who is now in Sweden. Now in Sweden, in the University of Chamlers, and my colleague in CIMAT, Luis Núñez de Tankur. And so the paper already appeared. And Javiera already mentioned the title. So the main goal, the main motivation or all for this paper was to develop a tool that A tool to get more samples of computations of Fresh, which is an invariant That measures singularities of polynomials where fields of characteristic be bigger than C. Be bigger than zero. Okay, so and then the second is to is the comparison of with the invariance, I mean, comparison with the low canonical. Threshold, which is an invariant over the complex number, right? Okay, so let me start with some notation. Let me start with some notation. So I will say I come from singularities over the complex numbers, right? So Luis Núñez is an specialist in singularities over fields of characteristic, finite characteristic. And I guess the point of this work was using Work was using a tool that is very common in complex geometry and in singularities of the complex number, and bring it to this case of finite characteristic. And this tool is this Ton Sebastiani property or whatever that I will explain later on. But I'm going to start speaking about the F threshold. So I'm going to give a notation and I'm going to define it. So assume F is a perfect. is a perfect field of characteristic p bigger than zero. So perfect means that all non-zero elements on k have roots of order p. Okay, I'm gonna denote by r the polynomial ring of several variables with coefficients on the field k and usually On the field K, and usually I'm gonna denote by M the maximal ideal generated by the variables. And I'm going to introduce also F. So this is going to be a ring morphism from R to R called provenius. Provenius morphism, which is given by sending any element to its people. Okay. So now the invariant Okay, so the definition goes as follows. So the idea is we are going to compare two types of powers. So one is the traditional power, the multiplication given by multiplication of polynomial by itself. Another is looking at the image of the polynomial or the ideal by the Frovenis morphism. So this is going to be Frovenis-Powers. Be from any sports. Okay, so given ideals, so I'm going to take a non-zero ideal that is going to be contained in the radical of another ideal. And the radical of this guy is containing the maximal ideal. So these are all ideals on my polynomial Rhinar. So first, we have these numbers. So nu of A with respect to J, and this depends on the characteristic P and on a number E. And so this is the maximal natural number L such that the usual power of the ideal is not contained in the Frovenius power. The Frovenius power, the usual L power of the ideal A is not contained in the E Frovenius power of J. So, where is there? Over yay given by so it's the ideal generated by the iteration of the Fourier's power of the elements on J. Okay, and now what I'm gonna do is the s threshold is gonna be the limit when e tends to infinity. tends to infinity of these numbers divided by P2B and so I divide I define the F threshold of the ideal A with respect to the ideal J as the limit when E goes to infinity of so this is the F threshold So, this is the F threshold of A with respect to J. Okay, so this limit exists and is known to be rational. So, these are results of Mustata. Mustata Takawi and Guatanabe for the sisters and of rationalities due to obliquely mustata and Smith Karen Smith. Okay, so. Okay, so okay so okay so mainly and in particular for this talk I'm gonna be considered so this is separate. I'm gonna be considered. So, so this is a remark. Mainly we consider the situation where A is a principal idea given by an element in R, F and J is already. Yay is already radical and is equal to the maximal ideal. Okay. So, what is the relation of the F threshold with the low canonical threshold? Okay, so I kind of assume that the audience here is more familiar with the local threshold. Nevertheless, I'm gonna recall what is What is okay? So, so now, uh, given f, so now let's say this is a polynomial, but the coefficients are complex numbers. Okay, so the last canonical threshold of f at zero is by definition the supreme of the rational numbers. numbers such that the inverse of the two times lambda power of the norm of f is locally is locally integer okay so this is kind of an analytic definition but there are algebraic versions of this definition Versions of this definition. So equivalently is the least number and lambda. And now, using this definition, it's easy to see that this is going to be rational then such that Such that the multiplier ideal of F with respect to lambda. And this is given in terms of an embedded resolution of a low resolution. better resolute of a low resolution as the push forward of this shift is different from the local ideal okay or if you want to say it's contained in the maximal ideal uh here uh so well maybe So, well, maybe just in plain words, is there a least jumping number, right? So, so the jumping numbers are where this succession of multiplier ideals jump. Okay, and this is so this is with P being a log resolution of F and And D is the support of the inverse image of F equals zero and the exceptional locus of P. Okay. Also, if you want, you can associate two numbers of the components of V, this new and well. And well, you can actually say two numbers, right? Like μi and Ni. These are going to be the order along the component EI of D of the pullback of the function and mu i is going to be related to the pullback of the standard differential, standard volume form, right? And so you can consider this Cauchy's nu over ni, and it's the minimum of this. ni and it's the the minimum of these quotients right so and uh so this is going to be since the resolution is a finite process there's going to be only a finite number of components so so so here you're you're taking a finite number of questions right and also you can look at the minimum of this thing okay so this is the log canonical threshold so as you see that there are many possible Possible definitions of a low canonical threshold. So it's an invariant that has been studied a lot in the framework of virational geometry, in particular the minimal model program that Pedro was speaking yesterday about. Okay, and now the relation. Well, there is this theorem of Theorem of Mustata Takagi and Watanabe that says that given F with rational coefficients, polynomial with rational coefficients, then the limit when P becomes. When P becomes arbitrarily large of the F threshold of the radiation of F modulo P equals the log canonical of F at zero okay and Okay, and there is also the conjecture that this F threshold and the log canonical threshold do coincide for infinite primes. Doctor of Fong Locke could be sure right, but you're looking at the limit, right? How about the first statement? No, because you're looking for the pranks. It cannot be. You are looking for the limit, right? Given that how the limit may be both computed, you know, so one species bigger node is not gonna be zero, right? Okay. Okay. Okay, so give me, let me give some examples and intuition. Hopefully, intuition. Right? Yeah, I guess giving giving intuition is a good idea. Yeah, I guess giving given intuition is always a will. Okay, so okay, so well, the first example everybody looks at is this x cubed plus y squared, right? So this is the polynomial anyone in. Polynomial, anyone in singularity theory knows how to resolve and everything. So in this case, well, the low canonical threshold is five over six, and this number is bigger than the F threshold. And here we have the following. So, this is going to be so this is going to be dependent on the characteristic p. So, it's going to be one half for p equal two, two thirds for p equal three, and then we have five over six for p when p is congruent one mod six and uh five over 5 over okay, so this is 6 when so it's going to be 5 over 6 minus 1 over 6p, and this is when p is congruent 5 mod 6. And here the observation is that then the conjecture holds because of Dirichlet's theorem that guarantees that there are infinitely many primes that fulfill. That fulfill this condition. Okay, so Okay, so I guess that's the typical sample. So, in particular, now I'm gonna okay, so now one can to try to gain some intuition, one can look at the Newton-Poly. Newton polytopes or Newton polygons of the polynomials and their powers, right? So we consider the monomials in the coordinate plane, right, like Newton does. So you have to consider powers of this thing and compare them to the Frovenius power of the maximal idea. The maximal idea is given by the two coordinates, x and y, and the Frovenius power is just... And the Fravenius power is just taking f to the E of X. So this is going to be X to the P to the power, P to the power E, right? So then I'm going to make this box, square box, right? Okay, so imagine this is a square. I don't know if it is, but so here you're going to have P to the E and P to the E. And now we're going to look to powers of F, right? Of F, right? So I'm going to use the traditional colors for the traffic lights, right? So I'm going to have something like, I can have something like this. So this is F to the power L1. And okay, so here I'm going to have powers of, so I'm going to have something like 3 to the L1, 2 to the L1. The L1. This is one possibility. And in this case, it's clear that this does not belong to the infravenous power of the maximal ideal. Then I can have something like this. So these are parallel lines with the same with the slope of negative two over three or something like that, right? three or something like that, right? Okay, so then this is when I take an L2 powers and then I have two to L2, three to L2. And in this case, well, I don't know. So here I imagine that I can have some monomials here, right? So it's going to depend on the coefficient of these monomials. Coefficient of these monomials. If the coefficients of this monomial vanish, mod p, I'm fine. If not, I don't have a contention, right? And then, well, the other possibility is that everything is above, right? So I'm completely fine, right? Sorry. So these are the possibilities, right? And okay, so now my okay, so now I want to, this is what one can try to do. And so doing that, you can get to these numbers here, right? Actually, you can do a little bit more than that. Than that. So, in another project that I'm doing with Delio, that is in progress, we made some computations in a more general case. So we were looking to any irreducible, locally irreducible singularity of plane car, right? So let me mention that a little bit. So, imagine, so in fact one can generalize in the following way. Okay, so imagine that you have a So, locally irreducible singular plane. Okay, so now Newton Pusset claims that topological Topologically, the situation is determined by the Newton Puisset exponents. So, this is a finite number. So, this is a finite number of exponents. Okay, so let me say that this is A over B, and I'm going to take maybe, so this, what I'm saying is these are co-prime numbers, and just let me say A is smaller than B. Okay? And then I have from these other numbers, I get a Numbers, I get a natural number n. So this n is actually, if you want to be more precise, is the index of the lattice where I have to put C plus lambda one C. So this is a lattice and I want to see the index of this sublattice in the bigger lattice where I have all the I have all the Newton Puisse bonus, right? So this is this number. Okay, you can look at it as also as the degree of a valois existential. Okay, so when you add to the polynomials in one variable, the fractional powers with the sponge, with the Newton Puss exponents. Okay, so with this information, With this information, there is a choice of coordinates. Well, or yeah, there is a choice of, okay, maybe it's a little bit more strong. So, so I'm going to have an equation for C, right? So, I'm going to have a polynomial, right? So, I'm going to have a polynomial, right? Because I want to do things that are defined for polynomials. I'm going to have a polynomial equation for C, for some C in this topological type. And the equation is going to look like this. So it's going to be something like, okay, so let's say Y to the A plus some C, some complex. Some complex, some number c times x to the b plus n plus more things. Okay, so so this is going to give me the Newton polygon that is going to be containing something like r a to the x plus b to the y equals n i b if I not run and this other monomial. And these other monomials are extremely above the Newton polygon. Okay, so now I can play this game with this polynomial, right? And what I say What I say so actually, yeah, I think I say something too weak. So, as far as you have a polynomial equation for f, you can get this. Okay, so if you give me a polynomial in two variables that defines a plain car, and it has an isolated singularity at the origin, I can get. Singularity at the origin, I can get to that with a change of coordinates. Yeah, yeah, from the beginning, I say it's locally reduced. Okay, so if it's not locally reducible, the Newton polygon can be more complicated. So I don't want to. And also, oh, yeah. Okay, so here I can have something more complicated also. So I don't wa I just wanna be in that situation. Can we write the local special threshold just from the Prissot exponent? Just from the Brisal exponent? I'm gonna give me just one minute. What I was going. Okay, so as the S threshold is invariant under change of coordinates, I can compute now with this equation, with this particular equation. Okay, so. So um to do computations and I'm gonna and I'm gonna take in and taking P of the form K and AB plus one we have that okay so so to to do not to disappoint Javier I'm gonna say that with this the low canonical threshold is Threshold is going to be A plus B divided by N A B. Okay? So that you can just, you compute a log resolution of the polynomial and you get that. Okay. So A and B are just the first exponent. Right, right, right. And the N? The N is this other number that comes from the comparison of the first exponent with all the others, right? Right, it depends also on all the forms, it depends on all of them, okay. Okay, so here we have that I have the following monomial So this belongs. So, this belongs to the expansion of F to the A with A is going to be P minus one times the low canonical threshold, and B is gonna be P minus one. uh p minus one divided by a okay so so that means that uh if i do that okay so so so this is the point uh p to the p to the e so i'm gonna have the the point that is right there right so so my newton polygon goes through through that and so i'm really in the in the border right i'm really in the border and then And then so this asterisk is essentially a power of dc. So for p, big and null, I don't care about this thing. And Lucas' theorem tells me that this combinatorial number is not congruent to zero mod p.  I can conclude that f to the power a n, that knows, does not belong to this thing, but since I'm really in the limit, if I take the power a to b plus one, then I totally above the box, so I'm fine. And thus I have the equality for infinitely many primes of the four. Of the form of this form, right? And again, applying DHS students. Okay? So, okay. So you can try to do that in general, but well, maybe it's a lot of it's too straightforward, right? So it's a totally brute force direct approach. So So maybe you don't go very far, but before going forward, I want to mention which is up to my knowledge the most powerful result on this conjecture of the quality of the threshold and the low canonical threshold for infinitely many price. So this is a recent result due to Mustata. You too, Mustata, again. Okay. So this is, I think, just appear in the also in the proceedings of the AMS. Okay, so the whole statement is maybe too long, but I'm going to try to summarize. So it says if actually this is a corollary, so he has some more, he has a Or he has a bound on the on the lower bound on the F threshold. But then from that, he deduced that if P minus one times the low canonical threshold is an integer, and if, and this is a very, this is a very Very strong hypothesis, I believe. So integer, integer, positive integer shifts of the opposite of the log canonical threshold are not roots of the Verstein Satopolynomial of Earth. Then you have the quality. Okay, so this is the Berstein set of polynomial. So d does everybody everybody knows what what what is this thing? It's okay? No? They don't know? Okay. So so so actually Berstensato say that you have an equality. I'm gonna say it very very very very fast. So so you have an equality of the following form. So P is gonna be a differential operator. Well if you want an element in the Bayle algebra. If you want an element in the Bayl algebra, so Bayla algebra is like the polynomials, and then you also allow the partials to the partial derivatives with respect to these variables to ah, and this and then you have an extra variable. So this is an extra variable s. This s can appear in the differential operator. Okay, so this is an object that, well, let's say this is in the variables. In the variables and the partials, and then you add some variables. Okay, so this, okay, and you have this equation. You have an functional identity like this one, and this is the minimal monic polynomial that so there are. So, there are an ideal of polynomials in one variable that verify this type of equalities, and the Bertan Sato is the generator of this idea, right? Okay. So, this is something very well, very powerful, right? So, there is a lot of research about the meaning of the roots of the Verstein-Sato polynomial. They are related to other invariants, jumping numbers, logarithms of the eigenvalues of the monodromy. They give you information about Jordan blocks of the monodromy, a lot of things. Okay, so okay, so now I want to explain what is our Explain what is our contribution to these problems. Okay, so okay, so let me let me say what are Ton Sebastiani polynomials. Okay, so this comes from a paper in Inventiones by Sebastiani and Tom. I don't know why it is say Tom Sebastiani and not the other way around, but it's the I follow the I follow what I think is customary, right? Maybe right. Okay, so so now so now let's consider two polynomials. So these are going to be polynomials in different sets of variables. So so so this join And so then we say if we consider the sum h to be f plus j, so this is a Tom Sebastiani polynomial. Well, Ana, so I guess what Tom Sebastiani discovered is in these cases, this is a particularly helpful situation to Helpful situation to compute some invariance, right? So, so, so, Tom, Tom and Sebastiani prove that the monodromy operator of H is the tensor product of the monodromy operators of f and g. And then there are similar results, and so later on. So later on, there are similar results for other invariants by many people, right? So for example, there is such a result for the Milner number the low canonical threshold. Canonical threshold. Okay, so then generalizations of the Milner number, the spectrum, jumping numbers. I guess they originally had, but this in general, probably this is later proof. I think I Later proof. I think there is a paper of Oka or somebody later on that prove it that this is general, I guess. And for these things, well, Miller number you need isolators, but for these things, it's pretty general. Ah, Igusta theta functions. And so on, right? I don't know. I don't know. Okay, so yeah, I don't know who is. I think this is in the paper, in the famous paper of color by singularities of pears. Spectrum, this must be by Steinbrink and Saito, I guess. Jumping numbers. I think there is a paper by Mustata and somebody else, maybe, I don't remember, and another paper by Maxine. Remember, and another paper by Maxine, Schurman, and Saito. I use a set of functions by the Neflan Serve. So, okay, so okay. So, so, so, so, well, so, so that's uh, it's a natural question. I thought it was a natural question to, to see what happened for thresholds, right? If you consider. And also, and also, okay, I'm gonna say this now, maybe. Daniel Hernandez is a person that computes erasers in many compute thresholds for diagonal. Polynomials. So this is to say for f of the form x1 to the a1 plus xt to the h. Okay, so looking at Daniel's computation and knowing from the world of complex singularities that Singularities that Ton Sebastian is many times a useful strategy. So I thought it was a natural question, try to do Ton Sebastian for results, right? Okay, so now main results. Statement there is just that this is the tensor product, you didn't say that what happens to the the low canonical triangle of these concepts of cancer. Telling polyromic, right? Uh-huh. Correct. I mean, here you're only mentioning the monodromy operator, not the block canonical threshold. Right, but I say there is a result, right? By color. Well, at this case, like it has to do, so it's going to be essentially the sum of the local canonical system. Okay. Okay, so okay, mendra so okay, so first actually I have to say something first. Infinite base P expanses so this is something that So, this is something that is going to be, it plays a role in the statement of the response. So, let me explain it very briefly. So, take a number between 0 and 1 and p prime. Oh, okay. So, I'm kind of late. So, there is an expression of this one. That's that. Such that the numerators are between zero and p minus one and are different from zero for infinitely many e values. So therefore, these are infinite expansions, right? These are infinite expansions, right? Okay, and I'm gonna, so notation is that sometimes I'm gonna cut these expansions, right? So I'm gonna, if I cut, if I cut the expansion at the level L, this is my notation for that. So with angle brackets, subscript L. So this is the sum from E from between E equals one. Between e equal one to l right okay so so an example okay very very briefly an example so so you saw that before I use I mentioned many times that P is mod ones congruent to something right so so so so so here's an example if you have that alpha If you have that alpha is A over B and P is congruent one mod B, then you multiply in both sides by P. So you have and here you can write something like EW P plus one over P A over B. And by recursion, you get that you You get that this is equal to the infinite sum of AWP to D. Okay. So now may restart now. Okay, so let F be the sum of two polynomials, G1 and G2, with G1 in R1, G2 in R2, with, okay, sorry, I'm trying to. Okay, sorry, I'm trying to go very fast. So, this is gonna be in the maximal of R1. So, it's gonna be in the maximal idea of R2. And these are in these joint sets of variables. And let's say that A1 is the F threshold of G1, A2 is the F-threshold of G sub two. So this joint sets of variables. Of variables. Okay, and if you want, you can say that the A1 and A2 is less than 1, but that's really not very essential. So the statement says that F threshold of F can be just the sum. So this is if some quantity is infinite, that I'm going to explain what was the. It that I'm going to explain what's the meaning of L. And otherwise, it's the sum of the truncations up to the level L of the canonical thresholds plus one over P to the L. So this is if L is finite. And L is the level up to the expansions at without carrying. Carring ah, okay, so I skipped that, right? So, so I say alpha and beta add with carbon if alpha E plus beta E is less or equal P minus one for all E. For only. And then here, so in my statement is with L being the maximum N such that we have equals equals equals or one let's have equal E must that equal A. Okay, so that's the statement. Okay, so that's the statement. And I already said that Hernandez proved a similar statement for diagonal surfaces. So let me can I do an example? Okay, so a sample. Okay, so the statement in the paper is more general. We don't take A, so we consider more general ideas, right? But okay, for the sake of the talk, I just consider J equal. Consider j equals m, right? So that can be done more general. And we have a statement more general than this one for what is called test ideals. So test ideals are the, so the threshold is the characteristic p version of the local canonical threshold. Test ideal is, let's say, the characteristic peak of multiplier ideal. So we have a statement for the first test ideal. Okay, I don't have time to do that, but. Uh I don't have time to do that, but uh uh yeah, okay, so just answer okay so I'm gonna take f a sum of three three different polynomials in different sets of variables so these are the explicit uh forms of the polynomials this is gonna be a diagonal polynomial so so by Hernandez you know that um oh okay let me let me maybe Okay, let me let me maybe okay so so so you know that the threshold u one is one half and this is equal to the log canonical threshold of f for a set B1 of primes of the form for an infinite set of primes of the form P is congruent one module mod mod 16. One module, mod 16. For G2, I'm going to take what is called a binomial, polynomial. And this were also studied by Daniel Hernandez. Okay, so here I have that by Hernandez, I know. I know that this is 3 over 16, and that it equals the low canonical threshold of G2. And this is for, again, an infinite set of primes that are congruent to one mod 32. Okay. And then G3 is a monomial. G3 is a monomial, b squared plus u to the power 3 plus t8, for example. So for monomials, the threshold does not depend on the characteristic, right? Because when you take your powers, there are no essentially monomials involved, right? And actually, the low canonical anadest threshold is given by the inverse of the biggest power. So in this case, it's one eighth. Okay, so with our result, right? So you can say now m is the maximum of the polynomial ring in all these indeterminates, x, y. Minus x, y, c, w, u, b, t, whatever. So you can say that actually, in this case, this is the sum of all these things. And this coincides with 13 over 16, which is the log canonical threshold of f. And this is okay. So, so here, what I'm saying is, I'm going to take, I'm going to take I'm gonna okay so so this is for for for for infinitely many primes of the form P that are congruent one mod 32. And what I'm saying is this is this is so so in this case this sum is without current and everything works. And what I'm saying is what we prove in the paper is in general We prove in the paper is in general when you have a situation like this, and you have an infinite intersection of these families of primes, and you have addition without current, then you can deduce that the conjecture holds. Okay, so that will be the general result. And okay, and I'll stop here. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you, Mama, for being very clear and are there any questions? No, but today I have a question about the log canonical threshold, in fact, so oversea. So is it topological invariant so that we have the result for distance Sebastiani's polynomial and we can conclude for so this is this is what Javier asked before, I think. So, my answer is that there is a okay. Well, now your question is a little bit stronger because you're asking if it's a topologically invariant, right? So that we can apply to polynomials that are not of the Sebastian type, but are topologically equivalent to them. I think it is. I think it is. At least in, yeah, I think it is. Because at the end, well, I mean, if you have a particular solution, then you're fine. So I think it's probably, I know, I don't remember. I think it's probably, yes. So for the scope of the paper, and we use a result in the paper of singularities of press, the famous paper of singularities of pairs of color. And then it says that if. Of color, and then it says that if the sum of the low canonical threshold is less than one, then it's equal to the sum. If it's bigger than one, then the polynomial is local. Thank you. Any other question? I have a question. And if you have a parameter family of polynomials, so usually So, usually one expects upper semi-continuous, but also one expects on a Zariski open set to be constant. Is this true for your in your case? I didn't look at that. I'm not sure. I think in the paper of Mustada, if I remember, maybe he used something like that. So, I will refer you to maybe to paper of Mustada. So a similar question to Maria Parisio's question. Is there some similar equivalence relation like topological equivalence for this characteristic P? Is there some more? Not that I know. Are there any questions online? Okay, thank you very much, Mehmed.
