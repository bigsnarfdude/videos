There's a very large literature on that. I'm just putting some papers, not all of them at all, but the ones that are the most relevant to our results. What I think we contribute to that literature, but I'm not wrong, is that we've made the link to this information acquisition from the mechanics, but also we look at a slightly different object that's not been studied somewhat. We look at the monotonicity of the boundaries, and traditionally, or most of the paper I'm aware of. I'm aware of, tend to look at the regularity of the broader age. For economists, we think that monotonicity is slightly more relevant. So let me give you quickly the general setting. So we're going to look at the stopping of a diffusion on a domain. X is just going to be an open connected subset of R. And that's going to be our general stopping problem. And that's going to be our general stopping problem. So the decision maker will choose a stopping time to maximize what it gets from a flow payoff plus payoff at the time of stopping. Subject to the state variable evolving according to significant processes. Okay, so for today, I'm just going to assume that everything is regular enough, and that we'll simplify the exposition, then we'll Will simplify the exposition, then we relax some of this assumption in the data. Okay, just one comment. Yeah, we're looking at a problem in which the decision maker can make a decision, choose an action at the time of stopping. So you can think of each of these eye as an action. And the payoff of this action depends on the state. I'm going to look at points that are uniformly elliptic. No, sorry, not uniformly. No, sorry, not me only, that are strictly elliptic. And I'm going to assume that V is continuous. With a little bit of continuity, either on F and G or with something else, it's in fact. Actually, in this setting, I'm pretty sure that it's not even an assumption, it's an implication of the regularity assumptions. Okay. And now I'm going to give you the definition for the main objective study. We're going to focus on the environmental taronatan because we want The target on the task because we want, in the end, to obtain a condition under which the concentration region is monotonous. And so we can say that a stopping problem is locally strictly monotonous at some time interval if the value function is locally strictly monoton in the continuation region or even there. It is everywhere. It's okay too. It can't be everywhere because uh on the stopping region is called G. Sorry. Uh and then we're gonna impose some condition. we're going to impose some conditions that are condition on the on the derivative of the different object including the the derivative of the value function so the condition on the condition on the endogenous object so that's why in the second part of the paper we're going to show you or we try to show that we can check this condition like it is if the the volume is a molecule decreasing we we want the the time derivative of the volatility The time derivative of the relativity, time the solidarity of the function to be decreased or to be negative. Another condition on the grade, and then a condition on the disconstruction. And the cost. Each of these conditions we can interpret. Given time I'm not going to spend, or I'm not going to try to do that now. Let me just give you a quick intuition for this one, because it's going to be the one that played the major role in context of the polymer mode. Context of the polymer mode. So, what does it say? It says that the volatility decreases over time. Which means that in any small interval of time, the information we get becomes less and less accurate. If your value function is complex, which is the case we're interested in, it means that the expected value function upon this small interval of time is decreasing as time passes. So, that's why we have this. So that's why we have this type of definition. Okay, and so now it's one more definition. Just a definition of what it means increasing for the continuation region. We're going to say that the concentration region is strictly increasing or decreasing over time. If it's increasing or declining within the set order or in the inclusion order. And on top of that, for both boundaries, or for points at the boundaries, if diabasis is strictly included in the Included in the interior of the conciliation region for increasing, or strictly included in the interior of the stopping region for increasing cost. And now that's our first result, and that's the tool we use then to show that for convex stopping problem, the continuation region is either decreasing or created. So, if an optimal stopping problem is locally strictly monopoly, then the optimal continuation is a problem. Then the optimal continuation region is locally strictly monotonous. If it's locally strictly monotonous decreasing, it's going to be the continuation region is going to be locally strictly decreasing and vice versa. And the proof of that is not very hard, actually. Just relies on which the methods. So first, weak monotonicity is completely trivial. Because back in the definition of monotonic of a monotonous stopping problem, we have that the value function is decreasing over time. We have that the value function is decreasing over time. My stopping payoff is independent of time, so I'll get the recognition essentially for free. String point ethnicity is a little more, but not super hard, and it's by contradiction. So if we suppose that there is a flat path of the boundary, then the derivative of the value function, solve the derivative of the equation, or the derivative in the preservation region, derivative of the diffusion equation. But then we can, well, humans should. We can, well, given sequential regularity of the boundary and of the solution of that problem, we can use the boundary lemma to obtain a contradiction. Say that the cost derivative in time and space will be strictly positive or strictly negative, depending on the condition we have. But on the boundary, my value function is equal to the stopping tail. And sweet space to all, also should be a derivative here. And so the Derivative here. And so the derivative of the value function is constant. So that's a good function. That was not very. Yeah, but that's how we do it. Okay. So now that we have the main, maybe very quick. Now that we have the main tool, we're going to apply this tool to a class of problem that here is a sub-class event of convex topic problems that are martingale convex topic. And what are they? It's a problem in which the It's a problem in which the payoff at the moment of stocking are convex. The cost function or the flow payoff is also convex in the state. The discount factor is constant and if it's called to zero, eventually we want to stop. That's what this condition says. So it's either a finite horizon or eventually there's a cost. I want to receive a positive flow pay of whatever. Anyway, and it's a basical problem, so here u is equal to zero. Here u is equal to 0. So you do not drift. Okay? And so the first proposition tells you that in mathematical problem, it's very easy to check whether they are strictly monotonous or not. Simply, a mathematical complex token problem is strictly monotonous if and only if it's not an if. A sufficient condition for that is that the volatility is decreasing, or strictly increasing it. 3D model increasing if the volatility is increasing over time and the full flow payoff is increasing over time, and vice versa for declaiming. And so, as a coalition of these things, we get that the continuation region in an artinial convex topic column is strictly decreasing over time. If the vertices are strictly decreasing, the the flow behavior is decreasing and at least one of them is strictly. So that's the result we use to obtain the the first result in the matrix. Result in the mass patient. So that's what's for the example. So let me try to summarize very briefly what we did in this paper. So we looked at a strictly motor environment, or we define strictly motor environment, and we connect them to the evolution of this topic in constitutional region in a simple topic order. We exhibit two classes of problems in which our conditions are very easy to check. Today I've only talked about co-mixed topic problems, but in the paper we also have like a Stopping problem, but in the paper, we also have like a stopping with random deadline. And then the technique we have, they're fairly adaptable. So everything implemented here with strong regulative conditions was for simplicity only. All this regularity can be relaxed quite a bit. Essentially, what we need is that everything is lip sheet with respect to time. They can be adapted also to characterize the shape of the scoping region, mixed scoping and controller columns. And so the one next thing we want to do is, here we were looking at the one-dimensional solving problem. We would like to know what happened when we were looking at n-dimensional problems. Here our problem is that the technique with user PG techniques and they require that the domain is relatively well behaved. In one dimension, it's very easy to get in more than one dimension. It's not completely straightforward, at least. So thank you very much for listening to me. Thank you very much for listening. Questions? Okay. So you said that if the problem is convex, it's easy to check. Can you give one example, specific example, where I have the continuity of the free boundary? The continuity of the free boundary? Yeah, this is the main result, right? And the free boundary is. You say that in the bullet points in the slide before, or two or one before, you say that if the stopping problem is convex, then it's easy to check the conditions on the prime rules. Give me an example of that. Okay, so for example, I'm not sure I'm understanding well, but the example I gave in the introduction, this one is an example of a convex stopping problem. Yeah? Because this is a maximum of a smooth. This is the maximum of a smooth convex function. This is a constant. And this is just any function. So what we need in this problem is we need the derivative of C, which is equal to zero, to be non-negative or non-positive, and the derivative with respect to C of that object to be also of the same type. And so the only thing we need to check is this derivative. In that problem, we're In that problem, where this is the probability that mu is true greater than zero, there's an explicit formula for that. You can compute it just using a central base rule. And then just checking whether this derivative is non-negative. It turns out that for this type of problem, as long, that's what I said here, as long as the support of f contains more than two points, the derivative will be non-profit. Will be uh non-pristy. So, in general, I think one side is if you look at the free boundary, lower seven continuity, I think is easy, the other one is the difficult one generally doesn't go. So, something gives you that the other condition over here. So, the problem I'm looking at, it's a lot of problem. So, we get one side like that, like you said, like every optimal starting problem gives one side this easy. Lower side continuity, or I don't really. Lower set continuity, or I don't remember which one, but one of them was immediate. The other thing that we get is that everything is well, or at least in what I presented, everything is well behaved. So we've got a lot of regularity coming from the value function. So in what I presented, for example, under this assumption, the value function is L P S F solution or sublime solution. And so it has a like a partial derivative that are order continuous. Derivatives that are order continuous, then we can use that plus the Lightness or Newton-Lightness formula to rule our charts. I think the question of me then is that you need to have it you need to have this figure generally because you make by contradiction and say that it's not continuous or right or left continuous or Or right or left continuous. So you assume that it's not curved and you have a continuity up, so you apply the generator on the continuation. And you pass to the limit, and you get the contradiction because when you apply the generator to payoff, you know the sign. But it is not expected. And here, here. Like that is generally not expected. No, no, no, but you can do this in a week for No, you can do this in a weak form, but what works. Okay, so the minimum payoff I need for that, but so come back to the question of method, I think that what is what is unclear for me is when you apply the generator to the table, how do you know the sign? How do you know that L or G is uh has a sign? Okay. Um it's because of some of the assumption I I make here. The assumption I make here. Yeah, but this one is our homogeneous, as you mentioned. What I like is some scene where I everything that you wrote with G and not with V. Okay, but this condition, I wrote it like that, I agree with the bit of here. Maybe I should have taken more time. But this condition, you need to hold locally at the bottom level. For convex talking problems, we can just forget about that because that's positive. This one, Um this one, uh in general, I can show that the smooth space thing in in space always old because the value function is a sublime solution. But can you learn so that would mean one w one one? Okay, w one two p. Log you have two two derivatives in L P So that I can show you. Then I can show if sigma is I think Lipschitz or alpha order is probably enough. And then given that, we have that this thing is equal to the derivative of g at the border. And then this, I mean, I can just sign the value function by direct argument. Or value functions that are bounded below, I can take them to be non-negative actually. Not negative, actually, like as a normalization. Yeah, so okay, but no, I can definitely rewrite that. Yeah, maybe it would be a good thing to do. I can rewrite that as a as a as a condition on G. I think, yeah. The problem is like this one I cannot, I mean, I can never rewrite as a condition on G. Or I don't know how to do it at least. But the supernova derivative. Yeah. Yeah, but some distribution. Yeah. That's what distributed. Any other questions? None, thank you very much. We think uh thing uh uh we have this one that after point three and the question is whether And the question is whether to organize something for like a group or just do it individually. How many people think that they would be interested in organizing everybody together? Just show of hands, please? With or without telephone? Just where you want to go. My phone is giving, it's giving. Okay. So also if you have a car and are willing to do the street together, can you maybe email to Dylan and we know how to do it? Maybe email to Dylan, and we know how many cars we have, so we know whether we have to otherwise try to organize or just have five cars. So, email to Dylan if you have a car. Okay, do you want to measure how many cars are interested? No, I like not just for it. I want to have three of us.
