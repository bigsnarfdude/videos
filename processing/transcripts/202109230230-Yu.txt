Okay, so first thank you very much for the invitation. And today I want to give you talk about the permutation orbifles of VOAs and associative algebras. And here is the plan. So in the first part, I will introduce some basic notions that I need to use in this talk. And I also talk about the And I also talk about the background or motivation of studying this topic. In the second part, I will recall the classical results about associative algebra of VOAs. And in the third part, I give you the main results that we have obtained so far about associative algebra of permutation or befos. And first, let me fix some notations. So we still let So we still let Vy1 omega be a VOA. And this Y is the vacuum and omega is the biosaural element. And this G is an automorphism of this VOA with finite order. And the order, we are going to use that capital letter T to represent the order of this automorphism. And then the VOA can be written as a sum of the eigenspaces for this automorphism. eigen spaces for this automorphism. And here, this V to R represents the eigen space with this eigenvalue. This is V to R. And we need to use this notation later again. Now let me introduce three types of twist T modules. And the first type is called a weak G twist T B module. And for such module, first is a vector space. A vector space and for any vector in the VOA corresponds to a vertex operator that can be written in this form. And the vertex operator satisfies some conditions. For example, lower trungation and the vacuum or the VOA corresponds to the identity map of this M. And the fourth condition, this is called a twisty Jacobi identity. If you compare to the Jacobi identity for the usual Jacobi identity, The usual Jacobi identity. There was an extra term here. And here, this U is from this V to R, the notation I just fixed. And this capital T is the order of this automotive, G. This is the notation we already have seen. So this is the notion of weak G twist T V module. And you see that actually in the notion of G twist T V module, there's no gradation condition. And this is called weak V module. And if we weak V module. And if we take this G equals the identity map of the G equals the identity map, then you get a notion of weak V module. That's the untwisted case. The second module is called admissible G twisty V module. And this module, first is a weak G twisty B module. And we also require that it has a G plus over T gradation. The Z plus over T gradation, and this is the so-called gradation condition. So you see that the conditions for admissible G2TB module is stronger than the weaker case. And still, if you take a G equals identity map, then this notion will give you a demisible B module. And we know that the rationality is defined by the semi-simplicity of a demisible B module category. We say that a BOA. We say that a VOA is G-rational if the admissible G-twisty B-module category is semi-sembled. And if this VOA is one rational, which means that it's just the notion of the rationality. This is G-rational. Okay, now the third type of module is called the G-twisty B module. And first, this is still a weak G-twisty B module. And we require that actually this M has gradation. Gradation is actually can be written as a sum of eigenspaces for the L0 operator. This L0 is the component operator, correspond to a biosoral element of the BOA. And we also require that each eigenspace is of finite dimension and also this condition. This is called a G twisty B module. And we sometimes also call this ordinary G twisty B module. And similarly, if you take a G equals And similarly, if you take a g equals the identity map, then you get the notion of ordinary V module, the untwisty case. So those are the three type of G twisty V modules that I need to use later. Now, let's back to the topic. So I said that we are going to talk about a permutation orbifold. And we all know that Orbifold is just you consider the settled fixed point. A settled fixed point under if you consider the settled fixed point of this VOA under a finite automorphism group, then we say we know that this V2G also has a V structure. This is orbifold BOA. And it's well known that one of the most important thing in orbifer theory is to understand different module categories. And the type of orbifer that we want to study is called permutation orbifer. Is called a permutation orbifold. The so-called permutation orbifold is that you consider a tensor product of BOAs. Then we know that this is still a BOA. And now we consider any sigma that is an element from the symmetric group. Then this sigma acts on the elements from the tensor product BOA by permuted sub-index here. Then you see that this sigma naturally becomes an automorphism of the tensor product VOA. Automorphism of the tensor product VOA. Now we consider the this tensor product VOA and the fixed point of this tensor product VOA under a finite permutation group. Then such orbifold is called a permutation orbifold. So this is the type of VOA that we want to study. So you might have a question that's why do we want to study this type of permutation or before? Why not just the general obvious? Why not just the general obvious? So, one reason is that if you look at the tensor product, the VOA here, you see that actually you can consider a tensor product of any VOA, which means that actually you can consider permutation orbifer of any VOA. And we know that such permutation orbifer has connection with the original VOAV. So, in some sense, we can say that when you study the permutation orbifold, this permutation or befold. And this actually also reflects the properties for the original VOA. So it should be interesting to study the permutation orifold. This is one reason. Another reason is we know that, as I mentioned, one of the most important thing in orbifold theory is to understand the different module category. And we know that in general, it's very difficult to construct TC modules. But for permutation orbifold, we know how to. Permutation OB fold, we know how to construct a TCT modulus. This is another reason. Okay, so about permutation OB fold, actually early from 1997, Borisov and Hemper and Schweger, and they already started G-twisty representations for a fine biosaural and superbiathoral BOAs. And they used the generators for those D algebras to study the G-twistity of Studied the G-20 opera, G-26 representations. And those results were generalized to the general symmetric group in Benthist paper in 1999. And then in 2005, Cass Longo and she studied communication orbifers from the point of view of conformance. And this is actually another reason that we started to consider the problems about permutation orbifold. About a permutation orbifold. So, in this paper, they actually give fusion rules of two significant permutation orbifolds. But when it comes to order three, they couldn't give the fusion rules. So one of our co-authors, she asked a question. She asked if we can just give an example of permutation orbifers of VOA, at least like order three. And then we find that actually at that time, we find that even for At that time, we find that even for the order two case, we couldn't find examples. That's the reason we started to study examples of permutation all before at the first beginning. And this is from a conformal nest point of view. In 2002, Barrendon and Mason gave the explicit construction for general permutation or BFOS of 2C modules for general permutation or BFOs. And I mentioned the detail. And I mentioned the detailed result later again because I will need to use the results here. And the equivalence of the two constructions of permutation treatment modules for lattice BOAs and the constructions in Baron-Domesis's paper was given in Baron Kwang and the Positive paper in 2007. And then later, Abiy and Miyamato proved the C2 co-finalness of fermentation orbifolds and also for the general cyclic orbifolds. Obivodes. So those are results from permutation orbifos. And as I mentioned, in 2016, we started to study examples of permutation orbifos. And we actually gave two cyclic permutation orbifolds and three cyclic permutation orbifolds of lattice BLAs. And we classify irreducible modulus for this permutation orbifolds. And we also give a fusion rules. And for k equals three case, we also. And for k equal to 3k, we also use the fusion rules to give the asymmetries for the permutation orbifows. This is what we have done in those paper when we study the examples here. And then later, permutation orbifles for Heisenberg vertex algebra or five algebra and varasaur vertex algebra were studied for k equals two or k equals three for by Miners, Penn, Shao, and Sadowski. Zadowski. And those are all examples of those are examples of permutation or befalls or BOAs. And in 2009, we proved a general result, which is about fusion products of untwisted and twisted modules for a test product BOA. Because when we study the examples here, we give the fusion rules for those permutation orbifold, and we find that there is some connection between the fusion rules. Between the fusion rules for the permutation orbifold and the fusion rules for the original BOA. So that's a natural question: whether we can give a straightforward formula that can tell you the connection here. So in this paper, we actually give a very clear formula that you can see the fusion rules in the as the tensor as modulus for tensor product VOA and the fusion rules for original VOA. VOA. Okay, now let's go back to the results by Barrendor and Mason. So they proved that, so if I let this G be a K-cycle commutation, they actually prove that there's one-to-one correspondence between the irreducible V module categories and irreducible G2ST modules for the tensor product VOA. And actually, they proved the result for the three module. The result for the three module categories I just mentioned. If this is weak, then this is weak, and if this is admissible, admissible, and if this ordinary, then this is ordinary. But since later, I only need to use this result, so I only write down this one. And more explicitly, if I let this M be an irreducible admissible V module, and the corresponding GTC module for the tensor product VOA is denoted by this TGM. Then, as TGM. Then, as a vector space, this M and T G M are the same, but the vector space and the vertex operator are different. So, here, if you compare this YM bar with this YM, you see that there is a delta operator here. And the Delta operator is given by the following conditions here. So, this is the G20 module for the tensor product VOA. The structure is given here. And conversely, if you are given a G20. If you are given a GTC module for the tested product VOA, you can also construct an irreducible module for this for original VOAB. And this is a one-to-one correspondence here. This is the result by Aaron Dorman Mason. Okay, now let's review the basic result about associated. About associative algebra. So in 1996, Zhu constructed an associative algebra, which is usually denoted by this AB. And the way they define the associative algebra is that first for inhomogeneous, they define two operations, which are denoted by a star and the circle here. And let the OV denote. V denote the subspace of V spanned by all the elements u circle V and U and V are just any elements from this V. Then now we can consider the quotient space, which is V quotient. This is subspace. Oh, I just find I forgot to force great. Okay, so true proof that actually the subspace OB is a two-sided idea under the The idea under the operation star so that this star is actually well defined in this associated in this quotient space. And furthermore, he proves that actually the star, this operation induces the structure of an associative algebra in the quotient space AB. And if we use this V bracket V to denote the image of the element in the quotient space, we know that this AB is a quotient space. And if we denote this as If we denote this as the image, now the image of the vacuum actually is the identity for the associative algebra, and the image of the biosolid element of the BOA actually is in the center. Furthermore, he proves that there was a one-to-one correspondence between irreducible admissible V modulus and irreducible modulus for the associative algebra. And if V is rational. And if v is irrational, then the associative algebra is semi-simple associative algebra. That's the Juice result. Now, let's review the result for Donnie Mason. So, in 1996, Donny Mason generalized the Juice result to G twisty module, to twisty modules, and let this G be automorphism with finite order, and they actually construct. And they actually constructed an associative algebra. And we are going to call this a twisty associative algebra. This is denoted by A sub G V and there are also two operations here. For U in this V to R V to R is the eigenspace I already fixed in the first beginning. For such U and any V and V, they define the U star V G V and U circle G V in this form. And similarly, one can also define Similarly, one can also define a quotient, a subspace OGV that is spanned by all elements. That can be written as U circle G V. UV are just any elements from this V. Now, if we consider the quotient space, then we can also get similar results. And notice that when you look at the operations here, if you take a G equals identity map, the U circle G V and the U star G V and U circle G V. U star G V and U circle G V actually just coincide with the star and the circle in Juice algebra. So you see that actually the AGV and the OGB when G equals one A G V and O G V are just A B and O B in Juice algebra. And they prove the similar results. So the subspace OGB is a two-sided idea of this B with respect to the product strategy. And this strategy also gives And this statue also gives an associative algebraic structure on this quotient space AGB. And the image of the vacuum is also the identity for this twisty associative algebra. The image for virusaural element is in the center of this associative algebra. Furthermore, there is a bijective correspondence between the irreducible admissible G2STB model. admissible G twisty V modulus and the an irreducible simple modulus for the twisty associative algebra. And if V is G rational, then the twisty associative algebra is a finite dimension, some simple algebra. This is a Donny Meses result. Okay, now if we use those results to consider the permutation orbifer case, so in particular, now we want to take this V. Now we want to take this V to be the tensor product VOA, and we want to take this G to be K cycle. Then we will see that actually, if we combine Jules' result, Donny Mason's result, and Berendos Mason's result, you will see that Jules result, as we have seen, tells you that there is a one-to-one correspondence between irreducible, admissible, V-modulus and irreducible modulus for associative algebra. Donny Mason's result says that there is a one-to-one correspondence. There was a one-to-one correspondence between irreducible, admissible, g-twisty modulus for the case of product VOA and irreducible modules for the twisty associative algebra. But in the meantime, we also know that Berendong and Mason's results tell you that there was a one-to-one correspondence between irreducible, admissible V modulus and irreducible, admissible G2C modulus for a tensor for WA. So there was a one-to-one correspondence between here and here. Correspondence between here and here. So you see that by you combine all these results and the observation about this AB and HEB tensic, you will find that actually this twisty associative algebra actually should be isomorphic to this AB. But we didn't really know how to find the isomorphism. We know that they should be isomorphic, but we don't know how to find the isomorphism. So we finally find the isomorphism. finally find the isomorphism. So the way we did this is that first we consider we first proved that the traced associative algebra actually can be spanned by elements of this form. And here the U to A is just an element from the tensor product BOA. We see the eighth place is U and the other place other tensor factor are just ones. And this is the elements that is formed. The elements of this form. So if I take k equals 2, the elements of this form is just u times 1 plus 1 times u. So one can prove that this twisty associative algebra for a tensor product BOA can be spent by elements of this form. And you see that elements of this form is very simple, right? So once we have this result, we can prove that actually for if we define a map such that map phi such that any elements of this form is a map to k delta k1 u you see that here the only thing varies here is u right and this is mapped to this one and the bracket here still means the corresponding element the image of the elements in v in this quotient space and this is image of the k delta k1 u in the quotient space here and we were able to prove that this find gives an isomorphism between this associated Between this associative algebra and this associative algebra. And this is the case that when this G is just, when this G is just a cycle, if this G is a general permutation, then we know that in this case, this G can be written as a product of these joint cycles. And in this case, we were able to prove that actually the twisty associative algebra is just as. Algebra is just isomorphic to tensor product of the associative algebras A V's. And this is the main results we have obtained so far about the associative algebra of the tensor product VOA. And we expect that this result will be useful for computing the associative algebra for the permutation obives here. Here. And there should be so the next problem we need to think about is what is the associative algebra of this permutation of Bifold and what is the relation, what's the connection among this associative algebra and the twisty associative algebra of the tensor product VOA and the associative algebra of the original VOA AB. And this is the problem that The problem that we are still working on. And that's all for my talk. Thank you.
