So my battery was empty, so it takes some time to uh wake up again. So that's how we started to think about how loops appear in networks. And apparently this is also loops appear quite a bit in nature. It's not only in jellyfish, as you know from here. We work on very different subjects here and loops. Here and loops appear in many of these networks in cities, in rivers, river deltas, in ant nests or termite nests. What can we think of more? Looking at the people, if I have more inspiration to see. In leaves, of course, in fination of leaves, in many different systems, we see these groups appearing. And so that's. So that's why we started to think how we could gather all this knowledge together. And I think it's a rather special meeting because normally we go to meetings for physics, we go to meetings for biology, we go to meetings on different subjects on geology. But meeting all together here is a very special idea. So just a bit of history how we got there, because in 2020 we started actually We started actually looping network meetings online, and they started with Stanislav, who came as a master student to Paris, and there was a lockdown. So he came from Rachel to Paris, and the poor guy was not allowed to leave his student apartment or studio, small studio. And so we said, what should we do to save it? And then we started this looping network. And then we started these looping network meetings. And these looping network meetings grew little by little. First, there was the Polish group, evidently, they joined in. Then people from the US joined in. People from the UK, it became bigger and bigger. And so we have still regular meetings on looping networks. So if you like to sign up, you can contact me or Stanislav or John. So we are. So, we are regularly organizing these meetings, and it's online meetings because it's very international. So, and then we had actually, Stéphane and I are in a master, where we torture the students. It's an introductionary week, and we torture the students to say, okay, in one week you have to create a project. And of course, they complain, they say, it's terrible. In one week, you cannot create a project. And they do, and they always come up with. And they do, and they always come up with great projects. And then Piotr and Stanislaus said, Yeah, there's this burst, but the deadline is in two days or three days or a week. I don't know. It was very short. Should we do something? And then we said, yeah, but if we ask the students to do something in one week, we can do this too. So we started to do this. And luckily, we were accepted for having a meeting, but not here. Meeting, but not here, it was originally meant in Mexico, which sadly was cancelled because of lack of money. A big finance supporter from the Casa Matemática Oasaca, due to the financial crisis, they stopped giving money. And that was a real problem for this site. And they could help us to have only 14 participants. Participants. We said, oh no, we cannot do that. We cannot just have 14 participants. We have already invited more than 40 people to come here. So, what to do? So, we had an intense exchange with this overheading birth organization, which has different sites and also here. And then they said, okay, you can apply for new. So, that's what we did. We applied for new, and actually, we just filed the same. And actually, we just filed the same application and it got accepted to be here. And now we are here in 2024. So it was a long history. It took us four years to realize this. But it's really a great pleasure to have you all here. So, just a bit on the statistics. We are very interdisciplinary. From your abstract, the web. From your abstract, your website, I gathered a bit your interests and I gathered your discipline, what is your major background. I gathered a gender, so what is your phenomenal mia, and what is your status. And so you see, your interest is superlated. Your discipline is also, it's lots of physics, but it's also. Lots of physics, but it's also rather diverse. We have biologists, we have mathematicians, many physicists, biophysicists. We have a chemical chemist here. I don't know who it is, but just to say to you, it's very introduced. And why I'm saying this, it's very important to make a good introduction to. Introduction talk because not many people will, like in your usual conferences, will have the background to follow what you are talking about. So please be interdisciplinary and pedagogical to explain what you are doing. Okay, so that everybody can follow and you do not lose anybody. We have 30% female. It's too little. We try always to get more, but it's But it's a story that we will continue. And we have many young researchers, and the majority is Adela Senior Research. So also, we are missing a few participants. It's very sad. It's apparent that Sharon, due to private reasons, she cannot be with us. We regret it a lot. She organized with us the conference. And Sharon is really. And Sharon is regretting herself very much not to be. Then there are Poor Ba, Ayden, and Rishab. There are three people from India. And we are very sad to learn that they have visa problems. They changed the rules. Indian people have to ask for a visa to come in in Canada. And I think it's a recent change. And unfortunately, And unfortunately, the embassies all over the world are over the Canadian embassies are overbooked, and it takes a very long time to get an appointment and to get the visa to come up. And they didn't succeed. So we are very sad about this. But for sure, Puba and Ivan will be online with us to give their presentations. So we are happy about it. And Sharon will be online too to give their presentations. So now we are very interdisciplinary and now how to organize this meeting? So we could have organized it blood vessels, blood vessel networks, river networks, leaf networks, leaf formation and some other stuff which is a bit random. But we thought that would be a bit boring and especially with Stefan we thought a lot about how to organise this meeting. How to organize this meeting. So before somebody's talking from there. So how do I mute Stanislav? Do you remember? No, I remember. Okay, perfect. So we thought a lot how to organize the music. So we thought, okay, it's probably the nicest way is to look what are the questions behind the morphogenesis of looping networks. How are so what kind What kind of questions do we ask? And that's why in your sessions you don't feel maybe not directly very comfortable, but I hope after my introduction you feel a bit more comfortable, or maybe not at all. We will see. So we have questions, so like properties in analyzing looping networks. There's lots of work on how, like, everybody knows, probably here, Kala ordering. You have a branching network, and you say the smallest branches at the end are zero, and then when they have an equal number, then it becomes one. And many people have analyzed these networks like that. But what do you do when you have loops? I hope to learn it here. So that's part of the session, so all the questions that we had. All the questions that we had. Also, loops are not very stable, or they can be stable, but under very special, under special circumstances. So we understand, we try to group people working on stability and selection of loops. How do these loops appear and how do they remain stable? And then we have also how do you generate? How do you generate loops? There's a transition. Sometimes these branches just branch and they don't loop, they don't reconnect. And sometimes they stay disconnected. So what's happening in this transition? So we will talk about that. And then in blood vessels, for instance, it's very different. So it's not that you have branches and they reconnect. In blood vessels, you have already a capillary mesh. Already a capillary mesh, and the network is basically selected. It's structured from a foam, basically. So, how does it work? So, it's called in vascular network, it's called remodeling. So, we will hear more about that soon. And then, how are these networks affected by growth when you have a growing tissue or when there's transport inside? Maybe it's optimized. Transport inside. Maybe it's optimized to optimize this transport. So we will have talks about that. So basically, to I wonder if you have another question. No, I come to the schedule. So basically we have we tried to get all the subjects fitted in these general questions. And then of course you always have people that doesn't fit. Have people that don't fit very well, or you have other boundary conditions because we didn't want to have all the online sessions in one session. We didn't want to have all the females being grouped together in one session. We didn't want what were more boundary conditions. We had many constraints. Constraints? Ah, yeah, travel constraints was also important. So we had some constraints, so we had to wiggle a bit. So if you don't feel at home in your session, it's because of that, okay? So don't worry. And so we organize the sessions like that. So the session one, and I thank you a lot for all the wonderful pictures you see. I think it makes everything more pleasant to look at and we will hang out. Pleasant to look at, and we will hang them in the coffee room. But the first session will be about local events. It's debatable, but everything is local events, but that's how we thought about it. Then we have a characterization of networks. And at the end of this afternoon, on Monday, we have two different networks, like veins and arteries, that connect together. Or we see that also in See that also in liver networks, if I remember well. So, two different networks connecting together. Then, we have on Tuesday we have growth of branching structures. The second session will be optimization related to what happens inside the network. We have two sessions of it because many people are thinking about this. Then on Wednesday, we have a show. Then on Wednesday we have a short morning session on transition, branching versus looping. And we have the afternoon to fill up yourself. So we leave that completely self-organized. Everybody does what he likes to do and so you can arrange among yourself what you like to do. In loops? In loops. Exactly. And then we have we look at We look at functioning and transport of networks on Thursday morning, then growth of networks in morphogenesis, and growth of networks, growth and network morphogenesis and optimization. So that's for Thursday. And on Friday, we end with the last loops. And it's more a concluding session. Okay? So, and then we have some rules of the interaction, some very light rules. Interaction, some very light rules. But so, as I said before, which I would like to stress again, we are an interdisciplinary group. So, try to zoom out and be pedagogical. The workshop will be done by you, basically. So, if we can communicate among each other, what we really try to do, we would like to have lots of discussions here in this room, but also during the Here in this room, but also during the coffee breaks and in the dinner place here. I maybe have on a walk or and we start each session, you're all aware, I think, because I sent you an email about it, but we start each session with a chair who's introducing the session and we end the session with a discussion. And I wanted to promote, I saw this actually in a conference at Evo D'Évo, where we were last. At Evau Dévo, where we were last week, and it was very, very nice. They encouraged the young scientists to ask first. So I would like to ask the chairs to pay attention to that, that not the confident older scientists start discussing, but please be aware there are many young scientists here that they have a voice and that they can ask, and try to encourage them to ask the first question. Ask the first question. So that are the rules of the game. And then you find, you all receive the abstract book and the schedule. So that are the links. I must say, the abstract book is updated. So I will send you a new link. It's a new link. So it had minor changes, but it became a bit nicer with sometimes a bit nicer pictures. And also the scale. And also the schedule. Check the schedule because it's very important we made some switches due to travel boundary conditions. On the left side, everything is up to date. So on the link, everything is up to date. And all the participants that were involved with the change are informed. So there should not be a problem. But to be sure, check the schedule. Check this kit. Yeah, I will send this by email again. Yeah, okay, to all the bodies. So, and then last but not least, we took our kids. So, they are here, they are having a lot of fun. And you can have a lot of fun too. There's a very nice swimming pool when you are swimming. You're swimming on your back and you see the mountains around you. It's very impressive. There's a nice river walk, you just go down. Nice river walk. You just go down, it's down, yeah. You go down the other. We go down to the river, you can have a very nice walk. There's also an art exhibition along the river, it's fun to see. There's a climbing wall, so if you're there, you can go all up. And there's even a bridge that you can climb with your head down. So if people feel challenged by that, please have fun. This is all at Berza. This is all at birth and you can borrow for, I think, a couple of dollars. You can borrow a harness to secure yourself and make sure that no accidents happen. And then I think I just want to say enjoy your meeting and again welcome. And then the first session, I think. Ah, yeah, perfectly time to see if it's. I have perfect in time. If I see the clock well on your right, 9:25. Then we start the first session. Thank you. And I am actually the chair of the first session. So, good. I see Olivier looking. So, Olivier is presenting the Is presenting the first talk, and he will talk about the scale of river networks. And what I understood is that rivers, we can characterize the shape of river networks on a fractal model. But if you go all the way to the end of the fractal tree, you have very tiny little rivers, and the whole And the whole world would be a swamp or wetlands, or at least river. And now the big question of Olivier is, where does this end, this land? And I think Olivier is going to explain it. And then there's something with the ground, because rivers are carrying water and sediments. Very important. Don't forget the sediments because that shapes the river, basically. And if I understand well, so the blue is the ink, but if I understand well, this is a permeable structure, and the river is flowing here. Do I see it towards you? Or is that? Yeah, okay. You interpret it like you would wish, so I'm trying to do this. And now you have water with ink sedimenting or going through, and this is where. Or going through, and this is where the ground comes in. That's, Olivier will correct me if I'm completely wrong. And then you get these slides. That's how I saw it. So they gather probably somewhere on these lands to drain the water to the ground. And that's how rivers end. That's how I saw it. But maybe I'm wrong. So this is Olivier who's going to explain us this better. To explain us this better. So, the second presentation, I think it's the second, I'm not sure. I'm not sure whether I took the order right. But Niccolo, where are you there? Niccolo. Niccolò is talking about roots. And he stressed very much: okay, rivers do not only carry water, but they also carry sediments. And that's not an easy. Sediments. And that's not an easy thing to model, if I understood that. And then, if you want to model a full network, it's a mess. So he concentrates just on the loops in the network. And you see, rivers do have very, it's called braiding rivers. I didn't know that, but it's a braiding, it's anastomosis for blood vessel networks. But these are. These are interconnecting, and if you look in our site where we are here now, you see very nice brain two. I think that's brain two, right? This is the boundary of the line. Maybe, okay. Maybe another one. That's just from the top of the one. That's from top of the tunnel mountain here. It's a walk of less than one hour. Piotr was courageous to do this very early in the morning, and he saw the sun. Very early in the morning, and he saw the sunrise. It was apparently magic. But I found it already magic when it was just 12 o'clock in the afternoon to have lunch up there. It was really very nice. And you have views like this. It's really magnificent. But just to talk, to stay to the loop, so Niccolo, he can measure what happens in these loops. Apparently, there are a lot of parameters, physical parameters and geometrical parameters. Parameters and geometrical parameters that are measured. And I think these loops are also quite dynamical, they are changing a lot. So, this is all measured, and he can make sense out of this. So, Nicodeau is going to make sense out of this for us and talk about the size of the loops and why they do have different sizes and so on. And then, oh, and then we have Sierra. And then we have Sharon online. She will talk about lung or pulmonary branching. And pulmonaries, they branch, but the tissue around is very important apparently, because apparently the shape of the tissue where this lung is growing, it's expanding and it's growing, and it has to decide what kind of Kind of bifurcation I have to make. And so in non-brain, they characterize this kind of brain scene very, so you have typical braincing mods, and Sharon will tell us more about it. But apparently, the geometry of the shape of the tissue that is around these growing buds is very important to determine what kind of brain spectrum you look at. Of brain spectrum you look at. So, Sierra will tell us about that more. So, this is my quite short introduction, but then I leave the floor to Olivier to talk about River.
