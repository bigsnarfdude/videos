Okay, thanks a lot for the introduction and the invitation. And uh in this talk, I will talk about a different kind of cosmology. Okay, so different communities have different Communities have different languages. So, before presenting the details, let me recall some basic definitions. So, what I mean by split space is piecewise polynomials with certain polynomials with certain uh uh continuity on the triangulation. Uh uh uh and what I mean by finite elements is is a special kind of sub a special kind of sublimes which can be locally uh uh constructed. So so in this case on on the triangle On the triangle, I have a linear polynomial, and this polynomial is uniquely uniquely determined by the values at the three vertices. So so so so so so then we have a a triangulation. A triangulation, we want to glue the triangles, triangles, triangles together. And we ensure that the vertex values are single-valued among among all the cells sharing the vertex. And such uh it Evaluation of functions at the vertices is called degrees of freedom. And in the sublime later, it is called the minimal determining set. And in this case, Uh uh in this case, the minimal determined inside can be defined uh on on a single cell. And uh uh in uh uh in this case on on each triangle on each triangle B it had the polynomial normal Nominal of degree five, and its value is completely determined by the value of the polynomial at each vertex and the first of the derivatives and the second of the derivatives plus plus plus uh a plus plus the the normal uh uh a derivative that the the midpoint of each edge. And when we can do together triangles, we require that these degrees of freedom are single-valued and this and uh uh and this is the same. In insurers C1 continuity. And in this case, in this case, we subdivide each triangle. Each triangle in small triangles and we use piecewise the polynomials, the polynomials which are C1 on the big triangle. And this value is determined by the vertex evaluation and the value of the value of And the vertex derivatives. And matching the degrees of freedom also gives C1. And this talk is focused on valued and tensor tensor-valued problems. So we will So so we will uh uh uh uh talk of about the complexes and the signales. So so this question can be generally uh uh raised for those lines, but the most uh examples uh uh uh in uh Uh in uh uh uh here are our separation finite uh I elements. Okay. Uh uh in the first part I've uh I will show why uh uh complexes are important uh for numerical PDEs. And uh in the second part uh uh Part we talk about which complexes to these were time. And then we talk about the finite limit version. Okay, so uh a complex is a sequence of spaces. Or sequence of spaces and operators. The spaces are connected by a differential operators. Operators composed twice get zero. So uh uh uh so so v squared is Uh uh so so v squared is equal to zero. Uh well uh uh in in particular, this implies that the the the range of B is contained uh uh i in the kernel of the next b. And we say that uh the complex is uh exact. Exact if the kernel is equal to the range and the co-homology is defined to be the quotient space of the kernel and the range. Uh example is the run uh a complex uh Complex. Here, each space consists of differential forms, and the operators are exterior derivatives. So so in theory if you can choose a basis and basis and write down the code. the co efficients and the uh uh i uh in this case uh uh the the the spaces are are scalar uh functions and the fact uh valued functions and the operators are are gradical and div. And you have uh a complex because core a complex because co of grade is equal to zero and divergence of co is equal to zero. And how to relate uh a complex to PDEs, we can talk about the formal eye joint operators. So so so So so so this all all all prototies come from uh uh uh integration by parts. Uh uh uh so uh uh uh the formal I I joint of grade is minus V one, but the formal I joint of co is co uh I and the formal I joint also form uh How to form a complex and this goes from the right to the left. It's this squared dual, this is co-dual, and this is duf dual. And the Hodge problem is defined to be d d star or plus d star d. If we have If we have this complex, so this is uh a scalar function and this is vector uh function. Uh uh so uh the this is V and here is V star. Uh uh this part is trivial. Uh uh so so in this case the whole flashing is just the Poisson equation. And uh in this case, uh we have d d star co co and minus square d. Uh this is related uh related to the Maxwell's uh uh uh equations. And here uh uh and here we and here we can get And here we can get the same form. Uh uh uh in this case we have this part which is the uh a lot less in okay uh uh let's look at uh model problem. Uh uh uh to solve Or to solve this PDE. So you can check that, cool, cool, minus 1 is just the Laplace for each component of each component of a vector field. But the point where conditions here are slightly different. They are the electric condition or the magnetic conditions. So this figure is obtained by uh uh d uh uh descretizing discretizing uh e uh each component of the field by a scalar finite i limit. And this figure is by uh uh a uh is by describing the the field from uh a complex. A complex. So so this is uh a finite item to the drum uh uh uh a complex. Uh uh uh each slot is it's a finite I I I i and the space uh uh uh uh this is s uh scalar, vector uh vectors and scalars. And scalars. So the degrees of freedom are at the vertices, on the edges, on the faces, and in the cell. And this is uh a complex. So so right the m um uh so for example So for example, where the map puts the space here to here and so on. So in this case, if you discretize each component by a scalar uh or this uh uh or gives you count uh uh gives you conf uh uh a wrong uh or solution. Uh so so th the philosophy uh here is clear. Uh uh if we are giving the fact valuable problems and the tests the value of the problems, we we we can't just uh treat it as I have a bunch of scalar problems for each component. There are more examples and motivations from eigenvalue problems and software. And the structure-preserving methods. So, the message here is to desyncretize complexes and preserve the cohomology. And this is the goal of the talk. And this And this area is called discrete differential forms of finite analytics area calculus. And this is a recent book, and this is a survey paper. Okay. Okay, what complexes to uh or to c consider? Uh okay, so first we want to uh uh or describe the uh the the drum uh complex with gradical and dip. And different problems And different problems uh uh require different complexes. Uh uh uh required Okay, so the points tank uh uh uh Found uh uh uh uh uh uh uh a construction is uh systematic way to generate the complexes from the RAM. Uh uh uh uh complexes. Uh uh and here are three basic examples in 3D. Uh uh They are called the Hessian complex, the elasticity complex, and the complex. So for the Hessian, a complex, this is a scalar function, uh uh uh uh this is the symmetric matrices, uh uh uh uh this is transfer and this is the vector. And this is the vectors. And if you take Haitian on the scalar function, you get a symmetric matrix. And if you take a curve on each row of a symmetric trigger matrix, you'll get trigger. Uh you get trace free and so on. And for the elasticity complex, you have uh vectors here and here uh and the symmetric matrices here and here. So so so s so so the first operator is to take is to take the gradient of the vector and take the symmetric part. And the second one is to take a curve on each row of metrics and curve on each column. And another way to view it is to take a curve on each row. Each row transpose and take a curve on each row again. And uh in geometry uh although this is the flat trick and this is the reader writes the curvature. Okay, and for the div complex, uh it is the form Uh it is the formal at the joint of the hash. So so you have vectors from here, uh uh the two trade-free here, and uh uh I have uh uh uh and the two symmetric here and the two scalps. Uh so so this operators are are the formal high drawing of the operas in the Haitian context. Any questions here? Please feel free to uh interrupt me uh if you have any questions. Okay. Okay. Oh okay, so there are many uh uh uh complexities which can be constructed uh uh in uh uh uh in this way. You you can also have complexes with matrices which are both symmetric and traits-break. And this is to take the symmetric and the traits-free part of The trace-free part of the the gradient of a vector. And this is uh uh uh uh uh uh the quote is the third order curve. And uh uh and if gravitational then the general when the tape tape we have transverse traceless uh gauge gauge meaning that the the variables are uh uh symmetric uh traits free on uh traits free on a trace free and divergence free on the they are exactly uh Described here. And also, we can take the driftfree part of a hashing and complete it to a complex. And these complexes have been applied and derived to Uh applied and derived to uh GR. This is a brief uh sketch of how to derive such complexes. Uh so uh so so V connected to the round complexes Total ROM complexes. Here, each row is the vector value to the drum complex. So start from a vector and take the gradient of each component and you can So you get a matrix and you take a code for each row of the matrix and so on. And then I can connect the two complexes by some by some algebraic maps. So here M skew maps are a vector for a skew-symmetric matrix in a canonical way. Uh okay this minus uh minus uh V three, V two and uh uh uh this is two three one and this Q is from uh uh E sq is just the The opposite o opposite way. You first take a scale of a matrix and translate it to a vector. And the second one, or this one, Uh or this one is the transpose minus trace and the second step is to decompose uh uh the matrix into uh symmetric and the skill uh asymmetric and the to identify uh or the skill uh symmetric with the vectors. The vectors and do I identify the vectors with the scale symmetric here and to examine them from the complex. So so uh you've got uh uh vectors here, uh symmetric matrices here uh and here and And the conclusion is that the cohomology of the derived uh complexes isomorphic to the uh uh the rum complex. I I I I'm uh I'm Uh and for general uh and for general differential forms, you uh you can tensor the RAM complex with J minus one form and tensor another the RAM uh complex with J form and connect the two rows by some uh By some uh constructions here, which is an alternating sum. Okay, so here are the examples because uh because in ready we have uh Here in 3D we have uh zero form, uh one form, two form and three forms, uh uh or zero form and three forms can be considered as scalars and one forms and uh uh one form and two forms are are are considered as vectors. are considered diasporas. So when you tensor or draw a complex with such form, you get the scalar valued drum complex and the vector valued the drum complex vectors and the scalars. So so from So from the first two rows, you can connect the two breeding and get hashin. This is how to get the hashing complex. And from the two rows in the middle, you can connect the two curls. And this is how to get the elasticity. elasticity complex. Uh uh and from the last tutorial you can connect the two divergence and get the D of D complex. And and uh uh uh uh if you are f familiar with the um uh uh with the young uh uh with the young uh uh uh tableau, uh uh this is another systematic way of deriving uh complexes of tensor with different kinds of symmetries. Okay uh and for uh uh each complex we can have different kinds of Have different kinds of continuities. So for the RAM, complex are two basic classes. So here, each space is has co efficients in the sublime of the space. This means that That each component of the space is in certain space. And in this case, the spaces are defined to be forms in L2 based exterior. X the relative C L 2. And recall that for piecewise the most functions, uh HQ is equivalent to the C Q minus one condition, and this condition is is equivalent to the continuity of trees. Continuity of trees. And here, trees is obtained by the integration by paths. Okay, so the co-homology does not depend on the regularity here. Some examples. Examples. So in 3D, B can have spaces like H3, H2, H1, and also B can have spaces like HQ and H D. And there are many combinations of them. So for example, you can have h2 here, h1 here, and because square root of h2 is contained in h1, so so so you require So so you require uh uh uh the space here uh uh to be in H1, uh basically in H1. And also uh you can have different combinations. Okay, s so let's talk about uh the finite element versions uh uh uh or This is a canonic cofinite alignment complex from the theory. And the degrees of freedom are the co-chains. So they are defined as the vertices. One cell, two cells, two cells. One cell, two cells, and so on. And the local co-functions are incomplete polynomials. So this is just P1 and this is in between P0. P0 and P1 And these spaces are continuous and have continuous the tangential uh components across the the cells and the continuous The cells and the continuous uh normals. And they the spaces can be extended to any uh dimension any k form and any polynomial degrees. Okay, so Okay, so uh uh uh uh uh uh or the construction was uh was canonical because people considering uh a load uh uh uh because uh uh because people consider you want regularity. Regularity uh and the things got subtle if we consider higher uh a higher continuity. Uh so so for the uh or fluid problem, the p uh uh volume. We want to construct a velocity space where each component is continuous. And if you want to construct a partial space which is generally or discontinuous. Discontinuous. And we want the divergence the space is contained contained in the pressure space. And this can be quite subtle. A natural choice is to use the continuous P2. Continuous uh P2 for each component of the velocity uh and uh and this continuous P1 uh for pressure but this fails uh uh uh another story is from is from the sublime uh or community which cares uh uh about the dimension dimension of sublime spaces. Uh uh uh the these two two questions are are related uh uh in this complex. Uh so uh if we take a gradient uh or co uh Or curve uh uh for uh a scalar C1 uh a function we get well uh we get a continuous field. And we have such uh dimension count if the complex is exact. And so And so uh uh uh or this uh despairs us to to take differentials uh uh uh on scalar functions to construct uh perfect spaces and the tensor spaces. Okay, also, uh, the Okay, f the first uh general uh remark is is uh is on super smoothness. Uh uh it is a phenomenon uh this way the smooth uh uh functions may have higher uh uh or continuities at the corners. Uh uh so so for example here uh Example here, uh uh uh piecewise the most uh uh uh C1 uh functions are C2 here. And the tail people was the first to say thematically uh. And there are two different ways to construct to find out the IE IE I elements either to use the super smoothness as degrees of freedom or avoid the supermusmen. Avoid the super smoothness by subdivision. Uh in this case, we want to construct a C1. Uh a space is but it requires uh uh or that the second or that derivative is also uh match and also also match. And uh And uh and uh and in this case we use piecewise polynomials to avoid. And uh uh uh uh in this book there are many different the kinds of refinement and the following. the kinds of refinement and for uh uh uh each refinement uh uh we can uh or think about as one uh spaces and finite high element spaces. And the Johnny's talk will be uh on this. And the China uh experiences Is that the final subdivision that requires less super smoothness? Using this idea you Uh uh uh uh you c uh uh uh uh or complete uh a sequence uh starting from uh uh uh this scalar space and the super smoothness propagates in the complex. So you have C2 here uh if you take gradient Gradient, it becomes C1 here. So this is C2, C1, and C0. And also, you can use some of the divisions and construct the complexity of the data. The uh complexes on the subdivision. Uh and uh uh uh in this way there are many the connections between uh old results and the new results. So so this the column was by the sublime uh people uh this column. A word for the the vector finite elements. And uh another general tool is to to do dimension count. Uh uh for uh a sequence uh uh or that is the Exactly is that the sum oh oh sorry I uh I should direct alternating sound. Is equal to zero, and this gives you some necessary uh condition of exact tennis and this gives you some uh uh hints. Uh Uh uh okay just two minutes I'm just watching tool who constructs a local uh uh exact sequence th it is the so-called Pangari is the so-called Pagari operators and they add the the P operators going from uh the the right to the left and uh and they satisfy uh DP plus P D is identity and this uh uh I Uh I I immediately improvise the the exactness and for the smooth drum uh uh uh a complex uh such uh uh such Uh uh such operators can be found uh uh in standard uh uh uh uh uh or textbooks and uh uh and uh uh and for the PGG complexes uh they can be derived uh following the PGG steps and this operators preserve the Operators preserve the the the polynomial classes. So so this uh implies the exactness of the polynomial complexes. And uh uh uh uh uh another tool is to u u use To use that kind of geometry or decompositions to decompose the space into bubbles on different cells. And the key uh thing is that the bubble spaces Is that the bubble spaces should also form a sequence. Okay, this is just some more details. And because we derive the the BGG complexes from a drug, the data is a very good idea Uh from the drawing complex design on the continuous level so it can make this construction uh of four finite elements and here we have two finite elements the drum uh complexes and Complexes and you want to match the space here, the space here. So these two spaces are the same. This means that we need two complexes faith different continuities. And another China was strategy is that because I use TASA product if we have TASA product reduction mesh. Mesh and the key thing here is that the partial derivative decrease does the continuity on the polynomial decrease. So Uh uh so for this curve, uh uh uh you take dy and the continuity and the polynomial uh uh are degree in the second uh in the sec and uh direction degree by one. Uh uh you uh uh uh you can We can also match the spaces and derived uh uh the PGG complexes. Uh uh but this does not work for the conformal uh uh complexes and this is uh puzzling uh puzzling and uh still open. Okay, so here is uh A summary of the state of the art and there are many open questions. And in principle, I need a question for Scala. Questions for scalar spaces can be asked for vector and the tensor value spaces such as the dimensionline, the supersmoothness, and so on. So there are new questions about co-ophomology and community quality uh uh interpolators and so on. Interpolators and so on. Okay, so I will just stop here and thank you for your attention. Other questions? A comment again, so two comments. One about the open problems. You should absolutely speak at the open problem session. And I always wanted to find out, you mentioned that the quadratic pair, the natural pair for the Stokes equation, quadratic velocity, doesn't work. Maybe during one of the working groups you could give us more details why it doesn't work because there is an associated 3D problem. because there is an associated CT problem there. So that would be very also nice to know. If somebody wants to join us for one of these working desk, uh that would be something too I always wanted to know. Okay, okay, yeah, sure. Hope you ask the same question. Thanks. More comments? More questions? This is not the case, so thanks again. Another coffee break until
