And so for the first talk in the afternoon, we have Shubham Veddy. Did I say your name correctly? Just introduce yourself. That's good enough. Shubham Grievi. Oh, okay, very good. That's the first problem in the problem. He's coming from Barack. Uh, from uh is coming from Berlin and is going to tell us about the gradient flow of spin seven structures based on a work in progress. Okay, yeah, thank you. So, this is a talk on a geometric flow about spin seven structures. And as mentioned here, it's a work in progress, and you will see why. And thankfully, the talks of Udo and Enrique have basically motivated why we are looking at these types of problems. So it's So, it's a similar thing in the same circle of ideology. So, this slide contains most of the information which I would need in order to describe the problem for the spin seven structures. So, if spin seven structures make sense on eight-dimensional remodeled manifold, eight-dimensional manifold, suppose M is such a smooth manifold, then a spin-7 structure on M is the reduction of the structure group of the frame. Reduction of the structure group of the frame bundle, which I denote by FRM, to the lead, so reduction of the structure group from GL8R to the lead group spin 7. And for the purposes of this talk, whenever I would say that there is a spin 7 structure, I would mean that it's given by a four-form phi only. And it satisfies the existence of such a structure as a topological condition. So many eight manifolds have a spin-7 structure, but not all of them. So this five. So, this phi induces a Riemannian metric, which I'm going to denote by G self phi, and an orientation, which I'm going to denote by wall phi. So, there is a Hoggish star operator, and this phi is self-dual, that is, phi is equal to star phi. So, M with a spin 7 structure phi will be called a spin 7 manifold if phi is parallel with respect to the Levicivita connection induced by phi. So, therefore, this NAPL. Phi. So, therefore, this NAPLA phi equal to zero is a highly non-linear PDE, so it's very hard to solve. And this is these are the type of metrics we want on eight manifolds because they are RT flat and they have very nice property. That's the goal of all these circle of ideas that if you have a spin-7 structure you are starting with, can you get a torsion-free structure on the same map? So, because of the existence So because of the existence of a spin seven structure, the space of differential forms on M decompose into irreducible spin seven representations. So omega two, that is the space of two forms, decompose as omega two seven plus omega two twenty one. So these seven twenty one these are pointwise dimensions. Omega three decomposes as omega three eight plus omega three forty eight and omega four decompose as omega four one plus four seven plus four twenty seven and four thirty five. The torsion, which I'm going to denote by T of a spin 7 structure, which is this is here, is a section of this tensor bundle. It's section of omega 1, 8, tensor omega 2, 7. So this is something which one needs to show that it lies in omega 2, 7 part. And it's written in local coordinates as the expression which I have written there. Unfortunately, all my All my formulas are with coordinates. Fortunately, it's only for 15 minutes. So, the expression T M semicolon AB, so the semicolon doesn't mean that it's a covariant derivative. It means that for every fixed m, the rest of the two indices lie in omega 2, 7. So, that's what I mean by T M semicolon maybe. And it's a contraction of nabla phi with phi itself on three indices. From three indices. So it can be shown that this T is so at least the dimension counting works because point-wise it lies in a 56-dimensional vector space. So it can be shown that it's actually a three-form. And so therefore, the torsion can be further decomposed into a T8 component and T48 component. And as we saw in the, I think, in Enrique's talk, that there is this diamond operation, which is just the infinitesimal. Which is just the infinitesimal action of G L A tar on our forms. So, any four form on a manifold with a spin semi-structure can be written as A dimension phi. And this is the formula for A dimension. So, it's a contraction on one index of A with phi, and then use Q symmetrics to get a four form. So, this is the formula. And the fact, one fact which is important is that omega 221 diamond phi is equal to zero because omega 221 is. zero because omega 2 21 is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of skill set but i don't think you get all the four forms like this for here that is you don't get the 27s no but that won't be necessary for the purposes of the talk yeah that's right so there's something which darren mentioned yesterday when he was talking about calibrations that in order to get a so this omega 427 these type of forms won't appear in such uh recomposition these are all forms we get the allowed step four These are all the forms we're going to allow to deform as a spin seven. As a spin seven structure, that's precisely right. So I want a spin seven structure in my geometric flow, so omega four twenty seven doesn't play any role. So from the last point in the previous slide, if we want to have a geometric flow of a spin-seminal structure, it can be written as partial phi by partial t as a diamond phi for a pair of symmetric two tensor h and x, where h x lies in omega to seven. than omega 27. So this omega 41 and omega 435 they are isomorphic with the space of symmetric two tensors. So that's the H appearing there. Omega 427 doesn't make it into a spin seven structure so that goes away and then omega 47 is the X part. So we have the torsion so it makes sense to define a very natural energy functional which I am I have written by E. So this is the L2 norm of the torsion. Norm of detortion with respect to the metric which the spin 7 structure induces. And an important point, which is unlike Enrique's and Odov's talk, is that we are not restricting to isometric spin seminar structures. So our spin seminar structures can induce different reminding metric and that's perfectly fine. So if I want to study some flow of spin seminar structure, a very natural candidate is to look at the negative gradient flow of this. Look at the negative variance flow of this energy functional. You can calculate the first variation of that, and this is the expression which you will get. So, besides the effect of you x, if you have one function as a degree of freedom in the isometric plot, so what would be that? Sorry, which function? Within a given asymmetric plot, you have a function and a vector fuse, which is free. You're only using the function. You're only using the vector Q, not the function. So this is a tricky. This x is not a. This is not a vector figure, it's omega 27. I'm not doing the isometric information. H is symmetric, it's responsible for varying the metric. That's right. X is skewed. Right. And that's responsible for varying the things which are not the metric. Well, seven parts. And you would still have. Well that's fairly fine. And you would still have a little bit of freedom. No, because that what you're counting is that the function squared plus the Lord squared of the vector is what to get out of the dependent there. The function is determined of the vector. So you can calculate the first variation of this energy function and this is the expression which you are going to get. It's very ugly, but this is what it is. So here RAM is the Ricci curvature. So the highly structure terms in this expression which are with the symmetric two tensor. are with the symmetric two tensor are the Ricci curvature and this NABLA M T B A B term and rest everything is lower order that is only one derivative of phi the wall and the highest order term so there is only one term with x it's the divergence of the torus yep and also x is going to be of type omega to seven right each time so for a different structure right so do you omega to seven is yeah exactly you're looking at that particular decomposition Are you looking at that particular decomposition? So, the divergence of the torsion is in coordinate is given by that expression which I have written there. So, just to for sanity check, if I look at... Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, let me just make sure I understood the spots to consult. So when you say I look at 2.7, that's of T. Or is it of the initial? Because phi is changing, right? So you can write it on that form when you allow a microphone. When you allow omega-27 to move around. Yeah. So it's omega-27 of T of 5. That's not a fixed omega-27. No, no, no. Correct. Okay. That's right. That's right. That's right. Okay, so you can prove that this nabla m T B A B term is actually the lead derivative of the metric in the direction of TA. So when I write P with a vector and A, I mean that I look at the torsion. I mean that I look at the torsion, I decompose it into T8 and T48. The eight-dimensional thing is isomorphic to a vector field. So I take that vector field. All right. So we look at the negative gradient flow of this energy functional. So it's the following flow of spin-seven structures. So it's minus Ricci. Actually, I look at the negative gradient flow of 8 times the energy functional. The 8 is there because I just want minus 2 Ri Chi. Because I just want minus 2 Ricci as the first step. So the flow of spin 7 structure which I'm considering is minus Ricci minus 2 times Li Tg plus divergence of torsion plus lower order terms time and phi and phi naught is some initial spin seven structure which you start with on your compact map. I abbreviate this as SDF. So along this SDF, you can calculate the evolution of the metric and Evolution of the metric and quantities related to the evolution of the metric? The evolution of the metric is given by 2 times h. So, where h is this, these two guys plus lower or the terms of n0. That's a metric to tensor. So, it's given by this expression here. And you can calculate the trace of it, and you will find that the evolution of the volume form is minus 3r minus 24 norm t square plus 24 times this contraction. ERR is this case. ERR is the scalar curvature. And of course, you can write the evolution of Reachy curvature, Riemann curvature, and so on. I don't, I have not written it here because they are sorry? I'm going to guess it's your initials. Yeah, no, no, no, it's not. It's not. I mean, SG is my initial, but no, no, no, no. It's spin 7 division flow. It's yeah. Oh, that's unfortunate, but okay. All right, so this is the theorem which I've been able to prove that this initial value problem Bf has a unique solution for a short time, where let's say 0 to T max, with T max depending on this initial spin-7 structure which you start. Start. So, let me see. So, I have like three minutes, so let me just go very quickly. So, here is the idea of the proof. So, you calculate the principal symbols of the operator involved. So, the highest order operators in the flow here is V Chi, Li T H G plus G, and rest everything is lower order. So, as far as short time existence is concerned, they don't play any role. So, you calculate the principal symbol and you prove that. And you prove that, well, you will see immediately that the principal symbol has a non-trivial kernel due to diffeomorphism. So you know that there will be problems. But you can prove that the dimension of that kernel is precisely 8, which is the dimension of our manifold. So therefore, the only obstruction to parabolicity of this flow is diffeomorphism invariance of the tensors involved. So then you can do a detect trick. So the detect vector field, so I Caleb talk about a So, I Caleb talk about a trick in the detect trick, but you need a vector field in the detect to basically kill out the failure of parabolicity. So, this vector field is VK is given by this expression. So, here phi bar is some fixed background spin 7 structure. You want to do some gauge fixing. You can just take the initial one for that. Yeah, you can take the initial one for that, for example. You can take this phi bar to be phi naught itself. And this is, should be a familiar term. Should be a familiar term. It's the vector field which appears when you want to prove the short-term existence of Ricci flow. So this is the Bianchi vector field, that's what it's called. And this is the extra bit. And then what you do is you look at a modified flow, which is the Tirishne-B-Turk flow for a spherical seminar structure. So it's the same flow, but now you've add a Li or a Li derivative term as well. What you can prove is that the principal symbol of this guy is an isomorphism. So this equation. So, this equation is parabolic. So, by standard theory, there exists a short-time existence, solution for short-time and uniqueness, and then you can use the diffeomorphisms generated by this vector field VK to go back to your original equation. So, the reason it's a work in progress is because I'm trying to derive sheet estimates for this flow, which proves that if you have bounds on second-order quantities, then this flow since it Then this flow, since it's parabolic, should evolve, give you bounds on all higher-order derivatives. And then, work in then, interesting question for the future is that if you can define an analogous functional which Nvik and Uddhaw defined, but now not in isometric case. So this is a scale-invariant functional. Is it still almost monotonic? So that's the first question. If it is, then can you define something called the entropy functional? Uh, something called the entropy functional. I won't talk about that, but there is some entropy functional. And can you use it for anything? Uh, so I think the easier thing would be to just look at the analogous G2 case, which is GDF. So, this was already done by Weiss and Witt, and then there is a paper which should come out soon by myself, Paniotis, Gianniotis, and Spiro, where we look at the analogous question for G2. And then the second question, which would be very interesting, is that whether Be very interesting is that whether torsion-free spin seminary structures are stable along the flow. That is, if you start near a torsion-free spin semi-structure, whether this flow flows that to a nearby torsion-free line. Okay, because if that is the case, then this slope can possibly find spin-7 structures on your manifold. All right, so thank you for your attention.
