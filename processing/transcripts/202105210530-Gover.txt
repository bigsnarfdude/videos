Okay, today is the last last day of our workshop. And I'm told from the secret Mr. Jilan, she told me that today is the living stream. It's okay. It is my great pleasure to introduce Professor Lauder Gover from the University of Auckland. The title of his talk is Conformally Environment, Yam Year's Energy and Education on Six Manifolds. Lord, please. Okay, so thank you very much. Tell me if there's any problems with the sound or anything. Problems with the sound or anything. Yeah, so it's a really great pleasure to be here giving this talk. I haven't given that many Zoom conference talks yet. I've given quite a few Zoom talks to students, but anyway, it's great to be involved in this one. Okay, so this is, I guess, work that's finally getting completed. It's an idea that's been around for quite a long time in my sort of on my to finish pile. So it's So it's current work with Larry Peterson and sort of previous work with the former postdoc, Calem Slade. He's no longer working in maths, but he was with me for a little while. And it actually, the idea dates back to some work with Tom Branson, who were a couple of articles of his to do with detour complexes and things like that. So let me just. Okay, so let's start with. Okay, so let's start with recalling something that maybe a lot of you know a little bit about. It's Bach's conformal gravity. In case you don't, right, so in the top box up here is my short course in Riemannian geometry. So you have a manifold with a metric, it determines Levi-Sevita, and that's my notation for the Riemann curvature tensor. Now, one thing you can do is you have a metric around so you can. You have a metric around so you can decompose the Riemann curvature into a completely trace-free part. So that means trace-free with respect to the metric. So completely trace-free. And then a trace part. And the trace part involves this thing called the Scout and tensor, and this is, in a sense, the best way to define the Scout and tensor and a certain product here, I forget the name of it, with the metric. I forget the name of it with the metric. But anyway, the trace-free part has the rather surprising and interesting property that it's conformally invariant. So if you put one index up on the vial tensor, it's sort of natural state, then it's really on the nose conformally invariant. It's not just covariant. It just doesn't change when you transform the metric conformally. And this is my convention for conformally transforming the metric up. Conformally transforming the metric, epsilon is the smooth function. So you do e to the, whoops, it should be a plus two omega, two epsilon. Sorry, there's a typo there. That should be a plus. So yeah, the convention given with the wrong sign, sorry. But anyway, the vial curvature is then conformally invariant. And if that's a plus up there, when you take the length of the vial curvature using the metric. Of the biocurvature using the metric, or the length squared, rather, then it transforms conformally as a density, in a sense. So, with this conformal factor minus four epsilon, as I say, that should have been a plus up there. Now, in dimension four, of course, in any dimension, the metric determines a measure for integration. But in dimension four, this transforms conformally like that. So, with a plus four up. So, with a plus four epsilon. So, this exactly balances the way the length of the length squared vial curvature transforms. And so, when you form the integral, the integrams conformally invariant, and so the integrals conformally invariant. And so, this gives a conformally invariant type of action. And that was Bach's idea, you know, that this would be a conformally invariant variant of the Einstein action, I suppose. I suppose. And so then you need to look at the Euler-Lagrange equations. And this is what they are. You get the functional gradient is then the so-called Bach tensor. And this is a double divergence of the vowel curvature plus a lower-order term involving Ricci contracted into Vowel. Well, of course, there's various ways of writing it, but this is a sort of nice way. And so the, you know, the Bach gravity is. You know, the bark gravity is the bark flat condition. So you put this tensor to zero. Currently, actually, that's quite a fashionable thing to study. So that differential equation, people are interested in, you know, one solution is if the manifolds conformally Einstein, that vanishes. If the manifolds self-dual, that vanishes. And then people are very interested if there are other circumstances which make that vanish. So that's a sort of current topic. Okay. Current topic. Okay. Okay. Well, that's so. Well, as I said on the bottom of that slide, just to go back, I didn't. So the bark and the vial are the only linear leading term conformal invariance in dimension four. So, you know, they're linear leading in the metric, the highest derivatives. There's a question of whether that, you know, what happens in higher dimensions. Is there a picture like this in high dimensions? And that's a This is in high dimensions, and that suggests sort of looking at conformal geometry more systematically. And so, this brings me to this thing called the tractor bundle and connection, which probably, you know, many of you know I'm a fan of. Okay, so the usual way to sort of promote this is to start off by saying that there's no preferred conformally invariant connection on the tangent bundle. So, if you have a general Riemannian If you have a general Riemannian manifold with no sort of special conditions, then in general, there's no sort of distinguished conformally invariant connection on the tangent bundle. And that, you know, initially might frustrate your study of conformal geometry, but there is on a slightly higher rank bundle, and this is what we call the tractor bundle. This is here's the cotangent bundle just twisted by a line bundle, a trivial line bundle, and then you're extending. And then you're extending, think of these as basically direct sums. You're extending by two line bundles. Now, there's a way of constructing this bundle, it's natural. This is not really an artificial construction. These line bundles, here's the convention. These are just roots of the canonical bundle according to this convention I've got here. So, okay, so you take the topic of stereo power of the tangent bundle, square it to make sure it's in a trivial line. Square it to make sure it's a trivial line bundle, and then take that root, the one over two n. That gives the weight one bundle. Okay, so this bundle curly t, that's the conformal tractor bundle. It has a conformally invariant connection. When you pick a metric from the conformal class, this bundle becomes a direct sum of the cotangent bundle twisted with these two line bundles, and the formula for the connection is given here. Okay, so you're acting on a triple here, you know, this triple sigma is in that. Know this triple sigma is in that line bundle, rho is in that one, and then this mu is a twisted cotangent. And the main point of giving you this formula for the connection is just to illustrate that this is pretty simple. It's just this is the Levy-Sevida connection, you're adding a bit of the Scout and tensor and so on. Okay, now that's conformally invariant. We picked a metric to write it, but if you change your choice of metric conformally, then everything sort of transforms in a nice way. Everything sort of transforms in a nice way, which says that this is an invariant connection. And it also preserves a thing called attractor metric. So there's a metric on this vector bundle. If the manifold's Romanian, this is Lorentzian signature, but it's a conformally invariant metric and it's preserved by that connection. So this package gives a kind of conceptual and practical approach to conformal geometry. For instance, this vial squared, the length of vial squared, is the same. Vial squared is the same as the tractor length, if you like, of the tractor curvature squared. So, which is then not surprising that it's conformally invariant because the curvature of the tractor connection has to be conformally invariant since the connection is. Okay, so the next ingredient we want to talk about is basically gauge theory. So, it's just to set up for gauge theory. So, in other words, we look at principal G bundles. Words, we look at principal g bundles for some Lie group G. Then, for every finite dimensional representation, we get an associated vector bundle. Um, you know, which one doesn't matter to us at the moment. And I'm writing A for a connection on the principal bundle, right? So then we have a principal connection on that bundle, and I'm going to use the same notation for the associated linear connection on the associated bundle, except that I'll write Nablerae for the covariant. Write nablara for the covariant derivative that corresponds to that connection. Okay, then with either picture, you get the curvature of that connection in the usual way. So, you know, or you can think of it as the curvature of the covariant derivative. And then, of course, like all curvatures, it satisfies the differential Bianchi identity, which means that, you know, this is a two-form taking values and endomorphisms of V, let's say, if we're looking at that version of it. But as it Of it. But as it's closed, this two-form in the sense that when you twist the exterior derivative by the connection, then you get DF is zero because that's the Bianchi identity. So we're going to use that property in a second. Okay, so one question you can ask, instead of constructing usual conformal invariants, the natural things, is how could you construct conformal invariants that couple connections like this to the underlying conformal geometry? So that's a sort of So that's a sort of general question that is, I think, also interesting. You know, what sort of things can arise. Even though we're going to make some here, but nothing too remarkable. But still, there's the question. Okay, so let's remember the Yang-Mills equations, the usual ones. So they come from a Lagrangian density, which you get by just you compose this curvature with its. Curvature with itself. Remember, it's taking values and endomorphisms. If you know, I think of it that way. So you can compose it with itself and then trace. That's a trace in the Lie algebra, if you like, or in the endomorphism. And then you get rid of the tensor indices in the usual way using the metric. So you take a sort of length squared on those indices. Okay, now under a conformal rescaling, here I'm assuming this connection does not transfer. This connection does not transform conformally, perhaps it's a U2 connection or something, has nothing to do with conformal geometry. So we assume the connection A doesn't change under a conformal transformation, that it's conformally invariant, then this Lagrangian density will transform in a quite a simple way, just picking up a sort of density weight from this use of the metric. So it transforms to e to the minus four epsilon times itself. And here I've got the conformal transformation correctly. Correctly. Okay, so, and then in dimension four, the measure determined by the metric transforms like that, just as we were saying before in connection with the Bach equations. So, again, this balances exactly, and so you get this conformally invariant Yang-Mills action. And so, if you find the Euler-Lagrange equations for that by taking now very For that, by taking now variations of the connection, then you're going to get equations, of course, that by construction are conformally invariant. And these are the Yang-Mills equations in dimension four. Okay, so well, this works in all dimensions, but the conformal invariance applies just to dimension four. So we get the Yang-Mills equations. Now, these are conformal invariants. So, first of all, the thing that takes connections to this action is a global conformal invariant. Action is a global conformal invariant, and the mapping the connection to this Yang-Mills or this functional gradient of that action is a local invariant of a connection. I'm saying invariant when things are covariant as well, but that's a standard. Okay, don't know why I'm doing it like this, but I'll do it like this this time. Okay, now you can ask an interesting question: is if you take those Yang Mills. is if you take those Yang-Mills equations or the action, what happens if you specialize that to the tractor metric, to the tractor connection, right? So A, I assume, was just some connection on a vector bundle and that it was conformally invariant. Well, the tractor connection is a connection on a vector bundle that's conformally invariant. So let's try that with Yangmills. First of all, the action we already observed above, it just recovers the bark action. It just recovers the bark action. But of course, when we come to take equations now, we're not doing variations with respect to the metric, but variations with respect to the connection to get the Yang-Mills equations. So what are the Yang-Mills equations when you apply them to the tractor connection? Well, actually, you do get the Bark-flat condition again, right? So the Yang's equations, if you put the tractor connection in here, oh, sorry, the left-hand side of the Yangtze equation. Oh, sorry, the left-hand side of the Engels equations just give you zero, zero, zero. So they nearly vanish in that sense. And then there's a sort of pot of gold at the bottom, or a pot of blue in my case, and that's the bark tensor. So the Yang-Mills equations for the tractor connection just are the bark flat condition. Okay, now, as I say, this theorem is not just a trivial corollary of the fact that we got the bark action up here because this is coming from variations of the connection. Okay, now what, so that's the story in dimension four, which is quite nice in a way, gives us a Yang-Mills perspective on the Bach equation. But what about in higher dimensions? So, you know, so the question is, is this a dimension four story or, you know, is there some sort of development of this in higher dimensions? Now, we know, especially people like Robin here, but I think most of you know that from the I think most of you know that from the conformal side, there are candidates for these things. So, in particular, there's the so-called Pfeffman-Graham obstruction tensor, or some people just call it the obstruction tensor, especially Robin. So, this is the obstruction to the Pfeffman-Graham ambient metric. It was mentioned, for instance, in Fang Wang's talk yesterday. It's the obstruction, it's the coefficient of the log terms in a Poincaré-Einstein, and even dimensions. And even dimensions. So, this is an even-dimensional object, and it's a higher-dimensional generalization of the Bach tensor, in a sense. So, it, you know, this looks like the start of the Bach tensor, but then we have these powers of the Laplacian as well, and then lower-order terms. Now, an interesting way that this arises, and this is due to Graham Hirachi, is that you can get this, well, this. Well, this Feffman-Gram instruction also arises as the functional gradient of the integral of Branson's Q-curvature. Now, functional gradient now with respect to metric variations. And the Q-curvature itself is an interesting object that has been mentioned and will be mentioned more in this conference that transforms conformally like this. So it's not conformally invariant, but on closed manifolds, its integral still is because. Manifolds, its integral still is because this p is the critical GJMS operator, which is a divergence operator. Okay, so that's conformally invariant on closed manifolds. And this gives a sort of conformal side of the picture. And then what about Yang mills? So the question is: is there now a higher order Yang mills that might produce the story like in dimension four? And I'm going to claim. And I'm going to claim the story as a happy ending. Though it's not really the end, but some progress, I suppose, because we were talking about dimension six. Okay. Now, it turns out that there are operators on closed differential forms that are analogues of the Q curvature. So, some Brantson and I sort of came up with these, and they're we called. And they're, we call them Q operators and so on, but it doesn't matter what you call them. On closed differential forms, you get a behavior that's exactly like the Q curvature. And the Q curvature itself is a special case. So you take a closed zero form like one and apply the appropriate operator. So you have such forms for each k, k is the form degree, each k below the middle order and in the even dimensions. Then this transforms like that. And as I say, if you take And as I say, if you take k to be zero, then this just becomes the usual q curvature. And the construction actually produces the usual q curvature in that way. That's the way the construction works. And for example, if you take k equals, let's see. So, well, I want to go on an n over 2 minus 1 form. I have to think about what that means for my numbers. But basically, you're then dealing with a q2, meaning. With a q2, meaning a second-order one of these q operators. Okay, um, and here I'm giving the explicit formula for that: P is the scouting, J is its metric trace. And now, an interesting thing happens, because of its low order, it's only second order, this can actually be coupled to connections. And it still conformally has the same behavior. Now, this is not true for the higher Q operators. Not true for the higher Q operators. There's a very important property of the critical GJMS operators, for instance, that they're not strongly invariant. You can't couple them to connections and still get a conformally invariant operator. And that's true for these Q operators as well. They have that same sort of critical property, except for the lowest order one. And again, a similar thing applies to the GJMS in dimension two. The critical GJMS is second order, and then it would be strongly invariant. Invariant. Okay, so this Q2 you can twist with a connection, and you can just check this all by hand that it then does transform in the right way. So now these only transform like this when you apply them on closed forms. Here, because when you twist up the connection, you can close, they have to be closed in the DA sense, right? So with a twisted exterior derivative, but the but the But the curvature of a connection is exactly such a thing. So, this is a two-form that is taking values in some bundle and it's DA closed because that's the Bianchi identity. So, using that and then contracting in the curvature again, you can produce a scalar quantity that transforms exactly like a Q curvature. I mean, when I say exactly, I mean, when I say exactly, so on dimension six, it has the right conformal weight, if you like, and it transforms by an operator that's divergence type. So this is kind of schematic. The numbers, some numbers are sort of set to one that aren't really one and so on here. But okay, so and then the measure in dimension six transforms, of course, like this, and this balances that weight, and so. Balances that weight. And so you get this action that you can make out of this that's conformally invariant, out of this type of Q curvature that's made out of the connection. Okay, so the claim is that this is a suitable higher Yang-Mills action for dimension six. I mean, let's go back. I mean, it's quadratic in the curvature. In the curvature, so it's sort of bound to be a good candidate, right? Um, provided this Q operator has the right ingredients and it does. And so, when you take variations of the connection to compute the functional gradient of that, you get an object that looks like this. Okay, so that really is a formula for it. Maybe there's a number there that's not correct, but otherwise it's correct. Um, and so the leading order. The leading order of this is sort of a delta D delta F structure, which is the correct thing. So now, I can't explain here what I mean by that's correct, but if you look at certain differential complexes that are around and so on, mainly the sort of Duran complex actually, really, and think about how such a thing could work, this is what you would like as the leading term of this thing. So it has the right leading term. So, it has the right leading term. This is conformally invariant. So, this functional gradient is conformally invariant. So, that's what we're saying here. So, this is what we're claiming is a good candidate for a higher Yang mills. And then, what is a test of this? Well, a test is one perhaps nice thing that didn't have to happen, but does work is that when you apply this to the tractor connection, so you take this higher Yang mils and you plug in. Higher Yang mils, and you plug in the tractor connection. You once again get all zeros except the pot of gold at the bottom again. And this time, instead of the Bach tensor, it's the dimension six Pfefferman-Graham obstruction tensor. Okay, well, that's the sort of main punchline, this page, really, that this thing gives a good action in dimension six for a higher Yang mills that works for any connection. And then when you plug this. And then, when you plug this into the tractor connection, then you get an analogue of what was happening in dimension four. Well, just a sort of to finish off a sort of application to the Einstein equations. So, as I said, the Bach tensor vanishes on conforming Einstein manifolds. It's similar for the Pfefferman-Graham abstraction. The way to see that is that the way it originally Is that the way it originally was discovered was an obstruction to the Fifthman-Gram ambient metric, which I think most people here know about, associated to even-dimensional conformal manifolds. For example, if you start off with a conformal six-manifold, then you get the ambient metric tries to associate a Ricci-flat eight-manifold. But there's an obstruction, there's a formal obstruction. An obstruction is a formal obstruction, and that's what the Pfefferman-Graham obstruction tensor is. You know, it's an obstruction at a certain order and the formal expansion of that, which then can be eliminated by adding log terms and so on. Okay, so it's when you try and solve it smoothly that it's obstructed. But if the original even-dimensional manifolds conformally Einstein, then there's formally at least, you know, that there's an all-orders ambient metric. And all orders ambient metric. Well, that was the observation by Fifman-Graham originally. And so this obstruction tensor must vanish. In fact, when it's conformally Einstein, there's an easy, explicit construction of the ambient metric. So it's not only formal, you can really construct one in a column just by a sort of warped metric construction. A warped product construction. So okay, so that means that the Fefferman-Ground tensor vanished. So that means that the Fiffman-Grand tensor vanishes on conformally Einstein manifolds, and the obstruction flat condition is once again a sort of conformal weakening of the Einstein equations. So they're very important in that sense. So the application, you know, one application of this is that, you know, using this higher Yang-Mills type equation that we're coming up with, you're getting this understood as a sort of Yang-Mills system, which Of Yang Mills system, which may help study this problem, just in the way potentially the intervention for using that the bark flat conditioners Yang Mills could potentially be used to study Einstein there. I think in physics, in a sense, they have used this Yang-Mills approach to studying the Einstein equations, although they didn't really call it that way when they did it. But I believe that Malda Sina and so on have done something like that. And so on, have done something like that. Okay, so that's it, really. I'll stop there. I've got a final one. There we go. Thank you, Laura. Any question or comments? Hi, Professor Gober. I saw your abstract of your talk. Yes. Of your talk. Yes. And I also write three slides on the conformal event, Jambius functional on three-dimensional. Can you show me more detail on the expression of the integral Q2? Q2. Yeah, I'll check. The leading terms should the same, the square term of the divergence of F, right? Yeah. And the second term is the Ricci. Yeah, this is the contraction by Ricci and the F square term of F. I'm not sure if because I do the find the conformal event by renormalization of the Yamius functional of the Yam of Yamius connection on some seven dimensional CCE on the band Long term on the on the pan, uh, yeah, yeah, expansion, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I had the idea that one could also do it that way. So, so, is this already published? Uh, no, no, no, no, okay, I didn't make many progress. Progress, I only found that I checked directly that's a conformal event. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, indeed. Um, I also had the idea that it should arise that way. Um That way. This was just one easy, explicit way to make it because we already had this Q2 operator. So, in other dimensions, this will not work. It's a hard to be explicit formula. Yeah. Once you go to other dimensions, it's going to get very difficult. And can uh can you approach fund more um so because the normalization approach uh only fund one uh-huh uh is the tractor connection approach can fund more uh well the tractor the tractor thing is separate right i mean the the question of the conformally invariant yang mills has nothing to do with tractors Mills has nothing to do with tractors. But what we are using are these operators, these Q operators that we did construct using tractors. But once you have those, we used an ambient metric construction really and then interpreted that via tractors. So we used the Fiffman gram ambient metric and then interpreted it via tractors. And that gave the Q operators and so on. And so on. And Galamo and someone else sort of recovered the same things by doing it instead using Ponkari, Einstein, and so on. But yeah, but once you have those Q operators, the... I'm sorry, Lord. I'm sorry. Yeah, okay. That's all right. Okay. Let's. Okay. Let's thank Professor Rodgov was a nice talk. Thank you very much. Thank you, everyone.
