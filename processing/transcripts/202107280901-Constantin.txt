He was a university professor at the University of Vienna and an expert in fluid mechanics. He made groundbreaking contributions to mathematics of waves in several settings. So thank you for agreeing to speak here. And please go ahead. Thank you for this kind invitation. It's a great pleasure to have the opportunity to give a talk here. Opportunity to give a talk here. So, my talk would be about, I mean, the title is Large Amplitude Steady Downstream Water Waves. And this is joint work with Walter Strauss and Eugene Varvaruka. And it concerns two-dimensional water waves with vorticity. So, I will just a second somehow. So, I will briefly explain the basic background. Explain the basic background, physical background. So we are interested in the most regular type of waves, so two-dimensional periodic traveling waves. The thing is, we want to allow large amplitude and we want a flat bed. So I will talk in a moment about how realistic this is. And the assumptions that are, so these are the free boundary Euler equations. The free boundary Euler equations, so inviscid flow, which is reasonable for water waves. We will assume constant density, which is also, I mean, there are some data here, that's also a reasonable assumption. The restoring force, because these are waves of large amplitude, will be only gravity. So, surface tension plays no role. And we neglect the viscous action of the air with the understanding that these waves were somehow generated. Waves were somehow generated by in a distant place and then they propagated. So, throughout this propagation, this viscous friction doesn't play an important role. And so, the kind of ways we are interested in are two-dimensional and they are termed swelling oceanography. The irregular ones are called C. So, and this assumption of two-dimensional is Assumption of two-dimensional is quite frequently encountered in field data. Now, the flat bed scenario, of course, I mean, the bed is not always flat, but there are surprisingly large regions where it is extremely flat, flatter than you would encounter on land, namely 7.5% approximately of the ocean floor consists of continental shells. Consists of continental shelves and there it is absolutely flat. The average depth is about 50 meters, and the largest ones are in the Arctic, around the Arctic. So, for example, it's 1,000 kilometers in the sea along more than 3,000 kilometers of the coast of Siberia. And there's also one closer to the US in the Yucatan Peninsula and closer to North America, where it extends more than one kilometer. Where it extends more than one kilometer offshore for about 500 kilometers. So 50 meters is a rough estimate for the depth. And well, the mathematical challenge is the following. There are no explicit solutions for finite depth. For infinite depth, there is one, but for finite depth, there is nothing explicit exact for the nonlinear equations. The other thing is that nonlinear way. Is that non-linear wave? I mean, non-linear analysis is essential because the shape of the waves, I will go ahead and then I will show you a picture in a moment that shows that the wave is far from being sinusoidal. The trough is very flat and the crest is quite narrow in general, especially these waves that are on the continental shelf. And the other thing that the downstream waves in the title refers to currents. Refers to currents. So, currents, non-uniform currents. So, if a current is non-uniform, that's the sign that the current is non-uniform is non-zero vorticity. For zero vorticity, you can have uniform currents. And because of the kind of modeling of context we are looking at, a constant vorticity is a good approximation. And I will explain a little bit why. Explain a little bit why the sign matters in what we do, whether it's positive or negative vorticity. That refers to downstream and upstream in another. And generally, wind-generated currents are sheared. So constant vorticity means that the shear is, I mean, the vortex, it's the simplest shear that you can have that is non-constant. Okay, this is the photo I was referring to. So you see, it's very far. To so you see, it's very far from the thing in linear theory, it's the crest is very narrow, and the trough is almost flat. Right, so now what we would like to do is we would like to write the governing equations and we would like to allow for overhanging waves, so these omega-shaped shaped things that appear to be. Appear to be, I mean, it appears that they can, such profiles cannot, you cannot encounter such profiles for irrotational flows, but for constant vorticity, they seem to be, it's possible to observe them. I haven't seen convincing photo, but that doesn't, but I've seen several papers where people make reference to this thing. So the flat. To this thing. So the free surface is not the graph of a function. u is the horizontal velocity, v is the vertical one, b is the flat pad that we take to be y equals zero. And right, so I will now talk about the governing equations. So it's non-dimensional, they are in non-dimensional form. So it's the Euler equations with gravity as the external force. Then density is constant, so mass conservation takes place. Constant, so mass conservation takes this form here of ux plus vy equals zero. The vorticity in this two-dimensional case, because the flow in one direction, in the horizontal direction perpendicular to the wave propagation direction, the flow is identical. So the vorticity is a vector in R3, but two components are zero. And the only one that, because it's two-dimensional, and the only one that might. dimensional and the only one that that might be non-zero is is this with uy minus vx. So in the two-dimensional context, we can think of vorticity as a as a scalar and it has this expression, its irrotation when that is zero. In our case, this will be constant. Then the boundary conditions is a dynamic boundary condition where we take the constant atmospheric pressure at the surface and the kinematic boundary conditions that tell you that Conditions that tell you that, I mean, there are interfaces. So the flat bed, there's a vanishing normal component along the flat bed, and also one at the surface. The particle on the boundary stays on the boundary. Right. Now, what about this vorticity? What is a realistic assumption? Now, if you look in the engineering literature, there seems to be a quite good agreement that wind. Quite a good agreement that wind generates vorticity of this type. So, this is a very simple model where the surface is flat, there is no vertical motion, so the only motion is in the horizontal, that's u. And u depends on the vertical variable y in this linear form. It's something that y0 is a reference depth. Anyhow, this is something with constant vorticity gamma. Okay, so this is a pure constant. Okay, so this is a pure current in the sense there are there is no wave, there are no waves, this is a purely, I mean, in general, there's no vertical velocity, the flat surface, right? And typical values would be of the current, if you wonder, it's this is 0.5 meters per second for the Siberian continental shelf and 0.33 on the in this Yucatan peninsula. And you can plug in the numbers to see. The numbers to see. Right now, constant vorticity is a good assumption in the sense that for this type of shallow waves, it's the existence of a non-zero mean vorticity that is important. That's the important thing rather than the specific distribution. And the typical wavelength is about 70 meters. Being 2D, the vorticity being constant is an assumption. If it holds at some time, it will hold at all later time. Time it will hold at all later time, and we consider traveling wave, so blow-up is not an issue here. But for all times, the vorticity because of the vorticity equation in 2D, right? And here is, here are the values, I mean, field data gives the values, the reasonable values for the vorticity in these two regions that I mentioned. Okay, the flow being steady means that it moves in the direction of the wave propagation at the constant time c. So we eliminate, we write the governing equations now in a moving frame to eliminate time from our system. And this is a reformulation. So there is a stream function. That's the most important thing defined in the typical way. And because Defined in the typical way. And because I'm in the moving frame, the y-derivative is u minus c. C is the constant wave speed. And then instead of the Euler equations, I have, I can, three boundary Euler equations with these two boundary conditions and the constant vorticity. They amount to the following. I have a domain, which is this under this omega-shaped free surface. So the flat bed is y equals. So the flat bed is y equals zero. That's not complicated. The free surface is parametrized by, well, little u and little v. So it's a parametrization that allows for overhanging. And because I want periodicity, this is how you translate the periodicity. U of s minus s and v of s is periodic of period l Laplace of the stream function is this constant vorticity. And then the nice thing because it's in a moving frame. Nice thing because it's in a moving frame and the wave is steady, the stream function from the boundary conditions, the kinematic boundary conditions mean exactly that size constant on the top and on the bed. And you can choose, I mean, it's defined, the stream function is defined up to a constant, so we choose it to be zero on the surface. And then on the flat bed is something called minus m. We call minus m. m is the relative mass flux. M is the relative mass flux, so it's also a physical quantity. And then, if you wonder that this last condition 1, well, that's because you have something like Bernoulli. So you have a Bernoulli equation for irrotational flow, in general, time-dependent. For steady, it becomes something like this. And these kinds of things generalize also to the constant vorticity case. So this is the last condition one. So, the last condition 1D is Bernoulli evaluated on the free surface. In Bernoulli, you have the pressure, the pressure is constant, so you get this kind of non-tangential non-linear boundary condition. So, the problem that we have is a free boundary problem for the unknown psi that is periodic, it solves this Poisson equation, and it's constant on the flat surface, and the flat on the free surface, and the free surface is unknown. So, that's Unknown. So that's the problem we are looking at. And like I said, if you integrate the psi y, that's u minus c from from at any and at any x, at any direction x, at any fixed x over the vertical from the bed to the surface, what you get is something that is independent of your location. That's this little m. It's called the mass flux. And this is the Bernoulli thing written in non-dimensional variables. In non-dimensional variable, and if you write it in this form, then you can see that everything here has the dimension of length, and there are physical names for each quantity expressing this non-linear oblique boundary condition. Okay, now the way we want to approach this, so what we want to do is I will briefly talk about the existence of solutions of large amplitude. Of solutions of large amplitude, and the object of the paper and of the talk is some qualitative properties. So, what we want to show, what we were interested in, is how the vorticity, what's the effect of the vorticity on the shape of these waves. So, in order to, well, one technique for free boundary problems is somehow to transform variables to transform this to a fixed boundary. In this case, To a fixed boundary. In this case, because the stream function is constant on top and on bed, and you have Laplace of psi equal a constant, well, you don't have harmonic maps, so you don't have conformal maps like in the rotational case, but you have something more. So if you see here, what this happens is that if you look at this expression, there's xi, okay? So what I want, I want to say that. To I want to say that this fluid domain is parametrized by a strip, okay, and that would be something like Riemann map, but not really because this is not conformal. To make something harmonic, I take this psi here and I have to add something to it to compensate for the fact that the Laplace is not zero, but it's equal to a constant. And then what you have is that this is. That this is this domain, because it's also periodic, it's like it's an annulus. And then when you have conformal maps from an annulus, the ratio matters. So there are some subtle things of complex analysis. Now, I will show you this kind of reformulation of the governing equations, and it looks very ugly, but actually, it has a lot of structure. Actually, it has a lot of structure. So, what this is, is the following. Basically, what we do, because we have harmonic maps, you think of Dirich Leneuman operator and you move everything to the boundary. So, this is a two-dimensional problem. It's an elliptic problem because time was eliminated. We are in a moving frame. And what we want, in addition, we want to take advantage of the fact that, well, Laplace is a constant, so we can make it harmonic and then. Harmonic, and then we want to shift everything to the surface and get the one-dimensional equation. So, reduce further the dimension by means of the Dirichlet-Neumann operator. This is what this does here, but there are many complications. Now, if you look at what is here, so this is this operator CKH, so H is this depth of the parametrization of the conformal. The conformal parametrization of the strip k is related to the wave number. So this C is like it's the periodic Hilbert transform. Then what you have here is V is the parameter for V is the parametrization. Little V is not the speed, is the parametrization of the free surface. You have Q is a constant, that's the head. Gamma, this thing here is the vorticity. Is the vorticity. And what you see here, this is Dirichle-Neumann. It's a non-linear equation with a lot of parameters, physical parameters coming up. And it's third order. If you kind of count, it's not quadratic, it's cubic. And it comes coupled with the scalar constraint. So the scalar constraint is that the average over a period of this expression is equal to this other average. These square brackets are averages. are averages. So at the moment it looks really horrible and it's not even quadratic. If you set gamma equals zero, you get the corresponding irrotational one, which would be the corresponding of the so-called Babenko equation for infinite depth. The finite depth case is more complicated than the infinite depth because in the infinite depth, you know what happens deep down. That is, the flow ceases to, I mean, the flow decays. I mean, the flow decays very strongly with depth. So then you have control of what happens at the boundary at minus infinity. Here, you don't have this, so it's much more complicated to define at that case, even in the rotational case. So here, m is gamma, m, q, g, and k are physical parameters, and we can shift, there is a symmetry, we can shift gamma to minus gamma and then m to minus m. Minus gamma and then m to minus m. So, this equation, this is a reformulation of the governing equation of the Euler equation. The advantage is that it's a pseudo-differential equation, non-linear one, coupled with the scalar constraint, but it's in one dimension. And here are, well, this is the Dirichlet-Neumann operator and the relationship to the Hilbert transform. So it's for this strip where I have the parametrization. And okay, and this is the formula. Okay, and this is the formula for the periodic Hilbert transform. So it's a principal value, and then there's a kernel. And the kernel, you can write it explicitly as a series. It takes on this form. And it turns out that this explicit, there is an alternative expression that is with these special functions from complex analysis, but since very few people know. Very few people know the properties of these functions. We find it actually more useful to work with this series representation. The important thing is this estimate that we write down here. This is an estimate that has nothing to do with the, I mean, it's valid for all depths of this parametrization. So the aim will be to show you that with the local bifurcation result and global bifurcation, you get solutions. And then we want to prove some a priori estimates. Some a priori estimates along this bifurcation, this global bifurcation curves. And these a priori estimates tell you something about what happens when the wave gets bigger and bigger. Now, in irrotational theory, you have something called the Stokes wave of greatest height. So you show that, okay, this free boundary problem for a special range of parameters determined by the local bifurcation, you have flows that have an Or have flows that have a non-flat surface, these are small waves with global bifurcation, let's say Rabinovich, or there is an analytic bifurcation, that's the thing that we are using. You extend this local curve, local bifurcating to a global one, and you know that you have some, if you have some compactness properties, you can show that along this global bifurcation, certain things happen. And with a priori estimates, we are. And with a priori estimates, we are able to refine those things. So now, this is the reformulation with this. The problem is that, so this reformulation is, in terms of the pseudo-differential operator, corresponds to a variational one. Okay. And the variational one, if you look at this is the energy here, this L, it depends on the domain and on the stream function. What you have here is the part, the first part accounting for. The part the first part accounting for kinetic energy, then there's something for vorticity, then there's potential energy, and the last one is this total head. Okay, so if you take the variations of this with respect to the domain and everything, then it's non-trivial calculation to prove that the Euler-Lagrange equations for this any critical point will satisfy the pseudo-differential operator and the scalar constraint. So there is also So, there is also this variational interpretation of this reformulation. Okay. So, what we do now, because we have this sort of differential thing, we can do local bifurcation. So, the solutions will be MQ V. V is the parameter for the vertical V of s was the height of the free surface, and the spaces M is mass flux, Q is total head. So these are scalars. And then V, we take it to be in the Holder space, two alpha, two derivatives. And I mean, the second derivative, the second derivative, this is one dimensional. So the second derivative is alpha Holder continuous. It's of period two pi, and E means it's even. To pi and E means it's even. Okay? And then you can do Kranda-Rabinowitz bifurcation, and you see that at this dispersion relation, so when the parameters are in this relation, you will have flows that you will see the appearance of genuine waves. So flows that don't have a flat free surface. And the interesting thing is, with respect to irrotational flow, is that you can have, because of the vortex. You can have because of the vorticity, you can have flow reversal. So, you have at some level in the fluid the direction of the flow changes at this bifurcation point. So, at this flat, at this flow with the flat surface, but where waves start to appear. But the interesting thing is that these stagnation points can so you can have a line of stagnation point, a critical layer, nothing like this. Critical layer, nothing like this happens in a rotational flow. And these are the critical layers, the perturbations of you have this Kelvin cat's eye pattern, this one here. Okay, so this will be, so this is what happens when you perturb it and the flow reversal occurs along the middle section of these cat eyes, where you see above the flow is from right to left, and below is from left to right. And then at this point, And then at these critical layers, if you do the dynamics, then you have this kind of things. Okay, so now what we do is something else. We make another, we have this differential equation and we rearrange it in the following form. We write it like this. So this is just a rewriting, but A rewriting, but the advantage is that if you look at the right-hand side, you see a lot of commutators, right? So, in the first line, there is a commutator multiplied with something, in the second line, another commutator, and then the third line is some expressions that are actually, you don't have derivatives, so you don't lose derivatives in the third line. But in the second line, you apply the Hilbert transform to Vv prime and then V minus Hilbert transform. So it's a kind of commutator, and there is a commutator estimate that you can. There is a commutator estimate that you can prove in Holder spaces or in alternative in some Lebesgue spaces, but we work with Holder spaces because here it's clear we have classical solutions. We don't need to talk about regularity theory to talk about the smoothness. So you have a gain, namely, well, it's not a perfect gain. You start with P alpha, P, so it's Holder spaces, P is greater or equal one, alpha is the parameter between zero and one. Between zero and one. And the two commutators that appear in this equation, when you look at them, well, the commutators, you lose something, but as long as you are willing to give up something, you give up something extremely small. So for every delta strictly smaller than alpha, you have this regularity for the commutators. And why is this important? Because it means that. It means that if you look at the equation, if g minus 2, if I divide with the first part, if that stays away from zero, what I have is then I have a compact operator. And I need this compact operator, not for the local bifurcation, but I want it. What we want now is we want to ensure that this local curve of genuine waves extends to a global one. And a global means it's not. Global means it's not restricted to a neighborhood of flows with the free surface. And this global, when you have compactness, when the operator that comes in is compact, then you can apply Le Ray-Schauder degree. And or, well, anyhow, you can apply degree theory. And with the help of degree theory, what you can show is that this global solution curve in Solution curve, in our case, because everything is real analytic, it's actually not a continuum, it's a curve that has a local analytic parametrization, the solution curve. You can say either the norm will blow up or it will return to the flat surface. So, there are these alternatives. So, because it's analytic bifurcation, what you get is not just the continuum, you get a real analytic reparametrization. So, this is the Parameterization. So, this is the analytic bifurcation theory. So, M, Q, V were the unknowns, and now you get the dependence of all of them on some parameter S. And when S is zero, you have pure current, so no wave. Near to the pure currents, you can approximate with linear theory, you have cosine, so you have these sinusoidal waves. But then, because this operator is compact, you have two options. Options: either it's unbounded in the function space, the function space is C2 alpha, or you approach stagnation at the wave crest, because that's Q minus 2 Gv equals zero, going to zero. And a third possible alternative that you can have in global bifurcation is that you return to the trivial solution curve. The trivial solution curve here would be flows with the flat surface, and that we eliminate. And that we eliminate by using nodal pattern. So, what we show is along the bifurcation, v is this little u of x and little v of x is the parameterization of the free surface. And what we show is that v is even and it's strictly negative from zero to pi. And then at zero and at pi, you have an estimate on. You have an estimate on the second derivative. So, this is a nodal pattern that prevents once you start to bifurcate, you can never return to the trivial curve because that will invalidate the validity of this nodal pattern. And you show that this holds with maximum principles, okay? Because it's an elliptic problem and it has enough structure this works through. Okay, and while we want this curve to be Well, we want this curve to be non-self-intersecting because we allow overhanging but not self-intersection. So one conjecture that this is something that we cannot prove, but this is what we imagine, this is how the limit of this continuum will look like. You have stagnation at the crest, either in the form of an angle that's in. An angle that's in the upper left corner, or you have overhanging with an angle, or the solution touches itself. Self-intersection, we cannot handle. Okay, so it touches itself, and then it has it has either below the crest or below the trough. So, that's these are these two figures. Okay, so this is the existence theory, and now I would like. And now I would like to come back and explain if you have this solution to this pseudo-differential equation, which is equivalent for non-self-intersecting free surfaces to the free boundary Euler equations. How do you recognize the current? Well, once you have a solution, what you can take is over a period L, period now time was eliminated, so period refers to the spatial period. refers to the spatial period. You take the average of psi y was u minus c and what you get, you see that this is, you can do this at every depth level below the trough, and you can see that this has a dependence of this form, gamma y, right? So this can be easily proved, and this is how you recognize the current in your mathematical solution. And now we distinguish between in Between in the proper frame of reference, positive and negative vorticity. So, the important thing is downstream waves. So, the wind blows in the direction of the waves, in the direction in which the wave propagates. That's downstream waves. Or it's two-dimensional. The other option would be that the wind is opposite and this is upstream waves. Now, the structure that we uncovered is for downstream. Uncovered is for downstream waves, and this is what I would like to talk now. So, this is roughly a picture. These are downstream waves left. Left on the left, on the figure in the left, is the physical frame. So, you have the waves that are sheared. This is what you see in the depiction of the current there, these little arrows, and the wind is in this direction. That's the physical. That's the physical frame. When you write things in the moving frame, it's a little bit confusing at first, or perhaps not that clear, but this is how it looks like. On the left is in the frame of reference. So these are the downstream ones, and these are upstream waves. So basically, the wind is opposite, and then you have something like that. That. So now, field data and experiments in laboratories suggest that upstream and downstream, the behavior of the waves as they grow is quite different. Because in the downstream case, so that's when the wind blows in the same direction, what happens is that the wind tends to make the wavelength longer and the waves are nicer. And the waves are nicer, are not so steep. And the upstream case, the crests are, I mean, this is where you have overhang, might have overhanging and the waves look rougher. And that's this, so this is what field data and experiments suggest, and this is what we are going to prove that along this global bifurcation. Along this global bifurcation curve, for downstream waves, you can never have overhanging. And moreover, the waves, the wave of the behavior as the vorticity grows, so a growing vorticity makes the wave smoother and smoother if it's downstream. Okay, so this is about a priori estimates in general. This is the theorem that we can, the main result. The main result. So let me just explain you the content in a few words, a few minutes. So we consider this favorable vorticity, that means downstream waves, and we consider this solution curve. We did the method of bifurcation that we use is real analytic bifurcation, so we really have a curve. And then any solution, we have some regularity, any solution is real analytic. Is real analytic. The waves are not overhanging. The wave amplitude is uniformly bounded. So these waves cannot grow too much. And we have an explicit bound on an L infinity bound that depends only on the vorticity and the wave period. And now, if you think in terms of vorticity, if the vorticity becomes bigger, then the amplitude of the wave tends to zero. So a bigger and bigger. So a bigger and bigger vorticity will make these waves insignificant. And this is as if you move along this bifurcation curve, then you approach the maximum amplitude. So that's the main result. And let me now go through this key ingredients of the proof. So the first thing The first thing is that at the bifurcation, we can linearize and compute everything. We have a dispersion relation that is explicit, and we can find the explicit formulas for the wave. So at the bifurcation, we can control things. And then with maximum principles, we can extend partly this qualitative control along the entire global. Global solution curve. So, the important thing is that this inequality for the this is the Hilbert transform holds, and psi y will be less than zero. So, this is with maximum principles. So, how do we rule out overhanging? Well, there is this expression here, which up to a constant is the negative fluid pressure, this Q. And, well, if you compute, if you try. Well, if you compute, if you try to, in the irrotational case, this Laplace of Q has a sign. In this case, it's slightly more complicated, but not. So you have for Q, when you compute Laplace of Q, you have, so second, you have some first order terms, and this is the zero order term. And if you look at it, psi y is negative, gamma is greater or equal zero. So this is. So, this is suitable for maximum principle in the case of favorable vorticity or downstream waves. So, this is a key ingredient because then we can we have with maximum principles, you have also HOF principle, and then you can get statements about what happens at About what happens at the point that will be overhanging. So, this is the key. And the key to the most difficult part is the L infinity bound on the wave amplitude. And that comes out of a rather surprising inequality for these third-order nonlinear pseudo-differential equation involving the Hilbert transform. So, what you see here. So, what you see here is, so this is, so to say, the key lemma for the L infinity bound. So, we take a function that is even and it grows from zero to pi, right? And it's two pi periodic, so it and it's strictly positive. And then what you look is at this expression. So, first is C is the Hilbert transform. C is the Hilbert transform for this strip of width kh, which is a physical constant. And what you see here is these are commutators. Okay, so the k is a weird, is a third order, a commutator for things of order three. And J is a commutator of order two, if you want. I mean, for degree two, not order. Yeah. And what you have here is: so this is second order, second. So, this is second order, second order. Then you take out the third order and you add the second order with f of pi minus f of 0. f of pi minus f of 0 is a positive quantity because f is increasing between 0 and pi. And what you can show is that this is bigger than this expression. This beta, this weird thing here that comes in is the estimate of beta was the kernel of the periodic. The kernel of the periodic Hilbert transform for this strip. So it's something we can estimate with the constant. And this is a kind, it's a very unusual inequality because it's really, well, I will not go into the details of the proof because it's quite a delicate proof, but that's the key. Delicate proof, but that's the key. If you wonder what this has to do, well, if you go back, this is the, if I go back to the formulation that I had, it has to do with this. So this is where it comes from. Okay, the terms there, this is the second order, this is the third order commutate. I mean, this is a commutator of order two, if you want, the function, and this is order three. And the rest, if you, the rest is. Rest, if you the rest is something where you hear in the third line, this is an average, so it's not much. These are the difficult things to control. And with this help, with the help of this lemma, we can find an explicit a priori bound for the L infinity norm of the solutions, meaning that the amplitude, and because we can estimate this. And because we can estimate this beta, the beta is the kernel with that value with pi, we can, with this estimate, we can let in this estimate gamma go to infinity and see and deduce. So the moral of the story is that, well, for the waves of great amplitude that, so for this global bifurcation curve, what we Curve, what we are able to show is that along the continuum in the down in the downstream case, in the so favorable vorticity, the wind blows in the same direction. The wave amplitude remains bounded. And if the vorticity increases, the effect on this is to dampen the wave height, to make it smaller and smaller. And that corresponds to what people have been observing. What people have been observing is that the wind, I mean, in so hand-waving observation is that if the wind blows in the same direction, this has the tendency for the wavelength to become larger and the wave height to decrease. And we have a quantitative estimate along this global bifurcation curve. Now, I should say the following, of course, near the local Course, near the local bifurcation. So, these solutions, when they start to appear as perturbations of a flat surface, there you have uniqueness. So, all the solutions are either on the trivial curve or on this local bifurcating thing. That's this Grand Dorabinovich gives you this. If you move away from the neighborhood of the, so if you are for what we, you are in the regime of waves of large amplitude, so. Of waves of large amplitude, so waves that are not anymore perturbations of a flat free surface, then this curve of solutions gives you waves, but exist, I mean, that they are unique is rather unlikely. Okay, so we cannot claim that these are all the waves, it's just that these are the waves of large amplitude that have That we know or we are aware of how to construct analytically. But it's the argument has a lot to do with continuation, even in this estimate, which we well, what it has to do is this monotonicity is something that you inherit along the curve. So you want with maximum principles, you want some properties to be preserved, and then you can use this. Then you can use this.
