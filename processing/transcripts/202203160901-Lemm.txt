You don't want to press the button here, right? On Zoom. You want to do it on the website? No, I did it on the other. I did it on the. Yes. Beautiful. I did. Yes. I'm this. All right. So welcome back, everybody. So this is the third day of the meeting, and we'll start with a talk by Marius Lem from the University of Tübingen on propagation bounds for the Booser-Hubbard model. It's a pleasure, Marius. Marius, the stage is yours. Well, thanks, Imuna, for the introduction. Thanks to all the organizers for the invitation talk and for putting together this meeting. I want to encourage you all to ask questions and interrupt me. I'm going to pause for questions also so we can keep it interactive. So, yeah, my title is a bit shorter than what was written on the website. It's just propagation bounds for the Bose-Hubbard model. It's because this is really. It's because this is really summarizing two papers, both based on work with Jeremy Fopin and Israel Michael Siegel. And they're both about propagation balance for the Bose-Hubbard model, but they are slightly different results using related but slightly different techniques. And we'll get to that. So I'm going to start by reviewing Lieb-Robinson bounds, which is what we're kind of bounds we're trying to prove, because those Hubbard models. Because those Hubbard models are also a quantum lattice gas, and the standard Lee-Robinson bounds, I assume many of you are familiar with. I know some of you are absolute experts in. So I'm going to review them somewhat briefly also to sort of set the stage. So what are we talking about for the standard Lieb-Robinson balance, given some very general quantum spin system, say on a lattice, but it can actually be a graph that has decent growth properties. That has decent growth properties. And, you know, this is just a sketch. And then it considers some local Hamiltonian. So the interactions should be local and bounded. Those are the two main ingredients and that I call a quantum spin system. And then I have a sum of, you say, nearest neighbor interactions, but actually sufficiently rapidly decaying interactions would also work. And the dynamics, I'm going to consider dynamics on observables. I'm going to take the Heisenberg dynamics, unitary conjugation. Unitary conjugation by the unitary generated by the Hamiltonian. And then the Lieb-Robinson bound bounds the commutator of two observables, B and a time evolved A of T. If A of T is Heisenberg time evolved, I take the commutator and I bound the norm, control the norm of this thing. And this is interesting in the case when A and B act on different subsets of the lattice. And so the distance between their supports is positive. Distance between their supports is positive. So, what's the support of an observable? It's just the region where the observable acts non-trivially. And by non-trivially, I mean not like the identity. Okay, so A acts somewhere, B acts somewhere else, and then at time of off A, just one of them, and the commutator is small. If, well, if this right-hand side is small, so the norm of A and the norm of B you can ignore, they're just there for homogeneity reasons. The main point about the right-hand side is that. The main point about the right-hand side is it's small if this exponent is very negative, which means that time is small compared to distance. Time is small compared to distance. You see already there's a light cone in there. And many of you may know this, of course, very well already. Okay, so that's the standard Lieb-Robinson bound. And holds really, I mean, say for many such Hamiltonians, really, the main input are local and bound interactions. I'm going to be emphasizing this because we're going to be dropping one of those. Because we're going to be dropping one of those assumptions later on. Okay, so this is just a recap. This is the Lieb-Robinson bound. The point about this, why is there light coin here? Well, at time zero, the left-hand side is zero because the observables act on disjoint subsets and then they commute. And so at positive times, the bound says at positive times, the combinator remains small. So what's an interpretation? Well, the interpretation then is that correlations between A and Then is that correlations between A and B, as expressed by commutators of these quantum observables, stay localized within this effective light cone where the distance is less than V times T, where V is some constant. Okay, up to exponentially small errors. So it's not a perfect light cone, it leaks errors. And so in this sense, quantum spin systems have a similar region of causality as relativistic systems do. Of course, for relativistic systems, the light cone, the actual light cone is perfect. There's no Cone is perfect. There's no leakage out of the actual light cone. In relativistic theory, this is just an effective light cone. Lee-Robinson bound just provide an effective light cone where there's some exponential leakage. But it's still, you know, for many applications, it's almost as good. So to two remarks about the proof of the standard Lieb-Robinson bound, like I already said, used interactions are bound and local. And in particular, the constants Cv and ψ that appear in this bound, Cv and Xi. appear in this bound C V and xi all depend on the the norm of the interaction, okay, the operator norm of the interaction. And then V is called the Leibrabinson velocity, and of course this Leibravinson velocity is effectively much smaller than the speed of light. Yeah, there's a question by Ramis. Yeah. Is there any intuition for why? Yeah, why that maximum norm affects acc and therefore, you know, makes the right-hand side exponentially different. Yeah. Well, one way to understand this bound is in terms of, well, maybe you want to control this commutator by taking a time derivative. And when you take a time derivative of, you think like a Gronwault argument. Argument. When you take a time derivative of the unitary dynamics, you get a commutator with the Hamiltonian. And the commutator with the Hamiltonian is then a commutator with all the local interactions. The local interactions do two things. One is they increase the support a little bit, right? Because they act not just on single sites, but they also have a certain norm. Now, yeah. So that's the first thing. Now, the second thing, and I don't know if that's particularly what you're asking, but I'm assuming. That's particularly what you're asking about. I'm assuming, I'm really thinking of a translation invariant system where really this max is not really dependent on X's X and Y. I'm not trying to sort of isolate the fact that maybe some region has much stronger couplings and some is much weaker. And then maybe in the weakerly coupled region, you could improve the Lieb-Robinson bound or something like that. That's possible. I don't know to what extent this has been done concretely, but that's not my main point. I just think of a translation invariant system, and then you just have some operator norm. And then you just have some operator norm. And that enters by virtue of this time derivative argument that I sketched. Yeah. So does do Lieb-Robinson bounds apply to, say, spin glasses as well? Yeah, as long, absolutely. So that's a nice aspect of them. And I think it's a very good question because this is also a conference about randomness. So yes, they apply in the same way is precisely because all you need is locality and boundedness. Locality and boundedness. And, you know, if the amplitudes are, you know, there's maybe an issue if you have Gaussian amplitudes, because then they need to control the bound and then you need to make some kind of cutoff arguments, right? Because also like, you know, what if the lattice becomes accidentally disconnected or almost disconnected? Well, that's even better for Lee Bravinson-Brown. I think what you might be I think what you might be thinking about is that the standard spin glass is actually a mean field model, and then it becomes a bit more problematic. That's different. Yeah, that's a highly connected, highly connected lattice. That's the complete graph. Yeah, well, that's right. That's a different story. No, no, I'm really thinking. Yeah, yeah, I'm really thinking, that's why I said lattice earlier. I'm really thinking of Z2 or Z3 or the honeycomb, something like this. That has to do with this growth condition I mentioned in the beginning on the graph, that you need some control, some growth of neighborhoods. And on the complete graph, the neighborhoods grow very quickly. Yes. Okay, thanks. That's good discussion. Yeah, no, thanks for the question. Are there any other questions? Okay, if not, I'm going to go on. If not, I'm going to go on. So, this is sort of just a reference point, just a touchstone for us, this Leap Robinson bound, to keep in mind, right? I'm going to briefly review the history and then start talking about bosons at some point. I'm going to talk a little bit more about the connection later. So let me quickly review the history. I'm a little intimidated doing this in front of Bruno, but luckily he's turned his camera off, so maybe he isn't listening. The history of Lee Robinson, but this is just a short version. They were proved in 1974. Version. They were proved in 1974 by Lieb and Robinson. And then, interestingly, I think almost 30 years, nothing happened really. They were almost ignored. And then 2004, Hastings realized they can be used as a tool to prove a higher dimensional Liebschulz-Mattis theorem. And then from then, things took off. And you can see that all the years are now very close to each other. And since then, basically, I mean, the summary of this long slide, I just Summary of this long slide. I just added this so that it can be uploaded later. I'm not going to go through every point. The summary of this long slide is that beginning in 2004 and since then, Lieb-Robinson bounds have become an extremely effective proof tool. Okay, so I highlight the word tool whenever I found it pertinent to the discussion. They've been used to prove other things about many-body sprint systems. Okay, and sort of one highlight perhaps is Hastings' proof of an Is the Hastings proof of an area law for 1D gap spin chains, especially I would say because of its connection to quantum information. And that usually browses and bounds in particular. But many other applications exist. Okay, and they've also been extended. And then Naftegada Sims have also played a key role in these extensions. Okay, so this is my summary of the history. I'm happy to answer questions about the history later, but you see they've But you see, they've really in 2004 and until now, they've really become a big topic. So, yeah, this is just my last slide about the standard Lieb-Robinson bounds. I just want to sort of summarize a little bit again, give you a little bit more intuition of why these are very useful tools to have. Here's a simple corollary that was observed. I think. Was observed, I think, first by Bravi Hastings and Fastrata in 2006, maybe earlier, but I think this was the first time this was observed. It's just a restatement almost of the Lieb-Robinson bound that doesn't involve commutators. Now it just involves one observable, A. Just one observable that's localized in, say, its support, some ball. And now I take this observable and I let time evolve. You know, I replace A by A of T. You know, I replace A by A of t. And so immediately, of course, the support spread across the whole lattice. But the question is, how close is A to an observable whose support is only slightly enlarged? Okay, that's the question. And the Lieb Robinson bound answers this question. It says, if I take A of t, so this is spread everywhere, I can approximate it by an A sub R of T. What's A sub R of T? Well, A sub R of T is the natural way to approximate it. Natural way to approximate A of T by some. Nature way to approximate A of t by something that lives on a slightly enlarged support, namely I take A of T and I take the partial trace of the complement of the thickened support. So support of A plus R is just all points that have distance at most R from the original support. So I grow the support a little bit by R, take the partial trace, and I'll A sub R of T is supported on this set. So A sub R of T is supported on a slightly different. So, A sub RFT is support on a slightly larger set. And the question is: is this a good approximation? This is a good approximation precisely if you remain inside the light cone. The same light cone condition that comes out of the Lieb-Robinson bound. The point is that in making this statement precise, you actually have to estimate a commutator. Okay, and this is how the Lieb-Robinson bound is used to prove this. So it's a direct consequence. It follows in three lines. Sorry. Is there a minus size? So it goes to zero. So it goes to zero and t goes to infinity? Thank you. Yeah, there's a typo. Yes, yes. Thank you. There's one minus too many. So this minus is too much. Yeah. Again, it's a light curve, right? Yeah. And coefficients are the same as in previous freedom. Yes, yes. Yes. Okay. So the difference is maybe this C is different or. I don't even think it's different. You see, the proof is really easy. I said it, I mean, I wasn't talking about it, but so what do you think? Yeah, okay, that's what I think too. Thank you. Okay, is there another? I mean, is there have two operators, A and B? Here we don't have B. Let me sketch the proof because I think that'll be most convincing. The derivation of this from the Libra. The derivation of this from the Lieb-Robinson bounds. Okay, so I write the partial trace as an average over unitary conjugations of integrating over the HAR measure. You know, there's this formula for the partial trace as an average over conjugating by all unitaries, right? So I have u star on the left, u on the right for this a sub r of t. And then for a of t, I can do the same just putting u star u. same just putting u star u u star u because they cancel each other so i have the average for both then and then by linearity i get sort of an integral here u star u a minus u star au and then i can estimate the throw the u star away you get a commutator with the unitary commutator with a unitary well you know the unitary has norm one in the leap-bobinson bound same constants um like bruno said and then that's it And then that's it. So, this is slightly more subtle if the space that you're working with is infinite dimensional. And then Bruno worked out the correct extension of the partial trace with, I think, with Bachmann Michelakis-Sims. But in the case where it's just a spin system, this is just a partial. Just a spin system, this is this is just the partial trace. Thanks for the question. Are there other questions? Okay, so this was just an example of a corollary. I like this because maybe it's not super obvious how to use commutators. Of course, we know commuters have to do with simultaneous measurements of things, and so they're maybe baked into quantum mechanics. So they're maybe baked into quantum mechanics, but this is also very clear in what this is saying, right? And there's no commutators in this, it's just very clean. Okay, so the main message of this first part was supposed to be that Lieb-Robinson bounds are an extremely versatile analytical tool. It's one of the few tools we have for analyzing many body lattice systems, many body lattice systems that, you know, let's say we have really on a lattice, not on. We have really on the lattice, not on the complete graph. We talked about this earlier. And it has really been a critical tool for very in the very diverse fields. I listed some examples here with some concrete applications. And so why are Lee-Robinson bounds so useful? I mean, I tried to summarize it in this little line here. They really show how the fact that the interactions of the, you know, the datum of the theory is the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian. That's what's given. It has the interactions are defining it. And they have two properties: they're local and bounded. And then what you're trying to do when you're doing quantum dynamics is understand the unitary group. And so the Lee-Robinson bounds tell you that the locality of the interactions translates to the locality of the dynamics, right? I mean, this is a statement about locality of the dynamics. The light cone is a statement about the locality of the dynamics. The point is, though, you also need bounded, okay? Though you also need bounded, okay. Oops, you also need bounded. That's another input, yeah. But that's sort of a very high-level summary of the problems. Okay. There's some stuff going on in the chat. Okay. I just noticed. Is there something I should don't know? I think that was answered in the chat. Okay, good. Okay, are there any other questions at this moment? So, if not, this is what I want to say about the standard deep out symbols. Okay. So, I want to now, you know, I've emphasized this really a lot in this talk. There were two assumptions on proving this. The interaction had to be local and bounded. And, you know, there are many physical systems where at least one of these assumptions. Physical systems where at least one of these assumptions fails in long-range interactions and unbounded interactions, right? And you can ask what happens to the Leap-Robinson bounds if I drop at least one of these assumptions. Can I still have a Leap-Robinson bound? And so people have worked a lot on removing assumption A, by which I mean they've studied long-range boundary interactions. And this is of relevance, for example, because you want to study systems of Rydberg atoms. And this is, I would say, is essentially. I would say has essentially been resolved. I think it's a great example of continued significant progress over about 10 years. And there are references from the last year, I would say, that really have nailed down what's going on. And basically, the short summary is not the subject of this talk, Long Range Interactions, but the basic summary is this. You get a light cone. You get a light cone up to a nice Leibronsenbound, nice light cone, same thing as we've been discussing if the interactions decay sufficiently rapidly. Okay. And sufficiently rapidly means slightly more than 2D, where D is spatial dimension. So say you're in Z D. And then between roughly D and 2D, the light cone gets worse. You still, the light cone becomes curved. It's like a square root light cone, it gets bent. Light cone, something, you know, it gets bent. It's not really a cone anymore, it gets bent. So it's like vt to the one-half minus distance or vt to the alpha. And then at some point, as you, as you reach, I think d plus one, then it's gone completely. So you have a transition. You have a transition regime. You have light cone, really fast decaying, no light cone, too slowly decaying, not integrable. And in between, there's some kind of a light cone exponent interpolates. Okay, that's that story. Okay, that's that story. That story is not what I'm talking about today. I'm going to be interested in removing the other assumption. The other assumption is the assumption of bounded interactions. Now, if you're used to spin systems, you might say, what interactions would be unbounded? Well, the most natural lattice gases that have unbound interactions, I would say, are bosonic gases. So the Bose-Hubbard model is the most natural example of this. Most natural example of this. So here's the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. So I consider a system of bosons on a lattice, you know, system, lambda, and I have creation annihilation operators at every site. And I call these Bx and BY for bosons. And then I have two kinds of terms in the Bosn-Hubbard model. I have a hopping term, and there's a hopping amplitude Jxy. And this is, you know, tip to say an example of Jxy. is you know typically say an example of jxy is just nearest neighbors that's this delta x sim y supposed to just denote nearest neighbors and then i have a potential term that's just the local on-site potential it only acts for products that are at the same site and it's typically repulsive doesn't have to be but it's often repulsive and here's a prototypical example of the potential is a quadratic potential as soon as you have at least two particles at a site they repel they don't want to be on top of each other They don't want to be on top of each other. And then you have the usual minus mu times particle number. I just put that into the V. I have a chemical potential. So the Bose-Hammer Hamiltonian has at least two non-commuting parts. I have something that wants to be delocalized, the hopping. Its eigenstates are plane waves. And I have something that wants to be localized. This local potential just wants to pick the optimal particle number that comes out of minimizing the speed. So I have this competition, and the Bose-Hubbard model shows phase transitions. The Hubbard model shows phase transitions between a superfluid and a mod insulator phase, depending on how the parameters play out. Okay, so it's two fundamentally different physical phases, and it's a very paradigmatic model for the modeling the transition between these. Okay, and it's bosonic, and that means the number of particles per side is unbounded. That's the key. The number of particles per side is unbounded. So nx, and therefore also bx and by all have operator norm equal infinity. Norm equals infinity. Okay, the operator norm is equal to infinity, so everything I've said before does not work, right? As soon as the operator norm is there, the standard proofs don't work. But it's still lattice gas, and people have observed the Robinson-type light cones in experiments with ultra-code bosons and optical lattices. And you know, it's a question: how does one prove this? Okay, so that's that's the model. Okay, so that's the model we'll be talking about for the rest of this talk. This model in the box, the Bose-Hubbard model. Okay, is the model clear? Okay, so BX, dagger, and BY, bosonic creation annihilation operators. Nx is Bx, dagger, BX, and the bosonic number operator. Okay, so let me go to the next slide. I have a short sort of summary of the state of the art and what are the main challenges. So people have looked into this problem about 10, 15 years, since about 10 to 15 years. So the main issue is that Lieb-Robinson bounds can be proved, but only for very special initial states. And roughly speaking, the absence of particles helps. Roughly speaking, the absence of particles helps you. So, that is because you know the number operator is unbounded, so it helps if you have few particles. Just a second, Marius, if I may interrupt you. There's a question in the chat. Maybe I can read it to you, but you may also read it yourself. It's the terms that couple two different sites together whose norm matters, right? That's correct. That's a good point. That's a good point. That's a good point. This was, I don't know when this was first observed. I know a paper by Bruno and Bob Sims that observes this where you show that unbounded local terms don't matter at all. That's correct. So thank you for the question. That's a good point. This slide should be amended with an asterisk to include this, really. Yeah, that's a good point. So on-site. So, so on-site, anything can happen because on-site doesn't move things. Yeah. But thanks for the comment. That's valuable. Okay. Any other comments or questions at this point? Okay, so from looking at the literature, it's a quick question. Sorry to interrupt. Just a quick. Uh, sorry to interrupt just a quick. So, you know, the distinction between long and short range that you talked about, you know, classically, the classic in classical physics, if, for example, the exponent of the potential is like one less than the dimension of the space, it's short range. Otherwise, it's just Gauss's law, right? You can just tell as you go to infinity, is the effect, does it diminish or not? Here, you, if I, if I heard you correctly, you say it's two times the dimension of space? Yeah. The dimension of space, yeah. I agree, it's kind of is there some uh, I don't understand the long-range situation well enough to really comment on that. Um, that I understand why this particular exponent comes out. I think people have constructed counterexamples also first. So, there's two sides of the story, right, to a phase diagram. That you construct counterexamples, you show that there are models that have modes that propagate at certain speeds and maybe. Certain speeds and maybe with certain light cones. And then you show in general if you know if the interaction decays like this or faster, then you also have a light cone in general. And I think the best way to understand your question would be to understand these modes, these sort of counterexamples that limit the existence of the light cone. I don't know, for 3D over two, right? And see why they, but I don't understand them well enough to sort of give a short, you know, interesting. Thank you. To know, interesting, thank you, yeah. But I agree, I agree. Also, I think it's a good question. I think it's a good point. I don't think it's obvious a priori that there should be a transition of 2D. I don't know if it's 2D plus 2 or 2D plus, I think 2D plus 1 of all things, because precisely because the main threshold is usually integrability, like you're saying. Or summability. Yeah. Okay, if not, then the main challenge always seemed to be to control positive density states, right? So states that have a bunch of particles sort of everywhere in space. And an example of a simple state that has positive density everywhere is a mod state. Or I mean, in general, what's a mod state? A mod state is you just take the local vacuum. So zero is the vacuum and you put a bunch. Vacuum, so zero is the vacuum, and you put a bunch of bosons on side X, and ν X are the occupation numbers, and then you tensor those together. So, this is a tensor product state. And then, of course, you run the dynamics on this. So, immediately, the tensor product structure is immediately destroyed, but you may start from this initial state. And this initial state, you know, you can put, for example, the new x's to be all the same number, say all two for all three. And then the methods don't work because so far you always needed some kind of empty. Always needed some kind of empty regions. Okay. Or control on the density. Well, anyway, let me go through some of the literature that existed on bosonic Liebrobinson bounds. The first paper is not really a paper about the Bose-Hubbard model. It's a paper about oscillator systems, but I mention it here because these oscillator systems are also unbounded. So this is a paper by Nachtegalegas, Schlein, and Sims, who proved Lee-Robinson bounds or sort of certain. bounds or sort of sort of anharmonic oscillator systems. And there you also need a different proof because the interactions are unbound. So then the next paper in this story is by Isaac and Gross who constructed certain unbound interactions where information does spread super ballistically, by which I mean there is no light cone. The light cone is broken. You can break the light cone in certain models with unbounded interactions. So that shows you this problem is a little bit subtle. So, that shows you this problem is a little bit subtle. So, you have to use the structure of the model a little bit, and perhaps also the structure of the initial state. Then, I think a seven-hold paper was by Schulch Harrison, Osper, and Isa in 2011. They proved the Lieb-Robinson bound for the Bose-Hubbard model when all the particles initially were localized in some finite region. So, there's some set X where all the particles are, and you go out here and you look, how quickly do I see something? And they show that it takes, you know, that there's a light code. It takes a, if the, if you. There's a light code. It takes a if your distance r it takes a time proportional to r that you see something. That's good, but of course it relies fundamentally on being no particles outside of this region exhibition. Okay, and then in the recent years this picked up a bit. Wang and Hazar improved the bounds there. Kuvaharo Zaito, I think, proved the first meaningful result of positive density. The price for them was that they had restricted the perturbations of a stationary state. State. But I really like that paper. Yunit Lukas proved a bound on, well, not on commutators, not on norms of commutators, but on, if you will, the expectation of this commutator in this mixed state. Okay. Okay. So this is some summary of the literature. Now I want to talk a little bit more about our first result. So this is just a recap of the Bose-Hubber to Hamiltonian and considering this on a finite subset of Zd now. So there's a dimension involved. So there's a dimension involved. And the first question we asked ourselves is: can we extend these previous results, in particular the one by Isaac et al., bounding transport, that previous result bound the transport into an empty region? And we're wondering, can we bound transport through an initially empty region? So you have full region, an empty sleeve, and then another full region. Can we extend the result to that? And the first result will do this. So I'm going to specify. You know, specify the key parameter now. The key parameter that quantifies transport are these hopping, we call them kappa coefficients. And what are they? They're just weighted means of the JXYs. The Jxy's are hopping coefficients. And I take this weighted sum of X. Oh, sorry. The sum is only over one of them. Excuse me. There's a typo here. It should be sup over X, sum over Y. Okay. X sum over y. Okay. Super x sum over y. It's a weighted sum of the hopping coefficients, but the main point I want to make is if the hopping coefficients have some decay, say bigger than, you know, decay like alpha, then this, we can, the result works if alpha is say bigger than d plus 3. Okay, so it's just quantifying the polynomial decay rate of the Hopping coefficients. Rate of the hopping coefficients. Okay. In particular, if you have nearest neighbor hopping as in the standard Bose-Hubert model, then this sum is just 2d times, you know, just the number of neighbors. So for nearest neighbor hopping, you can take any p. I'm wondering for up to which p is this finite? And so, you know, if this is just always two times d, then I can take any p. And a particular role will be. And a particular role will be played by the first one when p is equal to one, we call that vmax, and that'll be the maximum propagation speed. The point is clearly the range of the hopping affects the propagation bound. If you can hop very far, very quickly, the things spread more quickly, and this kappa specifies that. So it's a very soft assumption, very mild assumption. We have a bunch of polynomial decay in here. It's all okay. Okay. So here's the first theorem. That's the first. So here's the first theorem. That's the first result, joint work with Fopin Segai. And it's sort of a simplified version of it, but I think it fits better in the talk. So I take two observables. The basic idea is this should be like a Lieb-Robinson bound. Think of the template of the Lieb-Robinson bound. If you want to bound commutators, right? The first thing we have to give up on is bounding norms of commutators. That'll be too hard because we need to use the initial state. So we only bound expectations. So we only bound expectation. Oops, sorry. I don't know why this happened. We only bound expectation values of commutators in some initial state phi, which will satisfy some properties. Okay. What is the, I'm sorry, some of my mouse is very sensitive and it's jumping. What does the initial state satisfy? It satisfies that there are no particles inside some annulus. Okay. This Br minus B little R is this annulus. There's a little r and there's a big R, and I'm assuming no particles. And there's a big R, and I'm assuming no particles in the annulus for the initial state. And then I want to bound this. And I want to bound this. Well, first of all, there's a norm of A and a norm of B. We're used to that. Then we have the expected particle number. That's much better than the norm of the particle number. The norm of the particle number is infinite, but the expected particle number can be controlled. And then this should be like the light cone. So there should be some kind of light cone going on in here. Well, first of all, cone going on in here well first of all it's not going to be an exponential light cone it's going to be polynomial light cone and the errors will not by which i mean the errors will not be exponentially small they'll be polynomially small with this power p remember the power p i can take any p if uh i have nearest neighbor hopping for example so if i've nearest neighbor hopping then this is you know faster than any polynomial um and then here you see that there's a light cone condition that makes this small at vmax times makes this small if vmax times t is much less than two times the width of the annulus um so this is a space-time region where this is less than one right v max times t less than some distance this there's a region in space-time there's a cone and the only difference now is that outside of the cone the errors decay not exponentially but polynomial okay so this bounds uh transcript through this initially empty region so i have some observable a that's Region. So I have some observable A that's localized. Sorry, I should mention this also. The observable A is localized in the small ball, the observable B is localized outside. So the only way they can be connected is if things are transported through the angulus. Okay. So that's the first basically. Sorry. If I may ask him, so N is the total particle number, right? Yes. N is the total particle number. Yes, so you expect to meet this. Yes, so you expect this bound to, I mean, your bound explodes kind of with the total particle number. I mean, because probably you would like to test it on states where the last expectation value, which you wrote on the right-hand side, is proportional to the total particle number, right? Yeah, no, that's true. I mean, that's absolutely true. This is the main limitation of the bound is this point. Of the bound is this point, and of course, it shows you that you cannot put positive density everywhere else in space, um, because then this will right, right? So, at some point, you have to lose particles again somewhere, but it's the main point is that the transport is between these regions that are, yeah. So, let me let me understand, if we sort of, but but but you're not um, this is what I'm trying to understand. I mean, you're you're you're telling me, Amy, uh, you could allow. Uh, you could allow for particles outside the support of B. No, wait, wait, in inside, because B is somewhere there, right? Yes, right. You could allow for particles if we sort of outside this anonus. Yes. But with this expectation value, you would count the number of particles there. That's right. Yeah, that's exactly right. So you could also think of this, you know, as having two angles. If you want, you could add another. Having two annulus, if you want, you could add another annulus and say, maybe outside of another big annulus, I have to be empty, and then the bound would be more effective. But we don't need, you know, then it would be more clear why the bound in that scenario, the bound is clearly effective. But it's totally true that, yeah, we count all the number of particles all the way outside here. So, in which sense, because you were trying to make the impression that this is This is a step towards understanding that you have regions which are occupied, but then regions which are empty, and then again, maybe regions which are occupied. And in total, there's a total density, but with empty holes in it. That's not really, I mean, somehow what this bound is able to capture, right? I agree. We'll wait for the second. I agree. We'll wait for the second result. We'll be about that. This first result I view mainly as an extension of this proof by Isaac et al. that if you have stuff in a region and you go out and there's nothing outside, then you can control the Lee-Robinson bound and control the commutator. And I think this is an extension of that. It has its limitations. And I'll talk about these a little bit more on the next slide. A little bit more on the next slide, and then I'll get to the second result. So, okay, let me first comment: this is actually a more general version of this. We can allow for some particles inside the annulus, but not a fixed positive density. And we can also allow for unbounded observables by introducing appropriately weighted norms. But the main point I think about this result is there are three restrictions compared to the standard Lee-Robinson bound. First is we have matrix elements instead of norms. That's kind of to be expected. That's kind of to be expected, almost necessary. The second one is we have some mild restrictions on the kind of observables you can look at. Okay, that's maybe also necessary, but the main restriction is that there's there have to be few particles inside the androids. That's the main restriction. So, but then if these requirements are met, you have the Lieb-Robinson bound. You have it. So, basically, it allows you to, well, now you can go into any situation. Well, now you can go into any situation where these requirements are met and try to look at any kind of proof that uses Lebravinson bounds and derive the same thing, right? So here's an example of a consequence you can derive now if these requirements are met. That's similar to what we had earlier, that an observable can be locally approximated. So if an observable on some region, right, remember we talked about this version of the statement. Maybe I'll go back really quick. This was This was the statement that you got for the Leap-Robinson bound. Oops, where you control an observable by local approximation inside the light cone. And you can do a similar thing now in the same situation. If you're in that situation, you can do the same thing. You can take an observable and approximate it by a local version, but now not in the sense of norms, but in the sense of expectation values with this sort of polynomial light cone. This sort of polynomial light cone and with this n cost on the right side. Okay, so with all these restrictions, you get an analogous statement. So you can now try to go into like applications of this. And I think that's something we'd like to explore in the future. But for the moment, I think this is the status of that story. So are there any questions about this first result? Questions about this first result? So, can I just say that it would be mathematically very nice if instead of an annulus, you would have like two sets that are far apart from each other. So it would be like a generalization of the annulus. But you mean, but there's empty stuff in between. Well, you know, the definition in graph theory that you have like. Theory that you have like a set X and a set Y such that every point of X has a certain difference. I mean the lower bound on the distances between any point in set X and Y is something. Yes, that's a good point. Yeah, right. The annualists very convinced. I the annualists are very convenient in the proofs, but I do think there's a version of the statement. And you can apply this statement. Maybe I should clarify this. You can apply this statement also for such observables as long as there's an angulus that's empty between them. That's all we're using. We're not sort of using anything else about the initial state. There just has to be this empty angulus between them. But yeah, thanks for the comment. Okay, maybe let me get to remote. Okay, maybe let me get to remo uh result two because I'm actually I should ask how much more time do I have because I'm not entirely sure. I mean, we've been doing sort of questions along, so I don't know. Let me. You still have about, I don't know, 18 minutes, 18, 20 minutes. Okay. Oh, that's more than I thought. Okay. Is there a question in the chat? Question in the chat? Yes, one question coming in. So, does this result extend to continuous space? I'm just trying to understand this idea that if you have many, many bosons at one place, because of the snow, it spreads faster. So, I know standard models. Standard models, bosonic, I mean, bosonic theory has bosons. And it's continuous theory, but I mean, light con comes pretty much from the same reason. But in standard model, we don't know the superluminal spreading if we have too much matter in one point. So I'm very curious about intuition. Yeah, yeah. So all the Lieb-Robinson, I mean, of course, there's light cones in both theories, but they have a different origin, right? And the Lieb-Robinson-bound light cones. And the Lieb-Robinson-bound light cone really comes from the lattice structure, really, really needs the lattice structure. And you can really see that if you put a scaling factor in the lattice, on A, a lattice constant, and you send A to zero, the Leap-Robinson bound will explode. And very roughly speaking, here's a very high-level intuition for this. You know, momentum's bounded on the lattice. I mean, if you have free particles, momentum is bounded on the lattice. So maybe it makes some sense that. It makes some sense that even in an interacting model, propagation of modes is bounded on the lattice. No, even like, even if you think of one particle physics, right, there's not an obvious propagation speed for a single particle on a line. I mean, that even needs a lot of sort of discussion, even make sense of that. But on the lattice, I mean, on a 1D lattice, everything's immediately bounded because momentum is bound. I think we actually can do it later because I don't want to interrupt your talk, but I'm not sure I'm on the same page with you on this because I think the reason on the lattice is not the bounding of momentum, it's just the bound on the dispersion. And that's the bound of dispersion, which comes from lattice, is why the spreading is limited. While in continuous model, the dispersion, I mean, the slope goes forever. The slope goes forever. But we can talk about it later. Okay, but I don't want to interrupt your talk. I think it's super interesting. We can chat about this later. Yeah, yeah, that sounds good. Yeah. Thanks. I mean, it's maybe, you know, maybe I'm also misunderstanding it. I mean, I also don't, you know, my day studying the standard model are long gone. But yeah. Okay, let me maybe. Yeah, thanks for the question. Maybe, yeah, thanks for the question. Um, and maybe let me go on to the second result now. Um, and so the question: I mean, I mentioned these mod states, and Zimona asked about these mod states or general positive density states. And the question was, can we treat them if we? Oh, there's a point in the chat. Ah, yeah, it's a good point to think about the fact that the Robinson bound is just an upper bound. Robinson-Bauer is just an upper bound. Okay, so yeah, so can we maybe say something about the transport situation for general positive density initial states if we are a little bit more modest? If we take a, for example, a thermodynamic perspective and we only consider big clouds of particles moving. The Robinson bound controls everything, controls two observables. It can be single particles, single sort of, you know, fragments. Sort of, you know, fractions of entanglement, whatever. But here, the second result, we're going to study only macroscopic amounts. So how do we define macroscopic amounts? Well, we introduce an average or normalized local particle number. So the particle number in x is nx, but then the average version has a hat on it, and it's just the number of particles in x divided by the total particle number. So capital N is always the total particle. Number. So capital N is always the total particle number. And I'm going to use the notation for the complement, which is just x super c that'll that'll appear down there. And then I write dxy for the distance between x and y and psi t for the time evolution of some state psi zero. And then this is the second result. Then the second result, I'll have a picture on the next slide because I think it's a little hard to digest. But here's the second result as a formula. As a formula. So vmax is just the same as before. It's the sum of the jxy is times x minus y. So there's, you know, it's some number. So I take v slightly bigger than v max. So essentially v max. And then I have two fractions, eta and psi, and they should be between zero and one, actually. That's a typo. And so you should think of them as percentages. Okay. They can be like, I don't know, 60% and 61%. Don't know 60% and 61%, something like that. And then I'm assuming that my initial state satisfies this property. It satisfies that at most eta particles are outside of X. So say at most 60% of the particles are outside of X. Again, there'll be a picture on the next slide. And then I'm estimating the probability. Oh, and P, sorry, P is the spectral projector. P is the spectral projector. P is the spectral projector for this operator. So, right, it's saying the state is fully in the spectral subspace of N where this is true. And so then I look at the spectral projector for the average particle number in Y. Remember, Y is sort of far away. And I look at what's the chance of measuring more than, say, 61% of the particles in Y after time T. At time zero, this is zero, because, you know, at most 60% of the particles are outside of X and exactly. The particles are outside of x and psi is bigger than eta. So times zero, this is zero, and then for large times, this is bounded. And here, the main point is that I can take any psi zero that satisfies this, any initial state that satisfies this, which is a very weak assumption on the density. So let me go on the next slide and explain this in a picture. So here's the formula again. The assumption on the initial state is just that there's at most eta particles outside of x. Okay. X. Okay. So here's a here's this example again with eta is 0.6 and eta and psi is 0.61. So I'm assuming initially at time zero, at least 40% of the particles are in x, or conversely, at most 60% of the particles are outside x. In particular, at most 60% of the particles are inside y. Now, I'm wondering what's the chance that at some positive time I have at least 61% of the particles. 61% of the particles, I mean, that's the thing I'm estimating is small. So, what's the chance that I have at least 61% of the particles in Y? Well, if you think about that, that requires the transport of 1% of the particles from X to Y. And that takes time proportional to the distance. That's what the balance says. So the picture is always the converse of everything. I hope that's not confusing, but I like to put the physics in the picture, the bounds. The physics in the picture, the bound says what's not happening, the picture says what is happening, if that makes sense. The bound says particles don't go there inside the light code. The picture says, well, if T is small enough, then at most 61% of the particles will be in here. Okay, so that's the bound. And that's precisely that is a propagation bound for macroscopic particle numbers, but it's clearly. Um, but it's clearly sort of much more restricted than a Lieb-Robinson bound, right? I mean, there's many restrictions. First of all, I'm only counting particles, right? I'm not bounding commutators, not bounding general observables, I'm just counting particles. The second thing is it's only these macroscopic fractions. The third thing is I can't control, of course I can't, because I can only have some balanced propagation, but the chance that all the particles in the gray region that is not in the balls goes into YME. Is not in the balls goes into y immediately. That I have to allow for because you know there's no distance I have to play with here. I can just control how long it takes particles from x to go to y. So this is all, you know, I've tried to summarize this in sentences that explain this, right? The one way to phrase this, the transport of one percent or any fixed percentage of the particles from x to y takes time proportional to bxy. A macroscopic cloud of particles moves at most at speed vmax. speed vmax remember v is any number bigger than vmax so essentially v max um and the main point of the result is it does not require any constraint on the local particle density local particle density can be anything as long as this initial assumption is fulfilled which means this you know basically means x contains a macroscopic fraction of particles okay so so that's the result um i want to pause here and ask if there are any questions about this Because I think it's a little bit of an unusual phrasing of this. I mean, clearly, it's born out of the limitations in proving Lieb-Robinson bounds for the Bose-Hubbard model, but the desire to include general initial states. So there's some compromise that has to be made. And the compromise here is to go sort of to, if you will, to thermodynamics or statistical scales where you only talk about macroscopic fractions. So I'm going to wait for a minute to see if there are questions. Hi, I have a question. Is the exponent p minus one? So was it different earlier? Like, is that another compromise that you make? No, the p minus one is the same. So I can take any p that such that this thing holds. And again, there's a typo sup x on y. So it's that this. X some y, such that this thing is less than c with c independent of lambda. Which uh and for nearest neighbor hopping, I can take any p. So there's little compromise there, I would say, because especially because I think the nearest neighbor model is the most relevant prototype. Sorry, oh, compared to the for example, in this result, now you have a p minus two, right? So if you have like long-range interactions, then Like long-range interactions, then this is better than the Tommy Nanny equation. No, P minus two is slightly worse because it's yeah, yeah. But the one and two, I don't think they. Yeah, I honestly, I've never even really thought about that difference, the minus two and the minus one. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Cool. Thanks. Because, you know, think of. Cool, thanks. Because, you know, think of P, if you have nearest neighbors, you can take any P, then the difference is gone anyway. Yeah, yeah, I agree. Are there other questions? So one thing I want to remark, and it's related to a point Ramis raised earlier, is that the assumption on the J's, well, first of all, it's only the assumption on the J's. only assumption on the J's, not on the on-site terms. Well, we're already a little bit familiar with this from the other point about Lee Robinson about the on-site terms don't contribute. But the assumptions also, you know, it works the same way for, say, random interactions. And I think it would be very interesting. You know, we know many random models can lead to a suppression of transport. I think it would be very interesting to prove a better Very interesting to prove a better bound in a random Bose-Hubber model. Perhaps, even, you know, ideally, you would even think there's some localization so that you can take some suprema over T. Okay, so but let me just maybe wait, check again if there are any more questions. If not, I'm going to have a quick summary of the proof idea and then the summary slide. And then I guess I'll finish on the hour. Is that okay? I'll finish on the hour. Is that okay? Okay. Okay. So, what's the main idea of the proof? And this, let me focus a little bit on result two. I mean, the proof idea for result one is related. And the technique, okay, we just made up this term, is adiabatic space-time localization observables, ASTLOs. And they're inspired by techniques first developed, excuse me, for one-body sharing operators, by which I mean Laplacian plus V on L. By which I mean Laplacian plus V on L2 of R D by Michael Siegel and Albisafa. And what's the idea? Basically, the idea is that we want to dynamically track the local particle numbers outside of the light cone. We want to track the particles that made it out, even though they shouldn't have. We want to count the bad particles. Okay, and we want to see how this changes dynamically. And the point is, and I call this adiabatic because it's sort of in a smeared out way. We don't want to count particles in a discrete. Way. We don't want to count particles in a discrete way because we want to take a bunch of time derivatives. And for derivatives, it's bad if you have sharp things, right? Because they're not differentiable. So we want to count particles in a smeared out way on a long scale. Now, there is a secretly, there's a long scale on the problem, and that's the distance between the observables. Because if the distance is not large, the bound is meaningless, right? So you can think of the, there's actually, it's an adiabatic problem. Actually, there's a long scale in it. Long scale in it. That's the length scale of the distance between the supports. That's an important realization because it gives you a large parameter that you thought wasn't there before. There is actually a large parameter in it. That's the distance. And so that enables tools from what I would very broadly characterize as maybe like semi-classics or sort of tools where commutators can be small because you have a small parameter. small because you have a small parameter. So what's what's the what's this how's this as load precisely defined? Well so I take some cutoff function chi and this is the just example of a cutoff function. So it's a smooth function between zero and one that really is zero up until a point and then one up until from some point on and then I count particles that are outside of the light cone the smeared out way. So how do I do this? Well I have some sum over nx's. Some sum over nx's, nx are particle numbers, and I only count x's that are ignore the diameter of x, x's such that x minus vt is much bigger than d. That means the particles are outside the light cone. And I'm doing this in this averaged way. So I'm counting the fraction of particles that are outside of the light cone, but particles are just slightly outside of the light cone. I don't count them fully. Only particles that are really order D outside of the light cone, I count fully. Count fully. Then one needs to come with a okay, that's good, but then that doesn't work for reasons I don't have time to get into. But then you can, you have these spectral projectors. And these spectral projectors, basically the reason is the spectral projectors that we're looking at are also discontinuous things, right? So maybe now I have a good standard for particle number. This OSLO is a good smeared out particle number, but I have a spectral projector, so I need to smear that out as well, because the perspective projector is again discontinued. So then we Projectors again discontinue. So then we do another smearing. So I take another cutoff function, and to this OSLO, I apply, you know, just by the spectral theorem, I can apply a smeared out spectral projector, just taking a smeared out function using the spectral theorem of this OSL. Okay, it's just another, I mean, maybe it's a little bit harder to analyze, but it's, you know, it's the same idea. And then this is basically a smeared-out spectral projector and satisfies these important properties at time zero. These important properties at time zero, it's zero, and it bounds the quantity we want to bound. So now, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, you have the thing that you want to bound is bounded by this. I can subtract the value at zero for free, and then you see it's really bounded by the time derivative. So in the end, you want to control the time derivative. Okay, so I realize this is a little bit quick now at the end. This is the last slide of the proof, and then I have a summary slide. So basically, the point, let me very, very Basically, the point, let me very, very high-level summarize the strategy now. You want to bound the time derivative. In any, I don't know, in 80% of dynamical bound proofs I learned as a student, the idea is you bound the time derivative by itself and you apply a Gronwaul argument. And then you get an exponential bound. The Lieb-Robinson bound, the standard Lieb-Robinson about e to the t is proved in a kind of Gronwally-like way. It's a Gronwal argument in space-time, where you also track the support of the observables. It's kind of Observables. It's kind of a grown-wall argument. You have a time directory, you want to find the object itself again. Now, that's still the guiding principle here. It's not going to play out just quite so nicely, but what turns out is you can, when you compute the relevant time derivative, you find a leading term and a sub-leading term. S is a large parameter, S is the distance, and they're of the same structure. There is a self-similarity of the leading term. Of the leading term and the sub-leading term that's important. And you cannot apply a Gronwal argument. It's not quite so nice, but you can, when you have self-similarity, you can instead iterate. And in fact, that's a similar way. You can also think about the Gronwaw argument. You can do an iteration in space. Here, we don't do an iteration in space, but we do an iteration of derivatives. And this iteration is the key, and that leads to getting, you can iterate, it turns out you can iterate p times, and that's how you get the light code. P times, and that's how you get the light cone to the power p. This is, I think, too much to sort of take in. I just want to say the basic idea is again: you want to compute the derivative and find self-similar structures within the derivative, differential inequalities where terms are of the same type. And then once you have that, you can iterate. That's the high-level idea. The reason why we can compute, prove this technical estimate that I said here, that's the main work, is that we have an actual. Work is that we have an actually a small parameter that's the distance, and we use the Helfers-Hurstein formula and commutator expansions to prove this. I don't have time to get into this because I'm out of time. So let me just go to the summary. Summary is that we have two types of Lieb-Robinson type bounds for the Bose-Hubbard model. The first result was Lieb-Robinson bounds through an initially particle-free region to this empty annulus. That was more like a traditional Lieb-Robinson bound. It bounds a commutator. Bound and bounds a commutator, and it has many more applications more like the original Lee Broadens bound if the relevant restrictions are met. And the second result was a bound on transport of macroscopic particle clouds for general initial states. So sort of less, in some sense, less ambitious in terms of the actual bound, but more ambitious in terms of the initial states. This new analytical tool that we used are these astlows. Broadly speaking, I would say we view these astlows as a stand-in for truly monotonic quantities like entry. For truly monotonic quantities like entropy, that are useful in many dynamical proofs, they're sort of approximately monotonic. And therefore, they're more flexible. You can design them more flexibly. If you don't need full montanicity, if you only need sort of approximate montenecy, you can be a little bit more flexible in designing them. Some open problems. Well, it would be nice to apply a result to some bosonic analogs of situations where Lee Robbins and Bounds have been used. Maybe extend the result too, to not just study transport of parts. Too to not just study transport of particles but of other physical quantities, for example, entanglement. And something else I mentioned earlier is: I think it would be very interesting if any of these bounds could be improved in a model with randomness. Because there are models, spin models with randomness where you see versions of MBL. And I think it would be very cool to have sort of a bosonic version of this in this in a similar. In this, in a similar setting. I mean, some of this is known in physics, of course, but yeah. So, that's just because this is also a workshop on randomness. I also wanted to emphasize that so far our bounds do not use or hold in the same way for random things, but also I don't see how to leverage randomness. Okay, that's it. Thanks for listening. Thank you, Marius, for this very nice talk. There were a lot of questions already, I mean, but I Question already, but I see at least one other question in the chat. I think, Olis, do you want to raise this again? The one which has been postponed maybe for 10 minutes? Yeah, yeah. Actually, maybe Marius already answered it by this second result. So, my question was: again, if we have many, many bosons in one point in my very small region. My very small region. Does the spread of bosons will depend on this n on the number if we have like lattice? And my intuition from basically field theory says that we know in field theory, there is no way to make superluminal propagation by just adding up a lot of particles in one place. It's a kind of strict bound and comes from. bound and comes from you know symmetries and no symmetries from the structure of of propagator. So my question was if Lib-Robinson bound doesn't give us limit on transport, is it possible in this lattice models to make this like super liminal propagation? And probably a second result says no, you still have constant speed. Is that correct? Yes. Is that correct? Yeah, so there's, I would say, different levels of answer to the question. First of all, I'm convinced, but I mean, maybe unrightfully so, but that there is no superluminal transport in those Hubbard models, and that experimentally people have not seen it, as far as I'm aware. It's another question what we can prove. Right? So that's first of all, it's sort of about nature. But and then it's true that our second result gives, you know, it's Result gives, you know, in the sense of its applicability, gives a restriction on that. Yeah. Right. I mean, precisely to the degree that the mathematical statement applies. So yes. But, you know, there's, first of all, it only bounce particle transport. There's other physical characteristics that could spread very quickly. And it's also, you know, entanglement in certain situations can spread very quickly. It depends on the situation you're looking at. It depends on the situation you're looking at. I mean, we might also expect entanglement to spread very quickly in certain situations. But yeah, to the extent that the result applies, I think it says something. The second result says something in this direction. Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah, just a comment. I don't know actually any intuition about spreading anything else except of particles. So maybe there is interesting caveat, some quantities spreading superluminally, which I don't think there is any. Which I don't think there is any intuition. Yeah, thank you, Rez. It's a very, very interesting topic. Thank you. It's a great talk. Thanks. So, one more comment, maybe as a follow-up to this. I mean, you might also want to look at this paper by Isaac and Gross that I mentioned. I think it's like maybe 2010, roughly. Jens Eyes, yeah, I can send it to you too, but they prove they have an unbounded model, model of unbounded interaction that shows. Interaction there that shows superluminal transport. So I mean, it's sort of cooked up. It's a very special model, but it does have that phenomenon. It's not super complicated. It's not the Bose-Hubbard model, but it's another lattice model with unbound interaction. So I can send you the paper and it sounds like maybe you'd be curious about the mechanism there. Yeah, thanks. You mentioned in the You mentioned in the tokens 2011, right? Oh, maybe, yeah, yeah. So that could be, yeah, yeah, it's the one I mentioned. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. I'll try, I'll catch up on in the recording. Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Do I see any other questions from the audience? Actually, I cannot resist. I mean, so if nobody else has an urgent question. I mean, since you're motivated, the use of Lib Robinson bounds and the reason why one wants to, why one is excited about deriving these things by citing or recalling all these interesting results that, with the help of Lieb-Robinson bounds, it's basically a proof technique for relating gaps with intangible. With entanglement and all of that. Is there any in this bosonic business? I mean, is there any attempt or do you envision somehow to use these things anywhere? Yeah, I mean, good question. You know, I, so far, I mean, the second result, so the results are very different, right? There is second result. Right, the second result is physically maybe a little bit nicer, but it's less clear how you can apply it because it's not a bound on commutators. The first result is a bound on commutators just in the specific situation. So, you know, I've been interested in looking into to what extent can you take, well, so there's some more sort of applications that it seems like they could be made to work for bosons. And the first one is that. And the first one is that just that this corollary that you have observable that spreads and is no longer bound to the commutator, it's bound on the support of the observable. And then from that, and I think this is explained very well in the paper by Bruno with Sven and Bachmann, Michaelake is Naftagala Sims. They have this paper on how you translate Lieb-Robinson bounds into the Translate any Robinson bounds into this theory for
