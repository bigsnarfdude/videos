Okay, it's one thirty. Let's uh welcome to the afternoon session for the first day of the workshop. It's not a game show, but this is our lightning round. We're gonna have three 15-minute talks, 15 to 16, 17-minute talks in this hour. And then we'll do the same thing Tuesday and Thursday after lunch. This is gonna give you more opportunities for people to talk. For people to talk. Also, I should tell you that if you want room to work with other people, from three to five, where we usually have breakfast and lunch, that's going to be clear and we could use that room as well to have discussions. And of course, if this room isn't being used, you can use it also somewhere after dinner if you want. I think you're off to come here. I'm not sure. Okay, so our first lightning speaker this afternoon is Alfred Holmes from Oxford, and he's going to talk about work in progress on seven instantaneous. Progress on seven instantons and the channel construction. Great, okay. Thanks for the introduction. So, I guess I'm going to do something similar to what Daniel did five years ago and talk about some things that I hope to be true. So, I'm going to talk about a potential correspondence between spin 7 instantons on, say, the positive spinner bundle of a four-manifold and the ADHM. Yeah, yeah, sure. And the ADHM construction. So, the ADHM construction is kind of a theorem from 1978, kind of right at the beginning of, I guess, what turned out to be Donaldson theory. And this is a description of the instantons on R4. So, the statement of the theorem is that the instantons can be described purely algebraically. So, as in just in terms of matrices satisfying. In terms of matrices satisfying certain equations. So the ASD instanton equation is a non-linear PDE. So this is, yeah, that's kind of a non-trivial thing to say. So a picture for the ADHM construction is that you the solutions kind of look like this: where so this would be an instanton of charge 3. So, this would be an instanton of charge three. And so, you have kind of three peaks. And so, the solution is described by a pair T and P. So, T kind of corresponds to the position of where the peaks are, and P corresponds to kind of how concentrated the curvature is at each of the points. And then you require that the data satisfies the moment map condition. And this moment map just comes from the UK actually. comes from the UK action on kind of the sum of this space. What did you say T and P corresponds to? So T is kind of the position of the peaks and then P is kind of how concentrated the curvature is at each of the peaks. I mean this is definitely true in the case where K is equal to 1 and it gets more complicated when K is higher. So, the application of this to Donaldson theory comes from the work of Taubs, where if you have an instant ton on a manifold and the curvature is concentrated, then this instanton arises from kind of gluing in an ADHM instanton. So the picture is kind of like this: where if you have curvature concentrated somewhere on the manifold, then you can view. Somewhere on the manifold, then you can view this part of the instant on as coming from the ADHM construction. So this helps you solve the compatness problem in Donaldson theory, where if you have a sequence of connections, then you can, there's a problem where the curvature may concentrate at a point. And so this theorem allows you to just view this curvature concentration. Just view this curvature concentration in terms of connections on R4 instead of on your manifold. And so on R4, you have a complete description of the manifold from the ADHM, a complete description of the instantons from the ADHM construction. So you have a similar phenomena in higher dimensions where you can have bubbling along. Have bubbling along some subset of your manifold. And so there's a problem in the problem with the compactness of spin 7 instantons is that you have this bubbling along some subsets and you don't really know anything about these subsets. So this is kind of similar to something that Daniel mentioned in his talk. Daniel mentioned in his talk of an example of a trivial spin-7 instant on. And that's if you have a product manifold or a product of R4 times a four manifold where the metric has holomory contained in spin 7, then you can pull back connections on R4 to your manifold. You get a spin 7 instance on this manifold M. So it's kind of So it's kind of boring, but basically, you just have a kind of connection that's constant along X, but then you have the ASD instead on kind of on the R4 fibers. And then, so you could kind of equivalently describe this situation by instead viewing the Viewing the kind of trivial bundle of ADHM data over your manifold X, and then have a constant section S. And so this is kind of like an example of the thing that I would, or kind of a simple case of the thing that I would like to prove, where these pullback connections, I mean, it's just the same statement as the ADHM construction, but these pullback connections. But these buildback connections really correspond to kind of constant sections of ADHM data. And then if you had a sequence of such connections and you had this instant on bubbling, then the norm of this section would go to infinity. So this This is an example of this phenomenon where if this connection was singular, say at a point P, then the singular set would just be P times times X. But to study kind of spin 7 instantons in general, you kind of want a version of this picture, but where you can have this pullback connection change. This pullback connection change so it doesn't need to just be constant along x. And so one way of doing this is from the work of Hades, which is where if you have a connection on a bundle over the spinner bundle of X, then this connection can be decomposed into kind of horizontal and vertical parts. So the horizontal connection is on this kind of Kind of complicated principal bundle with structure group given by the kind of gauge transformations on each of the fibers. And then you have a vertical one form in this associated bundle. And then, so the theorem from Hades' paper in 2012 is that ASA spins ev an instant on if and only if it satisfies these kind of generalized. These kinds of generalized cyber-Witten equations. Here, this sigma is just something coming from the curvature of Q, where Q is the frame bundle of the spinner bundle. That's a good question. So, your eighth manifold is the total space of S plus of X. What's the spin seven structure on there? Is this theorem for particular spin seven structure or? Particulars from the seven structure, or? Yeah, so yeah, so in Hades Hapery comes up with the spin term structure. I think it's similar to the work done by Brian and Salmon. So X is any, what is X? Is it? Yeah, so it might not be a torsion-free. It might not be torsion-free. Free not be torn free, yeah. Okay, okay, so this is you don't need to be totally free to define any sort of equation. If you want it to be a critical point in the universe, then you have to worry about it. Thanks. Um, yeah, so in this picture, uh, we now no longer just have kind of the constant. Kind of constant connections coming from the pullback of something. We have a coupled system of equations for a connection on X and some section of this infinite dimensional bundle. So that's kind of one side of the correspondence that I would like to be true. And so there are some other Simog-Witten equations. Cyber-Gritton equations, which Alexander Darren and Thomas Wopolsky introduced in 2018. So these are the ADHM cyber-Grisson equations. So these are another example of the generalized cyber-GWISN equations. But here your spinners take values in the ADHM data rather than taking values in whatever. Yeah, whatever. Yeah, so in this example, the spinners take values in the connections on or for, whereas here we change it to the ADHM data. So then if you have the correct geometric setup, so you have kind of a generalized spin structure. So this is just a principal bundle. So, this is just a principal bundle that covers the frame bundle. Then you can write down some other cyber-witten equations, which are the ADHM cyber-Written equations. So we have our two situations where we want the solutions of we want there to be a correspondence between the solutions we'll need. Between the solutions, we'll need a map between the solutions. So, in the Donaldson-Kronheimer treatment of the ADHM construction in their book, they show that there exists this map R from the space of ADHM data into the set of sub-bundles of a certain trivial bundle over R4. So, this is the kind of actually bundle equipment. The kind of actual bundle equivalent to the grass manion. Yeah, and so they say that if you consider this map and you have some ADHM data that satisfies the moment map condition, then the connection on the bundle RTP induced by the trivial connection. Induced by the trivial connection will be ASD. And so this is more of an observation than a theorem, but in the setup of the ADH Hem-Cyber-Written equations, this map R lifts to a map of associated bundles over the manifold X. So this is just saying that this map R is equivariant with respect. Is equivariant with respect to the structure group of the spin structure used in the ADHM cyber-Griston equations. So kind of a picture of this is that if you have a connection A on this generalized spin structure from the ADHM Sybergen equations, and you also have a spinner taking values in the ADHM data. Values in the ADHM data. Then you can apply the ADHM construction, ADHM construction fiberwise on the manifold. And then this will give you a connection on the spinner bundle of X. So this is kind of a drawing of that. And so the conjecture is that R map solutions of the ADHM type. Of the ADHM type equation equations, two spins seven instantons on the spin structure on S plus. So kind of if you have just a map of associated bundles, and so you're changing the space where the spinners take their values. Then this should preserve solutions to the cyber-Written equations. But in this situation, it's slightly more complicated because we're also changing the horizontal connection. So then another conjecture would be that this is a map going one way, and the other conjecture would be that there's a one-to-one correspondence. And so this seems reasonable because in the when Donaldson Kronheimer talk about the ADHM construction, they give you a very clear way of going, say, from the connections to the ADHM data. And so in this case, the original ADHM construction would just be a special case of. Would just be a special case of this construction where you just take x to be r4 and consider the kind of translationally invariant solutions. And then some applications of this is so we had the incident on bubbling in the spin 7 case. And so you don't really know anything about this. So, you don't really know anything about the singular set. So, it could be some horrible, no-smooth structure or anything. But it might be possible to find kind of an approximation to the singular set, say X prime, and then consider these kind of ADHM side-bog-Guitton equations on this kind of nice smooth manifold X prime. Prime. And so, in much the same way as the ADHM construction describes the kind of singular instantons on R4, we might be able to use a construction like this to describe the limiting behavior of spin7 instantons. You actually know that XPRAM exists, right? You know that X is rectifier. Okay. I don't. But I don't um I'm not sure, but so okay, so then hopefully this should be kind of just an analogue to the ADHDM construction on four manifolds. Okay, so let's go.
