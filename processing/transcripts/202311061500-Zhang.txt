Sorry, I will probably cannot spend too much time to explicitly explain what is BSB dualities. And instead, I'm going to explain it by using examples and also spend more time to explain the questions I would like to consult. How do I turn the page? Oh, yeah. Okay. First of all, let me clarify my notation. The most notation is following the previous talk, except I'm going to use the Psi for additive character. I probably will not use that for the other parameter. Okay. I'm still considering in the number field. There's a laser pen. We have G won't be my G won't be Okay, okay, okay, okay. So I'm gonna take the group is defined over the number field. All the field in my talk is characteristic zero. And the A is for the ring of the adeles. Group B is the connected reductive group. The most cases are going to consider the split case, but occasionally I'm going to use the Causes split. So you also see the unitary group here. The special The special absorption group and the sympathetic groups we are already quite familiar, but in this talk, I'm also going to involve the simulated version and also the exceptional groups. Okay, and I already denoted H2B as closed subgroup. The H is for a smaller one. Let's say, for example, in the gangros per start model, the GGP case, I take the bigger group could be like the product of the orthogonal group, and also the H is diagonal inviting. Is diagonal in binding. We already see this example in Biden's talk. The pi is referring to the automorphic representations. Sorry, this is a tackle. The most cases is the discrete automorphic representation. And the F is local fields. So in my talk, I basically have two families. One family of the strongly tempered spherical subgroups. I'm going to show you the list very soon. And another family is the BSV duality. BSV duality. I'm going to explicitly show you what their duality. So I have two families of separate varieties. For each family, I'm going to ask the following questions. The global variant and also the local variant. For the global variant, we are interested about the period integral. So I have an automorphic form on the bigger group and I can integrate over the smaller subgroup. And I take the stars in certain cases, I may need to regularize it, but that is not the key. Regularize it, but that is not the key point for today's talk. And here, the chi is a representation for the edge, and later I'm going to use, I'm probably also going to use the CTA representations here. Thanks, Chen Yan's talk. She already explained the CTA series very well, so I will skip the details. The global question is: we are interesting, like, say, when this integral is not identically zero. Adding equally zero. So as the GGP, so it's the period like the previous examples we see. We take the G is the orthogonal, the product of orthogonal, like the branching problems. We know the global Gangler's per side conjecture tell us if this is not equal to zero, you need if and only if. The locally the multiplicities cannot be zero. And also you have the central value is non-zero. This is the global invariant attached for the Global invariant attached for the period. And the first one is more likely to detect the functionality property. If it's non-zero, have a necessary condition is your other parameter should be have a certain type. And for the GGP case, this is the most cases where I'm interested in like the generic other parameter. Later on, when we see the duality, the BSV dualities on the other steps, only the non-tempered other parameter is going to show up. I'm going to show you the example very soon. I'm going to show you the example very soon. So, that is the global questions. The local, we are interested about distinguish. The local multiplicity formula is referring to the dimension of the H aquino linear form on these representations. So here is the local problems. And we know this, we expected this multiplicity formula, the local multiplicity formula should behave well on the local other packet, like the GGP case. Like the GGP case, the GGP case, if you take the generic other packet, in this, I mean the other SL2 is going to be the trivial. Okay, and in that case, we know the multiplicity in the Vogue packet is going to be one, and you can identify the distinguished representation explicitly by calculating the local simplicity root number, which is that we call it the distinguished characters in the enhanced error parameters. Parameters. Okay, so that is the questions we would like to ask for both families. The first part is quite simple. It's basically just to quickly review some basic concepts and also the notations I used. So the Sephiroth subgroup. To consider the previous questions, you have to balance your representations and your subgroups. In a sense, like Your subgroups, instance, like okay, if your reputation is big, instance, like careful on the group dimension, like the generic representation, you have to take your you cannot take your H is too small. If you allow your rep, you cannot take your H is too small. If you allow your H is small or too big, you probably have to adjust your dimension of your reputations. So, in general, one canonical choice, we can take the H is to be the spherical subgroup. And that is, we mean the double cosets, the action of H. Double coset, the action of H on the flag variety has the open orbit. In other words, if you consider the double coset of the H and the Boreal, it's going to be finite, equivalent. Here are some well-known examples, like the symmetric subgroups. The group is fixed by the order two automorphisms, which is the involution. Also, the weighting model, in this case, RH is the maximum unipotent subgroups, and you can attach the regular. Attach the regular, the non-generic, non-degenerate additive characters on the unipotent, which is eigendenote by pi. The last case is the GGP. And we also have several well-known conjectures related to the spherical subgroups, like the GGP conjecture, the Perstadt conjecture, this is a quadratic extension over F, and also the BSV. And also, the BSV is a framework on the relative long-term program. And the BSV are referring to the Benziv Secular Artists and WNC-recent long paper. Okay, so this is our subgroup. And now let me explain the first keywords in my title. And also, the spherical subgroup is quite a large list. And the first part is we consider strongly tempered spherical. Consider this strongly tempered spherical subgroup. Let me explain what that means. I have split it as two cases. The first case, I consider H is reductive subgroups. And in this case, we required the metric coefficient of the temporary representation restricted on the H is integrable. Of course, multiple center, the intersection part. This is the integrable over H. The most cases are going to take you to the repetition on the G is of the trivial center. On the G is of the trivial central character, just to simplify everything. The second case is we may have the H is made not reductive, which is so-called the Wittig induction type. The Wittig induction type is going to arise from a smaller pair of spherical subgroups. I denote the G naught and H naught. The G naught is really referring to like as a Levy subgroup of G, and H naught is corresponding to the stabilizer of the Stabilizer of the corresponding degenerative weighting functions you already defined by using the new pattern orbit. I'm going to show you my examples very soon. So, that is the first condition to explain. Actually, this is to characterize the size of this dual group. If you're familiar with the GX dual, the dual group associated to the spherical varieties. So, in this case, roughly speak, this GX du is just a G. The GXG is just a G itself, at least the same, basically the same type. The second one is the one is we assume there is no type n spherical root. So this is quite a significant assumption. It's still so far, we still have no clear idea how to drop this one, even in the BSB's paper. Which is excluded the example is something like this: the GLN and the ON case. The GON and the ON case. This is the case we don't like. In this case, actually, they are not guaranteeing the representation going to be unique. The multiplicity, the local multiplicity you see in the previous slides is going to be one. It's not guaranteed this is a unique, you have the uniqueness for these separate subgroups. So if you want to get a canonical purity in a group globally, Canonical period integral globally. The another assumption is we have the extra assumption, is the rational open orbit is unique. Okay, so that's the additional one. If you have this one, conjecturally, we expect this is a Galfon pair, which is you're going to have the uniqueness. And then for strongly tempered, we also prove you're going to have the uniqueness for the working package, like the local GDP case. And also, if you have the assumption. And also, if you have the assumption plus this additional one, you're going to get the list. And we conjecture this list enjoys the same properties like the GGP globally and also locally. I will show you. Okay. So this is a list. Actually, I just listed the give the list the example of the lack of the attention, which is this is not a complete list. For example, I didn't. Not a complete list, for example, I didn't put the Whittig models or GGP or Schaleka models here because that is kind of like well-known examples. Um, the classification, this is also basically the complete list we have. In the following sense, the H is reductive. If you see the H is reductive, that's the first three case. Basically, two cases if you consider speed version. So, the first three cases, this is coming from the classification. Cases: This is coming from the classification of the Bravi and Pezeni's classification for the spherical varieties. You check the table, you can see quite easy to verify they are the only remaining strongly tempered spherical subgroups. And the last seven cases here, the four and five, the four is the causes speed version, the causes speed version of the version five. See, both of them are type A. Pay. For the 4 to the 10, they are the so-called WITIC induction case. So for the Wittika induction case, recently WITEC and his undergraduate student, Brian Wong, give very nice explanations and also the classifications for the WITEK inductions in the even orbital case. Let me explain what's the meaning of the even new quadrant orbit. Of the even orbit. If we look at the second and the middle columns here, I was using the partition like the 429. I'm using the partition to label the unipotent subgroup. The U is referring to the unipotent. So the unipotent subgroups here, this is the partition is corresponding to the new potential orbit in the Lie algebra. If you have the, we know this is the new partner orbit coming from this Jordan decomposition, which is the partition with. Which is the partition with a certain constraints. And then number 10 is coming, you can use a barcoder to label it. I'm going to explain that later, but let's go back to here. So you have this sequence of the partition. You can make the SLs to triple. You write the send a simple element to acting on the Lie algebra. This unipotent, Lie algebra of this unipotent is corresponding to the eigenvalue is greater or equals two. They are even means the The weighty tinky diagram is labeled by zero and two. You don't have one. So, in other words, the g1 the eigenvalue one space is zero. So, there is no Fried Jacobi coefficients in this list. I guess Emu is going to give a more detailed explanation later. So, I just stopped here. Okay, so this is the unipartiness subgroup. And for those unipotent, you're going to have a corresponding levy. You're going to have a corresponding levy subgroup, and the GO2 is a diagonal imbalance. Most cases, those levy part is corresponding to the triple of the GO2. So those case also can be considered as a induction from the triple product. Okay, so this is the, I'm going to give you a detailed explanations for atom 5. The last columns here is referring. Columns here is referring to the L functions involved. This is a representation for the due set. It's a symplatic representation. I'm going to use these symplatic representations when we move to the BSV view. Okay, and the last one, the last one, how do we get this E7? You're going to have a levy is SO12, is a type E6. Is a type d6. So you get that from the number 9. So that's the idea. You have how do you get the new point orbit for this u and to get the witty induction. This omega 7 is also the representation, is the representation of the dimension 56. It's a simpler one. And I use the simplicity simulated case for the G. The main reason is because I would like to take the To take the joint type for the on the group set. And in this case, you're going to have the multiplicity one, the additional assumption going to hold. If you replace your G to be the simply connected half, say for example, like the number six. This doesn't work. Okay, so. Okay, so sorry, I don't have the pointer. The number six, if you look at this GSP10, if you just remove the G, you just get the SP10. The other side is GL2 becomes SL2. Eventually, you're going to have a count in the similar issues like the SL2 in the torus in the SL2. Even in the boreal case, over R or over periodic numbers, the orbit is identified to the square class. So you have more than one. So, you have more than one open orbit. And then the multi-based one is going to fail. Even over the Roman five places, you may have like four dimensions. So, if it's globally, it's hard to say which one is canonical. The period integral is canonical. Okay, but over the locally, the question still makes sense, but it becomes more complicated. So, that's the first question that I gonna would like to ask. Like to ask. And this is slightly more details about the models. How do we use the unipotent orbit, on the potential orbit to associate this model? You have the partition 3, 3, you get this Jordan block, and the matrix AC is the, you can use these Jordan block to form the SL2 triple. The AC is the eigenvalue of 2 and the Value of two and the joint action, the B is the eigenvalue four. You don't have all the eigenvalues. The PSI additive character is just take the trace A plus C. And the levy here is the diagonal GO2, three blocks. And if you like the M acting on this unipotent, you have the stabilizer acting is on the computation. So you're the stabilizer of this character with. Of this character, we've the character is just the trace A plus C, and the stabilizer is just the GO2 diagonal. So this is what I mean, the triple product induction. And it's easy to check. You only have a finitely many double cosets, the unique open orbits. And this is called the Kinsburger-Ralis models. The originally, the connection with the period integral and also the Purity integral and also the local multiplicity formula is conjectured by Ginsberger-Ralis Jung. So that is all the others are similar. You can play the same rule to have the partition to recover the unipotent and then to get the model. And this triple, SL2 triple, going to play a very important role in the BSV view set. Okay, so let me explain the first Explain the first conjectures by calculating the unramified matrix coefficient similar to what we do for the refiner GDP, the Ichino-Iketa types calculation. You're going to expect the period integral square is related to the central value of this L function. The pi is the L function in the first column of the G. And the rho x is the symplatic representation we just see. Representation: We just see in the previous table. So the row x is just the last columns that is the type of the L functions. Okay, so this is a global formula. All the remaining are also very interesting. Basically, this type of the conjecture have two things. One is the local multiplicity. That's the necessary condition. The second one is the central value. This is the global environment you cannot see from the local. From the local properties. The other part is not that significant since it's coming from the normalization of the harmoniums and the osopheric varieties. It's quite easy to be computed. Okay, the next step, I'm going to formulate the local multiplicity formula. So in order to introduce the volume packet for this case, for these fair varieties, I also need the non- Non-causes split form. And for this case, because our reductive part H is only PGO2, so you only have two forms, either split or non-split, which is a quartener. The quarten I denote by B here. So correspondingly, I didn't take all the inner twist of the G, just the division version. And the quartener version. So which is the last column is. Last column is so the working package formally, you can, of course, you can involve all the inner twist, but here I the pure in the form for this spherical varieties, we just referring to these two groups. The one split or quasi-split, the other one is not split over the quarten. And the subgroup is also defined over F. If you replace the GL2 or GU2 by or GU2 by the D cross. So you also analog can have an HD variance for the GD. And in particular, if you have the GU4 or GU2 keys, it's much more complicated. You have more choices for the Hermitian forms over the real places, over the real field. Okay, so when we consider the When we consider the local multiplicities, it's not just involved the causes speed variant, but also the speed variant. You put the two L packets together, you get the multiplicity one. And also like the previous period integral, this is also not just for the Caucasus split version, but also for the quartening version. Okay, the same L because sometimes the L function are the same. And the point is the ramified. The point is the ramified part may have to choose the containers. Okay, okay, so this is the global version. Now, I think we are ready to explain the local problem. So, I have the list of the strongly tempered spherical subgroups. I have the globally what we expect. Now, let's move to the local, the local multiplicities by characterize everything in terms of the enhanced Launch parameter. Everything in terms of the enhanced lunar parameter. But later, if we involved the non-tempered RST packet, we needed the local RSP packet instead. Just to quickly review the notation I used for the local Laura's correspondence. So I take the WF prime is the weedling groups. So in the pi-atic conversions, I have the SL2. You will not see the SL2, the Wiggling S2. The SL2, the we didn't need SL2 high target only. The ones you see the SL2 is always referring to the other SL2 later. So in this case, it's slightly, I also take SD to be the component group of the centralizer. The vulnerabilities are union of the two forms we see. This is the cost determined by the group we are codes we are interested in. This is quite a This is quite roughly speaking to discuss the local Lancas correspondence. And the canonical batch action, of course, you need to determine the auxiliary choice of the Wittika data, how to normalize everything. But if you have the joint type, no such issue or concern. You have the one-to-one correspondence. So if you have a temporary repetitions, we use a pair, Lawrence parameter phi. Lawrence parameter phi and also a character on the component group. The one thing I have to emphasize different with the GGP is for the GGP case, we have the orthogonal, special orthogonal unitary and SP. For those kids, your component group is abelian, the abelian two groups. So this is always give you, once you're talking about the character, that is always a quadratic character, the chi, the representation is a quadratic character. But you already see in my list. But you already see in my list, I have the joint type. So in the two groups, you may have spin, you may have the E7. The component group is no longer in two groups. It's much more complicated. I guess you probably will see that in Ed's talk. So like say, for example, even for the G2 maybe in Ching's talk, even in the G2, then you may potentially have the S3. So the Kai is the The uh the okay, so the chi in general, the chi could be uh very complicated, but uh now let's uh answer the first case. Actually, I'm going to have the four cases for the local multiplicity. The first case is you do have the uniqueness, which is the rational open orbit is unique. So, you expect the volume packet to have the uniqueness, okay? And we do can prove if you sum everything, uh, we exclude the Everything. We exclude the real case. The first, I have to assume the local allowance correspondence. Of course, we didn't prove the local lands for the E7. And I need to assume the stabilities and the scores transfer. Everything is based on the local language correspondence. Because our data, the other set or the labeling is using the enhanced L parameters. So we need to assume the local language. And we also exclude the real case for the For the weighting induction case, the main reason is technical issues for the multiplicity geometrical multiplicity formulas. But for the periodical case, we do have this summation. The summation, the first family, the first sum is over the quasi split. Okay, the second one is over the quaternions. The summation is multiplicity one. Also, from this multiplicity formula, Multiplicity formula, you can see I also including the dimension of the chi here. The chi is referring to the representation for the component group. In the others, this is immediately give us if you vary something like the representation for the component, like the two-dimensional representation of the component group or three-dimensional component group, no worry, it won't show up at all. The multiplicity is equal to zero automatically by the unit case. So, in other words, if you are looking for the distinct If you are looking for the distinguished representation in the L packet, you're only looking for the characters in the component groups, maybe not quadratical character. We cannot see that from this statement. Okay, so that is the multi-base one for the vulgar packet. Then the second question is, there could be many elements in this vulgar packet. So the second question is, which one? So which means which card? So, which means which chi, which representation of the component group is our distinguished representation corresponding to the distinguished representation. So, I'm going to denote that is omega 0x. I'm going to explain that very soon. Another reason I'm going to explain a more general version, which is remove this additional assumption, which is you're going to expect the right-hand side is no longer one. It's probably the number of the The number of the open objects, the number of the rational open objects, like the power of twos. Okay, so this is what we expect for the general. And in that case, this character, the chi, could be dimension bigger because I lose the constraints on the right-hand side. It may not be one. So the previously, this dimension chi could be anything in general. In general. So, in that case, this distinguished representation wouldn't be much more complicated. So, let me show you how do we do that. Also, inspired by the BSV's framework, how do we explicit the conjecture of the multiplicity formula? I'm going to assume the role for the as a split case. If it's quasi-speed, it's much more complicated. If it's causing speed, it's much more complicated. So, I'm gonna recall one concept, which is a BSV is called anomaly-free. So, this is a purely Lie algebra statement. Everything is a complex, complex, finite-dimensional complex representation. So, it's very easy to check and verify. We have a symplatic representation, which is our case for the dual group. We're going to call it normally free, basically, have two assumptions. Two assumptions, the two conditions. The first one is we can split the norm, split the weight. The T is a torus, maximum torus for the dual group. Sorry, I forgot the L yeah, this is correct. Say the T is the L T is the torus in the L G in the dual group. So I split the weight as a positive weight and the this due. You always can do that because you have a symplatic representation. So this condition is a double. Repetition. So, this condition is a damage for the splitter torus, but it's not trivial for the cost split case. The second one is basically asking: I was able to take the square root of the characters. So the second one is I have a lambda. We take the determinant, the capital lambda in the condition one. I take the determinant of the capital lambda. It's just the different with a width. The difference with a width of t is biosquared. Sorry, the different theta is a character for the whole group G. So it's a global, is a character for the whole group. And the difference is a square of the torus T and other weight. So it's basically you can find the determinant of the lambda. You can find a character on the G. Sometimes most cases are probably trivial. If you can, you can think in, there is nothing to lose you thinking in the CTA just trivial because I. You thinking in the CTA just the trivial because I can take the Lg to be the simply connected groups. All the characters are trivial. And then the determinant lambda just can take the square root, which is chi. I need this chi for the later definitions to define the distinguished character. Okay, so that is normally free. And we have the, and now I need to use this concept to extend this concept to the endoscopy triples. Triples. This part is a little bit technical, but later on, I'm going to show you explicit examples. So I'm going to go through this roughly quickly. So I have a semi-simple element in the dual group. And you're going to have the NSCOV triple, which is a G prime, such that the G prime is have an inviting into the centralizer of the S. And then you're also going to get originally we have the representation, symplatic representation. The repetition symplatic representation of Joule, then you can get a symplatic representation for the dual of the G prime. And the repetition, we denote a repetition is V. So the Vs minus is just the eigen space, the eigen space with respect to negative one, the eigenvalues. So that is a particular space for the S. And if you restrict your row into these VS manners, you're going to get asymptotic repetitions. asymptotic repentations for the Lg'. The point is why we are interested about this is you want to define a distinguished representation for the component group. So you need to give a values for each semi-simple element here. And then if proof they are independent with the choice of your S prime is only depending on your component groups. So that's where we are going. Okay, so we have the anomaly free which is and ends up we need this for all the endoscopic triples. For all the endoscopic triples. Okay, those conditions are purely algebra. And once we have this, we can define the character. The story is quite complicated. The since it's because based on the conjecture, the representation should be factored through the gx view, not the dual of the g. So they are slightly different because they may have. Because they may have, like, for our strongly tempered case, they may have the same type, but the one could be the simply connected, the other could be the joint. Maybe have a slogan difference there. So that's why I need a lift. If I have a parameter phi prime for the gx associated to the spherical variety, that's usually arisen by quotient center, something like that. Center, something like that. And also, in this whole definition, I don't need to assume the unique open orbit. I only need the strongly tempered without type M. Okay. And for we define the character for each S. This is coming from the row X, which is the symplatic representations you see in the list. And you have restricted to the eigenvalue of negative one space. I compose the embeddings eta L. Inbidings eta L and then compose the lifting of the characters, the parameters, and then you do everything, normalize the negative one. The negative one is the matter is depends on, this is kind of like the normalization, it depends on negative one belongs to the square class or not. So it's to make everything correct. And this is a characters we expect. This is actually. Expect okay. This is accurate defile character, defile representations, and you can show this is uh the most cases you can show this is the independent of the choice of your lifting, which is five zero, and also depending on the choice of your and scopic triples, and eventually give you an actual character, actual representations for the component group. And if we apply to the multiplicative one case, basically everything is gone, you don't have the gx. Is gone. You don't have the gx. It just simply gives you the g the dual of the g and it's not that complicated. Like everything, almost everything is gone, and you only have you directly get a character here, not a representation. A quadratic character. Yes, yes, exactly. That's for the you coming from, okay, that's a good question. From okay, that's a good question. I didn't, you know, the rule x is determined. How do I okay? The rule x is not what we choose, is computed from the spherical variety. So once you give g, you give h, you compute the matrix coefficient of the g restricted under h, then you get this steal function. The real x is the outcome. Yeah, yes, exactly. Very good. So in this case, So, in this case, the LGX is the same as LG is the same as LGX because for the other joint type. Yeah, so that's why you don't have the libid issue at all. Okay, I'm going to show you one example very soon about the SL2 case, so you may see the slightly difference. But the things we are interested in is like when you become, you have the SOG involved, like swap the simply connected and the joint tab. Next and the joint tab, the multiplicity goes to bigger. So the whole multiplicity formula is, I cannot, okay, yeah, the whole multiplicity formula is going to be more complicated. So the formula is, I have, I constructed the character, but that character is for the lifting, for the gx. I need to go back to the g again. So then this is also. So, then this is also. I need to lifting one more time. And you may have the lifting is definitely not unique. You may have many choices of the lifting. And then you have the pushback of the characters. So not everything, the pushback, I mean here, you have the phi prime tilde, which is induced from the phi prime, the different component group. And this gives you a map from the component group of the phi prime. From the component group of the phi prime go to the component group of the phi. So the one side is the gx du, the other side is the g du. So this map is may not be injective or subjective. I can give you the both examples. And so this induced representations could be much bigger. So when you calculate the multiplicity, basically you calculate all the characters occurs in this induced representation. This induced the representations. The characters we defined in the previous omega is only defined on the image, a subgroup, a representation on the subgroup of the S phi. But you want to do the induction, you can get the whole whole thing and take the sum over all the possible liftings. Okay, so that is a general formula for all the strongly tempered case without have any roots. And if you have the multiplicity one, To one, uh, the lifting is unique. The basically, everything is just one. The nothing else, this part is the induced is just omega prime itself. So, the omega is just exactly the quadratic characters you are looking for. Okay, maybe I can explain an example is easier to have everything. So, this is an example for SL2 and GL1 over Q5. The five is model for you. Q 5. The 5 is module 4 equal to 1. So the negative 1 is going to be a square. I don't need to worry about the epsilon theta negative 1 here. The evaluation on the negative 1 is always a 1. And the character, the repetitions, the character, the L parameter on the SL2, the do set is PGL2. But you are not, you have to lift into the SL2. And the SL2, that is our GX2. Is our GX2, and you know, this is simply connected to the PGL2. And the lift thing is not always exist, it exists if and only if the central character is trivial. So that is well-known conditions. And in this case, your component group have three cases. It could be one, two, and four. The case for the by and the root x is just. And the loot x is just the two standard, the two copies of standard representation of the SL2, which is the two symplatic representation. It's still symplic. And your row x, your s, your semi-simple element is basically only have two cases, either whole group or the negative one. And in this case, your eigenvector space of the negative one is either empty, either zero or just as a whole space. As a whole space. And for this case, the character we defined as just a trivial. The induced representation is just as all the representation of S V. And the lifting is just depending on 4 over S V. I was taking the 5, so the square class is exactly 4. This is the 4 over S V. So if you calculate If you calculate the regular representation here, multiplicity is always one. And the dimension is exactly equal to the multiplicity is exactly equal to four over the size of the L packet. And in this case, it's quite interesting. You can think about two exceptions, two special cases. The one case is if you have a IRA. is if you have an unramified representation, the unramified representation, the generic unramified representation of SL2, the component group is trivial. So you only have one element here, which is unramified. And if you plug into the formula, you get 4 over 1. So the multiplicity is 4. The 4 is exactly corresponding to the number of the rational open objects, the square class. So that's my Square class. So that's multi-base is four. You have another case is cardinality is four, which is the say, for example, the depth zero representation. You have two non-conjugate maximal compact subgroup of SL2. You put the smallest cascade representations. The cascade representation of you have two of such representation. The dimension is q minus one half. And then you have the combination, you have four representation. They stay in the same. They stay in the same L packet. And in this L packet, each of them is unique, have distinguished which multiplicity one. So that's why you added all of them together, you still get four. So that is two extreme cases. And if you want to answer the questions for the strongly tempered, this is a question is ask more about. More about our understandings on the component groups, the endoscopic structures. So, which is a question I would like to ask for the local case, the second part, which is if I have a strongly tempers trying to figure out what all the possibilities that we have here. The formula here is actually suggested from the Wasper G's approach to prove the local GDP by using the geometrical multiplicity formula. Using the geometrical multiplicity formula of the relative choice formula, once you reduce to the endoscopy tab, basically you have to solve the linear system, the system of the linear equations. And this is the formula suggested. But all the environments we introduced here is making the logically perfect. But say we don't know exactly, can you explicate what is SP and SP prime? Say, for example, I don't know what's the answer for the E7. Like, what's the all. The E7, like what's all the possible component groups we can have, and of course, you can thinking like take a compact subgroup in the duke group and consider the centralizer, then take the component group, and you can calculate, enumerate everything. But another question is going to be like, how do you know this, those kind of components do give you a L parameter? How about such no, there is no, you do have such component group, but there is no L parameter too. Parametric to associate. That's, of course, if it's a unipotent representation, the all the component group arrays from the unipotent orbit, you definitely have lost construction. You definitely can get such a parameter. But how about the others? So that is more like the refiner structures we asked, not just for the exceptional groups, but also like for the spin case or the PGSP case. Spin case or the PGSP case following Shui's thesis, we do need more refined what the SP is even for the orthogonal group, even for the classical group, the SP is not RB2. You can easily get like the two groups, but not RBI, the central extensions from the important orbit. And also, even you know the structures, you still have to know what's the possible lifting. What's the possible lifting of the L pyramid? What's the possible lifting of the L parameters? And eventually, not just for the generic L packet we discussed here, but also how about the non-tempered other packet for those strongly tempers, like the local GGP for the non-tempered case, the branching law problems. I guess Kyrian is gonna tell us more about the non-tempered local GGP. The non-tempered local GGP, and which is we can ask the same questions for the generic packet, we already have the similar phenomenon. So, how about the non-tempered case? So, this is the second layer about the local multiplicities. But for these questions, we still ask more refinery questions on the aniscopy data. Later, let's take the BSD view. So, so far, so good. Good. Okay, now let's take the BSV view. I will not record the full definitions. I just show you the list. Okay, so here is a story. The table on the first one and the third one you already see. And the idea is following. You have a sympherical subgroup on one family. You get a symplatical representation on the dual z. So you get the relations about the purity growth. One side of the purity is on the G. One side as a period is on the g, the l function on the dual set, and as a bsp due, roughly, you have another pair, which is I can take the period integral on the g hat. The g hat is the due, but not over the complex number over the Rs. You can take the period integrals for the g hat. And the rule X is going to give you a symplatic representation, which is going to give you a theta, the way representations are on the big groups. For example, For example, the first one, I'm going to take the adjoint form for the G. So it's PGL6, the dual group is going to be SL6. And you plug in the rational point. Everything is split, defined over Z even. So I just plug in the ideals over the number of fields. And that is the automotive form we live down on the SL6. And you consider the exterior cube of the SL6. That gives you a map from the SL6 to SP20. The SL6 to SP20, right? The simpler representation. And you take a W representation on the SP20 cubed, of course, and then you use that big theta to integral with the caspet of SL6. Okay, so that is the purely integral you see in the bottom. So that is our big theta is the CTA series defined in Defined in Cheng Yan's talk, but I was talking about the SP20s here. Now this is just the unitary. So this is a period integral, and which is suggested by the BSP. And you can do the similar things for all the other cases, because all the other cases rho x is sympathetic. The phi x is the critical values you're going to relate it to the other set, to the L function set. This critical value is essential. The critical value essentially is given from the G. So the second family of the equation, purely group and the L function, just swap the data. Okay, so in this case, if you want to see the non-vanish, you cannot take the group is too big. The repetition is too big. The group is fixed. Now the initial is over the g hat. Okay, the g hat is not a big group, but now it's a point as we consider over there. Neither point is we consider over there number field. And let's just assume everything is trivial central character. This is the integration. So for this integration, you definitely need to normalize. But if you want to get an advantage conjecture, you probably need this phi to be the residue of the SSN series. Not as a caspet. The caspet may not give you the zeros. And also, not all the cosmetic are going to give you. Cospital is going to give you the non-zero purity integrals. You have to satisfy pi is not necessary, cospital, it's only discrete. I mean, you can, but you're going to get a zero. Okay, that's a problem. Conjecturally, you're going to get a zero. Yeah, yeah, conjecturally is zero. I'm going to show you why. Now, the second question is to let's move. Why we say I don't expect to. Say, I'm going to expect to the reserve representations here. So I need the certain constraints on the pi. This cannot be n in pi, give you the meaningful information. Let's see what kind of the other parameter is going to show up. So this is how I use another SL2 using the unipotent orbit on the G side. On the G side, I already have the partition. I just pick up the remaining six cases because these cases. Cases because these cases your reductive part is H0, all of them are corresponding to the rank one, the coziness of choice formulas, the rank one weighting models, the SL2 weighting models. So that's why we put all of them together. How do you get your constraints on the other type, which is the others SL2? It's not all the representation of the others SL2 show up. That dimension of the SL2 is coming from the on your. The SL2 is coming from the onyopotent orbit. Okay, so this is everything is on the dual set. The three square is giving you the representation of SL2, which is a dimension. This is corresponding to the new point of it to the B square. That is complete a SL2 triple in the dual group, right? So that is what we need. The three is what we need. So following KS talk, you had you already see the V D there. You already see the V D there, the same B. So now this is the image, the invitance of the SL2 to the GC. This SL2 triple is corresponding to the new partner orbit. You do have the centralizers for this SL2. You pick up the view of this PGL2 part. So that is our H0. So now you have the investment. So now you have the embedding H0 with SL2 embedded on the G. So this is the due set of the G hat. So everything is over C. Now that is going to give us the condition on the other pyramid. Now that is the first part, which is if you want a period integral is the oh, sorry, I type is non-zero twice. It's non-zero only if the other parameter is factor. Other parameters factor through the L to X we just defined. And from here, you already can see this is definitely non-tempered one. Your B is quite big. Your B is here is coming from like the partition 3, square, 4, 3, 4, 6, and so on. So your SL2 is definitely not trivial. So you're only interested in, only the non-tempered one interested. Interested. Okay. Okay. And then the second part is give you the period integral, the L functions involved. The L function is basically the adjoint L functions for SL2 because your two group is PGL2C. So that's a parameter you have. And the lifting is coming from the SL2 to the other. So that's the rank. That's the group you. Rank that's the group you can do the comparison. That's why we have the costness of trace formula and the top, which is critical values. No worry, all the critical values greater than one. So it's always non-vanish. And then the global invariant here is different with the previous case, which is you have the central value, could be zero or not. But here, the central critical value is one, one, two, three, four, five, or something like that. Three, four, five, or something like that. It's always, as long as you have the condition one, this condition is always automatically satisfied. It's always non-zero. It's meaningful, but it's non-zero. If you want the non-managed condition, you only need the local global principle, which means if you have the locally non-managed, the global is non-managed. So you have to figure out what is the local multiplicity formulas in this study. Unfortunately, it's no longer generic. Generic A packet. It's a non-tempered A packet. So the structure is, I expect it's more complicated. Okay. And that is the comparisons we use. The first one is the relative trees formula. And that's a kernel function. This is a very standard one. The only thing I want to explain is the first trees formula, the integral over n is the wheel front associated. wheel front associate in the for the due for the psv dualities sorry so not bsc i was picking uh uh barbish wagon dualities the new point the wheel front will certainly so that i use the case which is it could be the character or could be the feature copies because i have two cases the due set it's not a even you could have the g1 is equal to g1 is non-zero so one is non-zero. So the first integral is the degenerate weight model suggested from the SL to from the pyramid by the B V duality. Because that is the second part. The C is still the C series. The second one is the well-known cost of tristrom just for the FL2 case integral over the maximum upper triangular matrices. And the fundamental And the fundamental actually, before the BSV's framework in 1997, Mohan Ralis already formulated the comparisons to those two family of the pairs, the rank one case. Just for the previous four cases, they already realized everything in the cubic joint algebra by using the exceptional groups. They already start to compare the two sets. Here, the two set by using the relative trace formulas. And so, our case is just at the bottom two: the GSP10 and GSP6 cross GO2. Because it is the other set is a rank one, it's quite easy to prove the fundamental lemma and the smooth transfers in this case for those two relative transformers. And now, the last part of my talk is to move. Of my talk is to move to the local multiplicity formula. The globally, we already see, and also the approach is ready. You have the relative trees formula to comparison. Of course, besides the relative trees formula, you also can use the C the correspondence or the minimal representations to gather the correspondence on the due set. If you use the Sorry. If you use the like use the Professor Juan Gumet's result, it's also quite easy to see. The repetition is quite small. The repetition is quite small here. So you're also kind of easy to use the CD correspondence to transfer to the SL2 case. It's an alternative way using the CD correspondence to prove everything. The last part on the local multiplicity is that we do have. The local multiplicities, we do have the certain difficulty. We don't know. So we already have, we kind of know the other parameters factors through this pi B type. The B is the three square, four squares you see, three or four. This non-temper. And we expected the residue representation is going to be distinguished, but we don't know the parametric of the residue spectrums in this. The residue spectrums in this packet. In other words, at least I don't know if we have like a generalized springer correspondence theory you established for the global version. Yeah, so that's the question one I would like to ask. The second part is because it's the non-temporary, even you expect which one, even you expect this local aspect package to have the multiplicity one. The waspy method does not work well. Not work well is that like the representation of the character is no longer tamper. You cannot use the harsh on the character to do the approximation to do the calculation. So that's a big trouble. And also, even you expect a certain member is distinguished, but we don't know how large of this package, what are the members here, especially like for the spin or for even for the generous, like the E7. The most difficult case question is. The most difficult case question is: if we take the G is the joint type, your G hatch is going to be simply connected case. This case, we still expect you should in certain way, you're going to have the multiplicity one in the local non-tempered as packet, but you still can switch this SL6 to like the PGL6. The multiplicity corresponding to the other set, which is going to be much bigger, and then the The I have no idea how to parametrize the local multiplicities in those non-tempered. In that case, it's much more complicated. Even you know which members are distinguished. But as we discussed, first, we don't know how many we are not yet labeled everything. The second is even we know how do we find an efficient way to choose that. Okay. Okay, yeah, thank you very much. And also, thanks AASM, the host. That's all my talk. Thank you.
