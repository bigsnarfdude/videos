Thank you very much for the invitation to this workshop conference. And I think I should say that I'm not an expert about hypocritical apparatus, but today I talk about some new perspective on some singular homoitis from the perspective of categorical elementary geometry. And this is a joint work with in progress with Tudor. Chilo, what do I do? The paper should appear in the archive soon, I think. Here I start from the motivation surface of a complex number field. Let's take a v Let's take a v is it algebraic, and also let's take some so this grid is some algae that we can see for object in the derived category and I take Shingma to the stability condition. So, here stability condition means that either I will take means that either I will take a classical geode stability condition in this case I take anti-divisor on this or regional stability on digits so given G the data so stability condition is a set of semi-stable objects and we can Set of semi-stable objects, and we can form the modular space of such objects not by m to be m sigma b. So this is, this is a modularized, modularized scheme, modularized base of inputs, this is essay quick lines classing of signal semi-state objects. For example, in the case of classical disk customities, this is constructed as it faced GIT closure. And in that case, this is a projective scheme. And there are many works on the geometry of this module space. And but before I mention about this, let's. But before I mention about this, let's write so here the point is that I don't assume that groups pre-primitive. So I like group to be multiple of some primitive vector and it's from positive integer and group is primitive. And also the I like the The we have this vector at the g minus two, and for simple, I assume that g is bigger than or equal to two. The story also works when g is either zero or one, but uh but in order to make the uh uh description simpler, I assume that this is bigger than or equal to zero and I will also take shit mark. And I will also take Shinma this stability condition to be genomic stability condition. So, this means that if you consider the regional stability condition, so there is a warm chamber structure on this face, and so genetic means that it does not apply in the world. So then the for example the when d equal one equals one case is where this machine vector is primitive and if you take primitive machine vector and genetic stability condition it is relevant that this module is specific impact students. In fact, smooth but as I d go wrong again, this is a holomorphic sympathetic manifold and which is the deformation pay point to the hereby scheme of points on KC surface. Of course, this is the classical thing, for example, looking. Classical, yeah, for example, Nukai in the case of region stability, the device maker, and there are many other contributions. So, this is a case of the primitive case, and what I want to discuss is non-primitive case. And in uh in the non-primitive case, this mobile space is uh always Xi Singular. Is always Xi Chingular, and the question is that whether we have some nice resolution of the chingular case. So, this is also well known that when dimension is true, that is equal to and g equals. So, in this case, the also resolution of singularities. So, this is due to algorithm. So, this is So this is the division of generated. And in fact, so this is again for most simple manual. So we may try to find a similar example in other cases, but it is known that this is only possible case where we have such a little bit nice preservation of the similarities. Either D is valid or is different. In this case, this is not possible. In fact, there is no prepared distribution on L. This is due to colouring brand and so on. So, this is the situation for GPS. And what I'm going to address here is that instead of considering the usual reservation universities, we can try to find some categorical reservoirs machine units which have nice behavior. So, the question is that without the easiest. There is some categorical distribution of M. So there's where we are formation with the categorical resolution, but I don't specify what it is now at this moment. But anyway, so the question is that whether there's some nice replacement of this single sympathetic function space or some data subcategory of them. That is why at least I want to define Smith on Dropper category. So here I briefly talk about digital notation. So the thing is, if you have like DG category, maybe if over. Maybe probably quick to angry. So then, so this is equal to this if this is equal to droplet. If you take the direct sum of this common space, completely the finite engineer. And this is called sluice. So this is the notion of the diagonal DG module or the product of this DG category. If this diagonal module is perfect. And if we say that this category is collaborative, so if you have smooth and fornice condition, there is a self-functor in this category. So under this self-functor is just a shift of something. Delta is a module, so that is so yeah. So yeah. So there is a communicator easy functor from here that is sending this is so this is the director and the powerhead means that it is essentially coming from the unit embedding. So yeah, but this differential is not important here. Is not important here. So, for example, I will explain some examples. For example, if you consider X is less projective like it, in first we singular projective. Projective writing. If you consider dpx, you can consider dpx or pop fix and you can find the easiest use or profile. In fact, so this dbx is this is not proper because if x Is not proper because if x is singular, then if for example you take a structure of the singular point, then this common space is infinitely dimensional. So this is not proper. But there is an interesting work by Junes showing that although this is singular, this is loose in this definition. On the other hand, if you can consider the perfect complex, that is locally given by the Given by the finite complex vector boundaries. In this case, this is in this case, this is this is proper, but this is not so much. So, if you consider the user derived category or complex on for the change of projectability, then you have to, so you need just X to be smooth and pro. Need just x to be smooth and proper. You need x to be, in fact, smooth. And also, if you consider equal e d x and x is smooth projective variety, then s is a collabial of this if and only if x is a collabial manual. If execute the collaborative mind, when you can find some proper collaborator category, which may be regarded as certain categorical resolution of this Shinja infected microphone, then we may expect that this is a nice categorical investment. So, the so that is one. I believe that such a categorical distribution from the perspective of animatric geometry. So, when animative geometry, so especially in the so-called Johnson-Thomas theory, so which counts certain stable objects to a semi-stable object from Clabial sequence? So, in this setting, so starting from this module space, although this is the modular space on KC surface, but nevertheless, we can interpret this object as some module space of the objects on Clavier C point, for example. Objects on club C point, for example, you can take the product of a KC surface with a fine time. Starting from this module space, there is a way to extract certain integer certainty for the DPS number omega sigma double. So this definition is quite intricate, and I don't give it a precise definition, but roughly speaking, so this is a kind. So, this is a kind of Euler characteristic. So, this I like quotation mark of this. And of course, that is fan who is primitive and sigma generic. So, this is the usual order characteristic. But fan is not primitive. So, the but still there is a way to define such a number. So, this is due to Number for this to do to join some phone consider survey model and say Davison. Any other people? And again, it's not primitive, so you have to consider the impact modular step of the semi-stable object, the logarithm in the so-called algebra, and also the Multi-cohere algebra, and also the important thing we got to regard it as a multi-space of object on Cloud Sea. So that is so this definition is complicated. One is that the need economy geometry or Geometry for PC surface product fine. So anyway, we have this number, but also the expressed value of this invariant is also completely known. So this is due to the result by mono recontomers. And this was conjectured by Mafield that so this number is in fact equal to the actual Euler characteristic of filibuster scheme of point. So, of course, point rate is primitive, so this is all biased because this The whole bias because this modular space is in fact deformation equivalent to the k-beto scheme of points. But when we're not primitive, this is quite surprising. There is no really, no reason for this to. But nevertheless, we every conjecture in multiple geometry, like long-written DT workmark correspondence, or if we know if we assume everything, then this should be true. And also by combining all of the techniques in any. Techniques in animatric geometry. So, this is now 23 and 23. So, this kind of identity is also required towards so-called high-intended phenomena. So, that must be also true for arbitrary club C code. So, that means that if you specify the MOCA vector like zero, data, or something, then Or something. Then, so this, of course, this right-to-man side is independent of the left of the for example, when chi equals one, this vector is primitive, so this is required, but when chi equals zero, so this vector might not be primitive, then vector is some multiple, so this identity is quite highly. But anyway, so even if mp is not primitive, So, even if MP is not primitive, we can see some form of homoic simple manifold. So, the question is that whether we can extract some shadow of the homoic chimp vector manifold of K3 n-type from this singular chimp activ module space, which also recovers this identity. So, this is our contribution from this kinematic geometry. So, from this perspective, the concept is a support concept. Now, we have this invariant, maximum sigma b dps invariant. So, this is a this is in integer, and these are similar attempts to. There are similar attempts to define such integer value invariants to the defined value, like Mochik invariant or cohomological invariant. For example, there is one step of the refinement. So called the PPS cohomology. So this is due to again enjoy some future properties. So this is arbitrary port on the Arbitrary obvious report and for KC surface case so Davison and the proper methods that it is EPS homology this so this is the integer and this is the some vector space or graded vector space it recovers this invariant by taking the Euler character the what I want to try is that we want to The draw is that we want the further definement categorization, which I may call EPS category. So, this second step of the categorification is not yet known in general, but if we visit such a categorization, then it may give some answer to the first question about categorical difference. Categorical replacement, categorical resolution of the Shinju Shimpeli module base. Okay. So this is the market or motivation of my talk. And yes, then I'm going to explain the main results. So the main result is that it is native to such a category which satisfies almost all the required properties. But before that, so I explained some more notation. So far, I considered this singular motor space and And so, this is obtained at the starting from GIT quotient. So, this is the actual scheme or pulparity. But this is obtained as a GIT quotient of some stock. I write it as so this is the uh this is the modular scheme. So, this is a modular star. And I want to find such a category from the derived category of this module stack. But again, so this is when look at the technology primitive. This is the Shinger. And this is again also Shinger stack. And I'd like to consider this category and also its bounded derived category of this singular stack. And then, of course, I'm considering the stack. So, stack means information of the stabilizer groups. And for example, for each point, each point corresponds to some semi-stable object. Corresponds to some semi-stable object, and each point has trivial automatic groups that is coming from the scalar multiplication. This X distance without scalar multiplication gives the decomposition of this DBM into the corresponding weight species. So, this part, this line corresponds to the ratio of W part with respect to this G faction. So, this stack is some sister job of another stack. And if you this is a sister job of some other stack, then there is associated such decomposition. For example, patients want the derived category of the like this sister, then decompose it into the corresponding weight categories. So, here is first seven. The first one is that there is For the category for each rate W. And in fact, so this is the admissible for the category. Admissible means that there is like light and left adjoint functions of this inclusion. If because that's a breed of multiple of this from primitive one, if this dividability of the breeze on the display W is complained, then this is local on the service. And moreover, and also with previous A functor, but unfortunately, this is moreism. We can only show that this is true, either locally or end. We view that this works globally, but there are some technical supporting this one globally. And also, so if you restrict this category, so this category is somewhat linear over the over this down here n. And if you restrict it to the smooth locus, so this is equivalent to the derived category of this. The derived category of this previous one, but twisted by some glorial class. So, this W appears as the whole of the globe class in this notation. So, I'm alright to find it to divide the category of chip sheets. So, uh, yes. So, this alpha corresponds to the existence of the universal shift over this municipal class. So, in general, so there is some obstruction of the existence of the universal shift, and it is classified by some global class. Classified by some blower class. So from this property, I expect that this is like a kind of twisted version. Non-commutative, twisted, or categorical, refund resolution of this singular synthetic. Singular symbolic conjoint space n. Okay, so I will explain later how this category should look like, but anyway, I will continue with its property. What you mentioned is about constructing some categorization of the BPS of Moji. And the property of important property of the BPS of Moji is that for it gives the building block of the whole divided category of this singular module stack. And on the level of the homoji, so we should refresh the derivative category of the homoji, and in this case, guide the so-called PBW type salmon by David Song and By Davison and Hidden Group Returns. So the next result is about its codification. So this one is given by Infaco Doc. But I tried to make my talk without saying anything about the derived stack, but this is the only part I have to say about derived stack. What is this one plus KVE view and drive internet? It's WIP prime with some shift of the weight. And so, this notation means that so far I considered this conjugate stack as a classical acting stack. But now, so this one is a defined submission machine, but now this is a subcategory of the elaborate category of the elaborate module spec. He liked the multi-stack. So, but this was basically coming from like more gross representation theory. And so, I don't explain much about this theorem, but also this tent also has important meaning in presentation service. So, this is given by so-called categorical product. So, it is important to import derivative structure in defining categorical whole product, and this is due to product by potential. Anyway, so what this let me try to do that. So, this subcategory is somewhat giving a block in describing all. Of derived category of this Shingle Moja stack. And this, yeah, this I should say this is category called analog of stolen or the ruler mode over this. Over this module stack or d by Davis on the I continue the property of this category. The next result is the independence of this category of the stability condition. Of this category over the state definition that is let's say let's say e to e w so this category may depend on choice of the subdivision condition, but it's for it is in fact independent of sigma up to equivalence. So, this is regarded as a categorical evolution. So, this is regarded as a categorical evolution formula. So, for example, if you consider the given VPS invariant or DP invariant on KC surface, this is independent of the choice of the stability condition. For example, by the work of molecules, the VPS invariant is the same as the Hearbetto scale, or the characteristic of Herbetoski confines. In particular, this is independent of choice of stability condition. So, this is regarded as analog. What do we call analog? And in fact, so in the case of in the primitive case, for example, let's say d equal to w one on a w equal zero. So in this case, for this category, it's by definition, this is the p point to the derived category of sigma b and in this case, this is the usual derived category of the monorphic sympathetic. The honorific sympathetic manifold. And in this case, if you consider the role crossing of stability conditions, so then this for most manifold varieties and the sound bilational transformation. And this category should be equivalent from the underground k equivalence equivalence conjecture. And this one. And just want to proven by what's been risked on. For this cell MC gives the generalization of this categorized large data. So the next result is the composition of this category with the BPS in variant. Again, so this is the frame B and that with plane. Then, there are several embargoes defined from the DG category. For example, we can consider the topological case theory of the DG category introduced by Blank. And if you take the topological characteristic of the topological psychology of this category, then this is. Continually then this is equal to the this is equal to the EPS invariant and by the work by molecular so this is equal to the OER characteristic of Him points property I would call it as like when I'm talking with component I would say this is important. I would say this is the DPS category. And in general, I find this is not a prime case, so I would say this is required in PPS in the sense that it recovers the PPS invariant. I'll say one more Julian. This is a technical part, but so this is a Part, but so this is a somewhat new technique about in considering such a category. As I said, this I'm thinking about the derived category of the singular derived stack. And so usually it is difficult to consider, for example, the derived category of this singular stack. But for example, if the object of this singular stack is perfect, then it may be easier to compute the homospace, for example. But the important property of this category is that, in fact, it is not necessary that this object is perfect. There might be some object which is not perfect, but nevertheless, it is in some sense close to it. So, again, so let's say it is beyond public scope plane. Okay, let's consider the another. Then let's consider another stack. So, this is the means that this is not the set of Shinga points. This is just a notation of a new stack, another stack. So, this is a stack over this Shinge multi-stack so that the fiber of this map is the traceless vertical from E. So, this zero means that for this is traceless. This zero means that for this is to restless park. So, this is the certain cone of this shingle stack. And in other words, so this is the minus one cosmology of the potential complex of the single stack with this D. So, in the right gauge back geometry, this is also called the minus associated potential stack. Minus associated with tangent stock, but anyway, so the for each object EVM, so there is a so-called jingle support. And so this is not the usual support, and it lies on the this uh. And graph is speaking, so this so this one is introduced by adding channel gateway. And so roughly speaking, roughly speaking, it measures how this object is far from the perfect complex. In fact, if this Of course, there is a natural zero section, and if this is contained in the zero section, this is perfect. So, this is the characterization of the perfect complex in terms of this chinga sport. And the this tells me that for any object, its shingle support is contained in not necessarily the image of the data section, but so called the new potential. This section, but focus on important form. So, this is the point of E and the point of this fiber. After that, theta is essentially high composition of theta is table. So, this means that although this object may not be perfect, but in some sense, this is close to the perfect complex. And in fact, so this. Complex. And in fact, so this is a great analogy of the so-called support condition for the homological transatomacy invariant, cohomological BPS invariant by Davidson and his graduate. And this is somehow categorical analog touch support condition. And in fact, this is a statement of this theorem E. And in fact, this enough to conclude that. Enough to conclude that is category is 4. So, this is the without I'm going to explain how this category looks look like. How this category looks like in terms of some local description of this ginger stack. It's not proper. Yeah, yeah. So in the non-copime case, I think it is also important to find some data category, but I think that even if DMW is not co-prime, I think it cannot be further decomposed. Deposed and yeah, that's what we did, yeah. Now, I'm going to talk about local description. What do we give again? So, this let's say this is a map from the singular mujai stack to the singular simple ID and for. Variety and present the classification of this singular variety in terms of the Jordan header field restrictions. So, this is a modular space of SAP minus plus. And each point of this one corresponds to the pre-stable object. That is a direct sum of the stable object. And that is easy to fight by go down here the time. And the default starter corresponds to the direct sum of the same object. E-base button is point to equal, let's say this one to equal f plus e. Where if it's a gigamo stable object with the corrector. Which look like equal to this primitive integral. So then, so starting from this point, we can consider this moment mark or require clan's mark. So, in the case of KC surface, we have the so-called formality theorem. This means that we have only quadratic term of the grain map. And in fact, this is this x1 is pd2. And this is one-dimensional. And also, this image is contained in the process part of this DFD. And this map is, of course, expressed as that x1 xg y1 to yg to what's the sum of this bucket. If we take this PD with the inverse level consented by JLD and take So, this is a local model of this which is marked. Well, it's a local model. So, we want to construct a derivative category of this singular. Delighted category of this singular coefficient stack, but there is a way to it with some function more small, something small smoother thing. That is for this is called possible derivative. So, this is the equivalence between the bounded derived category of this single stack with a category of The category of graded matic activization. And if it is a sum function on this stack, which then x1 xg y1 to yg that will be less or zi yi and pick some. So this is a function gfd implement function on this smooth stack and this right hand side is category. And side is category of multiple actualizations with objects consist of alpha and beta, such as that HPI is a coherent shift and alpha and beta the multiplication is composition multiplication by f and also in the positive direction. So, the advantage for this activity bias is first given by homogeneous setting, e-gik, and also there are other formulations. And this graded means that we have some grading of this stack with respect to the sheet star action with weight zero and two. So, the point is that the left-hand side is a derived category of the shiny one. And on the other hand, the right-hand side is this is a category defined. Hand side is this is a category defined on this one, but the point is that we have this singularity on the left-hand side. The information of the singularity is transponded to the geometry of this direction. In some sense, this is the gravity between the singularities and the geometry of this spark. And in fact, this XD and what processing is critical locus of this function is gives a local model of the model space of the semi-stick object on the Carabia C for that is KC surface product affine dying. So here, so we have the information from the Carlabia C for the site. So then the study is to find some category on the light sound side and then Light from the side, and then we'll go back to here. And then we define this in a subcategory. So, this is defined to be the category of this object category. About the relations so that for each actor of the maximum tollers of the GVD. So, this is the maximum tollers. We have that this weight tool of this object with respect to this co-character is contained in this region. Continue in this video. So, this determinant means that this is a determinant character of the GAGAVD, and this endometria is defined to be a thing of favorable and tangible complex. And tangent complex of XE but taking the lambda positive part, but so this Xd is expressed divided in this way. So this is nothing but QG rammer and G of D. So this means that this is the sum of the weight of the GVD. It clears with the lambda is projected. Anyway, so this is of course explicitly created. And so this is the category, subcategory defined in this way. So such a category without this potential F is first considered by von Denberg and Spencer in their construction of the so-called non-computer queplant resolution. And so this is a motor factorization version. Mautic optimization version of this funding base bank of construction. This is authorization version of funding bank. And serial construction was also used by Hype Investor and Sam to give so-called magic window sewing for GIT crossing to stacks for. For GIT crossing the stacks for symmetric representations. Anyway, so this is the category inside this multi-factorization. And again, so we have this portion of e balance define TDW. Well, yeah, so easy to draw everything on this. So, this is a local model, and of course, we have to show that this kind of from the construction can be good. But, anyway, so this is the local model for this category and. And anyway, so we have to show that, for example, whether this presentation is independent of the choice of the presentation of M as the local or something. But anyway, so this can be proven to give a global category. And we can prove the, we have the CLM A to E, and we have the similar properties for this local model. And this is also good for the. So for the multi-factorization side, then on the multi-factorization side, everything is support hominotics on the weight of the GFD representations. So everything is reduced to some hominotics. So point of view, I say so, this is a lot of, yeah. Yeah, conjecture, or yeah. So again, so I would expect that this is on the Smith locus, this category is the derived category of the tweeted sheets. And on the Shinge locus, this is some sort of tweeted version of the compatification, semester compatification of the semester of the singular one. Of this singular one, and so I expect that this is something similar to the component of the derivative category of current fold, and it may be something like is something like non-commutative or maybe hypercaleous manifold. Which is okay. Because so the topological characteristic of this one equals the Euler characteristic of a shabby scheme of points. For example, we may ask whether this is equivalent to the derivative category of this device of channel points. So, in this talk, I formulate this. This theorem for the assumption of g is bigger than or equal to two. And we can also formulate such a question for, for example, g equal one and g equals zero. g equals zero case is quite trivial, so this is somewhat trivial statement, but g equal one case is still non-trivial. And g equal one case, so we have to impose the derivative structure because the when g is bigger than equal to two, the derivative structure of m is not so much far from the honest derivative structure. From the ones derived structure. But when G equals one, for example, for example, when G is bigger than or equal to two, this clones map, so zero locus of the clones map is complete intersection. But when G equals one, this is not. So the derived structure is essential. So by importing the derived structure, we can also formulate such a question. And in this case, we expect that this is equivalent to the derived category of twisted case surface. Yeah, so I have the same on me, but I stop here. Thank you very much.
