And in this case, I guess uh I'm normally a co-organizer, but really we all know Mitch, we have all the work. Thank you, Mitch, for putting this together. And uh so this work is uh joined with uh Simon Weber and uh Kevin Stubb and both are in the audience. So it's also ongoing work and hopefully we can have an archive of Super soon. Uh I'm gonna introduce the problem. Uh I'm gonna first talk about the main results in an informal way. Main results in an informal way because the conditions are technical. Then I will talk about the main results and mention a little bit of a proof sketch. And in the end, I'll mention some of my questions. We know that TBG as an integer filling is very interesting because it's a correlated insulator, which means that if you take the VM model, you can predict correctly the flat band, but the phase A flat band, but the phase is a simple metallic phase. So, to really explain the experimentally observed correlated insulator phase, we need to do something extra. And as we know, the nature of the background correlation is still being debated, although tremendous progress has been made in the past few years. So, one of the most striking results to me found. To me, found a theoretical community in this Moray system is the existence of this exact ground space of certain limits. And the interacting homitony, at first, I think last time, a flat iron called the interacting chiral model, ICF, I think has done, isn't here yet. And so he said that, well, the model isn't really. Said that, well, the model isn't really very much chiral, so you should really just say this Fat Band, I think in the end, the settlement of the term Fat Band interacting hypothetical MPI. But if you have a better name, please suggest. So the chiral limit, certain single-thrated determinants can be exact in ground states, many body harmonic integer fitting. This is very much counterintuitive if you view that from the perspective of That from the perspective of Harbaugh models. This also combining theoretical and experimental evidence is, I think it is widely accepted that metric angle TBG is strongly interacting, which means that the physics is beyond a non-interacting model or a high-binding model or something like that. But whether it is strongly correlated, which especially in the sense of a quantum chemist, whether there is a very significant effect. There is a very significant effect beyond hard default, which is debatable. And in this particular case, it's definitely not beyond hard to fall because hard to fog is exact. So it seems to be strongly interacting, but not strongly correlated. And later, we're going to hear more about this about Fibian, some numerical species compared with DMRG and so on and so forth. So the phase we're interested in is a relatively maybe you can say not so interesting phase once you're in this field for some time because it is relatively simple but this relatively simple phase gives us some hope to have a concrete understanding. This phase is the single valley model and if you look at the Hartree Fog ground scale, it is a sub valid problem. It is a sub-lattice polarized. So, how do you see this sub-lattice polarized? Actually, there should be honeycomb lattice here, but now it's your triangular lattice, which means that the ground state, if you plot the background density, or here, more accurately, the local density states, which corresponds to STM images, microscopically, some of this B size, all the B sides are actually dark. You only see this polarized dark one of the suburbances. The other one is equally in. The other one is equally energy favorable, but it's not like a mixture of both. If you go to the two-value model, this corresponds to a valid hole state. It is ferromagnetic, we have heard from Alan talking about that this morning. It's a single-stated determinant, exact brown state in certain limits. And throughout the talk, I'm going to focus on this flat band interacting component, which really smears out a lot of the microscopic details. A lot of the microscopic details, and for this thing, I mean, the submatrix divided by sigma indicates each or itself or method. And this sigma defines the thermometric. The calculation I showed earlier was from a model. It actually turns out doesn't quite matter whether you go obtain this from a continuum model or relaxed model, because if you even do abinitial calibrations, this is ongoing for This is an ongoing work joint collaboration with the Steve Lewis group and my salad health group. So Ray Kim is here. And so, among other things, he plotted this electron density of Actray, the valid hole state. From our initial calculations, Actray takes care of 10,000 atoms per unit cell, and you construct the projecting harmony and find radical ground state, and you look. And it's pretty much the same. Look, and it's pretty much the same thing. You can see that the electron density completely focuses on the A sub-lattice, and on the B sub-lattice, there's nothing. But this is one Mori unit cell contains about 11,000 patterns. And you can see additional patterns that there are some electromagnetic here on A region and very little electron density outside. So the model and our initial calculations, at least at this level, they correspond to each other. At this level, they correspond to each other quite well. Some of our motivating questions are: the ground state can be a single state of determinant. It seems very counterintuitive from Harvard model. And what's the nature of this thing? Especially, what's the algebraic structure that allows you to obtain this exact ground state result? And once we know these algebraic structures and symmetry properties, whether we can generalize it. Properties: whether we can generalize this to other settings, such as multiple fat banks, multiple layers, and so on and so forth. And also, the question is: you have already provided a description by construction, a ground state, whether such ground states are unique. Are you missing something else? So, these are our both of the questions. Any questions so far? So, this is single flavor. Single flavor. Yeah. And so. Yeah. And so I'll talk about those U2U2U4U for a thing later. Okay. So let me say that what are things beyond the TVG? The standard model now, which is a simplification of the VM model, which was done by Bolsky collaborators in 2019, is this Cairo VM Hamptoni. After some reordering, you have this. Some reordering. You have this 0, 0 on a diagonal, you have D operator on an off-diagonal, D takes the form of differential operators and the potential. The standard choice of the potential is this thing that corresponds to the Mohray structure. And it's really very simple. You have some phases and two linear combination. For this one, the rigorous work has been done by Simon Becker, Montgomery, which said. And they have a beautiful theory for capturing all the magic angles, not only the first magic angles, but all the magic angles alpha. By the way, the magic angle is captured by this parameter alpha here after some cascading and minimization argument. So not only the first magic angle, but all the magic angles, not only on the real line, but also in compact space. On the real line, but also in a complex space. Of course, what does it mean to have a complex magic angle still needs to be discovered actual heroes, but you actually have a full description of everything. Here we use m to denote the multiplicity of the magic angle alpha. If you see a star without a number, that means m is equal to 1. The number of flat bands is 2 times the multiplicity. So if this is 1, that means there are two flat bands. And without loss of the Flat bands. And without loss of generality, we use a minus one and plus one to indicate these flat bands. If you pick the standard U0, then you have two flat bands and this is the standard TBG, let's say dash two. The reason why we have a dash two is because just to make a very simple modification, surprisingly, you get four frat bands, even though it's a single flavor. What you do there is really to do a next-order expansion of Of the Oriental. So you have a QI, then you have like a 2QI. So this one just comes from the construction. It turns out very interestingly, at least numerically, whenever the linear combination is like the positive, you will see two flat bands, but when it is negative, then see four black bands. Which kind of means that when you do perturbative Perturbative expansion of these hopping parameters. If you don't like it, just a form nearest neighbor hopping, you have an X nearest neighbor, Nets, X nearest neighbor. But somehow in the Fourier space, if it goes, the forms are ripple in the right way, then you will see, boom, there are like four flat bands. And which means that here, the multiplicity is 2, and therefore, n is a number of flat bands, 2f, without loss of generality. flat bands 2m without loss of generality denote them by plus minus 1 plus minus 2 and there are also other imaging variables too all computed within the same framework. You can also do things beyond two layers. You can do the tri-layer graphing. One of the things that's very closely related to TBG is equal to a sample tri-layer graphing where this D is not Where this D is no longer a 2x2 matrix, but replaced by a 3x3 matrix. There's an intimate connection between the TBG and TTG. You can have an exact mapping between the two. So the TBG have two and four flatbands, and TTG can have four and eight flatbands. In particular, if you choose U to be the standard potential, you have four flatbands. You can apply exactly the same technique and to find both the real and magic. And to find all the real and magic angles, here this one, you start with 2 and you multiply by 2 factor 2 and you have 4 diameters. And we aim at describing the exact ground state of all these systems, but also. Just to show you that these systems are generally different from TBG2, and this is the total density states of the party fault graph. States of the part refault ground state, there is a considerable band renormalization, according to Adam's technology said earlier, because all these things, the bands are completely flat. If you plot the total density states of the flat bands, from the DM model, you should just have a delta V around zero with the firm insertion. There's nothing else. But if you solve the Harpy Fog, at the Harpy Fog level, you will see that the bands, they considerably They considerably split, and in the middle there's a gap. It's not completely zero, that's because of smearing to facilitate the plotting. If you do the TBG, then the bands, they just split into two peaks. And if you look at the TBG4, it actually split into four peaks. And similarly, if you look at the TTG ETTG4, there are four peaks. And you can also try to look at the local density states corresponding. Local density states corresponding to their STF images. This is the background of the study. Now let me present informal statements of the main results. You have to look at things from a second formulation, which is we look at a single flavor. So this is the graphene on a layer of breathing zone, and near the edge, there is a small mini. There is a small min MORE protein zone or mini protein zone. Here, this MORAD protein zone is denoted by omega star. For the BM model, you can just work with the continuous level, work with the omega star. But in the interacting level, this is a bit inconvenient because you have to work with an infinite number of cardinals. So you need to discretize. Cardos. So you need to discretize this operating zone in a certain way. For example, take a monk horse to kind of grid and this discretize the grid, for example, like this, and this is the quantum K. Most of the talk, well, for example, single-value regime, if you have two values, then you have another one here. At each K, you first dynamize this VM homicomy. You obtain the flat bands, and this flat band is a set. The set is denoted by the word V n, which is a plus. By equal Ven, which is a plus minus one, dot plus minus ten. And for each of this thing, you associate the winner associate the creation and annihilation operators denoted by F dagger and k and f hat and k respectively. So the flatband interacting homotopy is a relatively simple. You get rid of all the Dispersion part, and you only keep an electron-electron interaction, which takes the form of a V hat times rho rho. This rho thing here captures all the information of the band structure. There is a quadratic term with respect to f-hat, dagger, and f-hat. And because they have two rows here, so multiply them together, you have a quartic compounding. But also, you subtract. Homotonium, but also you subtract the constant. This one corresponds to the so-called average subtraction corresponding to a part of the closed symmetric system. But all it does, at least of the integer fitting, just to modify the chemical potential, that doesn't change the actual band structure. So really, everything that plays a role here is vortic turf. I will explain this lambda thing later, which plays a key role. The V hat is the Fourier transform of the screen Poulom kernel. Turns out for analytical reasons, it really doesn't matter what it looks like. As long as it is non-advisive everywhere, fine. And have some decay, so that's sense. Furthermore, you can show that this is really the formation conjugate of the rho minus Q. It's a Fermi conjugate of rho, which means that this is a positive semi-definite model. This is a key because it is a key. This is a key because uh it is a positive semi-definite, means that if you can find a state, you get uh HFBI to that state, turn zero, well, this is must be the run state. Uh don't guarantee it, but uh if you can do it, that's it. Uh now let me talk about this lambda, uh, which really encodes all the information of the band structure. This lambda is called the form factor. What you do here is you assume that the DM bands DM bands, they are normalized in the sense that you sum over the sub-atis index and the layer index and the do a Kelton normalization equal to one. If you work with this normalization condition, you can write down the Fourier transform of this band U. Now it's called a U hat MK G, which is this thing. Now you compute this kind of like a inner product. Kind of like inner product. But what this roughly, it looks like relatively complicated. What it roughly does is you form a pair product in a real space and then you go fully transform. That is what this is called, a form factor. So this form factor encodes all the information of the band structure. And once you have this lambda, you can throw away the model and you just work with this interaction on the form structure. There are several important symmetries involved in the model. Important symmetries involved in the model. It turns out this is all you need to construct the following exact ground state result as well as the unique needs result. So, unique needs, you need a bit more. There are three important symmetries. All of them are important. One is the so-called subatom symmetry, Z. Some people call it the sigma Z. What it does is that so they all commute. So they all commute with a homotomy and sorry, commute or anti they all act as a unitary or anti-unitary symmetries of the system. That if Z acting on a function u pull out sigma, sigma is plus minus one. So if the sub lattice A, sigma is plus, sub lattice B, sigma minus. There's a C to Z T symmetry. I really don't have a better name. I hope there's an English word. I hope there's an English word to capture this thing. Is there English word other than C2ZT? I mean, it's really awkward. No? Okay, that's called. Time reversal like. Time reversal like. It doesn't capture the C to the Z. Anyway, we couldn't find anything. That's called C to C T, because literally what it does is C to Z and the T. I remember so. Time reversal. And that's a symmetry for the single rally. And then there's a layer symmetry. Sometimes the layer terms are particle hosting, but we find layer symmetry more plane and captures what is going on. That is, if you reverse the two layers, there's some symmetry. These three are really what you need for multiple flatbands and multiple flatbands and multiple layers. Because of the symmetries, it induces. Because of the symmetries, it induces something called a gauge fixing. So the Q symmetry, or C2ZT, enforces, allows you to do a gauge fixing. Gauge fixing is really a fancy term to rotate your UMK at bands. You can rotate the UMK such that u minus n, remember n is a plus one, double dot, plus plus minus one double dot plus minus n, and so that u minus n is directly corresponding. Is directly corresponding to the u plus n through this Q operation. This is the one thing that kind of fixes the gauge. The second thing is you combine the C2ZT and sub-lattice symmetry. Then you can make sure that this U is also sub-lattice polarized in a sense that you can identify this N and sigma. And so that's another, at least for a two-layer, this is a And uh yeah, so sorry, this one's really for for the TPG. Yeah, and uh uh then with these two symmetries, you just work it out, you'll find that the form factor actually has this block diagram form. You have a m by m matrix, and each of this m by m matrix is called A. They are also complex components. Uh they are also complex conjugate of each other. The whole thing is 2m by 2m. That's a size of a file space per k. Any questions so far? So the first result is what do we mean that the ferromagnetic state and determinants are the ground state, which means that once you have done the gate fixing, now you can talk about n is bigger than. Can talk about n is bigger than zero or n is smaller than zero. So one of these chiral sectors or churn sectors. You just take all for each k, you take all the n that is bigger than zero or smaller than zero. This gives you a single slated determinant, psi plus or psi minus. Then, with all these three symmetries, you can directly prove that this FSD ferromagnet. FSD, ferromagnetic stated determinant states, are many model brown states. You can further show that there's a positive charge gap, which means that if you add one more electron, the amount of energy you need to pay is finite even in the thermodynamic limit. This directly shows some evidence that it is a correlated, not only correlated, but also it's an insulated, right? So before it's a simple metal, there's no gap, and now there's a gap, at least. In the metal body, At least in the many body since you have many gaps. The simplest one to show is the charge gap. This is an extension of many people's work and their audience. And also it extends earlier the charge gap argument for TPG2. So really later I'll show you a sketch of the proof, but it's really diminished. But this extends to the main result is that under Is that under additional non-degeneracy assumptions, these are the only translational invariant slated determinants at the half-fame? A lot of objectives, and that's why it took us a while. And the main thing I will say is that the main complication is what the syntax degeneracy conditions are. Half-filling means that you half-fill the band because you, n, you have plus minus one, double-daughter, plus, minus n, you take, take a half-filled field. Plus minus m, you take half of those and perform a slated determinant. You can also consider other integer fittings. And translational invariant, I'll explain what it means technically, but we also now, thanks to like the new idea from Kevin that we scrambled a bit like last week, and Kevin now has a completely new way of thinking about this, and maybe bioines can get rid of this translational immerry assumption. Okay, so let me talk about actually what the net results are, but any question on this one. So let me first show you in one slide what are the key ingredients from the earlier works that this FFD states are ground states. Recall that HFBI takes its form. Here, the key Takes its form. Here, the Q vector takes is in the linear combination of two vectors from the Murray query zone. These are the Monkhorst Pack grid plus the reciprocal lattice vectors. So both ground. The HFBI is a positive second definite, which means that all we need to do is to find a psi, man volume state, so that this guy hits the psi equal to zero. The psi equal to zero, then means HSBI hits if psi is equal to zero, then it's a part of state. It turns out that you just get this FIC state hit by rho half minus Q prime, any Q prime. You will find that after some computation, this is the eigenvector of that and the eigenvector, this guy. And then you so to obtain this line, you need To obtain this line, you need the Z and Q symmetries to allow you to do the gauge fixing, as I said before. Finally, apply the layer symmetry, it gives you a sum, which precisely says this trace, imaginary parts of the trace is equal to zero. Okay, so that's a central point. So it's very constructive, which is very cool. And it's very striking, and maybe it has something to do with the fact that. Something to do with the fact that why the system is strongly interacting, but at least in some regimes, not strongly occurring. Now let's try to address the uniqueness part, but let me first explain what is translational invariance. You give me any many body wave function ψ, I can always compute its one particle reduced R dm. In general, it's labeled by k and k prime, as well as bending. K prime, that's what's n in m. In this s n n m, you contract them this way. Viewed in the matrix form, each of this is a size of size 2m by 2m. This is just a dense matrix. It's positive semi-definite, satisfies a trace condition, but this is generally what you're going to have. You can capture the system can break the translational symmetry spontaneously, and you don't know, because we're getting hard to thought with a self-consistent solution, we don't know whether it's going to break the. Solution: We don't know whether it's going to break the translation symmetry. If the system satisfies translational inherence, it means that all the off-the-final bots are zero, and all you have is this. Equivalent condition is that when, I should say that for a single slated determinant, alternative characterization is that, or a sufficient, actually a sufficient condition to say translation invariance is you just look at the diagonal block and define this. You just look at the diagonal block and you find this projector, then you work out the hydrograph, you'll find that that is fine. So in May, at the Flat Air Mori meeting, I presented the following informal result. Roughly, what it says is generically, these FSD states are the only translational invariant slated determined ground states at half figure. It was okay, I mean, because going through the proof, you'll find that in order for this not to be the only state, actually, something, cancellation must happen. But Simon strongly objected to the statement. And the idea is the whole thing is about symmetry. What do you mean by generically? So that's a valid point. And we couldn't really answer, find out a concrete definition generically. So after scrambling for months, For a month and still ongoing. This is the concrete condition that gets rid of the generic distance. And so there are a few things. One is the Mount Corstrid must be sufficiently fine. That allows you to apply some continuity arguments later. Then there's a special K in the Mount Corst that does two things. One is that you can see these conditions are. You can see these conditions are technical and also explains why this is so hard to end up. Thanks to Kevin's relentless effort to go back and forth on this thing. One is that for this special k, there exists at least one g vector, the reciprocal vector, that is, this imaginary trace thing is not equal to zero. So if you recall, That before we say the sum is equal to zero, that's a sum rule, but at least one of them should be not equal to zero. And this is important because it's really later in the proof, it is an important ingredient to show that when you do a local flip in the transect, everything is uniform. You just make one flip, you must at least pay a finite amount of time to deponate to show that. So the energy penalty is a proportional to the square by this kind of thing. So one of them must be completed. First. The second is even more subtle, is there's no hidden inverted substance, which means that you give me any non-trivial projectors. I look at these form factors, right? You give me any non-trivial projector, it means that it's not zero, it's not identity. There exists a 1G. There exists a 1G so that you can think like a kg written in the matrix form. You have a pi, you have i minus pi. After some rotation, this part, so this is like i minus pi, this is like pi, you pick any pi, this one should be non-zero. What it says is that What it says is that it's okay that you can diagonalize one AKG, that's fine, but this should not be simultaneously tri-diagonalized, and leaving this pi to be an invariant substance. Why? Because if it is, you can simultaneously tri-diagonalize all these AKGs, then you can pretty much show that there is no energy penalty in shifting things about. So these are really the two key ingredients. Ingredient, once it satisfies these two conditions, then FSD states are the only transfer in terms of ground states of half-degree. I hope Simon is a bit happier now. So why these non-degeneracy conditions? And because there is one simple counterexample is this two-value model and U4 by U4 symmetry argument that you have these two values, but in this case, you'll find In this case, you will find that both conditions are actually. One is because this AKG, AKG to a foreign, not like a two-byte, so the lambda is A and A factor. But for a two-value model, if you stack the two values together, they are further off-dionized. So that immediately satisfies the, violates the hidden subspace, numerical subspace conditions. Subspace mirror subspace condition that will not even pause just there in the daylight. But also, like a more subtle thing is you will realize that you trace a couple things here. Harshly imagining exactly controls in each other. And this is, you take the spinning into account, this really gives you a more direct visualization of this so-called V U4 by U4 in the symmetry part. In the symmetry mark? Indeed. This is once you break these conditions, you can have a plethora of metabolic ground states, and they're all hard to fall around ground states. This is one of them. The name is actually a little bit confusing, called the quantum hole. But this is really in the true baddie case. Earlier the ferromagnetic state is called the baddie hole, and uh that's really localized uh on one sub at least. Localized on one sub-attice. And this one is called a fundamental normal muscle. And in the two-value model, what it does is the eigenvector of a sigma z tau z. Therefore, it actually occupies both A and B subattices. Now you really see, compared to the previous vector, now you will see the common completics. It's no longer sub-attice polarized. And there are many other completeness things, KIBC, TIBC, IKS, and they're all due to this bias. And they're all due to this violation of the exact same conditions. For this, you can see the STM paper by Maxalate's group, and also Matri paper with additional conferences. Okay, so but this conditions, especially the second one, the no-hidden invariant subsurface condition is actually quite difficult to check. We had some difficulty identifying papers. Identifying papers. They're actually relatively recent paper talking about when you can block a phi diagram of a set of matrices. The conditions are probably related to some computational algebraic geometry type of things, and they are difficult to verify. And so a natural question is whether we can simplify these conditions that are more complicationally amendable. And it turns out, for technical reasons, if you just have two flatbands or have four. If you just have two flatbands or have four flatbands, these conditions can be dramatically simplified. And you can further explicitly verify this new non-degeneracy conditions using the Jacobi theta functions and the Wei-Strass p functions that Simon collaborators kind of worked on before. This allows you to really show that for TBG2, TBG4, and ETTG4, these are the conditions in the The thermodynamic states are the equal ground states without additional conditions. Specifically, the two-band case, it turns out we only need to verify the no, the finite energy penalty condition, which is there exists a K, so that for some Q, that this magic part is not equal to zero. For the four-band case, the no-simultaneous tried ionization condition is reduced to a no-sultane. Is reduced to a no-simultaneous dionization condition. Of course, these two are not the same thing, but there's some reduction in view that allows you just to check some commutators of sound equals zero, which is a gaji-bearant thing that you can easily compute. Maybe, how much time do I have? Five minutes. Okay. Okay. So I guess this is the theta function argument that. So, this is the theta function argument that I said earlier. This is one of the cases. For the TPG2, all we need to show is that there exists a Q prime such that this guy is not equal to zero. Because this UKR has this analytical formula written as some U0R times Jacobian theta functions. But you can directly investigate whether this is not equal to zero. And this is equivalent to. And this is equivalent to whatever is UKR, the norm of that is an even function. You can directly do the computation and I can follow that computation line by line, down by assignment, but I still couldn't reproduce the argument myself, I have to say. So that seems still very technical to me. But if you look at the plots, it becomes obviously that when k is equal to zero, then I mean. zero, then I mean, it looks even, it's not even the period. That's right, marketing. For TPG full, and you can do similar things involving this very clever LSROS p functions and to our upcoming archive. Now, maybe since I'm going to have a few minutes, and then we talk about the proof strategy of the main results. Of the main results. And if you're interested, feel free to talk with us. And there are some more technical things later. And the proof strategy is the following. First, you have the FBI amatoni, which is really a quartic amatoni. And if you look at the heart tree fog, it has two parts. One is heart-treated fog. You want to minimize that, which is by definition bigger than or equal to minimize of heart tree plus minimize a fog. Of part tree plus minimize a fog in like seven. And you know that because the part tree fall energy is upper bound, gives the upper bound of energy, this must be greater than zero. But now we're exactly looking for a state that is zero, which means that both hard tree and fog must be minimized instantaneously. And the hard tree actually doesn't provide you much information. There are just numerous possibilities to minimize that. But the fog has a lot. Uh has a lot of charge. Here's the strategy to minimize the fun. It's actually a little bit uh com complicated. One is uh you need to show that uh once you assume the uh the state is translational invariant, you still need to show that it is uniform fitting, which means that you cannot have this thing has a three occupied electrons, that one has one occupied electron, and so on and so forth. This you can actually rule out. This you can actually rule up with some arguments about the rank, the form factor. Then you need to show that we picked a special k, right? We picked the special k pick the special k that says there is no hidden invariant subspace and also there is some finite energy. What you do is for this special k. For this special case, there is no intra-band mutation. It has to fully occupy this transactor or fully occupy that transactor, but it cannot handle mixing. Otherwise, you pay any penalty. That's the second step. The third step you do is that you use the assumption that the k-mesh is fine enough and some continuity argument saying that there's a no-intraband rotation well problem all the way covered in hybrid. And finally, you couple everything together. This fixes the ferromagnetic brown state uniquely, and which, and then as afterthought, you find that in many minds, the hard chain. Okay, so Eslen, you're right here for open questions. Hopefully, you can answer this, including everything else in the talk. So open questions. How to scroll. Open questions. How to strengthen the assumptions to rule out the cancellation of security breaking? This is really the very clever idea that Kevin came up just last week. We scrambled quite a bit before coming to bent and finding the slides done last night. And so it boils down to the solution of the solvability of a set of Sylvester equations. You repeatedly use that argument for rules out. Use that argument or rule out many thoughts from zero, and hopefully, this will provide a new argument to reduce to the strength of the thing. How to talk about the uniqueness of the many-body ground states is interesting. Obviously, the many body ground states cannot be unique because you can do a linear combination of the two slated determinants, and I mean that's a that gives you nominally an infinite number of ground states. However, if you can If you can work with some structures to RDN, or maybe a simplified version of that, maybe you can also show that many ground states cannot, that should be unique as well. Because at this point, really, you just don't see any evidence that for the simple model, some other interesting metabolic ground states will come out. We think that with this new probability argument, it might really allow us to generalize to the talk about the two-value model and talk about the more generalized uniqueness without how to influence symmetry. To be some optimal symmetry and maybe also address other feelings as well. But really, what we need are this ZQ and L symmetries. If you consider TDG with a number equal to this angle, or the critical T D G, I mean the the breaks among them and uh how do you do some uh characterization, uh that's uh I think very interesting. That's very interesting work. But also, I have a little bit of space here that I want to really hopefully discuss with many experts during the week. I mean, the exact results are cute, but those are special models. And what are meaningful works that we should do beyond the carving? One is whether the material details are important, and what's the role of artificial modeling here for interaction. Of artificial modeling here for interacting with it. And we have some query results, but obviously it's very wrong to talk about that. And also a higher level question is, is magic angle TBG ever strongly correlated? Maybe that's a little bit provocative because we know that for fraction cure, it's turn into a bit of a fractional turn, fractional chromical, finite temperature, dopane, they'll all point to some level of strong flavor. Some level of strong flavor of strong correlation, but it would be nice to pin down a specific regime that absolutely know this is wrong to correct beyond Harketzone. I think that'll be really interesting to us. And thank you, Yuri, as Davos. Thank you for your attention. But in this case, I guess it is the best place to advertise that. And if that's some and we don't just work on proving these things, I'm very interested in addressing I'm very interested in addressing problems. And if you have a project, it's great.
