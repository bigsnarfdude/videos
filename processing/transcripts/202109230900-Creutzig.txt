I hope you came back. So, let me tell you where I want to go. So, I started the talk by telling you a little bit about the nicest categories that are difficultly nicest VOA that lead to finite tensor categories. And then I told you that at least. And then I told you that at least I do believe that all VOAs that we know are related to affine VOAs, so vertex algebras associated to Lie super algebras via standard constructions. And so that means I decided to explain to you what do we know about the representation category of the simplest, non-semi-simple example, which is SL2 head, the affine vertex version of SL2 at admissible level. At admissible level. And at the moment, I have told you which modules come from the horizontal sub-algebra, from the finite-dimensional Lie algebra SL2. And you see that that's already quite rich because you have all these different types. You have modules that come from finite dimensional SL2 modules from integrable ones. You have modules that come from highest weight modules. You have models that come from lowest weight models. You have modules that come from the That comes from those that are neither highest nor lowest weight. And the one main point is that these modules that come from highest, neither highest nor lowest weight, relaxed weight, there we have a whole continuous series, one says of coherent family of modules. And these relaxed highest weight modules sometimes they are not irreducible, but indecomposable, but this irreducibility, this indecomposability comes This indecomposability comes from the top level, so they are already reducible but indecomposable on the top level, on the level of the SL2 horizontal sub-algebra. And now, if this were the complete story, then I would declare this to be not terribly exciting. So we have to go on. And now the point is that we have actually more modules. We have actually more modules, and for this, this funny symbol sigma star comes into play. So, this is called spectral flow. And now we take an element L in the integers. So, think about the integers here as the co-weight letters of SL2. In my normalization, the root letters was 2z. So, the weight letters in this normalization is z. And I'm just saying it for generalizations purposes. So then we define sigma L on E n to be E n minus L. Let me first write down how we define it and then Write down how we define it and then say tell you what I mean by this. So, by the En, Fn, and Hn, I mean the corresponding elements of the F hein Lie algebra SL2, right? So, that means the N is. So that means the n is here an index that goes over the integers. And this sigma l on the en and fn, it shifts this index, which we call the mode index, but by plus minus l. And the h n are almost left invariant, except the h0 is shifted by a constant proportional to the level. Now the group of affine-weiled translations is exactly Translations is exactly z, and these are automorphisms induced from affine wild translations. So, this is an out one can check in this case explicitly that this gives us an automorphism of the affine d algebra SL2 at level k. So, that means where the central element acts by the by the integer by the number k. So, and whenever we have an automorphism, then we can twist. Automorphism, then we can twist the module by the automorphism. What does this mean? This means for a given module m hat, a module of SL2, of F and SL2, we can define the module twisted by the automorphism sigma to the L and we call this the spectrally flowed spectrally flow twist. Of m hat and the action, what's the how is the action defined? So, you take an element x of the affine Lie algebra, or it's universal enveloping algebra, and you act on a vector, and then it's defined to be the action twisted by the automorphism. By the outer morphism, the usual thing. Now, why is this interesting? This is interesting because you see this automorphism maps E0 to E minus L and F 0 to F plus L. What it does, it changes our embedding of the horse. Changes our embedding of the horizontal sub-algebra SL2 inside the affine L-algebra SL2. Usually you embed the SL2 by mapping EFH to E0, F0, H0. But here now we map it to E minus L, F L and H0 shifted by minus L times K. And this means if we start with a lower bounded module, that means that That means that it has some top level and be twisted by a spectral flow, then it will be lower bounded with respect to the twisted embedding of the horizontal sub-ashramant. And so this means, in particular, with respect to our original weight grading, it will not be lower bounded anymore. So this is the This is an important spectral flow twist of lower twists of lower bounded modules. And I have to write usually because you can have coincidences. So this means this. So, this means this spectral flow gives you a zoo of possibilities, namely here now a whole integer family, of constructing new modules. And now, so this is a kind of good news, namely we have this Deujou algebra that Drajen and Anton used to classify lower bounded modules, and then we have this just f and try. This is just f and automorphisms used by f and while translations to give us a zoo of new modules that are not lower bounded. Now, of course, the question that arises is, are these all modules? Well, the answer is almost yes. And how do we understand this? And in particular, are there non-trivial extensions? Are there non-trivial extensions in these modules? And there was a super nice result by Dražen a few years ago, which I must say I really like. And so Dražen Adamovich calls these logarithmic modules. And so he did something very smart. So I may, well, let me maybe first write down the answer and then I tell you what he did. So he constructed certain non-trivial extensions of modules. And I think the best way to picture this is via the Louvre diagram. Chances we have a movie diagram. And here s goes from between 2 and v minus 2. In the case, s equals 1 and v minus 1 is very similar. It is actually almost exactly the same. It's just I would need to introduce a little bit further notation. So let's go back a little bit. I've told you here that these highest weight modules, D plus RS, they have. They can be extended by these spectrally flown modules. And now, what Darjan proved is that they cannot only be extended by these modules, but actually they fit into a larger indecomposable module having four composition factors. And it was at that time a long-standing conjecture that these Lurie diagram, I mean, these Lurie. A Lurie diagram. I mean, these logarithmic modules exist, but also that they are projective and injective in a suitable category. Okay. And so now let me lose a few words how Dražen constructed it, because this methodology is very useful. It's very well known that one can embed affine vertex algebras in some free field algebra. This fermates under the name. This film is under the name Wakimoto Freefield Realization. But unfortunately, this realization only holds for the universal and the fine view A and not its simple quotient. However, what Drahljen realized is you can take this free field realization, embed this in an even larger structure, with the advantage that this larger structure factorizes into a Virasau algebra and some kind of Kind of mixed free field algebra. But the Virasova algebra admits in the universal Virasova algebra, of course, admits in homomorphism to its simple quotient. And this means, and this homomorphism to the simple quotient induces a homomorphism of the universal affine SL2 into some quotient of it inside this smaller structure. Structure and Drajon was able to prove that this always realizes at admissible level the simple fine VOA. And so this means he was able to realize the simple fine VOA inside the rational VR sober Elgeba time sum, somehow strange free field structure. But free field always means very simple. And that was a very good news because then you can just take Virasaur times. And you can just take VRSO times free-field modules, and they immediately give you modules for SL2 for the affine VOA. And these were exactly the relaxed size weight modules and the spectrally flown images. But even better, he was able to deform the SL2 head action using screening charges to get these logarithmic modules. And so I really want to stress this point. I think this is an achievement because we had no idea how to construct this logarithmic. No idea how to construct these logarithmic modules. And the Durham methodology is, in principle, something very general, modulo, that it's unfortunately very tedious and the details are very difficult to do the construction. So Rajan, Naoki Gendra and myself, we are at the moment working exactly on this problem for SL3. Okay, anyway, now the main question here is Main question here is: Do we now know all modules of the affine vertex algebra at admissible level? And this question Tomiyuki asked me four or five months ago. And it turns out we can answer this question. So, this is work in progress of Tomiyuki Kazuya and myself. And myself. And this theorem says, as an abelian category, we understand as a two admissible level. Let me phrase this a little bit more precisely. So these low-earth modules are projective and injective. And in addition, they are. And in addition, they are projective cover and injective aisle of these modules, of these highest weight modules, D plus RS, in which category? That's what we of course have to say. In the category, so we first have to ask ourselves what's a good category to look for. What's a good category to look at? And we decided we have to look at the category of smooth weight modules. And here, K is an admissible level. And more generally, a complete list of projective and injective modules. And active modules is given by the generic relaxed highest weight modules, which are simple and projective. Here, lambda cannot be equal to the two forbidden values and the spectrally flow images. The spectrally flow images of these logarithmic modules constructed by Adamovich and R and S going over the usual index set. So this was somehow a question one has been looking for a long time. So you see You see, quite a few people have worked on this problem, right? Adamovich, Milas, David Redoubt, Simon Wood, myself, and Kazuya, and now also Tomi Yuki, and many others. And even in the case of SL2, and we even had a lot of problems classifying everything. And the reason is just that it's very demanding. That it's very demanding to work with modules that don't have any nice finiteness conditions. And so, right, because these logarithmic modules, these PRS, they have some finiteness condition, but much less nice than what we are used to. They are definitely very far away from being lower bounded, for example. Anyway, let me also tell you a few. Let me also tell you a few words on how we prove this. So, we first of all do understand two things. We understand, and that's a general thing, that extensions in the category of lower bounded modules comes entirely from the horizontal sub-algebra, from the finite dimension Lie algebra. That's very good news because that means it's related to a finite Lie theory problem. Yeah, a finite D theory problem. And moreover, yeah. Sorry, sorry to interrupt that. I noticed that there is a notation change here. You're talking about a finite dimension of the algebra. The P, the earlier for the D, plus or minus, you have a hat. Now here you don't have a hat. Yeah. Thank you for noticing. This is, I completely forgot. Thank you very much for noticing. I completely forgot to put the ad. Put the ad. Yeah, so it turns out the lower bounded models are classified by removing the head. And now it also turns out that there's an extremely efficient criterion that tells us, tells you that X1 vanishes. So X1 between... So X1 between a lower bounded module and a non-lower bounded module can only be non-vanishing if a certain lowest rate condition is satisfied, which almost never is satisfied. And these two criteria seem to be very good. At least it turns out in the SL2 case, these two criteria, together with the existence of this logarithmic module by a Gaussian. This logarithmic module by Gaussian, which I mean, is really just an existence statement of certain extensions, fix the category, the block structure of the category, I mean, the extension structure uniquely. So it's just a matter of playing a few weeks with long exact sequences and chromology to see that what we know uniquely fixes the catary. The category. So it's a little bit stupid, right? So it means we do what we can and observe that this uniquely fixes the category. Okay, I didn't tell you what the smooth rate module is, and now I want to do an excursion about possible categories of affine vertex super algebra. And a smooth is somehow the largest category that. The largest category that is still nice enough for the moment, I would say. So this is the so let G be a Lie supply algebra now and get in general. And let's take B to be the killing form. And normalize in the usual way, such that long would have norm two. And by the fine v a we mean at that level k we mean the killing. The killing form normalized with k. And by a module, if I say module in the following, I mean a module for the affine Lie algebra at this level. That is also a module for the vertex. For the vertex edge. Okay, so this is kind of the preliminary for the section. So the largest category we like to look at is the category of smooth weight modules. It's denoted by CKG. Okay, I don't know what happened. Category of smooth weight modules. But what it means is the module M is smooth as a G-H module. So this means if you fix an element in M and an element X, Xn in G hi. And you know, I mean, an element in your Lie algebra x, then there exists a sufficiently large mode xn such that xn annihilates this element. So it's a finite smoothness is a finiteness condition. But it's a finiteness condition that, for example, is satisfied by all the modules that I have presented for SL2. I have presented for SL2. So it's a fairly weak one. And the weight condition is that we want every module to decompose into weight spaces. So this means lambda here is the usual weight for G, the horizontal subalgebra, and delta is conformal weight. And And what we want is that for a fixed lambda, if I take the conformal weight, now I guess I forgot to have to put a minus sign again. That these rate spaces vanish if I take the for fixed g rate. G rate, I could take the conformal rate low enough. And now, next thing is we would like to put a finite as an extra label. And here we demand in addition that these weight spaces are finite-dimensional. So, for all such pairs. So, for all such pairs of weight and conformal weight. Now, it turns out for SL2, every category of finite smooth weight models and of smooth weight modules do coincide. This is a happy SL2 coincidence, which unfortunately does not persist for higher rank. Then one has the category RK. RK inside this one, where one in R stands for relaxed weight. And here the additional condition is that the modules are lower bounded. So this means this cadio Rk is the one that you can, for which you can classify simple modules using Juice algebra. Then we can put an extra label finite. If we want to demand that weight spaces again finite-dimensional, and then finally, the last category is the most famous one, which is OK, right? The ordinary modules. That's the subcategory of finite weight modules for which I have the property. Which have the property that the sum over all the conformal weight spaces, this means the sum over all weights of the m lambda delta are already finite dimension. They are ordinary SVA modules. Okay, so to tell you in our In our SL2 case, it turns out that these categories of finite smooth weight models and of smooth weight modules coincided. And that was the category we eventually looked at, the category of lower bounded modules, this RK of G, that was the one that came from the horizontal sub-algebra. And then the ordinary modules were just this LR, the finite number of modules. Finite number of modules that come from integrable representations of SL2. And I presented that we can do the classification in the case of SL2. And so let's ask ourselves what can we do for general G. And now I prefer to remove the super just because that. Just because that is difficult, it becomes then very difficult. Now, there's a lot of progress on the simple modules in the category of lower bounded weight modules by Kazuya Kavasetsu and David Ridaud. So they have So, they have put a lot of effort into this the last years. I think some work is also with Simon Wood. And in our work, we have the following nice statement that any simple module in the category of finite smooth weight modules, so this means not no lower bounded condition. Is a spectral flow twist of a lower bounded module. So something we already observed for SL2. And we shouldn't claim too much credit for it because this follows fairly quickly by a very nice result. Quickly, by a very nice result by Fotoni. So, and actually, somebody else, I forgot his name, I'm sorry. And we also have very efficient criterion for banishing of X1. I think this criterion is very good, and it also applies for super algebras. For first extensions. But the very big problem which prevents us from having more progress is do the Adamovich construction. This is unfortunately technically not good for us at the moment. And so, how can we prove that we have certain projects? That we have certain projective models, but if we can't even prove their existence, right? That is the challenge. And one reason it's not only a technical challenge, but we also have problems having a good idea. So, but probably fairly soon, Dražan, Naoki, and I will have a paper where we explain quite a bit on this for SL3. Now, let me go back to the Now, let me go back to the beginning of my slides. So, Matt Rupert, he worked a lot on unrolled quantum groups. And unrolled quantum groups are supposedly via logarithmic Kashmir-Lushik correspondence related to the higher rank versions, to the general Lie algebra version of. To the general Lie algebra version of the famous singlet algebras. But now there exists a close relation between singlet algebras and certain nice or special W algebras. And very, very rarely these W algebras are also F-hank verticals algebras. But one case is the case of fourth root of unity of unrolled quantum group of SL3. And that supposedly has a very Supposedly has a very nice relation to affine vertex algebra of SL3 at the admissible level minus 3 over 2. And there's another project in progress with Matt Rupert and David Redoubt, where we explore this relation in a lot of detail. In particular, we give a full classification and structure of all modules of this unrolled quantum group. And in particular, this picture. Group and in particular, this picture is the visualization of the projective cover of the tensor identity of the unrolled quantum group. In particular, this means we are logarithmic Kashner-Lushtik correspondence conjecturally. This is how the projective cover of the affine VOA of SL3 at level minus 3 over 2 in the category of smooth weight modules looks like. And so you see. And so you see every dot represents a composition factor. This is the Lervy diagram. So, what it means is here, this dot on the bottom means the submodule, the affine VOA itself. And then it has five layers. And the second layer has six dots. So there are six simple ones. The middle layer has 10 and 6 and 1 again. And the arrows denote actions. Denote actions and the different colors denote decomposition in terms of something what you should think about as verma-like modules, relaxed high state modules. And I can tell you, it took us a while to come up with all this. And this should be considered the simplest case beyond SL2. And anyway, I think this picture is quite pleasant, but it's anyway. Anyway, the state of the arts, right? The talk is, I would like to present the state of the art of categories beyond semi-simplicity is that we slowly have to go to more complicated examples and resort on some methods, like here, conjectural correspondence to unrolled quantum groups to get ideas of what kind of projective modules. What kind of projective modules we get. Anyway, I think it is not impossible to prove that this conjecture is true, but it would surely take some work. Anyway. Ah, Simon, you're there. Hi. No. I think this has nothing to do with WPQ. So, Simon, there are also triplet and singlet algebra analogs of a more complicated type, which have been particularly studied by Simon Wood. And they have the enormous additional difficulty that the VOA itself is not a simple. UA itself is not simple. And Simon was able to determine, or yet, actually, I don't know how old it was. Anyway, the Lovy diagrams of those in that case were known and they have a somehow similar form. But there's no connection to this WUPQ triplets or signlets. Not to my knowledge. Good. And this was done by Simon Ingo and Matthias Garva, dear Ingo Onke, who's probably also here. Hi, Ingo. Okay, good. Where am I? Now let me. So up to now, I have So, up to now, I have told you what I personally do now about the abelian categories of affine vertex algebras beyond integer levels. And now I will tell you what I do know about vertex tensor category structure. This is the last part and we'll. And we'll be quick now. So, luckily, Jinwei Young was here in Alberta for the last couple of years. And we focused on the problem: what kind of vertex tensor category structure can we establish on VO? Structure can be established on VOAs that are not of the nice type. This means they are not rational, not C2 co-finite. And we did this in a bunch of examples, but we have one kind of NICE theorem which is what it is. So we take V to be a VOA and such that any simple Simple ordinary module module is C1 cofinite. So remember at the beginning I defined C2 cofinite and I told you you can replace the two by any positive integer, in particular also C1 cofinite. So C2 cofiniteness implies C1 cofiniteness, but the other way around. The other way around is, in general, not true. So, and but C1 cofiniteness is thus a weaker finiteness condition than C2 cofiniteness. But Miyamoto established that the fusion product of C1 cofinite modules is C1 cofinite again. That's of course a nice property because I mean if you want to establish a tensor category structure, it's better. It's better be closed under your potential tensor product. And then we take all grading restricted generalized Mormon modules. So these are modules that come via a universal construction from modules of from Jus algebra's modules, modules for Jus algebra. For Juice algebra, and we need that all these modules are of finite length, and then we have a vertex tensor category structure. So, sloppily speaking, we get what extensor category with ordinary models are C1 co-finite and we have a finite length. one co-finite and the other finite length of property. So this is somehow a good theorem, but ordinary is still quite restrictive. Let me give you a list of examples where this applies. So it applies very So it applies very well to the category of ordinary modules of an affine Lie algebra. Because a module of an affine Lie super algebra is a C1 cofinite if and only if it is ordinary. While in general it is very hard to establish cofiniteness, for affine vertex algebra is something that you get for free. It's something that you get for free. And so you get it, for example, for affine these super algebras if the level is an irrational number and the even subalgebra is semi-simple. Is semi-simple. I should say removing the semi-simplicity of the even sub-algebra is a technicality that I plan to give to a master or PhD student. It's a little bit tedious, but I don't think it should be too difficult. Another case which actually was the starting point of our collaboration. Starting point of our collaboration. If k is admissible, and g is a Lie algebra. So the first statement also holds for G super algebra. This is why there's a restriction on the even subalgebra. And it also holds if G is equal to OSP1 to N. And this Lie-Algebra case is work of Jinwei Yiji. Of Jinvei, Yiji, and myself. And then the next case is, in some sense, the best one, K non-zero and G, the L super algebra GL1 slash one. So this is a work by Robert and Jenway and myself. And then there's also a bunch of There's also a bunch of non-admissible examples, but this is case by case. And then, so this means, so an upshot is somehow if you don't have a category that has nice C1 co-finiteness content. C1 co-finiteness condition, we will have a hard time at the moment to establish vertex tensor category. And this means if we go back to the list of categories, the category of ordinary modules is the smallest one. So we have a general theorem that guarantees the existence of vertex tensor category at least for the smallest category of modules of an affine vertex algebra that we have. Okay, now. Okay, now of course we would like to have additional structure. And one thing we always would like to have, if possible, that this category is rigid. And that's also difficult to establish or because it's again case by case and each case is quite a bit of work. So if K is admissible and G is of type A, C, D. A C D E at the moment. I think we also had a few isolated cases in type B and OSP1 to N works as well. So you see really BFGR missing. It's not too much that is missing there. And it's only a matter of time to also add those. And GR1 slash more. Okay. Now, okay, this. Okay, this means the category of ordinary modules is one has an existence of vertex tensor category, and in some cases, one also has rigidity. There are a few more rigidity cases. I don't want to list all of those. Now, but what we really would like to do, we would like to get a vertex tensor category on the caddy of smooth weight modules. And this is, we don't know how to do this because that cadet is. Because that category is definitely not C1 co-finite. So let me first tell you what we do now or expect. The caddy of lower bounded modules will almost certainly not be closed on a tensor product. So this means this is simply not a candidate to look. Is simply not a candidate to look for a category tensor category structure. But the category of finite smooth weight modules, this is a C, is expected to be, and I also expect it to be actually always rigid, at least for admissible level, but extends okay. But extensor carry. So, this is a very open and probably very a lot of work to establish conjecture. Okay, so how can we deal with this problem? There are actually some partial results. So, first of all, even though that's not an FMBOA, but that's very close, Simon Wood and Robert Allen established. They established that the corresponding category of beta gamma has a rigid vertex tensor category structure. And they established this by relating it to a modified C1 co-finite condition that Jinmei had worked about. And what they essentially related it to is that SL2 has a Heisenberg sub-algion. A Heisenberg sub-algebra. Heisenberg algebra has good tensor category. And then one can ask: what about the corresponding Heisenberg coset? That's called the para fermion algebra. And for modules of that algebra, C1 cofiniteness of those modules was known. So essentially, they reduced it to a C1 cofiniteness problem. One co-finiteness problem of coset, and this seems to be one general way to go. So, let me give you two examples. This means these are SL2 at level minus one half and SL2 at level minus four over three. So you see now I not only have to restrict to SL2, but also to specific levels. These two, much like the beta gamma goes. Much like the beta gamma gauss, so the beta gamma ghosts are essentially as reported level minus one half, are extensions of singlet VOAs. So singlet VOAs are the U1 orbifolds of the famous triplet VOAs times something very simple, namely Heisenberg VOAs. And generate Jinway, Robert, and I, we already had worked on vertex tensor category of the singlet VUA, but only on a very small subcategory, the accessible one, the one that comes from ordinary Virasovo modules. But now we are actually also able to establish vertex tensor category for the singlet VOA for singlet. And now I say plus hopefully vigility because we haven't done this yet. Because we haven't done this yet. But we have ideas on that, will appear. So this will be joint work with also with Shashank. And this means, and an immediate consequence is that the same holds for the affine VOAs. Fine VOAs. And in fact, a consequence will be that the same holds also for a bunch of interesting sub-algebra W algebras. But that's not the topic of this talk. So this is one way how one can express establish. Establish the existence of vertex tensor category on the largest good category of models of an f n vertex algebra, namely by passing to a coset, hoping that the coset has nicer finiteness properties, doing the job there, and then extending. Big problem is it's a case-by-case analysis, and every case is an enormous amount of work. I should also say that the case of SL2 at level minus one half, interestingly, also follows directly from the GL1 slash one story, because there is something going on that presently one is more and more understanding that these Fagen-Frenkel duality of W algebras nicely generalizes beyond principle W algebras. Principle W algebras and in particular also generalizes to certain affine VOAs. But the Fagen-Frankl dual, in some sense, is a super, W super algebra. So in particular, the Fagen-Frankel dual to beta gamma goes, which is not really a... Anyway, it also fits into this picture, is the affine vertex super algebra of GL1 slash one. And the interesting thing is that this duality. Think is that this duality is good enough that it gives a functor, actually a vertex tensor functor from representation categories from one to the other. But interestingly, on the superside GL1-1, all modules are ordinary. This means the theorem of Jinwei and myself does apply there. So, this means the and I think this is the way one has to go. So So, for example, for SL2, Fine SL2, the new Feynman-Fenkel dual type thing is the N equals 2 superfunct algebra. And it is a realistic hope that the categories of smooth weight modules of SL2 via this duality corresponds to the category of ordinary superconformal algebra modules, and that one can show vertex. And that one can show vertex tensor category there, and then the one on SL2 would follow immediately. So I say, in general, we need new technology, and that is quite a deep thing. But actually, Shigenori will exactly present these types of. No, he already did it. He already presented these types of to Aleti. Very good. Very good. So, this is what I wanted to say. So, my aim for these two hours was to give you an overview. What do we know about vertex tensor categories beyond semi-simplicity? I decided to focus on the affine ones because it's the best accessible one. And the upshot is unfortunately nice finiteness conditions are missing and they make. And they make that makes progress slow. But if you see at the dates of the theorems that I presented, they were all quite recent. So this means we seem to be on a good pay. Yeah, thank you very much for your attention.
