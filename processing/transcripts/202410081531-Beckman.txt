This is the background, just fun movie of from one of our camera traps of a two-front who's flown down and is eating some fruit from a cycotria shrub, which is a macabre point. So what really fascinates me is the multiple interacting patterns that influences the early stages of plant recruitment. This is when fruit is developing in the When fruit or developing in the canopy to seed dispersal, so the movement of a seed away from the tree, and then when seeds get deposited to what I call the seedscape, which are all the aspects of the biotic and abiotic environments surrounding seeds, that influence all later stages of plant recruitment because plants don't move. So it's these early stages where plants experience their highest mortality and have the ability to move. So what's happening? Need to move. So, what's happening here is really important for things like population persistence and spread and community diversity. And plants are dispersed by a variety of different vectors. They can be dispersed by wind, they can be dispersed by water like this coconut, they can be dispersed ballistically through mechanisms of the plant itself, or a variety of different mammals and insects, mainly ants. Ants. And in fact, most plants around the world are dispersed by animals, and the majority of plants in the tropics are dispersed by animals. And these different, so plant species dispersed by different vectors result in spatial patterns, but even within a species, you can have seeds that are dispersed by different vectors, and all of these result in different spatial patterns of plants that result in this initial spatial template of plants that influence all these later stages. That influenced all these later stages of abiotic and biotic interactions. And we're also undergoing global change drivers. Some of the important global change drivers are land use change, direct exploitation. So in this context, we can think of hunting of animals that are important seed dispersers, and climate change, because they can all influence dispersal vectors and their movement. And so understanding this context of global change, Change, I think it's really important to get a mechanistic understanding of what's happening at these early stages of plants' life cycle to be able to come up with predictive models of how plants may respond to global change. But as you can see here, these interactions tend to be very complex. They also occur over multiple spatial and temporal scales. They can be context-dependent. So understanding these mechanisms can be difficult. Understanding these mechanisms can be difficult empirically, but also challenging to look at mathematically or computationally. But I think we can make a lot of forward progress in these knowledge gaps. So these are two knowledge gaps I identified a few years ago in the seed dispersal ecology. So understanding how individual seeds move and understanding the demographic consequences of that movement. So we can make a lot of progress. So, we can make a lot of progress by taking these multi- or interdisciplinary approaches, getting perspectives from people who work on wind dynamics or water, animal movement, and plant demography, as well as working with mathematicians and statisticians to then be able to collect empirical data and simultaneously develop mechanistic models where there can be this iterative process between the two. So these large number of So, these large number of processes create this distinct paradox where we want to both embrace this complexity to be able to make predictions for specific systems, but we also want to reduce this complexity to be able to generalize across systems. And we can do that in a variety of different ways, but here I'm just going to focus on integrating models and data where we can use certain types of modeling approaches to get more generalizable understanding. Generalizable understanding and develop theoretical approaches, maybe combine with standardized empirical methods. But we can develop system-based approaches as well that get more of the mechanisms of specific systems and incorporate some of that uncertainty in the data as well. And so in my research, I'm interested in how seed dispersal influences the seedscape and then how this influences plant performance from germination all the way up to reproductive adult, how this influences population spread and persistence, and then how does it. And persistence, and then, how does scale-up to influence biodiversity and the system function? And then, how are these interactions disrupted under global change, and what are the consequences of that? So, our research group use a lot of interdisciplinary approaches to do this. We use experiments to get at those mechanisms, but these tend to be limited in spatial and temporal scope. We use statistical models to analyze observational data to get at the patterns, but these can point. But these could point to some of those mechanisms. We've also kind of branched off and done some chemical ecology to get a physiological mechanism of the plants and how that's mediating a lot of these interactions and seed dispersal, which I'm not going to talk about. And then, yeah, using all this information to develop mathematical multiplicational models. So I'm just going to give two short, very short vignettes on how we're trying to close some of these knowledge gaps on the movement ecology of seas and demographic consequences that CEPAS working on. Consequences of seed dispersal. So, this first one is linking seed dispersers movement to seed dispersal patterns. And this is work done by Benod Bora, who is a PhD student in my research group, who's currently a postdoc at Utah State University, and some collaborators that we have that work on movement ecology of primates and where we get all the data. And this builds from the movement ecology paradigm, which lays out this framework to. Lays out this framework to be able to understand the mechanisms of animal movement that be broken up into these three components: an internal state, like the physiological state, or the cognitive state of why those animals are moving. The navigation capacity, so where and when is the organism moving, and motion capacity, how are they moving, like flying, walking, etc. And all of these are influenced by external factors, which then result in a movement path. So, what we ideally wanted to do. So, what we ideally wanted to do is understand some of these drivers of animal movement and then how that influences seed dispersal patterns. So, we do that by using animal data from animal movement from our collaborators, where we can come up with these different behaviors based on their step lengths and turning angles. So, in these two behaviors that we are focused on are in a camp state where the animals take very short steps. Take very short step lengths but are turning a lot, which we call them hands. They could be resting or foraging in a traveling state where they have very long step lengths and they're not turning very much where they might be exploring their environment, for example. And these different movement patterns then influence the seed dispersal patterns. You might expect very clumped seed deposition patterns when they're encamped and more even seed deposition patterns when they're exploring their environment. And they might also be depositing. And they might also be depositing the seeds in different habitats. So, Bonneau developed this individual-based model, parameterized animal movement, remote sancing data, and then to predict the number of seeds in different micro-habitats and dispersal distances. And this was done with information from Barro, Colorado Island, which is in the middle of Panama Canal. The field station has been there since the development of this canal. So, 100 years of ecological information that has been coming out of this research. Information that has been coming out of this research station. And most of the plants there are dispersed by animals. These are just an example of some of the animals that disperse seeds. And the environmental data we had was from remote sensing that includes the location of gaps, the canopy height, and how steep the terrain is, which I'm not going to talk about. Our city system is this emergent canopy tree that is the only species. It is the only species that's fruiting in the dry season, so nothing else is fruiting. So it's an important food source for the spider monkey. We have aerial images of this emergent tree, and then so we know their locations of at least emergent trees. And then we have relocation data from eight individuals of spider monkeys at every four minutes. And then Binod used some animal movement analyses where he used, he could characterize these different behaviors based on the different environments. So the probability. Environment, so the probability of staying within a state or transitioning between the states depending on the environment. And he found that spider monkeys were more likely to encamp under a taller canopy, so increased canopy height and steeper terrain, such as ridges, where they can see better. And then when they were traveling, he used his integrated step selection analysis and found that spider monkeys tend to select taller canopies and steeper trains and avoid tree fall gaps. So then, So then I was really interested in how this influenced seed deposition patterns. So he simulated 500 dispersal events, so just from when the fighter monkey removes the fruit to deposition. And then he recorded the number of seeds in these different micro-habitats and recorded the dispersal distances. And then we also had a null model where the spider monkeys had no habitat selection, but the same distribution of behaviors. So what he found was that spider monkeys dispersed seeds. That spider monkeys disperse seeds shorter distances than our random foragers, so slightly shorter distances. So, spider monkeys are in red, random forager is in green, and these are the distribution of seed dispersal distances away from a breeding tree. Then you look to see how environmental factors influence the presence of a seed within a location. So, here this is seed count versus canopy height. And the spider monkeys tended to deposit. Spider monkeys tended to deposit more seeds in taller canopies compared to random forager, and less seeds in shorter canopies compared to a random forager. And this has important, this can be important for plant recruitment because under these taller canopy heights, the seeds would have been shown to have higher predation rates and lower germination success. And then the second most influential predictor of presence of the seed was canopy environment. So spider monkeys display. So spider monkeys disperse more seeds in the understory than a random forager and less seeds in a gap towards a random forager, which might provide a mechanism for some observations that have been found in Baro, Colorado Island. So this is the number of seeds and gaps relative to understories. So below one, there are more seeds in the understory versus a gap, especially in early stages of like right after a tree falls. Like right after a tree falls. So, potentially, one reason that has been hypothesized that we show is that these animals are actively avoiding these gaps because they're going to be stressful environments. And then, for the plants, these gaps also have high seed predation, but they're really good for plant growth. So, movement decisions of animals and heterogeneous environments determine the seed scape of individual seeds and overall seed dispersal patterns. And ideally, I would like to then understand. Understand what the consequences of this are for populations, biodiversity, and ecosystem function. And one proposal I've been reading with collaborators who work on birds, so this is a mannequin, they have this cold legging structure, so the males do this moon walk to attract the females. And then there's some juveniles, and they all have, anyway, different movement patterns. They're just Predicted movement patterns. That would then result in different seed deposition patterns. So we would ideally, if this got funded, look at the movement patterns of these birds, so looking at intraspecific variation in movement, link this to seed dispersal, and then feed this into a dynamic vegetation model, which is an individual-based model, to look at how this influences the diversity of the plants. And then, so my next vignette is motivated by the fact that there's lots of plants on Earth, and we have little information of these to inform conservation. And most models that are used to predict biodiversity responses to climate change or global change tend to ignore processes such as dispersal or make simplistic assumptions. And there's a variety of approaches that you can use to model the responses of organisms to global change. They can be more general, such as species. Be more general, such as species distribution models that tend to relate the occurrence of a species to environmental factors. These are more tractable and they require less information than, say, more process-based models that require lots of data. And here we're using this intermediate approach, so that includes some processes but doesn't require as much information. And this was funded in BAMP pre-pandemic. Pre-pandemic with these great collaborators, one of whom is here. So, this builds on integral difference equations where we have dispersal and demography, and we assume a Gaussian dispersal kernel and arithmetic growth rate, where we can then look at this, use mathematical insights to look at the spreading rate and critical patch sizes and ask the following questions. So, what is the global distribution of plant species vulnerabilities to climate change? species vulnerabilities to climate change and habitat loss what is the probably what is the probability populations can keep up with climate change and habitat loss and then and also how does correlation on life history traits influence extinction risk and and again this is motivated by just the lack of so the data and ecology is growing and becoming more accessible but it's still fairly sparse for individual species so this is some of the just a summary of the data that we have we have Summary of the data that we have. We have this distribution of dispersal coefficients for 760 species, and then we have population growth rates for 792 species. But the overlap in both dispersal and growth rate for these species is fairly low. So to look at the global distribution of plant species vulnerabilities to climate change, one way we can do this is just independently sample from population growth rates and dispersal coefficients. Growth rates and dispersal coefficients, and then assume we're making realistic combinations of species we might see in nature, and then plot the distribution of spreading speeds here and see what the proportion or the probability of a species or population is, the probability of them being able to keep up with the velocity of climate change. And what I've plotted here is a velocity of climate change that has been reported in the literature. And by doing this, we find that about 4% of the species has spreading speeds that are greater than the one. Running speeds that are greater than the velocity of climate change and that we predict would be able to keep up. But other approaches that we came up with is using different, instead of just assuming, using the empirical distribution, we could just assume some distributions. So these are the different distributions. So by doing that, we can then come up with a probably density function for the spreading speeds, assuming you've Assuming either the dispersal coefficient D or the population growth rates are random variables and one of them is fixed, or that both of them are random variables and follow these different distributions and then calculate out the probability density functions. We can do this for spreading speeds, for critical patch sizes, and then I've just plotted them out here and then we can look to see what some of the patterns are. So one of them is when D was spig, so spreading speed distributions tend to have longer tails. Tend to have longer tails. And then we can do the same for critical patch sizes. So here I'm using, I've just arbitrarily picked some patch size that tends to be recommended in the literature for conservation purposes. And then we can use that as a way to see if the critical patch sizes for these hypothetical populations is bigger than this arbitrary value. So here I've calculated. So here I've calculated out the probability that the spreading speeds are, so the probability of extinction, or extinction risk. So the probability speed is less than the predicted velocity of climate change. As you can see, it varies depending on the distribution that you use, but most of them tend to be, most of the extinction risks tend to be lower when we assume some distribution than when we use the empirical distributions. So for example, So, for example, extinction risk is higher when R is fixed compared to when D is fixed, and then extinction risk can increase or decrease depending on the distribution when assuming both R and D are ring-boo variables. And this is just viewing it a different way. So, this is looking at persistence, which I've calculated as one minus extinction risk. And you can see that, well, and so, and for a range of different climate velocities, not just one that was reported in the literature, and so you can see the persistent decreases of climate velocity. Decreases as climate velocity increases. And then we can do something similar for patch sizes, so which I've done here. And then, so finally, I also looked at how correlation between dispersal coefficient and population growth rates could influence these values. And so here, rho is the correlation between dispersal and population growth rates. And as these become more positive, As these become more positively correlated, the extinction risk decreases. So, this is a kind of a proof of concept of when we have limited information, how we can use parametric distributions of probably density functions to calculate some extinction risk. And of course, it depends on your assumptions and your parameters that you use, but can give you maybe a range of extinction risk and more information to play out that complements existing approaches. Approaches. But there's some future directions that could be interesting to. So we assume unstructured populations, so it would be interesting to include structured populations. So Gaussian, most plants have longer tails, so it would be also interesting to extend this to more realistic dispersal kernels and to extend this to heterogeneous environments and think about whether the probability of plants being able, or any organism to be able to. For any organism to be able to keep up under landscape fragmentation under climate change. So, with that, thank you. Thank you. Are there any questions? It's a very interesting talk. For the first part, for the dispersal, because you have like a hundred years data, have you looked at the change of the At the change of the diffusion pattern or something over the time, and then you can see if there's any climate change or land use change, what contributes to the different type like pattern of the diffusion or dispersal patterns? Say that again? Have you looked at whether the dispersal patterns that you show will change over the years in the first part of the monkeys? Yeah, no, we haven't. Ours are very. Uh, no, we haven't. Ours are very short time scales, so just one tree. And the animal movement data that we have is just from one season too. But it, oh, but yeah, so it would, so and so the motivation for writing this grant was different from mannequin is doing something like that to see how over like 100 years how this animal. So the idea is to get an understanding of what's driving animal movement across a precipitation gradient, which could be an Which could be an indicator for climate change, and then derive some dispersal kernels that we could feed into them with a dynamic vegetation model that we could simulate for longer time periods, and then have also different assumptions for germanium growth under different precipitations. Does that answer your question? Okay, yeah, so that would yeah, 'cause yeah, the primate study is yeah, it's only like like a one breeding system, yeah. One fruiting system. But yeah, ideally it would be nice to do it over again. One percent. So it's interesting, your animal movement, you're thinking about capt and travel. Friends that I think about animal movement and exploitation and exploration. Okay, yeah. Yeah, but but but they're Yeah. But they're different words for the same thing. You know, the creatures will move long distances throughout the ways to try to find things and stop there trying to consume them. So we don't think you think there's some sort of animal point about your animal, you have a certain kind of environment. Oh, is it good for you to move? Yeah. And what do you have to do to achieve that? And you're looking at it from the point. And you're looking at it from the point of view of you've got animals that are doing that, what patterns are going to be more or less helpful for the plants. But ideally, the animals and the plants are going to want to find each other. So there's interesting, but probably not possible to sort of put it together so you you can think about it as a holistic system overall. System overall. Yeah, that would be the ideal. Like, this is just looking really just as like they ate something, they moved, and like pooped it out, and that's the simulation. But ideally, and Vinode 1 has started the bigger, is thinking about how they're moving. You had to find these resource patches and how they're responding to that. And then you would have some feedback of how the treaties are maybe changing. That would be really cool. Yeah, there should be a feedback thing. And I would guess. And I would guess that if conditions are favourable, it would lead to feedback right, it would be better for both populations, but perhaps the animals. But it would be really cool if you look like that. It would be really cool, yeah. Yeah, that is called truth matching, I believe. My question is, how is fragmentation going to affect? Tom Blackjoy did experiments where he fragmented parts of structures. Parts of tropical forests. I don't remember its results, but do you know if that's had effects on the state dispersal? Yeah, so the first study was mainly done on Baroque Lural Island, so it's all on the island, and we're seeing everything that happens on the island. But with the mannequins, our initial proposal that we did submit, which was too ambitious, was looking at a gradient of precipitation with fragmentation to get a dissynergistic effects of both, but then we decided that was too. But then we decided that was too complicated, especially following these birds and these different landscapes, and also, I guess, dangerous to do so, like some of the landscapes that they work on. Yeah, and then the other work as well, I've been hoping to expand that to include some heterogeneous environments and think about fragmentation too, but haven't gotten there. Yep, something that we definitely have thought about, but not there. Keep me holding our state for any questions for the session.
