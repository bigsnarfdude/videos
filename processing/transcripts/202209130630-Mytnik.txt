Thank you, Sam, for the introduction, and thank you to organizers for inviting me to give a talk at this conference. So I'm going to talk about speed of propagation of stochastic reaction diffusion equations. But before we go to start talking about stochastic equations, Stochastic equation. So, I say a few words about deterministic reaction diffusion equations, in particular the important class of deterministic reaction diffusion equation, that means KPP equation. So, Fischer KPP equation, which is Fischer, Kolmogorov, Petrovsky, Piskonov equation. Of equation, and here is the very particular case of such equation, which is lives in R, so evolves in space. The solution is derivative in time equals to Laplacian plus the drift term u times one minus u. And we will be talking about solution that takes values between zero and one. And one. There is one of the motivations for studying such equations, a biological one. One can think about population which lives in R and U T X is the proportion of population and time t at site X with the advantages gene. Members of the population move a trend. Population moves at random, and this gives rise to this Laplacian term. So, we can think about Brownian motion, and this gives rise to this term in the equation. And more feed members replace less feed, and frequency of interaction, which leads to interaction leads to the increase in the feed population, is proportional to the number. Is proportional to the number of members in each population, feed and unfeed. So in the end, in the equation, it's proportional than U2 times 1 minus U. This is a fit. This is not feed. So the feed population propagates. Now, there is a, so you can see this equation, there is a particular class of solutions which Of solutions which we call traveling wave solution, which means, so which means that if we look, there is some constant C, and if you look at the solution of the equation in the vicinity of this, of the C times T, you will see. t you will see the function uc which is easy to check it solves this ordinary differential equation and the profile of so the the profile of the population will look like this and it travels to so this looks like function u and this travels to the right with speed c okay and the so for this equation the boundary For this equation, the boundary condition at infinity at zero at minus infinity at one. This picture is a bit misleading. So I can think that here, for example, the value is zero, here it is one, but it's misleading. The solution is really positive for all values of x, it's just very small, and it's less than one for all values of x. And this comes from. Values of x, and this comes from the fact that Laplacian does allow the solution to hit zero or one. Okay, clearly there are also other solutions to such equations, not only trebolant wave solutions. And mainly in this talk, we'll talk about initial conditions which are in the space. Which are in the space Ci, which we call the space of continuous functions with compact interface. So these are functions such that so if this is say one, then you have some point you may call. Some point, you may call it L0, such that to the left of this point solution is one, and there is function, there is point, let's call it R zero, such that to the right of this point, another solution, the initial condition is zero. So this will be initial, maybe initial condition for our. Condition for our equation, there is some degenerate case which will be, which also can be considered. It's not in this class, but somehow very close, the heavy-side initial conditions, which will look like this. And so this is the class of function Ci. And it turns out that if we start with such initial conditions, then the solution to this equation will also propagate to the right. To the right, and if there exists a function mt depending on t such that mt over t converges to some constant c star. And if we look at the solution of this KPP equation in the vicinity of mt, then s t goes to infinity, this solution. This solution will converge to this traveling wave function, which we defined in the previous slide, with a specific constant C star. Okay? Where C star equals in this case to square root of two, which is in fact the minimal possible speed for the traveling wave solution to non-negative traveling wave solution to this equation. negative traveling wave solution to this equation. So all traveling waves, there is a minimal speed, the minimal speed is given by C star. Okay, so any kind of any again solution to this equation starting with this class finished condition will in the end converge to the traveling wave with the to this function traveling wave with minimal speed to this stationary solution with minimal statistical surface if you look at the VC If you look at the vicinity of MT. And one can ask how, okay, clear that the leading order of MT is T times C star. Bramson asked the question: can we get the further expansion? So how the next terms looks like. And he found out that the correction, there is a next term correction to this linear behavior, which is some constant. Which is some constant, specific constant type log t, all this still doesn't depend on initial condition. No matter what initial condition in this class you take, you get these leading terms in the behavior of mt. But there is also the additional constant, which indeed depends on the initial condition. All this as time goes to infinity. Time goes to infinity. Yeah. Yeah, can I ask a question? Sure. So, is this U C star still the solution to the ordinary differential equation you were? Yes, it is. Okay, here you have solution for many C's, but the minimal C for which you have solution in this class will be C star. Okay. Okay. But you have also solutions for greater C's, which mainly corresponds if you start with initial conditions which decay slowly. Which decay slowly at infinity. And they somehow decay at infinity will be transferred into the speed of propagation. Since this somehow decays very rapidly, it's zero starting from some point. That's why you get the minimal speed of propagation. Okay. There are more, you can consider more general drift. So if you can replace this. So, if you can replace this drift by some functions, so FU. There are some conditions, they should be in a kind of KPP class. Important by these Lipschitz, it's zero at zero, zero at one. And in this case, so the C star is defined as square root of two times the derivative of f at zero. So in fact, the minimal speed is determined by the derivative function f. Derivative function f at zero. And from this, by the way, you can immediately conjecture and think that if you have some function, which, for example, looks like square root of u near zero, then the solution propagates with infinite speed. In fact, it propagates immediately to infinity and so this. So this existence of finite derivative is essential for existence of the finite speed. Okay, any questions? Now we move to the stochastic KvP equation. So we take the same basic example of KVP equation of u. Example of Caripi equation of u times one minus u term. And we add the noise, which is a multiplicative noise. W dot is Gaussian space-time white noise. I probably don't need to explain what is it. It's the noise with this covariance function. And it's multiplied by square root of u1 minus u of the solution and some parameter sigma which keeps somehow. Keep somehow says as how strong is this noise perturbation. Formally, you can think about variance of this storm, variance of this square root times delta g gx of the noise as this function times gxdg. Okay, this gives you the variance in the space-time area gxdg. XDG. Again, one can motivate it by saying that, okay, before we get this term, since we had this interaction between feet and unfeet, and feet always wins, here can say that the outcome of interaction between feet and unfeet may be random, which gives rise to the noise. And interactions between feet and unfeet are independent at different space-time points, which gives rise to the white noise. Which gives rise to the white noise in the perturbation and the rate of interaction proportional to the number of feet and unfeet individual or when we scale them, it's proportional to u times 1 minus u. And this gives us multiplication noise with this variance, which gives us this equation. Okay, any questions? Okay. And we are interested in the behavior of the solution to this equation. This equation was studied thoroughly many years. So again, this is the equation. And again, CI is the class of functions with. The class of functions with a compact interface. And again, so as a so let's do it again here. This may be your zero. And the question is what happens with the solution to this equation if you start with this compact interface. With this compact interface, okay. Let's say this is L0, this is R0. And it turns out that, so Carl and Sowers, so they showed that in fact, compact interface property is preserved for this equation, which means for any time t, the solution to this equation is also. Equation is also in this class. So you may say that. So it looks, will be looking, your solution will be like this. Okay. So this will be RG, this will be LG. Okay. So compact center. And so you can see that this is in fact in So it's not in contrast with what happens in the deterministic case when sigma equals zero. As I said, in the deterministic case, the solution is positive everywhere, it's less than one everywhere. So adding this noise, this type of noise, somehow creates the killing effect that whenever mass tries to propagate, it immediately Propagate it is immediately killed by the noise, and so one can so people who I know the superprocesses, the present of square root of u in front of the noise shows you that in fact there will be compact support property, should be compact support property, since branching tends to this kind of branching noise tends to kill the mass, the small mass. Okay, and the same with one minus u, it pushes mass up to one. It pushes mass up to one. Okay. And another thing you may ask: okay, what do we know about the propagation of the right edge of the support in this equation? And so again, Renzauer showed that for small parameter sigma, there exists a speed of propagation, which means Rt over T as T goes to. T over T as T goes to infinity converges to V dependent on sigma. Okay? And for other values of sigma, Connolly and During showed that in fact this limit exists. The speed of propagation of the right Horde exists for any value of sigma. And the next question, yes. Can I just ask a quick question? Just be sure the notation R of T is the same as R index T here. Ah, yes, yes, yes. Sorry. Yes, yes, yes, sorry. Yes, okay. And then do you have, does someone know a result about the propagation of L of T or is it not of interest? No, no, it's of interest. In this case, it goes like R of T. Yes, but in more general cases, really, very good question. And is there any like differential equation that when? equation that where R of T solution of for which R of T solution of now we don't know this we don't know the equation that R T is so okay we don't know thank you since it may go okay it's a complicated process so at least so for small times it may it may even jump yeah for example if here the population for example will die out Arctic may jump backward okay okay okay thank you it's pretty complicated Okay, okay, thank you. It's pretty complicated process and we don't know the we can yeah okay um okay now the next question which is interest of interest is dependence of this speed of propagation on this parameter sigma on the strength of the uh of the noise okay uh okay so this was this is our question So, this is our question. And in a paper with Carl and Jeremy Castell, okay, it's clear, by the way, yeah, that V of zero will be the speed of propagation of the deterministic equation. Okay, it's a bit different will be the definition there, what the speed of propagation means, but intuitively that when we take sigma to zero, we should go. See sigma two zero, we should go to deterministic uh speed, and this should give us the zero equals to square root of uh two. Okay, and the question is that for small sigma, so how so what will be the correction term, how fast the speed converges to square root of two. And in this paper with Carne and Jeremy, for small sigma, we showed that V sigma, okay, there is a square root of two. Okay, there is a square root of two, which corresponds to zero speed, and the equation slows down, and there is a correction term which is proportional to one over log sigma square. Okay? This verified the Brenet-Dredac conjecture of 97. Similar log correction you see in other papers related to Brin. Other papers are related to branching, different branching processes. So, I just mentioned some of them. And the same type of correction appears. In fact, this correction, okay, which was predicted by physicists, in fact, it's very surprising. Somehow, you would expect that if you put here some small noise, maybe correction will be polynomial in sigma, but it's not the case. In fact, it's huge correction for. Huge correction for small sigma bigger than any polynomial term. Okay, so and so one thing we should somehow notice that noise slows down the propagation. Okay, and you can somehow tweetily it's not clear. It's not clear, but intuitively reasonable, since here I say that noise kills the mass here. So, which means the small mass, which means that noise always kills the mass to the right, which somehow slows down and slow down is very special. Another question that one may ask, what happens if sigma is large? If sigma goes to infinity, for example, goes to infinity, then this noise is huge. Noise is huge, and what you probably would expect that the speed of propagation goes to zero, and this is indeed the case. Okay, if noise, if sigma goes to infinity, noise is so huge, then the equation doesn't have any positive speed of propagation. And in fact, Colin During the same paper, so get the okay, but the main question is how fast it goes to zero. It goes to zero and get the lower bound on the speed of progression as sigma goes to infinity. V of sigma is greater than equal than one over sigma square. Then when sigma goes to limit, this goes to one, and so means that v sigma essentially greater equal than one over sigma square. And the other conjecture was that, in fact, this is the right asymptotics, that the sigma behaves like one over sigma square for sigma. Over sigma square for sigma going to infinity. Okay. You may ask what happens. Yes. Is this still a conjecture? The fact that... No, I'll get back to this. We're verifying this conjecture. Okay, I'll get back to this. To what happens. Yeah, this conjecture was verified. For them, it was conjecture, but now it's not. The question is: what happens for more general drift? I ask if you put here not. May ask if you put here not u1 minus u, but you put some other function. For nice functions, which you call them of KPP type, which are leap sheds, f of 0 is 0, f of 1 is 0, and f of u is bounded by derivative of f at 0 times u. And if you take, okay, f prime of 0 equals to 1, then nothing Nothing so nothing new happens compared to this drift. We get the same first order it is correction to the speed. It's the same constant divided by log sigma square. Okay? So the same guy as for f of u, which is u times 1 minus u. Okay? The speed of propagation really is for the function in this class, in the KVP class. In this class, in the KVP class, is defined by derivative at zero. Okay, uh, you may ask: okay, what happens in the case when f is not necessarily Lipschitz, not necessarily in the KPP class. Before I get to this, I'll do some, give you another motivation for studying this KPP equations with noise. Okay, with Noise. Okay. If one consider the system of particles moving as independent Brownian motion, and suppose we start with one particle. Suppose we start with one particle at position zero. Each particle splits into at rate one, there is exponential clock independently of the others, and pairs of particles coalesce at rate Of particles coalesce at rate sigma square according to the intersection local time. Okay, so have you have part? Oops, sorry, you have a particle which goes like this. It may split at some point, it may split again at some point, this also may split, and at certain points, several particles get together, two particles get together, they spread sometimes together, and there is exponential clock. Variety square according to the intersection local time, how much time they spend together. After this, we'll coalesce and create just one particle which continues. And the process continues like this. Okay? So this is the system, and you may take here, for example, if this is time, this is the rightmost particle. Rightmost particle at time t of this branching coalescent system, RTBC. Okay? And again, so this t can be here or here. Sorry about this. And then there is very interesting duality relation, which is due to Shiger, which implies that probability that the rightmost particle is in the position which is greater than z. To get this probability, you should take the solution to our Should take the solution to our KPP equation, stochastic KPP equation, starting at heaviside initial conditions. Okay, so like this. This is U0. And then you check, take the expectation of the value of the solution to this SPD at time t point z, and this will give you this probability. Okay. And then, so essentially, this means that the speed of propagation of this equation, it bounds, or in this case, it's equal to the speed of propagation to the speed of the rightmost particle in this branching coalescence system. So it will be exactly the same speed as for this equation, as for this. For this equation, as for this equation. Okay, so it's kind of very interesting duality. And again, if you don't have noise, then this is just branching. And you get that the rightmost particle propagates with speed square root of two. This is what everyone dealing with branching Brownian motion knows this fact. But here you see that when you add coalescence, you can also, based on this duality, Evaluate the speed of propagation. And in fact, it also now, since there is this duality, it's again clear why the noise slows down the propagation. Clearly, the coalescence slows down the propagation of the system, since there are less particles in the system. Some of them coalesce. And when they coalesce, the speed of propagation goes down. And it runs out with. And it turns out that this duality allows us to get the speed of propagation of this particle. And by the way, so in this duality, so I don't want to show how it's good. This term corresponds to branching in the dual picture. And this term corresponds to coalescence in the dual picture. Okay? Okay. Okay. Uh just one just few words. Okay. Now you may ask, okay, what happens if I really, okay, we have this duality for this picture. And this, by the way, corresponds to binary branching. And the question is, if I want to get if If I want to get more general function here, I probably will get more general branching particle system. Okay, this is in reality with the branching binary branching colist particle system. Watching what happens in the case of if I want to have more general function f of u. And turns out that if I have more general branching such that probably Such that probability of k offspring is qk and μ is expectated, expected number of offspring, then I can take of f of u in this equation given by this relationship. You can easily check that for binary branching, it will give you u times 1 minus u. And the derivative of this function is mu minus 1, where mu is the expectation of the number of a sprint in The number of spring in the coalescent branching system. Okay? So it's known that this duality holds whenever expected number of offspring branching system is finite. Okay, it's known, but it's known. One can find it in the literature. We believe and conjecture that duality holds. Conjecture that duality holds also for the case when the expected number of offspring is infinite, which means the derivative of this function at zero is infinite. In fact, it's an ongoing project where we try to derive this. One can easily construct the branching law such that f of z of u f of z will be z to the p one minus z. be z to the p1 minus z which means it is held there with exponent p at zero okay it's just particular example but it's interesting that one can try to to to get this also for the fun have this duality also for functions which not necessary in the KPPF class not necessary difference okay And uh okay now the uh uh so this gives us motivation again. It's another motivation to study this equation since this is due in dual to some very non-trivial branching particle system where the branching law has infinite mean, which not much is not is known about this in presence of coalescence. About this in the presence of coalescence. If there's no coalescence, everything explodes if you have infinite mean. But in the presence of coalescence, it's maybe the picture is different. Okay, so we are going to study this equation again, behaviorist equation, sigma is not zero, for non-necessary difference function f. And the first question you ask, whenever this function is non-literate, and you have such equation, you ask whether there is Ask whether there is a unique solution to such equation. So, before studying this behavior, we would like to know whether there is a unique solution to such equation. And this was the first result in the joint paper with Carl and Leonier Rizzak, which shows that if the f of u is bounded by square root of u times one minus u, then there is a unique solution in law to this equation. And again, the And again, the interface is compact. LT and RT are almost surely finite. Okay? And this uniqueness in law, in fact, follows from Dawson-Gersanov theorem, which in fact allows you to say that any solution to this equation is absolutely continuous to the solution without drift. Solution without drift, without the storm, for which uniqueness is known. Okay, this is the first result, and the second result: this solution has speed V sigma for any C. Okay, any questions? Okay, so just pay attention that this is not So, if you don't know Dolson Gersanov, it's not very trivial to understand how we can get uniqueness when your drift is non-Lipse function. Okay? But also, we have this condition that it's power one half. This comes from those in your cell. Okay, having this at hand, so there is another second result in this paper. Suppose f of u is bounded by. f of u is bounded by u one minus u to the gamma over gamma some number any number greater than one half it's a bit a bit weaker than the previous one previous one we allowed gamma to be one half so we have such function here and it turns out that for any initial condition in this class again compact interface the so again so the question we ask here is what happens when the noise is large When sigma goes to infinity, and as I showed, said there is conjecture that this, in the particular case, when this is u times y minus u, sigma squared times v sigma goes to one. What we showed in this paper, that in fact, you can take pretty general class of functions, and there is a constant that depends on function you want to put. That depends on function, we don't want to put here the expression for this constant, but there is a constant depends on function such that in spec sigma square time v sigma converges to Cf. And this constant is less than infinity. And for the particular function f of u1, 1 mass u, which Conland-Doren considered, one can show that C of f equals 1. So this answers and verifies Conland-Doren conjecture. Conjecture. Okay, but it does more than this. It showed that, in fact, the asymptotic of the speed for a large class of non-necessary difference functions. Okay? Any questions? Okay. Now, the next question that we would like to address, remember, so we addressed the question. address the question what happens with this equation where f of u in the kpp class or in the simplest case u1 minus u and what happens for small noise when sigma goes to zero yeah and remind you in this case the speed converges to square root of two so some finite number which is the speed of propagation of the deterministic equation okay Okay? Now the question is what happens here when this is not necessarily a Libras function. Okay, not KPP class. And this is the work, joint work with great technical postdocs, Clayton Barnes and Reniao-san, which gives the following results. Suppose F is non-negative. Result: Suppose f is non-negative and f of u is less or equal than square root u one minus u. Why do we need this condition to have uniqueness of solution to this equation? The one we showed in the previous result. Okay? And now we assume that there exists p in region one half and one such that fu over u to the p, so lim nth and lim sup are bounded. This is bound away from zero. This is bound. Away from zero, this is about this is less than infinity. So essentially, you can think that f of u behaves like u to the p up to the constant for u which is close to zero. Okay? This is our drift function, okay, which is p is less than one, so it's non-so derivative at zero is infinity, which For zero is infinity, which means that the speed should converge to infinity. V sigma should converge to infinity. Since without noise, the speed of propagation is infinite. What was the main purpose of this work is to show how fast this V sigma converges to infinity. And it turns out that V sigma behaves like sigma to minus. Behaves like sigma to minus 2 and to this power, which depends on p. Okay, so v sigma behaves like this function. And it's a, you have lower bound, upper bound. We don't know if we don't know if the limit exists here, if one can make this constant equal, this we don't know, but in the first order of approximation, we get the behavior of the We get the behavior of the speed whenever the strength of noise goes to zero. Okay? Any questions? Okay. And the example of functions, for example, that you can create example is f of u u to the p 1 minus oops, 1 minus u. Sorry. Any questions? Any questions? Okay, just a few words about the, not the proof, but the kind of the heuristic wishes, heuristics which is behind the proofs. And I'll start with the capi p case. Again, I'm talking here about the small noise theory, the small noise case. Okay, so again, this is the equation, this is capi-p case. So derivative is one, f of u is less or equal than u, and v0 is square root of two. And turns out that the behavior of this SPDE, as I said, so why the why the noise slows down the propagation of equation, it somehow kills. Okay. So this is one, so you have the This is one, so you have your equation, your solution. And if whenever mass tries to propagate to the right and it is small, the noise kills it. Tries to, okay, with a certain rate, it kills it. Okay? Which means that essentially the solution to this stochastic equation looks similar to solution To the solution of the deterministic equation with Keeling on the boundary, which somehow says we have Dirichlet boundary condition. But Dirichlet boundary condition should move to the right. So essentially, one need to consider the following equation. Take this deterministic cap equation and say that what you want. And say that what you want, you want to have the solution, this is one, because you want to have the solution which goes to the right with the speed nu. So this is point new times g and what we want, want a derivative. What the derivative at this point will be of the solution will be sigma square. Okay. So I don't tell you what is new. I tell you I want the traveling wave solution that propagates to the right with speed new, and at the point that so it is zero here, it's positive here, and solves this equation here. Here and what we want that this derivative will be sigma square. Why I want this derivative to be sigma square? This derivative somehow gives you Dirichlet condition, somehow says that there is mass of the equation which is killed at this point. And what is the rate with which it is killed? It's killed exactly with the rate of this derivative. And why we do this? Since we say that this noise in fact. Since we say that this noise, in fact, kills the mass with the rate sigma squared. That's why this should behave essentially like this. Now, so you say, take this equation, ask for the derivative to be sigma squared, and now ask what mu should be to make it possible. And it turns out to make this possible, nu should be exactly of this order that the speed of propagation of stars. That the speed of propagation of stochastic equation square root of two minus explicit constant stack log sigma squared. So if we have solved this equation, I get new. Now the only thing is which is left is to show that this index exactly mimics the behavior of this. Okay, so this sorry, sir, I had one question. Are you saying that the fact that you're moving to the right is due to this killing of mass? This killing of mass? You need to find new. What you need to find such the derivative here will be sigma square. If you change new, suppose I just don't give you this condition and say take this problem with some new. Okay? Then this will prescribe the derivative. Okay? This will prescribe some derivative here. This will prescribe some derivative here since there will be solution. Suppose you can show that there is a solution, it will prescribe derivative. I ask you the other problem. I say you, I want the inverse problem. So yeah, I say I want you to know, I want to have key theory which is sigma square. Sigma square means that the mass that which will be killed here is killed with the rate sigma square. And then find such new such. And then find such nu such that it will make this derivative to be sigma squared. Okay? You can do it both ways. You can prescribe the speed that is giving you derivative, or you can give me derivative, this will prescribe the speed. But you cannot voluntarily say, at least I don't know how to say, to take them together something and say, okay, this will be. There's no two degrees of freedom. No two degrees of freedom. There's one degree of freedom. And since I say I know that the rate of Killian is sigma square, I ask you, please find me the rate with which it goes to the right. For example, if you somehow say that this will be square root of two, it somehow will say the derivative is zero. It moves too fast. Okay. Okay. And if you have to move too slow, the derivative will be bigger. Okay. So this, so the speed somehow is inverse proportional to this derivative. And this is this one, so this deterministic calculation can show that, in fact, if I prescribe you the derivative, then the speech should be like this. Otherwise, you cannot get the derivative. Okay? And the similar and the similar and the similar. And the similar result is for the non-Lipschitz case, where, for example, f of u is like looks like u to the p for small u. And again, you're trying to do the same. You say, consider this equation, and suppose I have this equation such that up to the boundary again. So, you solve this equation, and here I want to kill it. I want to find some new t such that this derivative will be sigma squared. And it also says that, in fact, the balancing value that assures this, then the speed should be very large with this sigma to this negative power. Okay? This is what happens in this case. It's very non-trivial, but this is. Case, it's very non-trivial, but this is kind of the heuristics here. Okay, there is also another way to think about this, I can show it later, but this is one of the ways to think about this. And now open problems, exactly what I was asked in the beginning. The main problem is: okay, right edge of this solution goes with some speed to the right, left edge also goes. Left edge also goes. And the question is: Can you show that the speeds are the same? It's not clear. So it's probably should be true, but it's not clear in general case. For u1 minus u, one can get it by symmetry, but for general case, it's not clear. Okay, suppose in the theorem 3, f of u over u p converges to some. Up converges to some positive limit, is C1 equals to C2 here? Can I show that V sigma behaves exactly like some constant times sigma to the negative power? And okay, the important question is: we do it everything for p greater or equal than one half if I don't have. If I don't have this bound, if a few has Gorster behavior at zero, P less than one-half, can we get uniqueness and the speed for SPGE? And the main point is that Dolson-Gersanov doesn't work. Dolson-Gersanov theorem doesn't, at least I don't know how to apply it, doesn't work. Okay. And the last question is. And the last question is the one also I mentioned. Can one for non-Lipschitz f for some particular functions, can one really rigorously define derive the duality, which will give us also this bounce on speed of propagation of the branching coalescing particle system in the case of absence of the first moment for the branching. Okay, I guess that's all. That's all, and thank you very much for your attention. All right, thank you, Leonid. Do we have some questions? Questions? So I might have one about the branching qualities thing. So apparently, I mean, if I understand correctly, So apparently, I mean, if I understand correctly, there's this duality between the rightmost particle and maybe the R of T, right? You were... Rightmost particle expectation of U. So the expectation. Yeah, it's different from, yeah. Yeah, which means if you take Z, which will be far away, which means expectation will be small, then this probability. Then this probability will be small. So if I take u t and here, whatever should be the speed, v sigma t yeah, plus huge z, this will be small. Okay. Which essentially gives you that this is exactly the speed of also of this guy. If instead of z I take this, yeah. Then this will be v sigma whatever times t plus z. So if this probability, if this expectation is small, then this probability is also small. All right. And is there anything, there should be any something similar for the leftmost particle, right? It's a good point. It should be similar. I remember I thought about this. I agree with you, but it's not really like very symmetric, right? So you just it looks very symmetric. And in fact, you get the bound on R. Okay, again, if you if you if this guy is symmetric, This guy is symmetric, and probably you can do this. But no, okay, no, I take back what I said. I don't talk about the rightmost particle and leftmost particle for the branching system. For this, it's clear. The speed of rightmost to the right is the speed of leftmost to the left. But I talked about the solution to this equation. Solution to this equation, to the SPG. And here you have this one. This is the solution, UT. And this is RT and this is LT. And so it's not clear. So in the case U1 minus U, we know that as time goes to infinity, the distance between them. this uh the distance between them is uh is not infinite it doesn't converge to infinity but for more general for general case we don't know where this distance where the the the size of the interface is finite okay which in principle may say that this goes to the right with different speed okay in the case again in the kppp case in the case of binary of u1 minus u Binary U1 minus U can show that this is okay. And this is in fact what Carl showed and Russauers: that this distance in the end is fine. But for more general situations, we have no idea. Yeah, clearly for branching, collessing practical, this goes to the right and this goes to the left. It's symmetric. But here it's not. Okay? Right. And then about this. Right. And then about this branching coralis again. So it looks like it could make sense, maybe changing your Brownian motion for something else. It could make sense in higher dimensions too. Brownian motions don't collect in higher dimensions. Yeah, but yeah, if you change, yeah, you should change probably your driving. Okay, since it goes together, so Brony and motions don't collect in higher dimensions, and this turn that. High dimensions, and this term doesn't have doesn't have sense in high dimensions. Yeah. If you can find, okay, if you if you take random walks, you can do this. Yeah, so you can do it on the latches. Okay. You can do all this stuff on the latches, and there, yes, you can do whatever you can do. Do you have a kind of duality too? Sure, sure, sure, yeah, yeah. It's uh everywhere. So if you have Markov process here, it's not necessarily bronium. Okay, take any process. Can take any process, any motion process, Markov process, and here you'll just get the generator of this process. Okay. Okay. Important thing is that they need to call us. Yeah. Okay. But duality will hold. Yeah. All right. Do we have more questions for Lynette? Questions? All right. All right, so I've sent a link to this gap.
