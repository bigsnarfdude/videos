Oh yeah, so welcome to the third and last talk for today. I'm happy to introduce Emmanuel McCree from Paris-Sacle, who's going to be talking about anti-symplectic involution on projective hyperkalar manifolds. Yeah. Thank you very much. And thank you for organizing this conference. That's a pleasure, as usual. That's a it's a pleasure as usual and uh hopefully in person soonish. Okay, so I want to talk about uh something uh um which is slightly uh different from the topic of the conference. There will be some categories for the moment, but uh they are mostly hidden in the presentation. So but but they are there, so okay. Then I'm so the title of my talk is anti-symplatic evolutions on I hope it's visible. Yeah. On hypercaler, on I will define it in a second. And so this is let me say from the beginning that this is joint work with Lord Flappan, Kieran O'Grady, and Julia Saka. Julia Saka. And yeah, I talked about this paper, I think, a few months ago as well. But hopefully now, and okay, the preprint is not yet over, but we are done, sort of. So hopefully it will appear soon, at least a part of it. Okay. But the idea of the paper is very simple. So we want to understand a bit more anti-symplatic evolution, which I'm going to define now in a second, on a reducible or more symplatic manifold. We have some motivation, maybe. We have some motivation. Maybe today, since the audience, I will maybe skip a bit on the motivation. I will be a bit quick, and I will go a bit more on the details on the proof that we have. But anyway, if you want, we can discuss later, or I can tell you more about why we were interested in this project. Okay. Okay, let me start with the definition. So I start with X. So X for me will be always a smooth projective. And everything is over C, of course. And so I will call as usual IHES, IHS. And let me recall it briefly what it means to that basement project, you know. It means to that basic project, you know. So, what it means irreducible morph symplatic, so this for us will mean that all axes interconnected. And the second thing I just needed because for the definition later, that there is only one two-form up to constants, which I call it eta, and deta is non-degenerate, it's symplectic. Okay, good. So, this is uh. Okay, good. So this is a holomorphic symplatic. So definition. So we are interested in the following. So I take tau tau an isomorphism, an evolution actually. So tai square equals the identity. And I say that tau is anti-sympletic. If we have that tau, it always going to act on the h20, and I want that the action is with the. zero and I want that the action is with a minus. So it doesn't preserve the sympletic form and it's a small remark which is sort of immediate from the definition is that if tau is anti-sympletic then what we are interested in we are interested in the fixed locus of the involution that's our main goal for today and the boy it's directed from definition it's for that the sympathetic locus okay is Definition: it follows that the sympathetic locus okay is moved, it's fixed locus is smooth, okay. That is just because the involution is irregular, but it's Lagrangian, so it is a half-dimension, okay. And so, the question that we are interested in today is born for an anti-symplatic evolution on a reduced order symplatic, we want to understand the fixed laws. So, we want to understand the geometry, we want to understand which kind of variety are there, and what is the homology maybe, and so on and so forth. How many components there are a priority? Many components there are. A priority is smooth, but is in general is definitely not connected, and so we won't understand the detail geometry of these logs. Okay, of course, this will be very nice to do in general, but we have to make some assumption, and the reason is the following. So, because the problem is that is evolution are not so hard to find the explicit models, but are very hard to study explicitly the fixed locus. So, the only way we have to study to understand these problems is to degenerate, to find some specific example. To find some specific example where we can understand this involution. And unfortunately, these examples are singular. Okay. And they have to be explicit. So I need to be at least in one of the families that we know. So today, which one are my assumption? So the first one, I will going to assume that X is of a K3N type. So that is in one of the classical families. So these are the one, the result of sympathetic. The result of sympathetic, which are the formation equivalent to Hilbert scheme of points on a K3 surface. And the second assumption: well, there are many involutions, so we want to describe, in some sense, involution which are maximally modular. And then for asking this, I can look at the action of tau on the H2, and I can look at the fixed locus. And so, what we are interested in, we're interested in when the fixed locus is the smallest possible, so one-dimensional. Okay, so I want the Okay, so one of the fixed locus is generated by Lambda, where lambda will be an ample class. Okay, so that's the thing we are interested in. So these are the two things. Now, these restrict the beta polarization type of lambda. So there are essentially three types different. And we studied two of them for the moment, that's the one that we can. Well, for the moment, that's the one that we can study somehow. We can understand explicitly. So, let me recall you that every irreducible or symplectic manifold is naturally associated by a linear form, which is the Fujiki of the Bovomodo form. This is, in some sense, is the n square root of the self-intersection, so it's a quadratic form. And so I can apply the quadratic form to polarization. And the case in which we are interested is when the self-intersection of lambda with respect to this quadratic form is Respect to this quadratic form is two. Okay, so that's the case we are interested. And let me say a small remark before stating the theorem: is that under this assumption, well, it's easy to describe what is the action of tau on cohomology. And so tau acts as follows. So it acts as a reflection across the class lambda. Of course, if you want, across the line generated by lambda. So you can write it as follows if you want times lambda. Times lambda. Okay. Then this action is like this. This is defined for all alpha in the homology group of our x. And so as more remark, let me call this formula star. I will go to use it a bit later. Is that we can use global totality theorem. So as more remark before starting. And if we have such an action on cohomology by Verbiski Torality theorem, well, actually, this is the version which was. Well, actually, this is the version which was proved by Markman. I know that all these transformations of the form star will lift in a unique way to an automorphism. Then if you know the action on cohomology, we know that some automorphism always exists. So the global torality theorem implies for us that given such action action on homology, such as tau star, there exists always a unique tau. Okay? Then the study in cohomology is exactly what we need. Okay? Sorry, I just I missed some of what you said. Can you just explain the notation, some of the notation you have? Sure. So X of K3N type, it means that it's the formation equivalent to a Hilbert scheme of points on a K3 surface. Points on a K3 surface. So X is therefore to S to the N, where S is a K3 surface. Okay, so that's the K3 type. Then the notation H2 plus, sorry, here I was a bit too quick, but I hope is clear from the formula. So these are the invariant part on H2. On H2. Okay, then if you see from the formula, lambda is fixed by this formula and is the only one which is sent to itself. So it's a reflection. You can see also itself is anti symplectic exactly from the formula because there is this minus alpha here. So if you take a sympletic form eta, it goes into minus eta. Okay, so that's the good. So that's the part that I'm interested in. That I'm interested. Okay, good. Do you assume the Picard number to be one, or is it automatic? No, no, no, no, no, it won't be. It's a really global family, so the Picard number of X will vary dramatically. Okay, so it's really a family with a maximal number of moduli. But there's a unique ample one? Yes, because we're assuming that this is the case. So we're assuming that the form of tau on homology is exactly. Of tau on cohomology is exactly of this type. So we assume that there exists a lambda ample such that the action on cohomology is like this. Perfect. Thank you. So it's, but you're right. A priori is not. We'll see. Actually, I'm sorry. We're going to see this. For studying these, we need to study some example of evolution, which has not this property. So we're going to see some other things. But in general, this is what we want to study. But in general, this is what we want to study. And it's true that very general member of the family will have picarrank one. Okay, we always look at the projective one. And generically, that's what very generally that's what will happen. Okay, so as we said, square two and evolution of this type, this is integral by torrential theorem can always be lifted. So this is exactly what we need for understanding its equivalent to standard. Understanding its equivalent to standard evolution. Okay, so here is the theorem. So these are our theorems. There are two theorems we have. And unfortunately, to study them, the idea is elementary, but then the proof is always a bit technical. Anyway, I'll try to say. Okay, so if you start, sorry, go back a second. So if you have a polarization of degree two, there is another invariant, and that's the only invariant that we have. So there is the degree in this case. So, there is the degree in this case, and the other invariant is the divisibility. So, I define the divisibility of the polarization, it is as follows. So, I can look at the positive generator of the following ideal. So, I can look at the Bovir-Bogomodo form computed onto lambda, and then I pair it with all the classes in H2XZ. So the pair. Z. So the pairing given by Boviv Bogomolov is not unimodular. So in general, it is an ideal. So this is an ideal inside Z. Okay. And if the divisibility is 2, sorry, if the polarization is square 2, then there are only two possibilities. So the divisibility can only be either 1 or 2. Okay? So we have two invariants: the degree and divisibility. Okay? Good. Okay, good. So, theorem. Sorry, I'll keep it a second. So, here is the first theorem that we have. And I will ask also a few questions later. So, we have that x again, K3N type. Let me remind the assumption. Then I have lambda, which is ample on X with the property that the square is 2. Okay? And then I take. Okay, and then I take tau as tau of lambda, if you want the anti-symplectic involution defined by the equation star, associated to lambda. Okay, so well, let me say instead of defined, associated to lambda. So this means I just go back a second to page. I just go back a second, two pages in back. So, this means the formula here underlined. Okay, so I have lambda like this, and then by Tori, I can lift it, and so that's now our inclusion. Then, the first theorem that we can understand is the fixed locus, how many components it has. The fixed locus of tau has exactly a number of components equal to the visibility. So, exactly div So exactly d vert of lambda connected components. Okay, so that's the first thing we understand. So we know exactly how many components there are. There are either one or two. Okay, so that's the first theorem. And the second theorem is telling you something about the structure of these components. And so, theorem two. Two. I'll give you some examples in a second. First, let me state the theorem. So, theorem two, let me assume further the divisibility is two. Then, in this case, well from the previous theorem, we know that the fixed locus of tau has two components, which I always I will always try to keep this notation. I call it the one y and one sigma. It one y and one sigma, and the statement is that where y it's it's an interesting final. So I will try to explain why we found it interesting. It is a funnel manifold. And both final manifolds, I can define the index of a final manifold. So the index is the multiple, the anti-canonical is a multiple of an ample. The index is that multiple. The index is that multiple, and the index is three. Okay, so it's three times an ampola is the anti-canonical device. Okay, boom. So these are the two theorems. Okay, so we know how to get the Fano manifold associated to any hyperkeler with an involution. Then there is a question: what is the second component and what is the component in the case of derivative one? So we don't know much about it. So, we don't know much about it. We have some examples that I will describe in a second. But in general, it should not be fine in general, should not be even unirational. But we don't know which one it is. We don't know much. Even in the smaller genus case, we don't know much about it. We have some degeneration, but not enough for understanding this. In the case of divisivity one, we know a bit more. And I will tell you the two examples that we know, essentially. Okay? Essentially. Okay. But anyway, so these are the two theorems. So we know the number of components so far, and we know that one component is fine. So let me give you the examples of which also give a bit of motivation why we are interested in this thing. So the first thing is, well, let me save DVD1. Okay. And so here there are not so many examples, as I said. So in this case, the fixed locus, let me use the same notation as before. So in this case, it's just one component by theorem one. Is just one component by theorem one, and so we can look at smaller dimensions. So, the first case is dimension four, and this is well known. So, this is the case well studied by Bio Gredi, Ferretti, and many more people recently. So, this is a surface of general type. And uh so this was studied by This was studied by Ferretti Fogre. And what is the geometry behind this? So this is the case in which X is so-called a double EPW sextic. Okay, so it's a class of variety which has an evolution, a dimension four, and the fixed locus can be described by the generation methods. And this was done by Ferris. Methods and this was done by Ferretti. This was a paper by Iliato Manivella. So that's that's the part that this is known, okay, and that's how it fits in our picture. Okay, and the next case is already not known. And this was some motivation. The first motivation is to try to find some analog of WPW sex take in in higher dimensions. So this is should be the case of if you want the case in dimension two, these are K three surfaces which are two to one cover of P two. Which are two to one cover of P2. Okay, so this is how the family goes. And in this case, unfortunately, yet we don't know much. So this is a part of work in progress that we haven't actually finished yet the proof, although we have some argument on this. And so the guess, I guess, closer to that. It's a threefold in this case, of course. And we think that this should be of general type. And we have some argument for it, but we still have to think about a singularity about it. About the singularity, about it. So, it's anyway. So, that's what you expect. So, in general, I guess it's something which may be of general type. I don't know. Okay, but that's how the intuition should be. In this case, the component you have should be some sort of right of this type. Okay, so that's the example of the Visibility 1. And the Visibility 2 is also interesting. So, the Visibility 2 is something that was mentioned already in the conferences. The first example is The first example is the case of cubic fourfolds. Okay, so in this case, again, what's an easy lattice computation? If you have something of divisibility 2, you must have that 8 divides the dimension of x. Okay, then dimension is 8, 16, of all. And so we know by the theorem that the fixed locus is two components. And okay, so let's start the VTA. And okay, so let's start the visibility 8. So in this case, sorry, dimension 8. Then in this case, y is equal to 4. Okay, and x is something also which is well known. So x in this case is a so-called len, len, sorger, van straten, eightfold. Okay, so that was also all known somehow. So that's the first example. And in general, the fanos should be taught some sort of family which is similar to. Some sort of family which is similar to cubic fourfolds, you know, but in higher dimension. So these are dimension, uh, so start with four, then the next one will be eight, and so on and so forth. We know nothing about this manifold, except the next case, we have some, we know something about it. So this is the maximum 16 is the only one where we know something. And in this case, again, it's work in progress. So this is the part which has to be a bit. Has to be a bit, but in some sense, in this case, for example, we know what are the Odge numbers of these things. And so the Odge numbers are as follows, are something like 1, 1, so speak R rank 1, then okay, boys, something of this sort. If I remember well, I might mistake the computation here, so maybe don't take it as a full statement. But This part also has to be a bit written. Okay, so anyway, so these are the Odge numbers. You can see that there is some K3 surface associated to it, and which is here. That's the first K3. There should be another one. And then there should be something of this form that looks a bit like the Hilbert scheme. Okay. And indeed, there's somehow, yeah, we have a conjecture of this thing. And the conjecture is something. So this is the part about the right category. And so the conjecture that we have is the following. And so the conjecture that we have is the following, so conjecture that the direct category should be interesting of these finals. And so the conjecture is that if I take dB of y, in some sense, the intuition is that this final should be some similarity to the somewhat should be an analogy with another family of funuls that we know pretty well, which are modulate space of bundles on a curve, of rank two bundles, for example. And so we expect the right category to behave sort of similarly, maybe it's more complicated in. Maybe it's more complicated in higher dimensional, but anyway, we express something of this sort. So there is a component which I call the D2. Then there are three copies of D, and then one three copies of the line bundle. As I said, it has index three. And so that's somehow that's a maximum I can go for for line bundles. And then the three copies here, boys, so these are K3 categories. Boy, you should think, so these are K3 categories. They should be. And this one over here should be, well, it should be like the symmetric product of the K3 category. So this is a, it should be some sort of Hilbert scheme of, so this is the, the, how do I call it? Well, we know what should be someone in this case. In this case, we expect to be, let me just write the conjecture in a strong form. This is F is a reduced symplatic. Is a reduced or simplic fourfold, which is a strange dual to in some sense to X. Okay, there is some fourfold polarized, and also you expected that the number of moduli from the picture is exactly a full number of moduli again. There's a nice locally complete family of Fano that we expect related to a K3 surface, to some deformation of K3 surface. To some deformation of K3 surfaces, okay. Are you going to make any kind of conjectures on rationality of y or anything of that? That would be a good question, actually. We have no guess, but of course, one conjecture without any fundament will be like that it behave like cubic fourfold, maybe. So we that there are some devices where where uh where uh where uh you expect to be to be to be to be rational and something of this sort, but Something of this sort, but it's just some bold claims. It's not motivated by anything, except that there is a motivation that I will show you later. So, how do we prove this one? We prove by some deformation argument similar to cubic fourfolds. And so, in this case, for example, we know that some special limits are rational. We're going to see this. Yeah, so, but I don't know. Yeah, that I don't know. Another good question, we like to study more the homology. For example, if there is some sort of torality theorem, that would be nice. We don't know. That would be nice. We don't know anything. And also to study some special degeneration. It's a bit, but yeah, we know nothing. So it would be very interesting to study this thing, I think, my opinion. But yeah. But again, they should here, I think, in my, my view of seeing this thing is that this final should be something like indeed some analog of the case of modular space of rank two bundles on curves. In that case, the index is two. Okay, in that case, the index is two. Something could be socked. Yeah, I don't know anything, as I said. That's the only thing that this conjecture is sort of believe. I actually don't have even, we don't have a nice formula for a conjecture in general. You may imagine something similar, but maybe it's a bit more complicated situation. I don't know. But yeah. Okay, good. So that's the theorems. And as I said, maybe I won't give so much of the motivation. Maybe I won't give so much the motivation. Oh, wow, I'm super late. Okay, okay, sorry. If there are, but I can talk a bit later about the motivation, maybe a bit of the final in some sense motivates itself, but there is also some interest in studying the other components. That's Kiran has some nice conjecture on how to study the other components. This is related by covering a family of Lagrangians. And so it's related to some nice conjecture about the structure of child groups of other Keller. Of other Keller. But anyway, maybe I'll discuss later about this. So, what I want to do in the not so much time, much time that remains, I want to sketch a proof of these two theorems. And I want to give a bit an idea. And you will see that the connection with modulal curve that I'm just mentioned is actually a bit stronger. You will see. It's very similar to the picture of Bertram and Thaddeus done in that case. We're going to see. Okay, then. Okay, let me start with the proof of theorem one. Theorem one. So the proof, as I said, the idea is not so hard. So the idea is actually pretty simple. So we have to find just one model. That's the only thing we need. There are many models in this case. There are some models by Mukai, they were studied by Marpan, they were studied by Kiran in a previous paper. The problem that these models are not so explicit, so they are explicit as vector bundles, but they are not explicit enough to study what the Enough to study what the ficlos is. So we study some other model, the problem that these are singular. Then we have all this kind of complication coming from that. But the model are very explicit, but singular. And so the idea of the proof is I just have to find one. So the idea is that I have to find an explicit model. And the second part of And the second part of the proof is that I have to use some deformation theory. Okay, so the proof is the idea is pretty standard, but the only too slightly issue that we have, so the way to think about this explicit model, well, you can think from the viewpoint of cubic fourfold. So this should correspond in some sense to, so in dimension eight, for example, divisibility two. This is correspond, for example, to a cubic fourth. This is correspond, for example, to a cubic fourfold with an ordinary double point, for example, so something of this sort. And the deformation theorem is slightly more complicated than what is known for singular hyperkeler because it's not locally trivial. So we really want something which actually expands a bit. And some of the intuition here again is if you take a limit of degree 2k3 surfaces where you let the statistic degenerate to something with a node. A node, okay, then the evolution to go well in family. I have to take the singular K3 surface in the special filter. Okay, so that's a bit of the intuition behind this deformation part. Okay, so let me try to prove it. So, step one, let me describe an explicit model. And in some sense, here the analysis for this part is very classical, it's something super classical, you will see that. Super classical, you will see that, and even the proof is, but there is a small, small issue that I will tell you. So, first of all, let me just assume since any case, the case of the visibility one is a bit easier to study. So, let me just do everything in divisibility two. Okay. As I said, the visibility one is analogous. It's very similar, but it's actually easier. So, it's fine. Okay, so what is the method? So, the model, but the model has to be a K3 surface. Okay, so then the model is actually something. So, then the model is actually something very well known. So, it's I take a polarized K3 surface, which is assumed of genus G. And let me assume that it's very general. So, in this case, anyway, we need to find just a model, so I can't quite enough for later, but okay, for the moment it's fine. For later, but okay, for the moment, it's fine. Okay, good. So, which one is the model space? So, we are in divisibility too. So, let me also assume that the four divides the genus. So, that's the analog of the condition that we had before that eight has to divide the dimension. It's not needed for the first part, but let me assume it for later. At least we have it. Okay, it's not needed for what I'm saying now, but for later it is needed. Okay, so what is the model? The model is a model space of Modular space of stable objects, standard stable objects, of the one that we saw in Iset talk yesterday. So these are modular spaces with the V where the Mukai vector V. So I'm using the same notation as Z. So this is of the form rank zero, first chair class H, so support on the hyperplane sections, and DV0. And degree zero. Okay, so this is the moduli space. So it's something that we can study very well of Giesecker stable torsion sheaves of rank one and on the sections in the let me denote by capital H, the divisor associated to H, okay, and degree zero. Okay, and degree zero. Okay, then we know that this guy comes with a like random vibration that we're going to use on PG dual. Okay, and only call it pi. Okay. And what is the involution in this case? This is not a model that we want. This is just something that we can study. And then we're going to reduce our model. So the involution is very simple here. It's just taking the dual. Okay, I have a line bundle of degree zero on a smooth curve. I just take the dual, and this thing. Dual and this thing extends to actually an automorphism of the modern space. Okay, so the involution I call it tau here. And so tau is just taking the dual. But if you want more in derived category terms, if you want that this is induced by the anti-out equivalence, so that complicates a bit because it's an anti-out equivalence of the following form. The following form, just a dual. And if you don't mind, I add a shift for convenience and for avoiding to mistake the sign later. Okay, so I have this anti-involution of the derived category of S, and then I just take the action on the modular space, and this is preserved. Okay, so let's start with the proposition. So, again, this is not a model. So, this is a very classical again. We're going to reduce to this model because tau is not an evolution. Because tau is not an evolution of the one we like. Again, the way that you have to think about, take the k3 of degree two, so the general to a sextic with a node. So this thing, it's a bit like the blow-up. Okay, so there is an evolution, but does not go into family. Okay, so we have to do something there. But anyway, in this case, at least we know what are the two models. And you will see also which one is the final model in some sense. So there are two components. Okay? Where, but one is Okay, where one is very simple to find. So, y twiddle is just a zero section. So, this is very simple. It's just PG. Or better, PG do what if you want. And of pi. And the second one, it's a bit more mysterious, but geometrically, it's clear what it is, it's just a closure. And if you take a line band or Then, if you take a line bundle on a smooth curve, the dual is just the dual indeed. So, if I want a fixed point of this involution, I want something with square equal to zero. Okay, so then I take the locus, which is the closure of such line bundles. So, of IC lower star of Xi, such that Xi square is isomorphic to O C. Xi is not trivial, it is the trivial section, and then I want the curve to be smooth. Curve to be smooth. Okay. I take the closure of this. And so the proposition is say that this is it. Okay. So this is very similar to results which are known for Mg, for example. But in this case, I don't know. We didn't find anything anywhere in the literature. So this should be known, but we couldn't find it. And so let me sketch a proof of this. And sorry, I didn't finish. So these are like this, and both are irreducible. Okay. So, and where blah are both. Where blah are both irreducible. So it really has two components. Okay? So that's a statement, also. So it's the irreducibility that you're... It's the irreducibility that you want to prove by monotony. There are two things we want to prove. Yes, irreducibility is the first thing. So that, but that's easy. Okay, we're going to see it. It's just by monotomy argument. But also, we want that there are no exotic components, right? So we want there is nothing which is supported on singular curves. So you need some argument there also. Curve. So you need some argument there also. So those are the two arguments we need. But besides that, the argument is analogous to the usual arguments. It's monotony plus that there is no other things. Yeah? Yeah. And then we'll use an argument similar to yours. Now we will see. Okay. But yeah. So proof, okay, let me just say what Aaron asked somehow. So the proof has three parts. So the first thing you have to show the, okay. So, the first thing you have to show that, okay, white tweedle is irreducible. Okay, that's, I guess, SPG, fine. Then, sigma twiddle is irreducible. And this, as I said, is a monodomy argument. It's just sort of standard. So, okay, I prepared some alema, but I think I'm out of time already. So, this uses the idea of Bovile-Janssen, and we have to specialize further to some special K-3, which is a trigonal in this case. Anyway. In this case, anyway. And then the third part, as I was saying to Aaron, is the part about that there is no exotic components. And this is more subtle, exotic components. So this is something which is supported on singular curves. Okay. And that's a dimensional estimate with compatified Jacobian. So it's an argument that requires a bit, but okay, maybe for the sake of time, I just go further. I just go further. So, but anyway, so that's the proof. So, this is classical for the moment. Okay, so that's the first part. Okay, good. So, next, step two, is that this is not a good deformation. So, it won't deform to a family that we're interested in. So, we have to, because we have to find this divisor with the visibility two. So, that's the second part, which is the divisor lambda. Again, everything is explicit here. Again, everything is explicit here. So let me recall that you have Mukai homomorphism that goes from V perp into H2MZ, where V perp is inside the cohort of the K3 with respect to the Mokai pairing. Anyway, it's not super important what it is now, but it's important that I can safely treat divisors as they are clustering homology of a K3 surface. And then divisor is very simple, is the following explicit form is. Following explicit form is something of rank 2 with the following Mukai vector, 2 minus h and g divided by 2 minus 1. Okay, and the point is the following: this guy is the movable divisor, which is great, but it's not an F. Okay, so we want to reach this guy somehow. And so, for reaching this guy, we need to run some, we have to go through the whole process of Barashman transformations. And because this guy Transformations and because this guy is really at the bar at the other border of the movable cone. Okay, so that's a problem. So we have to control flops, but fortunately, it's not too hard. Okay, so we need to find another birational model. And that will be sort of closer to our model that we are interested in. So let me make very quickly a picture. Make very quickly a picture. So, the picture is that here you have the fiber, for example, here you have the nef cone of our modular space that we know very well, which is m. And then there will be a bunch of flops until we reach the last model. And here is lambda. Okay, so this is the last model that we are interested in, which is less explicit. Okay, so that's a problem, but still, okay, this is the whole thing is the movable cone. Okay. Okay, so we need to reach that one. As a fortunately, the flop in this case are easy to study because of the structure of the moduli space, and they are just Mukai flops. So they're very easy to study. Okay, so the statement is the following, but let me state as a lemma that the Barasha map from the two models, extreme models, call it. Models, call it M and M last is a composition of standard Mukai flop. So there is no stratification here. They're really the easiest possible Mukai flops, which are the form. So I have something of the form Mi I have my Muclithlope inside Mi plus one. And so there they go into some contraction, which I call it M-bar. No, M-bar is a badge. I'm tweeting. No, two is a badge. Okay. N. I think I have an N later, but okay. Hopefully, we. Okay, and these are just P bundle. Okay, maybe twisted. So there is some slightly funnier argument. But the basis is very simple to start. It's just a product of two hypercaler and it's just changing U with U dual. Okay, so that's the easiest format. So that's the easiest form of high flop ever. And this Z, it's also easy, is just an irreducible or more sympathetic smooth benefit. So they're the easy. And the second part of the statement, so that's the first part of the statement. The second part is that there is an evolution everywhere, which let me still call tau. And everything is compatible with this evolution. Okay, so the tau is compatible on each model. And so it survives when I cross all the various birational models. The various barrational models, and the interesting thing about this statement is that the number of fixed components stays the same, okay? So, compatible with tau, and the number of fixed components is constant. Okay, so that's the part that we're interested in, and that's easy, somehow it follows from the wall. Easy, somehow it follows from the work of a paper that we have since a few years ago with Arendt. Okay, so that's the part that, yeah, good. And it's kind of the example actually they were treated actually, it's similar to what Aaron did with Adaniele Arcara. And these are the simplest possible flops. And the simple possible, the simplest possible minimal problem that you can run. Minimal problem that you can run here. Okay, good. Then, okay, which one is our guy? So, I can use, so on M lambda, we are not done yet. So, on M blast, lambda induces a divisor contraction. So, this is a bit similar as K3 surface of again of degree two. Okay, it is a singular model. And so, again, everything is compatible with the evolution, and now we are good to go. So, this is tau. Let me call this guy. So, this is tau. Let me call this guy phi. Let me call this guy m bar with the involution. Now, everything is compatible, and the number, again, the components. Well, they might intersect a priori, although we think no, but it's not super important. In this case, it's still constant. Okay, so we reached, in some sense, some singular mode. So, we reached, in some sense, some singular model where we know there are only two components. Okay. And it's likely sub to this argument. This is where we took a lot of time. Maybe I won't say much about this. But we have to generalize this argument of Mukai. We have to know very well these fibers of this codezole contraction. And we have to know very well what is the action on this thing. Okay, but anyway, so we're done. So finally, we have our model, which is what we want. And we also know by using this classical method that we know exactly how many components there are. Okay. Exactly how many components there are. Okay, so this guy is a singular model of with an anti-symplatic evolution. Okay. And I have an example very quickly to show you, but then essentially, once you have done, then we are done. Okay, there is this. But let me first give you an example of what happens. At least you see the Of what happens. At least you see the analog with the work of Aaron and Tadeus. So, for example, if you take genus 8, this is very easy what you get. In some sense, you have, so the picture is something of this form. You start with your M over P8. Then the first piece is just a standard Mukai flop in which you flop the zero section. So, this is P8 dual. So, that's the first thing you do. So, here it destroys one component, but it reopens on the other side. And this is the only case in which this thing happens, okay? So, and then the next one, you can imagine what it is. So, you have a K3 surface inside PG, so you're blowing it up. So, you're looking at the space of secants. Okay, so that's the part number two. So, this is So, this is a Mokai flop. I'll arrive to that. So, this guy is a P6 bundle over the product of the K3 times K3. Okay, and the fixed locus, the component, for example, the final component that will be interested will get blown up on the K3 surface. And then there is another one. And the third one is again. And the third one is again another Mukai flop. So in this case, it's a P4 bundle over the Hilbert scheme of two points. And so you are blowing up the two secons. Okay. And as we are done. Okay. And in this case, then we go into our m bar, and that's our desired condition. And bar, and that's our digital contraction. Okay, and so what is corresponding to the fixed locus to the fixed locus goes under a flip. Okay, so as a matter is an anti-flip, so there is some P1 bundle over the Hilbert scheme that got replaced with a P2 bundle over there. And so you can imagine why the conjecture that I just told you should be true. So the expectation is that this M3 is not a Crepend resolution, but maybe you can find a categorical resolution. And then if you track by Bondalore the By Bondalore of the drive category of our component, which is P8. You get blow-up, then you get a flip, and then you can imagine that these kind of things will move in family. And so, if you compute the components, you get what you got into the conjecture. Okay, so that's a bit wild we expect such a thing. Okay, boom. So, that's the example. And I can describe a bit more later, but you also notice. More later, but you also know the singularity in this case. This thing is really, there is also a cubic appearing here, but anyway, I will tell a bit later, maybe. So, you also know how to resolve singularity here. Singularity are very easy, actually. They are just ordinary double points over a cubic fourfold of degree 14 associated with this in this case. Anyway, so this is very explicit, actually. And Sasha Kusunsovi also told us some way of rethinking this example in terms of Cremona transformation on P14. And also, this one is also nice. Anyway, so there is also some geometry in. Nice. Anyway, so there is also some geometric interpretation of this example as well. Okay, sorry, I finished the proof. And then step three is the specialization, so the singular specialization. And that's, as I said, is slightly non-standard, but it's still the method we use are, or maybe since I have really no time. I think my time is already over, right? Oh, no. You can take a couple more minutes. I mean, we started. Let me just take. Couple more minutes, and then you started. Let me just take one. Okay, anyway, this is this part. Let me just say one word about the other one. So, this just uses the work of the standard type by Namikawa Marman. Okay, but I need a bit more, it needs a bit of an argument here. So, you can really specialize to this kind of example, or if you have this kind of example, you can find a family that goes into there. Okay, so sorry, I'll um okay, let me say what I want to say, okay. What I want to say. Okay, how do I prove finances? Okay, so prove theorem two. So I can use the same specialization, but then it becomes a bit harder because I need to control singularities. So what we do, we choose another specialization. Okay, so that's why, so this will find, it's fine for genus 8, but in general becomes a bit more complicated. Should be easier, but it's less explicit. So there is another specialization that we can use. So another model, which is usual for cubics, use. Which, as usual, for cubics, use two models generally: ordinary double point, and the second one is the chordal cubic. So, that's very singular, but it's very explicit. And so, the model we use here is the K3 surface of degree two. Okay, this is a polarized K3 of degree two. So, this is a map into P2. We saw it also in his Z talk that he compares his model space, and we do essentially the same. So, our model in this case is again. Model in this case is again, I'll just describe first a smooth model. It's ranked two bundles with the first class H and the second class of the Buchai vector equal to this. Okay, then dimension of M is equal to 2n. n is any number which is divisible by 4. Okay, and lambda, what it is, anyway, it is all explicit, but if you take a second, lambda is exactly the one inducing the contraction on the Uhlenberg commodification. On the Uhlenberg commodification. So, this case is an F. And so, the model that we like, so and tau is the evolution induced by S. So, it's easier in this case. Okay, so that's the easiest possible evolution that we have. And then, okay, you can study what it is. Again, you have the zero contraction. So, let me just take one more, two more minutes, and then I'm done. So, you have this evolution, and then okay, then it's similar to before. So, you have the desert contraction. So you have a new visual contraction which goes from which is the Uhlenbeck commodification. Okay, so this is tau. It goes to m bar again with tau. So this is the Donaldson Ullenbeck. Yeah compatification. Okay. And well, what is the fixed locus? We know it exists a fixed component, which is very simple to describe. It's modular space of shifts on P2. Pull back, right? P2 pull back, right? So in this case, the fix is more is harder, this example. So fix as many components, but there is one special one, which is which I call it N, which is the pullback, if you want, of a moduli space from P2 with a corruption cartel. Is your screen frozen or is it just mine? Ah, no, you're right, actually. It's frozen. Ah, no, you're right, actually. It froze. Okay. It decides that it is time to finish. Okay, how do I do it now? Okay. Oops. Let me try again. I finished it. So it's okay. Now it's fine, I hope. Thanks. I just had to write two lines. Anything has Donaldson, yeah. I don't know. Okay, so it's one special component, which is this one. Okay. Has one special component which is this one, okay? Well, this can be computed with the minus, I guess. This is the churn character, anyway. And so, what is the point? The point is that I can take again n bar, the same component, the Donaldson Willembeck-Yau compatification. And Bohn, we know everything about this component. That's advantage there. In particular, Bone is normal, it's Gorenstein, it has cuvatural singularities, canonical. It is canonical, and in particular, the only thing we need is that LCI in codimension 3. Okay, and then okay, boom, and then we can use this method that is a final manifold of index 3, so we know the canonical bundle, how to compute it, and then use an argument similar to one before. Okay, then we have to worry about singularities and so on and so forth. So the argument is slightly subtle, but at the end, we prove that if you can put it in a family of fixed log size, this is the locus corresponding. Log side, this is the locus corresponding to the one that we knew from before. And we can study the canonical boundary, we can study everything, and we go from there. Okay, so this is another method. So both of them are useful for something. This is very explicit. This is very easy. And the other is very easy to do computation because it's much less singular. Okay, so then somehow you can use a bit both of them. Okay, so I think I'm very out of time. So I think I'm done. Thank you. Okay, great. Okay, great. Thank you, Emmanuel. That was a very nice talk. Thanks. Questions? But I thought Andre was doing a question. Um, can you go back to you had this conjecture somewhere in the middle of your talk? Yep. And you said that X should be strange dual. Ah, yes. Can you explain a little more what you meant by? Yeah, that I can say something. It's uh, it's actually very simple in this case. It's um, so whenever. So, whenever you have a polarized hypercaler of this form, the way that you have to think about it, there is an Old Theory way of doing it, but let me say it as a moduli space. So, you should think that X is a moduli space with respect to some k vector H, okay, where sigma is some stability condition on some K3 category, which in this case should be the same K3 category that appears in the statement. Okay, and then what I can do, I can take H. And then, what I can do, I can take H and I can take lambda, and they have the property that the intersection is zero. And so I can look at the pair X with lambda, or I can look at the pair F, where it is the moduli space of the vector lambda together with polarization H. Okay, and so in this case, let me recall that the lambda squared is equal to two, so it is a fourfold. Okay, and the polarization here is again of divisibility two, and the square this time it becomes a bit a bit higher. So this is a two okay, so h square at degree two, we say that so this is the dimension 2n, so this is 2n minus 2. Okay, and yeah, so in the case of cubic four. Yeah, so in the case of cubic fourfold, for example, this is exactly what we know already. So X is the length length, so we must have the eightfold, and F is the final variety of lines, together with the canonical polarization coming from the Grassmann 2, 6. And so in that case, that's what we expect. So we expect that D2 is always DB of this guy. Of f of the Grassmannian of lines. So, no, of F, of F. So, F is a. So, for the cubic fourfold, there is nothing, of course. So, for the cubic fourfold, it's a Sasha description. So, we have just D of Y, of Y of 1, of Y of 2. Okay, so this will be only for starting interesting from genus 8. Okay, so if you want, so that's the part where is. So, if you want, so that's the part where it's interesting. So, here we'll have this component, which is dB of f. And we don't have any interesting geometric description of this, and that would be nice to do also. So, for the cubic fourfold, this is the final variety of lines. And in general, there should be some geometric description. We have no idea. But it's like a non-commutative in this case, it's commutative. That's the thing that we have. So, in this case, it's really commutative. So, in this case, it's really commutative. So, that's here is the key point. So, it's if you want the way to think about in comparison with modular space of curves, it is the db of the symmetric product of the curve, the symmetric square. But in this case, in this special case, it's always commutative. So, in some sense, D is non-commutative, D is non-commutative, definitely, but the square. But but the square is commutative, something of this sort conjecture, yeah is is there is it is there some kind of interpretation? Is there some kind of interpretation? I mean, is there something in you started with a, you know, you started with the Kahler manifold and the Lagrangian sub-manifold, and somehow I suspected some kind of mere symmetry? That could be a good question. And yeah, I don't know, actually. This is a bit that we think about this Lagrangian is more like. More like as is probably this is one of the motivations that Kieran had in some sense. Yeah, this should be some sort of analog of Lagrangian vibration. So we do expect, so this is a fixed locus, so this thing does not move. But expectation, if you look at the case in which in which divisibility one, dimension four, so this is the WPW sextics. So in this case, the Lagrangian. So, in this case, the Lagrangian does not move, but if you take two times it, then this gives you a covering family of Lagrangian. So, it might have some sort of, but I don't know, some sort of mirror-similar interpretation in that sense. Then we can use it. Somehow, that's the idea of Kiran, somehow you can use that then to somehow. It's a bit of a similar to be to being a it's some replacement of Of Lagrangian vibration, something of this sort. But that's the only thing I know about it. Okay, thank you. Oh, thanks. Yeah. I can stop here. If there are no more questions, then let's just thank Manuel again for a very nice talk. Thanks. Um and we will see you all tomorrow at that all right now we can all go check the election results. No, yeah, that's true. I was I was going to throw it nothing new there, nothing new. Well, the only new things are bad. Okay, bad, okay. It seems clear that. It seems clear that the Senate will not be one. Yeah. Yeah. It looks like 99% of Michigan's counted. Biden's up front for it. The U.S. Postal Service did a good job of making sure the Senate stayed. I don't know. It's not clear to me that it's an issue of foul play. I don't know. I'm just making a joke. I'm much more concerned about the fact that. That it was so close, no matter what. That's correct. Yeah, I think that's yeah. That's the scariest part. Thank you for being here. I think response is not much better than Paris. In fact, it might be worse. For the COVID, yes. I can see that it's bad everywhere, I guess. It's bad everywhere, I guess. So it's a bit okay. Say how you're going, yeah, I will say, I think they are sleeping already. But good. Anyway, we'll meet tomorrow. All right. Okay, thanks. Bye, bye, bye. Bye. Bye.
