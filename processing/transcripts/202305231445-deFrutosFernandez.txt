The last topic today is like the end, and the subject will be colonology in the refreshment. Thanks. So I'm going to tell you about two different formalization projects today. The reason why is that both of these are formalizations of number theory results. And in both of these projects, there's going to be some sort of commodity theory that's going to play an important role later on. Later on. So, for both of these, I will try to tell you what has already been done or is being done at the moment and also some future works. So, I will start with local classical theory. Everything in this project is doing work with Philip Onuccio, who is already at this conference. And also, our goal is to eventually form a diet-social class field theory. We cannot really do this yet in LIN. Do this yet in Lin because right now Matri doesn't even have the definition of local P. Right, so before we can get to local class we think we have to start by setting up the foundations of the theory of local P. And that's what we are currently working on. So as usual in LIM, we try to formalize things in as much general idea as possible. So first I will start by showing you some results that we have formalized about Use some results that we have formalized about discrete valuation rings or fields with a discrete valuation. So I'm going to fix a field K. And our definition of discrete is that a valuation on the field K that takes values in set genus infinity is discrete if it is a non-Archimedean valuation that is surjective. There are some other definitions at the cultures, but we chose to enforce surjectivity so that we didn't have a choice of valuation. We don't have a choice of valuation. Okay, so the first proposition that we prove is that if we have that the field k is complete with respect to discrete valuation p, then the unit pole k0 is a discrete valuation p. Then after doing this, we prove some results about extensions. So if we have again k is complete with respect to this evaluation p, and we have a finite extension l over k. A finite extension L over K. We saw that there is a unique discrete valuation on L that gives rise to the valuation P on K. And moreover, we saw that the field L is complete with respect to this descriptive valuation. Finally, we also saw that the two possible definitions of the ring of integers agree. So meaning that, again, if k is complete with respect to this valuation and a level k is final. And L over K is finite, then the integral closure of the unit pole K0 inside L, this is equal to the unit pole inside L. Okay? In particular, this tells us that the unit pole in L is also this evaluation ring and that L naught is a finite free k0 model of rank n, where n is the dimension of L over K. Now that we have this. Now that we have these lemmas about these evaluations, we can specialize into the setting of local fields, which is the setting that is most interesting to us. So we are going to define a local field as a field which is complete with respect to a discrete valuation and such that the residue field is fine. So whenever I say local field today, I mean non-Archimedean local field. I'm not including the reals of the complex. Complex. And then we are going to try to prove most of the results using this first definition of local field. But for some things, it will be useful to separate into two cases. So we have mixed characteristic local fields, which are finite extensions of Qp of the field of periodic numbers. And then equal characteristic local fields are finite field extensions of the field. Are finite field extensions of the field FPX. Now there is some ambiguity here with what I mean by FPX, right? Because I could mean that this is the ring of Lorentz series of FP, but I could also mean that this is the exotic completion of the field FPX of rational functions. So one of the first things that we do is we prove, well, a Philippo student that this Well, Philippe was saying that these two rings are isomorphic, so it doesn't really matter which definition you work with. Okay, yeah. Are you go do you ever consider characteristic zero local fields like formal or on series in C? No. This is an arithmetic phenomenon. Thank you. Yeah. So no, we don't consider those. Also, for example, this isomorphism, this is true for general fields. So that we do in general. But most of the theory, we are going to assume that the rest of the is finite. Yeah, and then we saw that these two last definitions are special cases of local things. Okay. This is just how This is just how this looks in Lin. So, something I want to point out here is that I have written the evaluation additively because that's how it's usually done in the literature, but in Lin we work with the multiplicative version. So, here this set MO, this means with zero multiplicative M so basically it's like powers where the exponents are set union union, union minus infinity and then. And then, yeah, the definitions of mixed characteristic local field and equal characteristic local field are just saying that the dimension of the algebra is finite. Okay, so some results that we want to prove about local fields is first we want to prove that there is a relation to global fields, right? So, again, we work in the more general setting whenever possible. Setting whenever possible. So if we have a delete in the mean R, I will always assume that R is not a field, and K is the fraction green of R, K is a maximum ideal of R, then the completion of K at T has a discrete valuation that extends the valuation on K and such that the unit ball agrees with the completion of R at P. In particular, the completion of the In particular, the completion RP is a discrete valuation tree. And again, we specialize to the mixed characteristic and equal characteristic cases. So if we have a number field F and a finite place P of F, then F B is going to be a mixed characteristic local field. And if we start with a function field F and any place P of F, then Fb is an equal characteristic local field. Yeah, so this is a sketch of the proof of the first statement here in this slide. So on the first lines, I am just setting up the variables. So this tells me that R is a vacancy domain, K is the functional field of R, and V is a maximal ideal of R. Then I set up the notation Rv and KB for the completion. Kb for the completions. And what we do is we prove that there exists a uniformizer in Rv. That means that there exists an element with valuation equal to 1. Again, this looks a bit weird here because we are working with the multiplicative version. But it's multiplicative of minus 1, you should think of that as 1 in the integers. I mean, here we have a lemma that there's a. A lemma that tells us that whenever we have a uniformizer, then the valuation is going to be discrete. So the demand is going to be subjective. This Z and zero also reverses the order. Yeah, because you are raising to the negative of the values of the attitude values. Okay. And then the last thing I want to say about the ongoing work is about. About the ongoing work is about ramification indexes. So, in MASIF, we already have a very general definition of ramification index. So, this is defined in general for any A algebra B and any pair of ideals of A and B. But in our situation where we are working with discrete valuation rings, there's really only one ideal that we care about. We only care about the maximum ideal. So, to avoid having to write the maximal ideal of the time, we are going to set annotation E, D. annotation EBA for the ramification index of B over A. Okay, so we want to prove a few things about ramification indexes. So first we want to prove that the degree of re-extension L over K is equal to the ramification index times the inertial degree. And hopefully this will be easy because we have again a more general statement of this form in massive so we can This form in massive, so we can hopefully use that for this proof and not have to do a lot more. And then we also want to prove that a uniformized uniformized by in the basin A stays a uniformization in B if and only if the ramification index is equal to one. And finally, well, we have already shown that QP is unramified and modulo some stories of this isomorphism between Lorenz series and the complete. Between Egorian series and the completion, we also have it for FPX. I'm a little. Can I ask about this definition? What happens if A is say ZP and then you have red ZP and QP and then a red QP and Laurent series, or now a power series over QPP? So that would satisfy the variables, but then what would the ramification be in that context? Context. Do you mean for this here? In the lean code there. I guess I'm a little confused why there isn't like an integrality condition or something. Just gets narrow. Is that what it is? Yeah, you can understand because the general definition is utilizing, so probably you can hear something. Uh probably you get yeah something yeah some nonsense in those cases. Uh big is not contained in uh yeah if the small ideal is not contained in the big ideal the manification index is roughly zero and it takes it if they manifest itself here. Okay now I told you at the beginning that our goal is to prove local class free theory eventually. So I'll say a bit more about what we mean by that. So we want to prove what So we want to prove, well, the first thing that we want to prove is the local disciplicity law. So this tells us that if K is a local field, then there exists a homomorphism called the local arcing map from the units of K to the Gala group of K ab and over K. And this homomorphism satisfies that for every uniformizer of K, PK applied to this uniformizer, when you restrict to the unramified part of K, decided that the Part of k, so that the maximum randomized extension of k this acts like Robinius. And then we also want to show that for every finite abelian extension L of K, we get an induced isomorphism between the units of K positioned by the norm of the units of L and the Dalo group of L over T. Now, there's a second theorem that we'll also want to formalize later, which is the existence. Later, which is the existent theorem. So, this says that whenever, well, first, I'll remind you that a subgroup n of the units of a local field is called a norm group if there is a finite abelian extension l over n, such that this n is equal to the norm of the units of l. And then the statement of the theorem is that every open subgroup of finite index in the units of k is a norm group. Yeah, so today I'm only going to focus on this TLN and I'm going to outline a strategy to prove this. I'm not going to give a lot of details, but I'm going to point out some of the homology theory that we need for this. Okay, so yeah, the first thing that we need is we need group homology and Galbraith communology. So some good news: we already have group homology in Mazda, thanks to Amelia Livingstone, who is also here. Livingstone, which is also here. We are also going to need a group homology. And this tool is here, this is taken from the group homology page in Matrix. And a lot of what it's here are the first things that we want for our goal. So that worked out pretty nicely. And talking to Amelia, she tells us that the first goal, for example, the inflection restriction sequence. Restriction sequence that's done. It's not in MATLAB yet, but it's being PR. Then we are also going to need the longest act sequence in homology associated to any sort sequence of representations. And we will need a profinite homology to define the locomotive. Now, we also need some results about the homology of the units of L. So the first thing that we need is skill. So, the first thing that we need is Hilbert's theory and 19, which again is proven by Amelia, but not automatic yet. So, this says that whenever we have a finite calor extension of fields, then the first homology group where the group is galva of L over A and at the model is the units of L, this vanishes. We also need to know something about the second commodity group. So, for that, we need to prove this theorem. So, we need to prove that. Theorem. So we need to prove that for every local field gate, there is a canonical isomorphism between this second combined group and UM of Z, such that whenever we consider any finite extension of Perian, this induces an isomorphism between H2 and this cyclic group of Oregon. Okay? How far is that? That's a good question. Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have said that. I guess we need the second condition. It's really not a fair. That's what it means. Yeah, that's a good question. So canonical it has its own name. I think that's a way of saying definition. It's always nice. Okay. Then we need tape homology. So whenever there is a finite group, an M is a G model, we are going to define the Earth tape homology group as positive part. For positive part, this is just the usual group homology, but then we want to extend this to also the negative coefficients. So for r is equal to zero and r is equal to negative one, we are going to define it as these two quotients. And then if r is less than negative one, we are going to define it as the homology group of with coefficient minus r minus one. In particular, this means that we also need to formalize group homology, which is not done. Which is not done yet, but hopefully, now that group comology is done, it won't be as hard as if we didn't have that already. And then for the next slide, I want you to notice that in particular, if my model M is set with the trivial G absence, then H minus 2. So this is the first analogy proof, and that's going to be the average aisle of G. So the main theorem that we have to prove is called Gibbs theorem, and we will be able to recover the local reciprocity law from Gibbs. So what this says is that if G is a finite group and M is a G model, assuming that for all subgroups of G, we have these conditions, that the first homology group vanishes and the second homology group is cyclic of order equal to. is cyclic of order equal to the order of the group. Well then we get an isomorphism between HR theta of GZ and HR plus 2 theta of Gm. And this is a very specific isomorphism. This is just given by cap product with a generator of H2 of Gm. And yeah, this isomorphism only depends on the choice of the generator to the pick. Okay, so why do we So why do we get back the theorem that we wanted? Well, if we specialize to the case where m is the units of L, where L over k is a finite extension, and we look at the index R is equal to negative 2. Then on this side we have H minus 2 G cell, which I just told you is equal to T A B N is G. And then on this side we have And then on this side we have H0T of the units of L. So that's going to be the units of K positioned by the norm of the units of L. So the isomorphism that we wanted in the local reciprocity map is the map from this side to that side. And then you have to put, you do this for every finite extension and then you put them together to get the map in the level of the Javaian colour group. Okay. Any questions about this part of the talk? So then I'll move on to the second project. The second project is about formalizing definitions of several of on-page video prints. And parts of this project, I will tell you which part exactly are joined with. Tell you which part exactly are joined with Antoine Samberlo. Okay, so I'll start by reminding you of some work that I recently formalized. So first, very quickly I'll say that a non-Art median multiplicative norm on R bin R, this is just an absolute value on R that satisfies the strong triangle inequality. So the norm of a sum is less than or equal to the maximum. A sum is less than or equal to the maximum of the norms. I formally approved that if I have a field k that is complete with respect to a non-Archimedean multiplicative norm, and I have an algebraic extension L over K, which could be infinite, then there is a unique multiplicative norm on L that extends the norm on K. So this Uh, so this uh was formalized uh this year and it's going is going to be published in ITP this summer if you want to look it up. And then as a special case, we are going to apply this to K is equal to QP. So QP is complete with respect to the p-adic norm and L for us is going to be the algebraic closure of Qp. So this CRM tells us that This CRM tells us that the p-adic norm on QP extends uniquely to a p-adic norm on QPL. But then depending on what kind of work you want to do, QPL might not be the correct field to work with. So sometimes we want to work with the completion of QPL with respect to this norm. And that is called CP. Sometimes this is called the field of the addict complex numbers because of the analogy with the useful complex numbers. Complex language? Now I'm going to take a small detour and remind you of some of the theory that we are going to need for the next of the talk. So I claim here that QPL and CP are going to be the first example of contained periodrines. Before we look at what I mean by contained periodrines, I'm going to talk about color representation. So a color representation, so well first we fix So, well, first we fix apiadic field k. If you want k is equal to qp, but it could also be some extension. And we denote by dk the actual color group of k. Then a pi-adic color representation is a continuous loop homomorphism from dk to g L V, where phi is some finite dimensional 3p vector space. Okay, one example of this will be if we have a proper smooth variety x defined over k, then Of n over k, then we can look at this ethalcomology group, and that will be a theoretical representation. So, I guess my first problem here is a formalized talcomology so that we can talk about things like that, right? But yeah, like I guess the economy problems in this part of the talk are all like farther away than in the previous talk, I will say. Okay, so now that we have this definition of characteristics. Have this definition of colour representation. We can talk about what I mean by Fontainebleau trend. So, Fontainebleau string is going to be a topological QP algebra B that satisfies some nice properties. So, first property is we want this string to have a continuous linear action of GK. We also want it to have some kind of compatible structure, and sometimes this could be a proven snap, or it could be some sort of filtration, or so on. We want to impose that the fixed points of P under the action of decay form a field. And yeah, the last thing that we want is we consider this functor DV. So this functor sends a colour representation V to well we first take the tensor of the tensor product of V and representation P over to B and then Over to P, and then we take the fixed points by the Galaxy. Well, the claim is that this is going to be a vector space over this field Vg. And somehow this vector space is going to give us some interesting information about the colour representation V. And we will say that the representation V is beadmissible if the dimension of this. Of this vector space agrees with the QP dimension of E. Okay. So what examples have been already formulated? These three examples. So well in this slide, I'm just for simplicity assuming that case equal to QPL. So the first example we can take P is QPL and we say that the colour represent colour representation P is QPL is admissible. Is QPR admissible if and only if the Calo axiom factors through a finite quotient. If V is equal to the p-adic complex numbers, then one can show that V is simply admissible, is equivalent to the action of the inertia group on P factoring through a finite quotient. And finally, the last string that has been formalized is V-Host state. So this is the So, this is the Lorentz polynomial ring over CP, and our representation V is the hot state admissible, or we also call that hot state. If when we tensor the representation with CP, we obtain a decomposition of this one. So, all these equivalences have also been formalized? No, no, no. Only the definitions have been formalized. So, that is. Not the fact that it's a physical center, it's really centered. No, no, the only thing that has been for my life are the recognition of the rings. But you have all of this, you've got all of these controls over normal extensions, don't you? Tate has this concept of almost unraveled extension. I mean, all the machinery you've got, if you wanted to start doing too, all the machinery you've got would be very useful. I asked you this back in Los Angeles, but maybe there's an update. Do we have the Gala action on rehaunch date? No, not yet. We haven't seen it yet, right? On CP, yes, we do have it on CP. So we're just missing the cycle topic. Yeah, I haven't thought about that since the previous conference. Yeah. The analysts are called the known character, but we haven't a lot of it. Okay, so now this is sort of password. Now, what's ongoing in this project? Well, we want to summarize also the definitions of the rings VDERAM and V-Cris. So, I'll tell you a bit about how to define both of these. Both of them have very complicated definitions. So, for VDERAM, So, for V the random, again, I'm going to assume for this that k is equal to 2p. So, first, I define a ring E as the perfection of OCP mod P. This is the MATLIB code, sorry, the link code corresponding to that. Then we define AU as the big vectors of DSwing E. If vectors are already in market, which I already Those are already in market, which I always find sort of amazing. And then binf plus is going to be in what I have in market P. Why is the first one called pre-tilt as opposed to tilt? Is it just missing the additive structure? Well, I don't know. It's called that in Matlio. I can try to check later. That's the name in Matlia. Okay. And then to continue with the definition, we first have to prove that there is a canonical again, well, canonical means that we know what this map is, I guess. There is a surjective homomorphism from Bnf plus to Cp. And we are going to define B2AM plus as the completion of Tinf plus with respect to the ideal kernel of this map. There are still some sorries here, but the number of There are still some stories here, but the number of stories has decreased since last time, so hopefully, it's getting closer to being formalized. And then, once we have VDRN plus, V2M is just going to be the field of fractions of VRN plus. Okay. And when you have the Gala action, you should have to chase it through all your instructions. Because, yeah. I mean everything's voltage. No, but what I'm saying is that it's great for one eye, but it's amazing for the other it should all be for everything should be there? It's true, but hardly. Do we have a PRA logarithm or are we able to find the other T? I don't think we do. Where's Yuri? I told Yuri years ago when Yuri was thinking about logarithms, I told him he needed the other blog. I don't think anybody ever took me seriously, and I never bothered to actually do anything. But here we are. Okay. Now, the definition of P crease is also complicated. So, first, we define a ring A crease as the PRD completion of the divided power envelope of A inch with respect to the ideal curve theta. If you don't know what these words mean, I'm going to talk about that in a few slides. Once we have defined this kind of mysterious ring acres, ring A crease. We again invert P to get a new ring D crease plus and then we will have to show again this isn't done but we will have to show that there is some element T in D crease plus on which DK adds by multiplication by the siglotomic character and then D crease will be defined as D crease plus inverting this line. Okay, so what the part that we are working on is defining these three words divided by power angle. So the rest of the ongoing work that I'm going to discuss is all joined with Antwerp Chamberlain. And I'll start by telling you what divided powers are. So I'm going to fix a ring A and some ideal I of A. Then divided powers are Then a divided power structure on the ideal i is a family of maps from the ideal to star, indexed by the positive natural numbers, that satisfy the same properties as x to the n over n factory. This is very vague, but I will show you the link code in the next slide, and it will be clear which properties they satisfy. And then we will say that phemorphism is amorphism between two Amorphising between two well these tuples are going to be called divided power algebra so that will be the power the tuple formed by the ring the ideal and the divided power structure. So a piezomorphism is a map from a divided power algebra to a second map, which is a ring homomorphism from A to B, such that the image of the ideal in A falls into the ideal in B. Falls into the ideal MP and such that there is some compatibility for this family of maps given by this format. Okay, so this definition of divided properties was introduced by Cartan. Most of the theorems about this kind of objects were proven by Roby, and we are following some articles of Roby in our formalization. And the divided power envelope, which will The divided power envelope, which will come up in a couple of slides, that construction is due to first elope. And yeah, I will say that something that was a bit hard about this formalization was figuring out where everything was in the literature, right? Because at least that we know if there is no self-contained reference for the final detail by the power envelope. So yeah, you start with the Yeah, you start with this reference by Bertelo, but then that defines the divided power envelope, but assuming that you already have the definition of the universal divided power algebra. And for that, you have to go back to Robin. So we hope that something that's going to be useful about our formalization is that it will provide a unified reference for TIPS. Okay, so let me show you a bit of the ENCODE. So, this is what I mean by these maps behave like x to the n over n factorial. So, they satisfy all of these properties. So, yeah, a couple of comments about the implementation. So, in the previous slide, I said that this is a map from the idea to itself, but in MATLAB, to avoid coercion, it is more convenient to define this as a map from the ring A to itself, so that in the ideal I, this map is. That in the ideal i, this map is what we want, and outside the ideal, we just set it equal to zero. So, that's the first property is just telling us that outside the ideal, the map is equal to zero. And then the rest of the properties are telling us that these maps are supposed to satisfy the same properties as x to the end of the n factorial. So, for example, b power zero x, that should always be equal to one. Again, this is not included in the previous slide just because that will not go from the ideal to itself if we go from the ideal to a I guess. But then we also have that double one x is equal to x, because x to the one over one factorial is equal to x. And then we want to know how this decay with respect to addition, multiplication, and so on. So these are the formulas that have to be said. The formulas that have to be satisfied. What is L truth? You last like? Yeah, it's like multinomial size. Yeah, so like I'm not going to show you a lot of inko, but some of these proofs require a lot of like forminatorics to get the coefficients right and like rearranging sums and things like that. So some of them were quite painful in that respect. Some of them were quite painful in that respect, yeah. Okay, um, okay, so I'll give you some examples of things that we have formalized about these divided powers. So, for example, the first thing, well, one of the first things we formalized is that if the ring the ring A is accurate algebra, then really the only divided power structure that you can push is the one given by X to the n over n factory. So you can prove that anything that's a So you can prove that anything that satisfies all of the properties has to be equal to the Islamic. Then we want to construct divided powers on several constructions that you can apply to rings. So for example, if we have two ideas, I and J in A, and both of these ideas have provided power structures that agree on the intersection, then we can Then we can get a corresponding divided power structure on the sum of the ideals that extends both of the structures on I and N. And the sum hypotheses we can put divided power structures on intersection of ideas and ideas of attention proto frames. And then we can also find a notion of sub-PD ideal and we can prove something as about that notion. So for example, if there is an idea, For example, if j is an ideal of a, then j times i is a sub-PD ideal of i. And yeah, there's also some relation between this notion of sub-PD ideal and VD IDIs on the first. Okay. Now, next thing that we want to show is that there exists a universal divided power algebra. So, what this means is whenever we have an Whenever we have an A module M, there exists a divided power algebra, gamma M, gamma plus M, gamma, and some a linear map from the module M to gamma M with the right universal property. So the universal property here is that if I have another, if I have an A algebra B that has a B by the power sector, and then I have a map from the module N. From the module N to the ideal J. An A linear mass, then there is a unique divided power morphism from this universal divided power algebra to PJ theta, such that, well, these maps commit. Usually, when you want to work with the universal divided power algebra, you don't really care about the definition, you only care about the universal property, which is why. About the universal property, which is why in most cases the references omit this definition, right? But if we wanted to formalize it, we had to trace it down to this paper of Roddy. So we have formalized the definition and we have shown that the statement that gamma m is a graded algebra and that gamma naught of m is equal to the ring A, gamma 1 of m is equal to the model n, and the ideal is given by the sum of By the sum of the degree i parts for i positive. But we still have to prove that this command has a divided power structure that satisfies the correct universal property. So we still have some stories in that proof. Okay. But I'll show you a little bit what the construction actually is. So this divided power algebra, this is going to be a portion. Algebra. This is going to be a quotient of the multivariate polynomials with coefficients in the natural x times m. And we pose them by the idea generated by these relations. So we ask that x0a is related to 1. Then we ask some properties for the adhesion multiplication and scalar multiplication that kind of look the same. Kind of look the same, kind of look similar to the properties that we had in the finished multiplied powers. So yeah, you possibly use properties, and then this is the universal divided power envelope. Okay, and now the divided power envelope again is going to be characterized by some universal property. So now we have some. We have some divided power algebra on A, and we have an A algebra B with some ideal J. Well, the claim is that there exists some B algebra DV, sorry, DV gamma with some P D ideal J pi w J pine omega that contains J. JP and such that this map former is compatible with Kana with this universal property. So whenever we have divided our algebra C such that this ideal K contains J C and we have this sort of diagram, then there is a unique node here that makes the diagram commune. Mix the diagram commute. Yeah, so to formalize this in Nin, we first formalize what the universal property is. So we say that the map is universal if sorry, the algebra is universal if it satisfies this universal property hidden by this diagram. So that's what the first part of the code is telling you. Part of the code is telling you. And then we want to prove that there exists a divided power envelope. Again, this is given by a very explicit construction following a paper of Bertha Law. We have the definition, but we still have some stories in the proof. But I want to point out that somehow proving this theorem is independent of proving the previous theorem about the universal divided. The previous theorem about the universal divided power algebra. So we can take that as a story, I guess, and then a filling of proof of things just using the universal property. Okay, any questions? Okay. So, okay, the next slides are all about future work. And like in the previous case, I think these goals in general are farther away. But I think the most immediate But I think the most immediate ones will be proving some of the properties of the range speed RAM and decrease. So, for example, either proving that the fixed points by GK of VTARAM are equal to K, or proving that VDARAM has a filtration given by the valuation, and that the grid between corresponding filtration is the hot state, things like this. Things like this. Yeah, again, we also want some properties of decrease. So in decrease, now if we take the fixed points by dk, we don't get k anymore, we get this k-mode field. So this is defined as the deep vectors of the residual field of k and then a winberg field. And then this plane. Playing that I discussed with Brandeis Musician about the distinguished element of IT of Ida RAM. We wanted to have this element here is in decrease. But yeah, I think these goals are farther away than the goals from the previous project. And just for completion, I want to state some goals that are even farther away. So the first So the first one would be stating the front-end meso conjecture. So stating, right? Because this conjecture is still open, right? It is not only in some concrete places, before the old dimension. But even stating this will take some work, right? Because again, the talcomology appears here. So to be able to state this, we need to have a formalization of the alchemology. Yeah, and then another thing that contained PTO trains are useful for is for comparison theorems between homology theories. So for example, PTRAN can be used to provide a comparison theorem between the random homology and the et al cohomology of a proper smooth parity dx over k. So, yeah, this theorem tells us that for That for every integer R, there's some canonical isomorphism between beta random tensor k with the art round commodity and beta rand tensor QP with the art etal commodity. We also want that this respects filters and safety variation on both sides. Again, we don't have either the homologies yet, so yeah. But yeah, assuming that we were able to prove this comparison theorem, we could show that the Teran commodity can be recovered in terms of the et al. commodity. And we also will be able to prove this, it has this sort of decomposition. Okay, and yeah, I'll just quickly say that there's also some comparison theorem for decreased time. Theorem for decreased time cohomology. So now for this limit, assume that you have a proper smooth variety over k with good reduction, and then you pick some proper smooth model over OK. And then you get an isomorphism between, well, on one side you have some decreased tensor with some free staring commodity of this smooth model. Model and then on the right the right hand side you have V creates tension over QP with the artital common again very far away from the informalized but I'll start with it and yeah this is everything I wanted to present today. Do you have any questions?
