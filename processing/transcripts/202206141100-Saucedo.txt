Thanks, Alyssa, for the nice introduction. And thanks again for the invitation for me to present. My apologies for not being there in person, but so far I think I've learned a lot of valuable information and looking forward to the discussion later today. So today I'm going to talk about incorporating human mobility data into our EPI models. And I do want to say beforehand that this talk is going to be beforehand that this talk is going to be mostly based gonna be mostly based on vector-borne diseases but we do want to talk about a little about COVID later on in the talk itself all right so when I talk about mobility data nowadays most individuals have some type of smartphone device that allows you to more or less track More or less track how people move throughout different regions and also allow you to look at times that the amount of time people spend in certain regions. And also, you can view this data in many different formats. So here, what I'm illustrating is what type of data sources there exist and what are their limitations. What are their limitations in terms of timing and geographical location? So, for example, if you look at this figure here, the X axis represents various regions, so neighborhood, urban, regional, international, and international, and international. And then the Y axis represents different times, so hourly, daily, periodic. Time so hourly, daily, periodic, seasonal, long-term, and migration. Now, according to the type of data that you have, they can cover a variety of regions and timelines. So, for example, if you take a look at travel history surveys, they cover up to from neighborhood to intranational, and then they can be from daily to seasonal. And the type of data source that we would ideally like to That we would ideally like to have our hands on is a data set that covers all the timelines or all the region themselves. So, if you look here in the right, if you take a look at personal GPS trackers, those cover from neighborhood to regional and from hourly to periodic. And then you can incorporate also your social media, your mobile phone records, satellite nightlights, and also Google. And also Google location history data. So, from this example here, we could see that the Google location history data is the one that encompasses all of the types of regions and time. But you can already ask yourself, well, Google location picture data is mostly for users that have Android phones. And we know that everybody has an Android phone. They can have different types of phones. So that type of data itself. So, that type of data itself wouldn't be obtainable for certain individuals. And another big assumption that this is making here is that everybody has a cell phone, and we know that that's not the case. So, you know, even though we have this very nice way to be able to capture mobility, it can introduce some bias in the sense that not everybody has access to this type of technology. Technology. But what I'm going to be focusing on today is this mobile phone records data that we're going to incorporate to a vector-borne disease model. All right, so I want to give an example of some of the mobility trends that we could obtain from open sources. So this was obtained from the Apple. Obtained from the Apple mobility patterns. So, this is an example of how movement was portrayed in Virginia from January 2020 to 2021. And of course, you can see how movement changed through, you know, looking from beginning of 2020 to March and then back to the following year, we get this, you know, standard mobility pattern. Mobility pattern and then a dip, and then slowly back we see an increase. All right, so this is one of the examples of the type of mobility data that we have access to. And this one's nicely parsed in the sense that it gives you information about whether you're walking, taking a transit, or driving. And the idea is to be able to get this data and add it into our Eddie models. And how do we go about doing that? Uh, and doing that, right? So, again, um, this is in this in the lens of vector-borne diseases, but the techniques that I'm going to talk about here are applicable to any epidemiological models. So, a vector-borne disease is a disease that can be transmitted between from a vector to a human or from a vector to an animal. And this usually occurs when an infected vector. An infected vector bites a susceptible host, or a susceptible vector bites an infected host. And the types of vectors that we're talking about here, they could include mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, snails, and sandflies. The ones that we'll be talking about are going to be mosquitoes. So we have this interaction between a host and a vector and And of course, the infection only occurs when one, either the host or the vector is infected and when the other one is susceptible. So why focus on vector-borne diseases? Well, we know that vector-borne diseases are one of the leading causes of infectious diseases throughout the world. We see that. We see that there's still very, there's areas that are in which vertical borne diseases are very prevalent. And malaria is actually the one that is the most prominent and causes the most deaths throughout several regions. And we've started to see that there's several different factors that help malaria spread through different regions. So travel can be one of them. Travel can be one of them. As the world itself starts to get more connected, we can see malaria being transmitted into regions that haven't seen malaria. Climate change is another factor in a sense that environments that were not, that mosquitoes didn't thrive in before, now they can have access to those given environments. Movement of animals also plays a role in this. Of animals also plays a role in this. So there's a lot of factors that are having a huge impact on how vector-borne diseases become prevalent. And also, even these regions in which we don't see malaria or see vector-borne diseases, that they were eradicated once they're starting to slowly come back in, because we're starting to see this factor such as travel or animal movement coming into play into those regions. So we want to figure out. Regions. So we want to figure out what are how we can incorporate these stackers into our modeling and see what's the huge impact that they can make in either terms of control. So as we saw back in 2016, there was a Zika outbreak that occurred. And one of the factors that played a role into the propagation of To the propagation of Zika was the spatial heterogeneity. So there's different regions in which Zika was thriving due to its given environment. And what we wanted to tackle is to see, okay, can we use this information of people traveling from different regions into a vector-borne disease model and see how this spatial heterogeneity can influence. Can influence the disease dynamics in the network study. So there's been work done on this already in terms of figuring out how movement plays a role. So understanding how connectivity between different spatial locations, this is a big factor when you're trying to look at disease ecology and public health. So these are just a few studies that I want to. That I want to highlight here. But the overall idea is that incorporating connectivity and local disease transmissibility do play a strong role on trying to control a vector-borne disease outbreak. And then in regions in which you have low abundance of mosquitoes, you can still see persistence of that vector-borne disease. And that's because you have people going back into these regions. People going back into these regions in which the victim of the disease has high transmissibility, and they're going back to their home location to spread out the disease. And one key factor as well is that if you can somehow mitigate movement, that can have a huge impact on how to kind of control or mitigate the disease. Or mitigate the disease and extinction. All right, so what is the motivation for our study? Well, we're taking a look at this paper in which they compared a classic Ross McDonald model with a multi-patch model. So, in the multi-patch model, what they had was human ability through the use of cell phone data. And then their objective. And their objective was to look at, to try to identify how malaria sources sink for pre-elimination in amibia. And what they found out was that if you were to compare the classical model and the multi-patch model, you get more heterogeneity, of course, in the multi-patch model. And one of the big factors for preventing the elimination. Factors for preventing the elimination of malaria in this region was the use of looking at this multi-price model and incorporating human mobility. So what we wanted to focus on is how can we use this data to look at computing a fundamental component threshold for SIR model. For SIR model, which is the basic reproduction number, and doing that for a multi-patch/slash network type of model. So, what we tried, what we looked at was an SIS slash SI model. So, the SIS compartment is for the host. So, you have a susceptible host, and that susceptible host comes into contact with an infected mosquito, and then they become infected. Mosquito and then they become infected, and then eventually they recover. And then we also have the disease transmission for the vectors as well. So a susceptible vector bites in affected hosts. So that vector not becomes infected. And then they're removed from the population. So this is just a single patch here that we have, but the way that we want to think about it is if you consider a About it, is if you consider a graph, each of these nodes represents these transmission dynamics, and then the arrows here represent the movement of individuals. So, here for this model, we're going to assume that the host is the only one that's going to be moving and that the vectors themselves are not going to move. And we try to parameterize all these nodes with With certain local disease transmission rates. And again, when we have this, so here I just have four nodes, but in reality, we have end nodes that we're taking a look at. And if you see, you can barely see it here, but the width of the arrows here represents stronger movement from this patch to this patch down here. Down here, and then this. Um, this we have less movement from this node than this node over here. All right, so we're going to try to incorporate the distinct movement patterns between each of these nodes. So, the first goal here again is to come up with the closed form expression for the domain reproduction number for this given system. But before we do that, we have to consider the type of movement. Consider the type of movement that's occurring within our model. So there's two big approaches that we would like to consider. That's the Lagrangian approach and the Olerian approach. So when you're considering the Lagrangian approach, we're talking about people that stay, they're individuals that are treated as residents of a particular patch and then they're just commuting between other patches. Between other patches. And this type of setting is typically used when you're looking at small spatial scales. So people here have a sense of what their home patch is. And we can describe that by looking at this mixing matrix P, where P ij is the fraction of time that individual in patch J spends in patch I. And now if you want to consider a larger spatial scale, we can use the Eulerian approach. We can use the Eulerian approach. So, this is more about looking at migration between patches without a fixed sense of home. And the way that we can capture that mathematically is by using an adjacency matrix. So, adjacency matrix A here, where Mij, that represents the per capita movement rate from patch J to patch I. Now, how do we incorporate this information? Now, how do we incorporate this information into the multi-patch model? Well, what we could do is take a look at the Laplacian matrix. So, the Laplacian matrix, suppose you have a weighted directed graph. We can define the matrix L as our Laplacian of the graph by this matrix here. So, you have these per capita movement rates, the summation all in the diagonal, and then the off-diagonal, it's going to be Diagonal, it's going to be still got the per capita movements, but not being summed. Now we can define this by looking at the out degrees minus the adjacency matrix of so the so w here represents the diagonal matrix without degrees of a minus the adjacency itself. And one of the nice properties is the columns into this is equal to zero. And if we were to take a look at the kernel of our Laplacian matrix, that's going to represent the number of connected components of our Components of our graph. And there's other nice properties that the Laplace matrix itself has, but these are a few of them that I want to illustrate. And particularly, the kernel here of the Laplacian itself is going to be important when we're trying to define the network risk of our given system. All right, so if you were to disconnect every single patch itself, we can take a look at the patch-specific reproduction numbers. So here we don't have any movement. So here we don't have any movement. And what we see is something that we're standard when it comes to vector host models. So we have the R0 I, that's going to be the square root of our transmission rates and then removal rates for the vector and the host. So the betas are transmission rates and then gammas recovery rate and then the mus are the death rates for the vector and the host. So this is nothing new here, just very All right, so this is nothing new here, just very want you to keep this equation here in mind because it's going to appear later on in the talk. All right, so again, the key feature that we're trying to do here is come up with a network reproduction number or domain reproduction number. And the way that we do that is we can start off by using the next generation approach, right? So you have F here as the common vector of your Of your transmission or new infections. And then V here presents all the interaction occurring within the infected equation. And we're going to define the Laplacian matrix for the infected host. So you can define the Laplacian matrix for all of your compartments, but the one that we're really interested in is just for the infected host because that's the one that is going to appear. Because that's the one that is gonna appear when we're looking at the final step of the next generation approach. So, by that, I mean the F V I inverse. So what we end up getting is once you take the Jacobian and evaluate the zero equilibrium and all that, we get this very nice block matrix. So here we have a matrix of zeros, and then here we have a matrix of so d beta. So D beta H represents a diagonal matrix with the parameter beta H. And then D here does another diagonal matrix. So we still have this diagonal matrix in the upper part of our matrix. And then if you look at this component, we have this D beta V times Gi inverse, where this GI inverse represents the Laplacian matrix plus a diagonal matrix. Plus a diadem matrix with the removal rates of the host. And that's what we want to focus on. So we want to be able to come up with an expression for our fundamental matrix here, Gi inverse. And if we can do that, then we can come up with the dominant eigenvector for this matrix. Vector for Finn's matrix, which of course represents our reproduction number. And we can use this very nice Laurent series expansion to help us come up with an approximation for the GI inverse. So if you want to take a look, so there's two things you have to first consider is the type of graph that you have, whether it's going to be strongly coupled or weakly coupled. So if this scale here, epsilon, This scale here, epsilon, where we have this diagonal matrix divided by Laplacian, if that's so epsilon is a lot smaller than one, then we should strongly coupled and vice versa. And the other way around, it's going to be weakly coupled if epsilon is going to be greater than one. So under that consideration, if we have a strongly coupled graph, then we can use this Lorentzian expansion to represent the GI inverse. So we have this U matrix here. U matrix here, where U itself represents the stationary distribution of the continuous time graph that's being generated by the Laplacian matrix. And then this D bar represents the summation of all our removal parameters for the host. And we want to make a calculation for computing the network reduction number. And the way that we can do that is by defining a series. is by defining a series of diagonal matrices. And if we can find the eigenvalues for this matrix here, then the only thing I like to do is take the square root to find the, you know, to have the eigenvellers of F V numbers. So the key idea that I want you to put the graphs from here, if we do all these, we use these diagonal matrices. These diagonal matrices, what we can do is ignore the higher-order terms for Laurent series expansion and just focus on this first one. And this here is going to be approximately equal to u d bar. So again, u d bar is just going to be a diagonal matrix with the transmission parameters of the vector and the host divided by the movie rate of the vector itself. So, one thing that we could observe is that u is at rank one and then d bar has four rank. So, d bar has n minus one dimensional mold space. So, what that tells us is that there's only one non-zero eigenvalue. So, we can try to find that eigenvalue by doing this calculation. So, what you end up getting is that u d bar u, that's equal to the summation of your removal term. Of your removal terms times UI divided by d bar times u. So this here is our dominant eigenvalue, and it's being approximated by this term here. So making that calculation, what that's going to give us is the domain reproduction number. So this is, this R0 is approximately equal to one over square root of z. So this square root of z here is just a scaling term that comes from the Lot series. Term that comes from the Lot series. And if you were to rewrite it, what you notice is from the domain reproduction number, we still have some components that are patched from the local disease transmission. So we have this patch specific production number. We have our removal rates, the DI, and then you have UI here. So this UI, so this is the notation. So, this is this is you know, the notation is kind of probably not the best, but here, but uh, so this is a mu. Uh, so the mu represents the removal rates, the UI represents the network, we can call it the network risk for our system, and then we can just define this part here to be this r hat not. All right, so given that we have this calculation for the reproduction number. Calculation for the reproduction number, we want to take a look at the sensitivity equations for R0. And the reason we want to do this computation is just to see what R0 is most sensitive to. So we just take the derivative of the reproduction number with respect to the transmission parameters, the removal parameters for the host and the vector. For the host and the vector, and we get these equations. So, note here that we don't have the equation for the vector because that's very similar to the host. And as you can see in this sensitivity equations, again, we have the patch, the specific production number appearing along with the network structure in this term as well. So we wanted to take a look at a toy example just to see, give us a feel of what parameters are the ones that are impacting the domain reproduction number. So how sensitive is the reproduction number with respect to the local transmission dynamics, the network risk, and host absorption? So if you look here in this Right, so if you look here in this uh figure, so we have five scenarios. Um, so we have the black node is called node one, uh, the red node we call node two. And what we have is you know, movement between the nodes and then the removal from each of the nodes. And so, in terms of the local transmission dynamics, uh, the R02 is greater than R01. So, we're just picking that one to be. So we're just picking that one to be the node that has the most transmission between the two. And one thing that we saw is that in scenarios A, C, and D, node two is the one that should be considered for intervention, or in other words, we consider node two to be the one that R0 is going to be most sensitive to. And note scenarios C and E are. And E, R0 was sensitive to, it was hard to tell what R0 was sensitive to. So that really depended on what the values of the patch specific production number are equal to, and also the absorption, the host absorption, and the network risk. So, this is just again, just give us some motivation of what should we expect to see in more complicated scenarios, but Scenarios, but you can always start to observe that if you have more nodes, it's going to be a little more difficult to track down. Here, we just have a very simple example with two nodes, but if you have, let's say, 100 nodes, then it's going to be a lot more difficult to say exactly what R naught is more sensitive to, unless you have these very specific values, parameter values for all of your regions. Okay, so now this is where we. Okay, so now this is where we incorporate the mobility data. So we use human mobility data from Namibia. And the reason that we did this is mostly because of a colleague that I have that I have in contact with. He had this data available and I told him that I was working on developing this type of model and he was gladly shared his data with me. His data with me. So, if you notice here in our data, the way this is formatted is in terms of the proportion of time an individual spends at certain location. So, if you look at the diagonal matrices, that's going to be the home location for that individual. So, you can expect to see the spend most of their time in their home patch. And then, if you look at, say, column B and then Column B and then row three, then that's the how much time spent from you know patch to I to patch J. So if you were to actually map these, you would notice that the neighboring health districts, so what I have here in the column headers are certain health districts in Namibia. So the health districts that are adjacent to each other, those are the areas in which. Those are the areas in which they spend the most time outside of their home patch. And these records here, they're anonymous records, and even the powers in which this were collected from, this were being altered by a certain metric. So this is kind of like the aggregated proportion of time that someone spends either their home location or outside of that. So the question now turns into So, the question now turns into how do we use this case data to incorporate it into our model? So, the way that we can do that is again, we're still building using a Laplacian matrix and try to estimate the adjacency matrix from this type of data set. So, the way that we can do that is by defining this matrix V, where V is being composed of the Laplacian matrix L plus a diagonal matrix. Plus a diagonal matrix. So this diagonal matrix here represents the again, and in this case represents the removal rates for the host. So with this in mind, we want to solve this minimization problem in which we define this p hat inverse, and then that's going to be equal to the data, cell phone data that we have times the removal rates. The removal rates of the host, taking the inverse of the matrix. And using MATLAB, we're trying to come up with an estimate or trying to minimize this problem in which we're looking at the given data times this little constant matrix that we have composed inside the definition of D. So we can rewrite this to make the minimization a little bit easier. So note that So, note that in this last expression, I is 96. This is a 96 by 96 matrix because that's the number of nodes that we have in our given data. So, again, rewriting this minimization problem as this entry, the main idea is to find what this adjacent matrix is equal to. So, by doing that, we took a look at the partial rank correlation coefficient just to give us an idea how How well our estimation did. And you can notice here, overall, it did pretty well. Most of the nodes are close to one. This is a check on how our minimization problem looked like. And once we were able to estimate the efficiency matrix, now we can go ahead and plot how it looks in terms of movement within the country of Namibia. So here we have the Namibia. So here we have three different colors. So blue, red, and green. So blue means the. So it's hard to, we're first trying to figure out what's the best way to represent this. And we tried to do it by varying the shade of the connectivities. But at the end, we just created three different thresholds of how connected they are. So blue is the least connected, green is the intermediate connectivity. Connected connectivity and then red represents strong connections. And one thing that you observe here is that these middle nodes have the most connections. And that's because this is where the capital of Namibia is located. And you see some other nodes that have a few connections that are, you know, more sparse out throughout the country. And just to illustrate how the pastor production numbers look like. How the past reproduction numbers look like for the country of Namibia. We decided to plot those past-specific reproduction numbers for each of these health districts. So the lighter blue represents low values of the past-specific production numbers, and then the darker shade of blue represents higher values for the past specific reproduction numbers. And so the range, so if you see this range, that some of them are just. See the screen, so some of them are just above one. All right, so no, we were able to do the sensitivity equations for domain reproduction number, but we also be able to check whether they're realistic or they're within the radius convergence for our Laplacian or the Laurent series that we that we use. Series that we use to estimate the production number. So, to do this check, what we did was we took a look at three nodes. So, the blue represents the least sensitive node. The red represents the intermediate sensitive node, and then the yellow. I know it's the other way around. So, the yellow represents the least sensitive, red, intermediate, and then blue, the most sensitive. And we want to see where our estimation fell in terms of the sensitivities for the ranking sensitivities for each of these three parameters. So as you increase the scaling term, you start to see the variation of the ranking in terms of for each of these three nodes that we took a look at. Took a look at. And particularly if we look at gamma, so the larger the z-value is, then we're in a region that we can not trust very well the sensitivities for our given model. So this purple dotted line here represents our actual value from the data that we obtain. And what we notice is that we're within a region that the That the Lorentz series expansion gets approximately close for this domain reproduction number. Now, if you want to map, we also wanted to map the sensitivities for all of the transmission, the host removal, and the vector removal. And this is what we obtain. So, again, here what we're doing is doing a ranking between all of our nodes. Between all of our nodes. So the ranking, so the rank, so we see the darker shade of blue, that's the most sensitive, and then the lighter shade of blue is not as sensitive. So what you observe is that for the transmission and the vector removal, you get the same map, and that comes from the definition. That comes from the definition of the sensitivity equations. You get the same definition, except that you only have a minus term in front of the vector removal equation. And then for the host removal or what you see is the map looks a little bit different in terms of the actual ranking here. So this kind of gives you an idea of where your domain reproduction number is going to be most sensitive according to each of these regions. Of these regions. So here you see going the nodes up to 107, but the ones that didn't have information, we just left them white, and you can't really see them within the given figure. All right. So to summarize here, what we were able to do is develop an approximation for the reproduction number. And even though we're focusing mostly on We're focusing mostly on vector-borne diseases here. This methodology is also useful for any other type of infectious disease. And so being able to come up with this reproduction number for a multi-task model or network model is very beneficial. And also, being able to incorporate movement data, I think, is also. Movement data, I think, is also a key factor of determining how an infected disease can move through a certain population. And in terms of preparing for future pandemics, I think it's being able to have access to this type of data, I think is crucial because I think even though I've been focusing on COVID-19 here, we did try to work on COVID-19, but we had 19, but we had some limitations of getting data, reality data for the type of project that we were looking at. So I think having that type of access, I think, is an important factor for doing these type of models. And also, I'd like to thank my postdoctoral advisor, Joseph Tien, and also the Mathematical Bioscience Institute and NSF for Science Institute and NSF for giving us the opportunity to work on this type of project. Thank you.
