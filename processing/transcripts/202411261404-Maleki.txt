Small history of this problem and why we were motivated to work on this problem. So, the componential property was introduced by Del Sort to further study these sense regular graphs. And so, we are thinking that can we extend this property to graphs that are not necessarily distance regular? And so, the answer is yes, because we did a little research in literature and we noticed that. Literature, and we noticed that Paul Williger just recently extended this property to, in fact, two infinite families of graph, namely the projected geometry L and Q and the attributed space poset. So, because of that, we are motivated that because this is new, so it's a good idea to find more examples at this stage of research or even infinite family of graph with this property. And also, because we did the classification. Because we did a classification on these centrifugal graphs with classical parameters admitting a uniform structure last year, so we're thinking maybe we can focus on some of these graphs and see if they admit this couponial property or not. And so, motivated by this result, this is our result. We show that the Fubber-Quartet graph or a Hamming graph is in fact Jupyternormal. And so, of course. And so, of course, before we go into details, we need some background and definition. Half of the talk will be on just backgrounds and definitions, and the rest will be on the result. So, we need to know what is a terabyte article, what is an irreducible T-module, and what is Heming Graph. For sure, a lot of us know what is Heming Graph, but with the classical parameters, and also full-bipartite graph, and the Q polynomial property. You can lumiar property. So we start by our graph with vertex set X and R set R, which is a simple and greater and connected graph. We define rho of XY to be the distance between two vertices X and Y of our graph, and then eccentricity of X, which is the maximum distance between two vertices in our graph. And P is the diameter of the graph. And gamma of X are the set of vertices at distance R. Are the set of vertices at this stance R from our mixed vertex X. And also we have the vector space over the complex numbers, which is just consists of column vectors with coordinates indexed by X, vertices of the graph, and the entries are in C. And we also have the matrix algebra C over complex numbers, which is just a set of all matrices indexed under their rows and columns by the On the rows and columns by the vertices of the graphs and the entries are in C. And here we also have the adjacency matrix of our graph, which we know what it is, and another matrix for which we fix the vertex of our graph. And we define, it's a diagonal matrix, and under diagonal we have one if the distance between x and y is r and zero otherwise. And we call it r s to all i compotent of our graph comp. Of our graph company, now that we have these two matrices, we can introduce our theoretical algebra, which is a sub-graph of a big matrix algebra. And denotify m at of x over complex numbers. So this will algebra is generated by the set of dual item potents and, of course, the adjacency matrix of a graph. And this algebra acts on a natural way. Algebra acts on a natural way on the vector space, and we call the vector space in this way the standard module. And the set of all dual ideempotons form a basis for another algebra that we call it M star and it's in fact a dual adjacency algebra. And now by a T module, we mean just a vector subspace W of V, which is invariant by the elements. Which is invariant by the elements of the algebra. And a T module is called irreducible if it is non-zero and it has no non-trivial submodules. Also, it is well known that any T module is an orthogonal direct sum of irreducible T modules, and in return, any irreducible T module W is an orthogonal direct sum of non-vanishing subspaces the mod R sorry. And with this in hand, we can assign two parameters to an irreducible T module W, n point and the director. By n point, we mean the minimum number of r's for which the subspace the i star of w is non-zero. And diameter is just the number of r's for which the i sour of w is non-zero subtracted by one, by one. And we call our inducible t module to be thin. Call an inducible T module to be thing if the dimension of your server W is at most one. Now we need to introduce three more matrices here that are called the lowering, flat and raising matrices. These matrices are in fact in the big algebra, the matrix algebra, and by their definition it is clear that they are also in our Terbidica algebra because the Terbillar algebra is. A religion algebra because it's a religious algebra generated by A and the set of all two electropotents. And to have a better understanding of these three matrices, this is a combinatorial definition of that. So you fix a vertex in your graph and partition the vertices of the graph with respect to distance to x. And then, for instance, if you consider this f in here, we call it the flat matrix. These are like you fix a vertex in your graph, x. In your graph, x, and you partition your vertices to be like this. And if you pick two vertices, let's say z and y, the second definition says that z and y must be adjacent, so you have three possibilities. Either they are inside adjacent or backward or forward. But the other part of the definition says that they may. The other part of the definition says that they must have the same distance from x. So that means this. This is the only choice that we can have here. So this is the definition of the flat matrix. And consequently, you can define also the raising matrix and the lowering matrix here. And these two matrices have this nice property that the flat matrix transposes itself, and the transpose of the lowering is basing, and this sum to the Facing and the sum to the adjacent symmetry or background. Okay, now I think we are ready to define a uniform structure that I was talking in the beginning in our classification. But this uniform property was introduced in the 90s by Polter Williger on his study of graded partial motor sets. And later in 2013, it was extended to It was extended to a bipartite decision-quality graph by Walter Williger and Stefan Mikhovic. And last year, we extended to an arbitrary non-bipartite graph. So I will explain how did we extend that. So in order to define this uniform structure, sometimes I say uniform property, but they are the same. For that, we need a uniform matrix. We call it parameter matrix, which is a tri-diagonal matrix. This matrix has Matrix. This matrix has these properties that under diagonal we have all ones and upper diagonal and or lower diagonal must be all non-zero. And also the principal submatrix of this matrix is non-zero. If at the same time upper diagonal or lower diagonal are all non-zero, then we have a strong property. And so if you consider your And so if you consider your graph gamma, which is a wide parted graph, and you fix a vertex, you define the eccentricity for that vertex, and based on that you define your technical algebra. We say a uniform structure is just a pair uf, where f is just a collection of column vectors, such that this equation that we see here, equation number one, is satisfied on v. And consequently, we can say that it satisfies our EI star of V if and only if it holds for EI star of W for any reducible dimoise. The reason that we have this here is that it will make our job much more easier when we go into details. Instead of working on the whole space, we can just focus on reducible team models. And yes, this is a part that we did. This is the part that we did the generalization for arbitrary hypertage graphs. So we consider our graph. We have created a new graph from that by just removing these flat edges that I explained here from our graph. In that way, we make our graph a bipartite graph and we call it the full bipartite graph of the original graph. And the reason is that uh you can't find triangle in your graph later. That's why it's quite popular. That's why it's bipartisan. And we say that the graph supports the informal structure if it's a full bipartite graph admit the informal structure. This is the generalization. And of course, when you do this modification on your graph, this question can come to your mind that so what will happen to the terbilicular algebra for that graph? So since the territorial algebra we know that is generated by the adjacent We know that it's generated by the adjacency matrix of the graph and the set of all dual eye components. Here, we know that the adjacency matrix is the sum of lowering, flat, and raising matrix. Here, we remove the flat matrix in order to create your full workprotegraph gamma L. So, the adjacency matrix will be just the sum of L and R. This is the difference between the the vertical algebra of the Fourier particular and the original. And this is again our classification. The reason that I put this slide back here is just to show that we'll be focusing on the first graph. This is our first target to show that it has the full wave quartet graph of the Hamming graph has this property. And this is just to show that the Hamming graph is a distance regular graph with classical parameters and these are the classical parameters. If this happened for the case Q equals 1 in our class. For the case q equals 1 in our classification for distance regular graphs with classical parameters. And yes, now we can define our q polynomial property at the end. So let A be the adjacency matrix of your graph, which is simple, connected, and undirected. And let B sub R i, as it's written there, be an ordering of the eigen spaces of the adjacency matrix A. Adjacency matrix A. We say a matrix A star is a dual adjacency matrix of our graph with respect to this specific ordering of vector space. Sorry, our eigen spaces. If, first of all, it generates the dual adjacency algebra, and second, its action on the eigen spaces must be contained in this sum. Then we say that. We say that an ordering of eigen spaces is q polynomial with respect to a fixed vertex x if it has a dual adjacency matrix A star. In that case, we say that our graph is Q polynomial. Our graph at least a couple minutes structure. Okay, this is very important for us because when we want to show that we need to focus on these two properties, we need to create our star and show that there is an ordering for that. An ordering for that that satisfies this property, then we can say that okay, the graph that we have created is the column. Now we can start our main results. As I said, you consider your Hamming graph, remove the flat edges, your new graph is called Yammo F, which is the full bipartite graph of Hamming graph. And we show that it is pure polynomial. So the idea is first of all to find a star. So we were kind of lucky here because the star that we have is a diagonal matrix. The entries are defined to be taken by a star of S, which are indiced by the distance between X and Y. And this is, in fact, the star for Hamming graph itself, because we know that Hamming graph is a Q polynomial, so it must have a dual adjacency matrix L star for which we have this property. So we took this. So we took this JCC matrix and we want to show that this is exactly what we want for our full web article. And so first of all, we must show that the first property is to generate the dual adjacency algebra, if you remember the definition. So in order to see that, it is clear because when we create our new graph, we didn't touch the vertices of the graph. We just removed these flat edges. And so the dual identity stays the same. Dual eigenpotence says the same. And then we know that these dual eigenpotents are basis for our dual adjacency algebra. So when Q is pure, when H is Q polynomial and star is a dual adjacency matrix for that, A star clearly is the dual adjacency matrix. Sorry, M star is A star also generates the dual adjacency matrix for gamma M. Hope it is clear. Okay, and so the first property holds. And then we need to find an ordering. But before we need to find what are the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. And we also need to show that this pair A star satisfy this long equation, which is cubic in A and linear in A star. And linear in a star. And the reason why we want to show that you'll see later when we want to find the ordering. Okay, one way to compute the eigenvalues is just to consider the action of the adjacency matrix on the vector space. We know that the vector space is the direct sum of irreducible T modules, and for each T module, we have a basis W i's. So we just consider the action on these basis elements. And thanks to Tilburger, he provided us this action. Provided us this action, and as you see here, we just have the action because we just need to do AB, right? And A is just the sum of L and R in here. And we have the action of L and R in here. So based on that, we could represent this action as this tradiagonal matrix. And considering that the tribute in the T motors exist, if we have this chain of inequalities. His chain of inequalities. Okay, now we need to compute what is the characteristic polynomial of this big matrix. It was kind of complicated and tedious work, but at the end we managed to find the characteristic polynomial for this matrix. And this term Pd plus one of that sum is called the normalized crouch of polynomials. Normalize crowdsource polynomials of degree i. And we were again lucky in here because in 2010 Koke showed that these term factors linearly. So that's why we could easily find the eigenvalues of the characteristic polynomial here, which are of these four. And then again, considering the previous collaterality, together with the fact that the reducible T-modules exist if they satisfy this chain of irregularities. If they satisfy this chain of inequalities, we show that these are in fact the eigenvalues of our adjacency matrix. So we have the eigenvalues and now we just need to show that that Lawrence equation that I showed, the pair ASR, must satisfy that Larne equation. For that we first computed by that Lawrence equation I mean this one. Oh, this one. Okay, this is the second goal. This is the second goal. So, first we computed the terms on this equation one by one by showing the zy entry on each term. And then we say that the pair satisfy this tridiagonal relation. And again, we just computed the zy entry on both sides of this equation. And depending on their distance, we could show that. It could show that this equation, in fact, satisfies our graph, and it's a lot of work here. But the key point here is that we could use the property of the uniform property of the matrix that we have created here. And based on that, we could proceed and continue and show that this equation, in fact, satisfy in our graph. So this is the place that we use the uniform property. I didn't include the details for that. I didn't include the details for that. And we have some other observations on the primitive ideal potentials. And we know that they satisfy these four equations. And the last equation, if you multiply the last equation from the left by ER, you see that you get the third equation. And the third equation is very important for us because here in Here in this proposition, we want to show that this term is non-zero when the difference between the indices i and j in absolute value is either 0 or 2. So in order to prove this proposition, we consider the long equation that I showed you. That's why we computed that. We multiply that long equation from the left by Ei, from the right by Ej. EI from the right by EJ. And also, we consider the third property and we showed that this in fact satisfied here and here Ej is non-zero only when the difference between the indices I and J is 0 to now 0. And so now we can show that a star of B I, the second property for our Q polynomial property, also satisfies considering. Also satisfy considering this dual adjacency matrix A square. And to prove that, I just rewrote this VI as EI of V, which are the same, and then we put the identity matrix. The sum of EJ is from 0 to 2 D is the identity matrix. But here you see that we have created this term EJA star ER. And that's why we tried before to show that this is non-zero only when the difference between I and J0. The difference between i and j0 between absolute value. So you see that easily, you can see that here in this big sum, there are only three terms that will survive because if the difference between these two and this is an absolute value is two, the other one is zero, the other one is five. And so it's clearly contained in the sum. So in fact, we showed that the matrix star that we proposed in the beginning and what's the dual address, the matrix for the hammigraph, is also the dual addiction. Hemigraph is also the dual adjacency made to the web digraph of the Hemigraph. And based on this, we can have this ordering. This is the ordering that we are looking for because if we have this ordering, everything backward will satisfy. And then we show that, in fact, the graph that we have created satisfies all the properties for the Q polynomial. And so this is the final result: the adjacency matrix A of the graph. Oh, the graph. I mean the full graphical graph of the having graph is cube. And this is just, I'm done with my talk, but this is just because after working on this small case, we're thinking that can we generalize this and in general say something about this? And we did, and our paper is almost done. And our paper is almost done, and then we just impose some properties considering this uniform structure on this relation. And we could show that it always satisfies under the conditions that we have imposed. So under that, if you consider a full bipartite graph of any graph that admits a uniform structure, under that condition will be chiparty. And thank you. Wonderful talk. Any questions from the audience? Yeah, it's a great idea. Can you go back just one slide? There's one thing that I just didn't understand throughout. When you're saying with respect to X, where does the with respect to X come in? Perspective X come in. It's all back to the turbulent algebra when we want to define irreducible T modules and everything, and we do all the potents. We need to fix a vertex and define everything with respect to that vertex. So when you go back to the definition of the quail looker algebra, where's the little X? Did I just miss it? No, it just. Stars. It's very controlled. Yeah, it's in the beginning. Where's the little appetite? Yeah, it starts. Yeah, that's why it's yeah, so it's respect to X. With respect to X. The EI stars are with respect to X. Okay. You have a question? Yeah. So I've heard this voluntary unique virtual. I think when we did this work, we found actually. World, we found actually eight sets of disordering that were isomorphic to these two cases that I just presented. And I think so there are eight cases that were isomorphic to the two cases that I have presented at the end. Other questions? Fine, I'm Data. Um, that's quite a nice one. So let's begin with a private brand. When you write your adjacency matrix, when is it when it's a possible that you have a special big long scroll? Some of the more concepts. I don't know the answer to the question, but I think it's interesting. There are no more questions, let's get on. Okay, we're done to our next topic. Okay, we're down to our last coffee floor and the coffee break again.
