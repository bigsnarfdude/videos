For inviting me, first of all, here and second of all to speak. As Simon said, I'll be speaking about recent work of an ongoing work, work in progress on studying quasi-periodic operators with finite-valued backgrounds. And so here we're going to talk about continuity of the Lyman exponents. We have work in progress on positivity. Sorry, on a positive view, we have work in progress on conservation. So, before we get started on anything technical, I'd like to address a couple of related works. So, as we heard earlier, there's work by Kai Larze and Klein. And they studied and are studying quasi-periodic and random mixed operators, as we heard before lunch. And there are some nice results on both positivity and continuity of the Lyopo conspiracy in that case. There's also recently, actually just last month, little less. Little less than a month ago, actually, there was a preprint posted to the archive by Demonic Filmman and Book and they studied this product dynamics and a particular Product dynamics and of particular interest in their paper. It's a bit broader to their scope, but one of their applications was in for trigonometric polynomial, calls it periodic plus periodic. And they proved the positivity of the Lyophon exponent in that case. Uh three comes after two. Uh we should also mention uh work by Perkin and Ilya, who is in the audience in since 2019, where they studied the two-dimensional quasi-periodic operator with a low. Periodic operator with a low-complexity background, and they studied localization of that model. We also have work by Wensai in the same paper that actually Nera discussed this morning. One of the many large deviation theorems that he obtained is a large deviation theorem for positive mirror operators with. Operators with low-complexity background. And he also established continuity of the integrated density of states. Those results are perturbative. And not related to the particular model, but related to the argument that we're going to discuss is actually. Is actually this morning, Amira discussed this notion of complexification and using this harmonic measure, or this Poisson measure. And that's actually going to play a crucial role in our argument. Okay, so let's get started and actually write down what our Write down what our actual model is. So we're going to be interested in a posite periodic operator which acts on psi in the following way. We have the standard Laplacian. Laplacian. But then we're going to have our quasi-periodic potential. And we're going to have some background. And our positive periodic potential V is going to be some analytic function on function on the torus. Our phase X is just going to be something in the torus. Our frequency is going to be anything, again, in the torus. And our background is going to be a finite valued sequence. So view this as some function from z to some finite. Some finite set of numbers, say r1 to r q. And we're not going to assume anything special about this. The value of q is going to be completely irrelevant so long as it's some finite number. Okay? Some particular examples of u, but not periodic, right? Could be periodic. Could be periodic. So some particular examples of you. So it could be Q curiosity. So it could be Q periodic. It could also be, say, some subshift on some finite alphabet. It could also be, say, some Fibonacci type potential plus a plethora of Plus, a plethora of other things that I cannot possibly write down. I can't write down an exhaustive list. Okay, so maybe a random? So long as the randomness only takes finitely negative values, then absolutely. So, when we're going to be interested in the Lyophon of exponents, so we need to actually write down what that actually means. So, let's just recall the transfer matrix using some notation of ours. Let's say this is the following of 2 by 2. This is the following of 2 by 2 matrix. And so the usual n-step transfer matrix is just the product of these. in the usual way. And so to define our Liophot exponent, we first define these lns, which is just an average of the log Of the log norm of this. And so our Liopative exponent is going to be the, essentially, the limit of the average of this. Unfortunately, the limit need not exist always. So we're actually going to look at the lower number.  And our main theorem is the following: if we take our operator, which I just erased. Then we can find some lambda naught, which just depends on the quasi-bariotic potential. So that if we take lambda larger than lambda naught, the open of x function Open of x volume is at least half. And what's nice here is that this just depends on beer. It does not depend on the background in any way, shape, or form. And the method of proof is really inspired by. This argument by Swords and Spencer and Bourbain's book, for example, for proving this without a background. And so we just adapt that proof. And so that's really what I'd like to give an idea of. I'd like to give an idea of how we can adapt that proof to prove this. Improvements? This this tandem is quite large. Sorry, what? This tandem note is quite large. Yes, it can be quite large. It can be, but it is quite large. Yes. At least the greater part. Yes. Okay. And so, how do we do this with what's a rough outline? Do this with it? What's a rough outline? Well, first, what we're going to do is we're going to take these ln x e's before we take an average and we're going to complexify that. We're going to raise it to the complex average, to a complex string in particular. Which we can always do because this is a subharmonic function. This is a subharmonic function, and the potential has a nice analytic extension to the strip, so we can always extend this to some strip. You complexify the energy or the phase? We're complexifying the phase. Once we do that, we obtain lower bounds. On some line segment, on some horizontal line, we show that. Some horizontal line, we show that we have nice lower bounds in terms of lambda. And then, once we have these, we then relate this to back on the real line. So, this is the general structure of the path. So, complexification, how does that work? As I said, this is a subharmonic function. It has a nice subharmonic extension to some strip in the complex plane. So, firstly, let's call this new. Let's letter. Let's call this w of x. And this is a nice subharmonic function. And it extends in a bounded way in some complex. In some complex structure, there is some row for which we can do this extension. And a nice little lemma that immediately becomes obvious is that for any Delta smaller than one, there is some epsilon so that for any finite collection, but let's stick to Q because our background consists of Q numbers, for any collection. Collection of qubit numbers. There is some y naught between delta over two and delta so that if you look at the ephemeral x in one This is always greater than epsilon for any j. We can do this. How do you prove it? Suppose not. Then you can essentially construct, oh, I should have mentioned, because it's important here, V is non-constant. Our analytic potential is non-constant. Should have mentioned that because. Constant. Should have mentioned that because if this doesn't hold, then V must be constant. And what does this tell us immediately? This tells us. Thank you. X plus I, Y, naught. So that on this horizontal strip, The potential is always at least epsilon away from these EJs. Okay. So, what can we do? How does this get us lower bounds? Well, let's fix some delta very small. Let's say it's smaller than row over, say, 1,000. We're not making any claims that this is optimal in any way, shape, or form. And let epsilon be let's fix. Let's fix some energy as well. Let's fix some delta smaller than rho over 1,000. And let epsilon be the epsilon that we get from this lemma applied with this delta. And the E's and the EJs are just given by this energy minus the Q different values of our background. All right. Then this tells us that v of x there exists some y naught, right? Minus e plus j. say lambda is bigger than epsilon. And here this lambda is taken larger than say lambda naught, which is say epsilon minus 10. Very, very large. Again, we're making no claim that these lambdas are optimal. We're just saying there is such a lambda for which we have this uniform. Lambda for which we have this new fun broad map. So let's just multiply everything by lambda. This, and this almost gives us the lower bound that we want. And this is where we really differ from the case where there's no background. Because if we look at our W, Because if we look at our w, x plus log ep, well, this is certainly going to be larger than log of lambda epsilon minus one. Why? Because the norm of this is essentially determined by the values of the first coordinate in our matrix, which is given by. Matrix, which is given by this. How many of them are there? There are n of them, but we're dividing by n, so this works out. And we get this. This is not good enough. Not good enough for us. We need to be much more careful in assigning a lower bound. So let's introduce some set Z, which is, let's say, the J between 0 and N, so the indices. So the indices, such that the following is true. Look at u of j minus r fifth energy e. Let's suppose this is less than or equal to the largest value, the supremum of v times lambda. And let's suppose that There are k. And what we can do is we can actually say this is going to be k over n plus 1 over n times the sum for those indices that are not in j, not in z, I should say, of the log of v of j x plus y naught plus j. S J mega S J minus E times one. And this is where we really differ from the previous case. Why is this important? Because this is actually, if we look at this set C, this is actually larger than lambda epsilon. So this is actually Than lambda epsilon. So this is actually a better bound than if we were to just use this lambda epsilon minus one bound. And we need this when we compare it to upper bounds that we're going to get in a moment after. Oh, move. Okay. Uh, so in quick time, what we can do is we can look at the harmonic measure associated to this point A plus Iy not in the strip. Say in the upper half plane strip between 0 and rho over 10. What do we know about this? A couple quick facts is this lives on the line imaginary part equals zero and imaginary part equals one over 10. On the boundary of the strip. And so if we look at the value on this strip where, so this line Iy equals rho, Iy over 10, this measure is certainly no more than Why not? Over ten, which is followed by delta row row and the measure associated to the line up here. Equals zero is no larger than one minus, say these are going to come in handy because w is a subharmonic function, this point is in the interior of our strip, by the definition of the harmonic measure. Of the harmonic measure, what we can do is we can say that u of, say, a plus i, y naught for any a. Doesn't matter what, as long as it's real, this is less than or equal to the integral of u, let's say, z d mu of z one. Which is equal to the integral over the real line of u by w of x with respect to this measure plus the integral of x plus y. All right, and this is if I sign that. And the definition of the harmonic measure means, on this strip, means that we can actually do a change of variables. Now we can turn this into Variables. Now we can turn this into a harmonic measure with respect to just pi y nine. And if we do that, this is just u w of x plus a y pi nine. All right, and what we And what we can do now throughout is take an average So let's actually combine what we have. We've got this lower bound on x plus y. On x plus y naught for any x. So we can replace x with a x here with a. And so this is smaller than this. And let's integrate throughout. Let's take an average in A, integrate from 0 to 1. And if we do that, then let's call this Then let's call this star. Star is less than or equal to what? If we integrate here in A, and we use the fact that the potential is periodic, this is essentially just going to give us the integral of w dx terms negative one terms the measure. Of second group line plus the integral over the real line of the integral from 0 to 1 u of x plus a plus 10. Just take an average, and here we use periodicity. How do we deal with this, though? To fix this, we this integral dA is we're going to take an object. We're going to take an upper bound of the OX plus A. What upper bound? So if we take an upper bound and simplify it, what we end up getting is that this whole thing is less than or equal to the integral from 0 to 1 dx dx. Real line. Plus, this whole thing can actually be turned into the measure of the line. Y1 equals 10 times what? We're going to actually use the exact same bounding procedure that we used over here. Except instead of using lambda epsilon minus one, we're going to use this. This is the upper bound we're going to get. Upper bound is going to get, and we're going to end up with k over n plus maybe you try to finish your argument now. Okay, okay. I'll write this and then I'll explain. Okay. And then we get a log of a sentence. Get a log of essentially this exact same thing, modulo sub constants. So now the idea proceeds is we move everything over to the right, and by our choice of upper bounds that we had here, our choice of rho, delta, lambda, everything on the left-hand side is actually going to end up being larger than at least half delta lambda. That is actually it. Um so are there any questions here for Matthew? I have one and yes can I go ahead I actually have a a suggestion. If I if I uh well your argument is uh I Your argument is, if I understood it correctly, is based upon Burgundy's proof of Soret Spencer's result. So my suggestion is we have a different group of Soret-Spencer dwight and my paper from 2014 where the starting using the harmonic measure is not needed. We use the highest. The Hardy's convexity theorem that says that, well, a subharmonic function, if you average it along horizontal lines, it's going to be convex in the imaginary direction. So this argument is much more direct, it's much, much simpler. And in fact, the advantage of it is that it also gives sharp lower bounds. So I think you've got something like one half or one. you would get log lambda minus big log one. So I expect that it would be unhappy combined in this situation. I don't see why. And it would be why not. And so yeah, I suggest to take a look at that. I'll take a look at that. Thank you very much. Yeah. And actually it's a more general setting than this. No, it's a more general setting in this respect. There is a version of the art. And I also have a question, so this was... So you also mentioned that you studied the question of how to make your results fromgoing for this operator. For this operator, yes. We don't have results yet. Can you please say what we got or? We don't have any results yet. Results yet. We are in the process of working through computations, but we don't have results yet, unfortunately. We expect there to be continuity, at least in this positivity regime, certainly, in what we're hoping jointly in frequency and in energy for. For irrational frequency, but unfortunately, we haven't worked everything out yet. So I'm going to hedge my bets and say we think that's true, but don't know for sure. Can I also ask a question? So this is for 1D tolerance. How about the higher dimensional torrents? That's also something that That's also something that we intend to work on. We have ideas on how to approach that problem, but we wanted to kind of solve, resolve everything in the one-dimensional case before we tackled the higher-dimensional problem. Relating to okay, so type with what are the one decades you have some uh weak type of uh uh LDG, right? So you LDG, right? So different or in a general case, whether we can ask if the if the concycle without the background if the unprovided concycle has a certain weak type of LTT, whether the one with the project value background still has the same type of LTT or not. Yeah, that's a very kind of reasonable thing to investigate, and it's certainly something to consider. And we will certainly. We're trying to go for the LDT at the moment. Promising but not. Exactly. That's that's been yeah, that's why there are issues. Yeah, also for this like the half-land if you want. I think forget the book he wrote of the he just gets a rock sorry to the original paper. I can already give the shot of the mouth as he's not like Certainly, yes. Yeah, half-log lab is far from optimal.
