scale analysis in momentum space for multi-dimensional quasi-periodic schooling operators so please julian start hello do you hear me yeah very well okay so this is my joint work with leonid parnowski and raman sterenberg and we consider an operator fines la plus n plus v in the dimension and plus v in the dimension greater or equal than two so what is known about this problem for the case when v is quasi periodic there is a long list of offers and i apologize if i forgot somebody and appreciate any remarks about this but the main problem which we will consider problem which were considered in these papers were density of states and in with respect to spectrum it was only it was mostly about localization so our question was what is the spectrum and eigenfunctions of such an operator in a high energy region so we already answered such questions with raman sterein Questions with Raman Sternberg for dimension equal to two. And now Leonjan joined us and we considered the case D greater or equal than two, which is essentially more complicated than D equal to two. Let us introduce. Let us introduce some basic notations. First, let us introduce basic frequencies. Basic frequencies, this is vectors in Rd, and there is a vector of basic frequencies, which is omega 1, omega L, and this vector of basic frequencies belongs to the dimension dl. Now we consider an operator H minus Laplacian plus V, where V is a finite combination of exponents multiplied by the Fourier coefficient. And here, let me say what is what annotations here. So n bold n, vector n, belong. n vector n belong to g L, where L is greater than G, because when L is equal to G, we will get just periodic case. So we introduce the norm of N in the following way. And E theta x, this is just a plane wave. So often we will take instead of theta. will take instead of theta we will take k or we will take k plus n omega so what is n omega this is n j omega j because every omega j is an in r d so n this sum is a vector in r d so we call n uh n vector omega the frequencies Omega the frequencies. So without the loss of generality, we can assume that each omega j is in the unit cube and of the dimension D and vector omega is in the unit cube of the dimension D A. So now let me so after I told you all the nature. I told you all the notation. Maybe we have to return to formula three. Now it's become clear what is potential V. So the exponent has the impulses n omega. So now first, before we go any further, I would like to stress one of our main results even it Main results, even it is not our strongest result, just to give you some flavor of what is going on. So, for any finite set of Fourier coefficients Vn, there exists a subset omega star of basic frequency. So this is a subspat space in the unit cube of the dimension. Unit cube of the dimension dl with Neuja 1 such that for every vector omega in omega star, the absolute continuous spectrum of operator H contains a semi-axis where lambda star to omega, where lambda star depend on omega and Fourier coefficient and sufficiently large. Sufficiently large. So, this is some kind of better Zimmerfeld conjecture, but also with stress in that the semi-axis is absolutely continuous spectrum. Now, I am going to talk about our results in more details. First, I want to say that we describe generalized eigenvalues. Generalized eigenfunction C infinity on interval lambda infinity. So there is a set of impulses G infinity in R D. Later I will say that this set is sufficient, say more about the structure of this set, such that the corresponding generalized eigenfunctions of our operator look Operator look like a plane wave Ekx multiplied by one plus u omega, where u omega is a small function. This means that C infinity is close to the plane wave. So, and u infinity is a quasi-periodic function. It is a pointwise convergent series of exponent E n omega. N omega. So, in principle, it has the same structure as a potential, but potential has only a finite number of terms, and u omega has infinitely many terms. So, then the corresponding eigenvalues to C infinity look also like an eigenvalue of the free operator plus something sufficiently small. Later, we will discuss. Later, we will discuss that this formula is differentiable, but for now, let us just discuss G infinity. G infinity is an intersection of sets Gn and each G n has the following structure. If you consider a finite part of G n, it has, first of all, G infinity is a subset of R G. Infinity is a subset of Rg of the space of impulses. If you consider Cn, each of them in every finite ball has only a finite number of holes. But when N goes to infinity, then the number of holes become bigger and bigger, but the holes themselves become smaller and smaller. So when you can see that. When you consider the intersection of this, you get the G-infinity has a counter-type structure, but nevertheless, it's important that it has asymptotically full measure. If you consider intersection of G-infinity with a big ball BR and send R to infinity, then the Lebesgue merge of this set will be Of this set will be asymptotically close to that of Br. So now let us discuss D infinity lambda, which is called is energetic surface. So this is the set of k in G infinity such that lambda infinity k is equal to some fixed lambda. Because we can prove differentiability in certain sense of lambda infinity. In certain sense of lambda infinity, because differentiability on the set of counter measure is clearly a very dangerous thing, but in a certain sense we can talk about this. We can obtain that lambda infinity of k equal to lambda is close to unperturbed surface. Unperturbed surface would be a square root of lambda, the wall of the radius square root. ball of the radius square root of lambda, but here we have a surface which is close to this ball but has infinitely many holes because g infinity has this countertype structure. Nevertheless, this surface exists for every lambda and namely this formula allows us to prove absolute continuity. Now, so Now, so d infinity can be described like k, and here we have so-called radius of this curved ball multiplied by nu, when new belong to a subset of the union ball. So, you may think that nu belong to the set of possible direction of propagation for Direction of propagation for plane waves, almost plane waves. And kappa nu is square root of lambda plus a small value. The measure of allowed direction of propagation is asymptotically the whole unit sphere. So now what is AC branch of the spectrum? A C branch of the spectrum, the branch of the spectrum corresponding to eigenfunction C infinity is absolutely continuous. So there is one more result which I want to mention, but I'm not going to speak about this today. We also prove ballistic transport, existence of ballistic transport for this apparatus. Now I try to out I try to outline the proof of these results. The proof of these results, we had to develop a method which we called multi-scale analysis in the space of Mamienta Ka. It is very technical method, so I apologize if I will have some difficulty explaining this using This using using Zoom. So first remember this picture. You know, when you cannot explain something, it's good to give a picture. So what does this picture represent? So this picture represents some kind of inductive procedure. I will explain later the meaning of this. Explain later the meaning of this for our problem. So you have the red square, which we call Kn. This means this is in fact all in dimension L. So and this cube, it's more appropriate to say cube, it corresponds to induction step number n and the blue. And the blue square corresponds to the induction step on n plus 1. And before going from n to n plus 1, we populate this. N plus 1 is much bigger than n. And we populate n plus 1 with steps from different previous with cubes from different From different previous induction steps. So these bigger black cubes are approximately of the size of the red one. These smaller black cubes are approximately of the size of the green one. The green one corresponds to the step n minus one. I will return to this picture just now can say that by this induction procedure you can you You can imagine that the red cube is populated by a family of smaller cubes, and each smaller cubes is populated by the family of even smaller cubes. So, and each black cube also populated by smaller cubes. So, but induction procedure goes. Induction procedure goes in the direction of expanding, of making the blue cube bigger and bigger. So, blue cube will play the role of the red cube for some next cube and so on. Let me try to explain how it is all related to our problem. So we So we and I forgot to say that all these cubes are in the in the space Z L, dimension L. So let us introduce first a range of scales because this is multi-scale procedure, so we need some scales. So the scales are n. Scales Rn starting from zero to one defined like Rn plus one is a rho in power Rn where rho is fixed parameter which is of order of the length of k. Rho zero is just some fixed number sufficiently large dependent on the potential and frequency. So you see that the scale of That the scale of cubes grows exponentially very fast. So then we consider a collection of what we call central cubes or boxes, Kn. Don't pay attention on this hat. This is just coming from our paper. And each central cube is a ball of radius rho in power rn in the in. n in the in L infinity metric of Z L centered at the origin. Now we also consider so-called siblings of Kn. It is slightly, for technical reason, they have to be slightly smaller cubes centered at the points different from the origin. Now if we return to our picture To our picture, so we can see that these black big pubes are siblings of the red one and these black small pubes are siblings of the green one. And so, if we consider that the smallest cube and Smallest cube. And you see that there is also a black, very small black cube, which is even smaller, much smaller than the green one. So there is a central cube corresponding to it too. So by this, we can consider if the smallest one corresponds to the first step, then the green one corresponds to the second step, then the red one corresponds to the third step, and the picture with the blue. And the picture with the blue one corresponds to the fourth step. And each of these siblings of black cubes and also red and green, they have structures inside them. So now, when we constructed this, we will consider the projections Pn in L2ZL and each projection. Z L and each projection is more or less characteristic function of the cube Kn. So Pn is a finite dimensional projection with the dimension of the size of the volume of Kn. So we will consider similar projection for siblings 2. So then we consider the sequence of operator Hn. Of operator H N, P N H P N. Here I have some abuse of notation because H here is not an operator which is acting in L2R3. H here is something some. Here is something is an action of the operator on a linear set of the exponent. So now I think it was described in one of the previous said that HN acts on the subspace of Bisipovich. Subspace of Vysikovich space. So each HN has, so what is our goal? Our goal to make that each HN has one simple eigenvalue located sufficiently far, at least rho minus R away from the rest of the spectrum of Hn. Let us Let us think about Hn. Let us return to our picture. So think about Hn as the operator H reduced to the union of all these smaller squares, not to blue, not to the blue square, but to the union of black squares, red square, and Square and outside of this squares it is diagonal. So Hn has a block structure. So our purpose is to consider the eigenvalue of the apparatus restricted to the red square and compare it with eigenvalues of the apparatus restricted to the black squares and to make sure that. And to make sure that the eigenvalue, let us call it red eigenvalue, is sufficiently far from black eigenvalues. But sufficiently far means, in our case, some very little thing. This means that we just want to be them raw in power. Raw in power are in a way. So to make this happen, sure, we cannot do this for all K. We have to delete some K at every step, some so-called resonance K. This say that. We say that the eigenvalue is not resonant if this condition that it is sufficiently far away from the rest of the spectrum of Hn is satisfied. So in sense, you can say the eigenvalue in the red square is sufficiently far away from eigenvalues in the black squares. And this row minus. And this rho minus Rn, which is a very tiny value, is a good estimate for the estimate for the distance which is good enough. Sure, this means that we will have to throw away by some technical gymnastic some sufficiently small set of initial k. If we can provide this, then we will consider that the eigenvalue so sorry let me return again so then let me return. Then let me return to this picture again. So, if eigenvalues of a red operator is sufficiently far away from eigenvalues of black operators, then, and we also have a diagonal here, which is completely harmless after we make these cubes. So, then we can construct perturbation C. Construct perturbation theory for the blue operator in the blue box with respect to this block type operator, which is described by red and black boxes. So in order to make this perturbation theory possible, we have to construct here the whole family of blocks. Family of blocks. The main technical problem here, how we construct these blocks. And one of the most important things, we have to control the size of these blocks. And it is difficult in the sense that there is a danger that they can form some kind of clusters. Form some kind of clusters that they can overlap. And then we have, if they overlap and form some kind of chain, we are losing control over the size of this additional black squares, which become not squares, but some kind of change. So to overcome this problem, I will tell about this later, we will need to exclude certain frequencies. Include certain frequencies. So let us return. So this is our goal. And after we throw away certain K and certain frequencies, we will obtain that each operator Hm has an eigenvalue denote that lambda. then value denote that lambda n of k which behaves like k squared plus smaller terms that are controlled together with their derivatives via perturbation theory as a result lambda n is a continuous increase function of k and so this lambda n of k take values rho squared for a large collection of k so we can set we can Set we can call the set of K with this property the isoenergetic surface of Hn. What we want to say is that basically we prove for each Hn the results which are similar to those which I described first of all for our final operator, that each HN has eigenfunctions close to anti-toped eigenfunctions and it has eigenvalues And it has eigenvalues close to ampertoped eigenvalues on a certain set Gm. Let me return back to show you. So if you look at the result, you see here G infinity is the intersection of G n. G n is a good set of k on every step of On every step of the induction procedure. And on every step of the induction procedure, we have this. And for every step of the induction procedure, we have iso-energetic surface, which is close to unperturbed sphere. But on every step of the induction procedure, it has only finite number of holes, and it has more and more holes when n goes to infinity. When n goes to infinity. So now, and at every step on Gn, we have Cn, which is close to the plane wave, and we have lambda n, which is close to k squared. So eventually, when we consider the intersection of all good sets. All good sets on all steps of the induction procedure, we get a countertype set G infinity, and we can prove that lambda n and pn converge to some limit. And so by this, by this, we will prove the result for quasi-periodic operator. Operator. So this means that we start with taking finite size boxes, not in the space of space variable X, as it is usually done in multiscale analysis, but in the space of momenta K plus N. K plus n omega. So, of course, we cannot construct asymptotic formula for all k. Let us start with the step one. On the step one, we have relatively small cube around the origin, and we see that And we see that the perturbation series do not converge already in the simplest condition when k, the length of k is equal to k plus, say, omega 1 or some other n omega. This is a famous Laura diffraction condition in physics, and it means that the series divides The series diverge already on the first step if this condition is satisfied. But by deleting a small neighborhood of this plane, this is a plane or a hyperplane, we can say that on the first step, the perturbation series for the resolvent converge when we throw away k close to this hyperplane. Then, Plane. Then, in such cases, when we have such kind of condition, we say k and k plus omega 1 are in resulting. On each further step of the procedure, the definition of what the expression in resonance means exactly will change. So, in the on the first. So, on the first step, it is very simple, but when we move further and further, then this expression and result will include the spectrum of the restriction of H to the bigger cubes. In fact, I already, simply speaking, being in resonance means that means that the central the central cube eigenvalue is in some sense close to the eigenvalue of some non-central cube however our goal to construct perturbation series on every step is still achievable Is still achievable if we throw away some collection of bad initial points K. So these bad points will take away only small proportion of every isenergetic surface on every step n, which lacks enough energy. And this proportion will decay exponentially in n. However, if you can imagine that Imagine that if we want to transform the requirement that eigenvalues have to be sufficiently far from each other into requirements on k, it requires quite a lot of technical drop. First of all, for the reason that these eigenvalues are not necessary monotonic eigenvalues of this Eigenvalues of these black cubes. When we did with Roman dimension d equal to 2, then we used Cache, then we used Ruchet theorem. But here we have multi-dimensional case and everything is more complicated. So, on the way of proving this result, we have task one. Task one proved that for more Just one proof that for most K, Hn is not in resonance with restriction of H on all such cubes K Mn. That is, the spectra of restriction of H on the Kmn lies sufficiently far away. Sorry, the spectral restriction of H onto Kmn lies sufficiently far away. Kmn lies sufficiently far away from the eigenvalue of Hn we are interested in. This means what I already told to you. We take eigenvalues of the red square and we compare it with eigenvalues of the black squares. So sure, the natural question is how this black squares How these black squares are constructed. They are constructed the following way. Suppose you have an eigenvalue of the red square. Then you just look at all diagonal terms of the matrix. If they are all sufficiently far from your eigenvalue, you do nothing. If one of them is satisfied on law of diffraction conditions, One law of diffraction condition, you build around this a small block. So if even after this, the eigenvalue of a small block is close to the eigenvalue of the red box, you build somewhat bigger box around small black box. So every step when you So every step, when you make bigger and bigger block, your approximation of the corresponding eigenvalue become more and more precise. Task to prove that Hn plus one can be treated as a perturbation of the direct sum of restriction of H on these black boxes. You see, once you made the correct and Once you made the correct construction, it is already a technical thing to prove the convergence of perturbation series. But the next problem is much more complicated. Make sure that the sizes of KMN are not too large. And moreover, they are located sufficiently far away from each other. Away from each other in the letter Z8. So make sure that they do not intersect. The tool to achieve this is a version of Bourdain Lemma modified for our situation. By Bourdain Lemma, I mean dilemma from 2007, which was in his paper, Anderson Localization for Quasi-Periodic Lattices. For quasi-periodic lattice Schrodinger operator in Zd. So it tells us this lemma that we can achieve that black squares are well separated by throwing away a small proportion of bad frequency vectors vector omega. This lemma leads to the construction of a structure Of a structure that we called a multi-scale structure. Roughly speaking, the picture which I showed to you. So it turns out that we cannot solve this problem without deleting some set of omegas of measure zero. And we have to use Borguen lemma, which deals with semi-algebraic sets to Set to describe this set of omega which we delete. By the way, I forgot to say you that from the very beginning, we delete some set of omega which satisfy the so-called strong Diophantine condition. Content condition. There is, you see, I did not write it because they still give us this, we still have to throw away only Wimja Fanta condition. This means that if you take linear combination of omega j with integer n j. Are you writing something because I don't see? No, no, I'm not. I'm not writing. I cannot write. I cannot write. So there is a standard Definite condition, and we use somewhat stronger version of them. But maybe concrete formula is not so important because the main result that this Diefenteen condition by imposing this Diefentein condition, you You throw away only the set of frequencies of measure zero. Okay, so you impose the Delphentine condition. You don't have to impose them. Okay, okay. And so first we impose them for some technical reason, but then and then late already. Late already in constructing this multi-scale structure from Brugen Limmer, we got more conditions on omega, but they also give us the set of full measures. So we have to throw away only the set of measures zero. Okay, so at the end, your condition is not really arithmetic because. Is not really arithmetic because of Borgen's lemma, right? Not only arithmetic, no. Not just dear Fantine, it's more than that. Is it what you're asking? Yes, it is. Although, actually, for absolutely continuous spectrum, you kind of expect the result at the end without. Result without at the end without any different condition, but you're right, not the localization in the momentum space. So for the others, it's probably more some. You see, at least we cannot do this. You know, maybe it's still true, but we cannot do this. And moreover, it is all not uniform in omega, if you can guess. So, this semi-axis, the lower bound of a semi-axis, The lower bound of a semi-axis of absolutely continuous spectrum depends on omega? Okay, yeah, I see. I see. It depends on omega entirely or on the Diophantine condition? The law? I think it depends entirely because we have this also Brutain condition and they're much more implicit than the Fantain condition. Than Diophantine condition. You see, they are not so beautiful like Diophantine condition, yes. So it just there is just a statement that there is such a set of full motion, then this and this is true. So we don't really know how it looks like. I see. So it's what we call a perturbative result. In fact, the whole thing is perturbative. Yeah. So, did I answer your question to some extent? Hello, you did. Okay. So we made that this multiscale structure, you know, it has a good shape that all these black cubes are separated from each other by throwing away some omegas. This structure tells us that for each cube KJ at any level J less than m, there are J less than m. There are two possibilities. Either this cube is good, this means, or non-resonance, this means that the norm of the resolvent of this restriction of H to this cube is not too large, or roughly speaking, its eigenvalues are sufficiently far from eigenvalues of the central cube. Or if it is bad resonance, then we have to cover it by a bigger cube at the next level. In the next level, this is like you put a plaster, yes, and if this plaster is small for your wound, then you put a bigger plaster. And then if a bigger plaster is still too small for your wound, you put even bigger plaster. So the result is that eventually you will find a plaster which is big enough to treat the problem. We also know that all cubes, KJ, of all levels, are located far away from each other. Or if they are not located far away, they can kind of eat each other. The bigger one can eat smaller ones. And by this, survive only the bigger ones. A serious problem with applying our approach. Problem with a plan approach is that both so we I'm sorry, just what it is. We also, to estimate the norm of each block, we use so-called Cartan's Liemma, which I don't cite here. A serious problem with applying our approach is that both Bourdain's Liemma and Cartan's Liemma give us good enough estimates to be used in the induction procedure only once we have moved sufficiently far in the scale. Sufficiently far in the scale of approximation, namely when the power of raw is much larger than one. You see, I think this is a problem which happened quite often in induction procedures, that you can prove the induction step for n sufficiently large, but it is difficult sometimes to start the induction procedure. So, and in our case, the first two steps were, the first, very first step, which we called step zero, is very simple. It concerns only with one lower diffraction condition. But in the dimension two, the second step was already much easier. But in the dimension greater than two, the second step is really difficult. Step is really difficult, and here we needed some technique which were developed in the papers of Parnovsky Sternberg and Parnovsky Sobolev, which help us, sorry, which help us to make these two steps. Steps somehow and to make these two steps, we need not just standard DEFAN condition, but we need a strong DEFAN condition, what we call strong DEF fund condition. This is not a common name, it is something written in a matrix form with integers. form with integer coefficients and it estimate it's estimate the angle between frequencies too okay i think i have finished my talk um i'm sorry it's difficult to explain things Explain things without whiteboard, so but I try my best. Are there questions? So, this strong Diephantine conditions estimating the angles also is it kind of similar to the Diophantine condition, arithmetic. Diophantine condition arithmetic condition that Burgen Golstein Schlag is imposing the two-dimensional paper and also in size. The recent paper has that. I have to look at this. Somehow, maybe Leonia will say something about this. I'm not sure. I have to look at this. Okay. So the strong dioffending condition to does it seem like it's a technical obstruction to what you're doing or an actual obstruction to getting asymptotics the strong diagnosing condition that you need to impose, is it something that's due to the method? Think that's uh due to the methods that you're using, or it's uh this is not happening at all. This is necessary. I think this is due to the method. It is necessary on the second step. That as I told you before, the beginning, you see, proving, say, better than Merfeld conjecture for periodic potential in multi-dimensional case, it's very difficult. It's very difficult, mostly because of the first steps of the procedure. And here we use similar method, but for quasi-periodic case. And because the methods are similar, we needed to impose some conditions on omega. Roughly speaking, this is Roughly speaking, this is, you know, if you don't impose these conditions, you get quasi-periodic lattices which are getting too close to, how to say, quasi-periodic lattices such that the angle between vectors in these lattices cannot be controlled and from below. And then this is very bad. You see, when you have a lettuce, you want to control the distance between distances between points. But it turns out you also want to control the angles between different vectors which are ended at this point. You see, the points can be far away, but if the angle between corresponding vector is small, this is also bad. Also, but may I ask a question, Julia? Yeah, sure. So, what do you think? What the additional steps, ingredients one might need to prove, let's say, the spectrum, the higher parts is purely absolutely continuous. Well, this is very difficult because you know, I told you that we have a countertype set. Types set for k and for k in this counter type set we know everything. But to investigate the whole spectrum, we have to know what happens with eigenfunctions and eigenvectors in the holes of this countertype set. And there, this is a pen of worms. I don't know what is happening. I don't know what is happening there. And if you work with the discrete Schrodinger, you work on the lattice, I guess as a corollary of Bogan's results, you point spectrum is excluded. Yeah, you see, I didn't do this, I'm not close to this, because the operator is bounded for a discrete case. Discrete case. This means that instead of bounded, instead of high energy, you have to consider small potential. But this is not the same problems. They're not easily transformed to each other. But then probably the analogy would be that the spectrum contain an interval, maybe something like that. The spectrum is just an interval. But I am really not. I am really not very familiar with discrete case. It's surprising that this Bourdain paper where we took his lemma is for discrete case and for proving of localization. Yes, so you may think it's completely different method, but this limb is so powerful. It is just It is just devoted, it is just a geometrical lemma devoted to semi-algebraic sets that we were able to adjust it to our needs. Right, it's becoming it's a priori, it's tailored for the bounded operator. So, for your first step, zero step, and first step, you have nothing. No, no, Bourdain Lemma, if you take just, you don't have to write to read the whole paper to understand this lemma. It is Understand this lemma. It is completely geometric lemma. You just have some semi-algebraic sets and you consider cross-section of the semi-algebraic sets and then you get some estimates which you need. So it's just such a nice geometric lemma that it's helpful for more than one situation. Yeah, I want to make a couple of comments. So first of all, this whole situation is kind of reminiscent of situation with one dimensional with AC spectrum for one dimensional operators with analytic potential in the regime of In the subcritical regime, because there, when you have dual localization, you kind of obtain absolutely continuous spectrum. And you do need Diophantine conditions for that, obviously. But of course, there are all those energies and frequencies. And frequencies where you do not have dual localization, and you still have absolutely continuous spectrum, but it's more difficult to establish. So, here it's probably similar. So, what basically is established, so there are two big statements: one absolutely continuous spectrum, and another is Best Zommerfeld. So, as far as just absolutely continuous is concerned, basically, you establish it by dual localism. You establish it by dual localization. And for this regime of dual localization, clearly, at least die of time conditions, and probably some other throwing away some other stats of measure zero is necessary. But it doesn't mean it is necessary for the end statement. And there you may have some, you may have, and if analogy holds, you probably do have the purely absolutely continuous spectrum. Continuous spectrum, but by some other considerations, and the same is true, probably for the complement of this Cantor set that you construct, because there you do not have a nice localization in the dual space, but you probably still have something. But it's a lot more difficult problem. And the second way, what was mentioned, is regarding Benzesomer Feld and did the discrete analog. The discrete analog is localization for high cup for large not localization but interval in the spectrum for large couplings so because the analog of that is well Um, well, actually, in fact, not quite so I'm taking it sort of back, so or I need to include one more steps. So, it is the full analog is actually interval in the spectrum for small couplings for the multi-dimensional problem because high energies correspond to small couplings. But when you go to the dual problem, it becomes a high coupling problem for multi-frequency potentials. So there was a recent paper by Golstein, Schlag, and Wada establishing just that. And it is the same type of result as Bessie Zommerfeld. So and it's actually well, what I want to say is that the strongest result is Say that the strongest result is, in fact, about eigenfunctions. Because when we obtain this for eigenfunctions, we can obtain absolute continuity, but also we can prove ballistic transport, which I even did not touch here. So to obtain all of this, you have to go all the way down to eigenfunctions in our case. Yes, so definitely, you see, when you have these dual eigenfunctions, Have these dual eigenfunctions, it's probably again. If this one-dimensional analogy holds, it's a nice absolutely continuous spectrum with ballistic transport and all that, because for this other absolutely continuous spectrum that you obtain in one-dimensional case without dual eigenfunctions, you don't have all these nice features. There probably are, one can probably kind of define this nice absolutely. Define this nice absolutely continuous spectrum which corresponds to dual localization. But there is probably again if the analogy holds some other absolutely continuous spectrum which is less nice and where you don't have dual localization. But this is kind of very difficult to see how one can even approach. And my final comment is that so literature-wise, so also So also this Burgundian lemma was used in some other recent localization, discrete localization results. There was this paper by Ven Sai Yunfeng Shui and myself and also the paper. This is all discrete setting and localization, but again, there are some similar considerations and in particular so you are also a friend. So, you are also a fan of this limit. Once I understood this, I became a big fan of this. It is, it is huge, yeah. So, now my question is, on the lattice C D for small potential, do you expect purely absolutely continuous spectrum, or do you know a way of getting no, because you know, this is even if potential small. Even if potential is small, it is on infinite set. It is a perturbation of H0 on infinite set. So, smallness of the potential, in my opinion, does not help to anything because you multiply small value by infinity, which is the support of this potential. And then it does not help that it is small. Well, so again, there is. Well, so again, there is a preprint that we've been writing with Lonja, Parnovsky and Bourgen, where we establish existence of absolutely continuous spectrum for small discrete potential, also by duality. So again, the key result is actually this, in some sense, this. In some sense, this discrete paper that I mentioned that was the key recent input with Ven Tsai and Yun Feng. And then one also need to kind of upgrade it to existence of absolutely continuous component. So this is done, but this is kind of a paper that we've been writing forever. Forever. Okay, LCD, you can prove the existence of absolutely continuous spectral processes. Yes, existence, but not purity. So it's the same. Okay, okay. Well, thank you, Lana. I want to say hello.
