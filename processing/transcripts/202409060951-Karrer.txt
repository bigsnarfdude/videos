And it kind of measures how hyperbolic like your group behaves. So now when one has this topological space, it often happens that the space is not connected. And if it is not connected, there are called connected components. And one can ask the question if non-singleton connected. If non-singleton connected components arise from, like are related to subgroups. And non-singleton components, I just mean connected components which contain at least two points. So one can ask the question, are there subgroups arising from non-silicon? Components in the Morse boundary. So another way of saying this is to say if we have a non-singular connected component with the Morse boundary, is the reason for that subgroup? And the subgroup will then have some, be hyperbolic-like in the sense that the reason is some connected components of the Morse bar. Connected components of Morse boundary, which measures in some way hyperbolicity, roughly speaking. So now in this project, we gave a criterion for when this is the case, which is preserved under quasi-isometry quasi-isometries. And now under And now in the version progress, he answered this with yes for right angry coxademoups. And there the situation is as nice as it could be. So if we have a white angle coxidal group with the fine graph delta, then these groups are conjugate through special subgroups. So, subgroups which are generated by a subset of the generate like of the vertex set by a sub and they arise from a nice splitting process. It can be better of the defining graph. And now, if one combines these things, so I wanted to put this on my blackboard, but this does not fit, then one gets a s gamma square. Gamma is quite neutral to a right-handed oxidom because this thing here also implies that this Ethereum is satisfied and then we have that lithium group which is quite isometric fluoride in the Coxider group. Then non-symmetric connected components arise from subgroups. So now, after I said this, I have to make all this more precise. So I have to explain what the Morse boundary is and what I'm Voice boundary is, and what I mean is arising from connected components. I guess I will do this up. Alright. Okay, so what is the Morse boundary? It was introduced by Charny and Zotero for Katzero groups and then generalized by Cordes for finally generated groups. And so if we have gamma finite degenerated group, then we can define the Morse boundary. We can take as the Morse boundary The Moist boundary of an associated kd graph. And what is this? This is the set of geodesic rays in the kinetic graph. We could start with the identity. The identity, which are Moore's, up to the exploitance relation that we want to consider two-tier diseques equivalent if they stay close. So if there exists a C such that the distance of gamma one of T and gamma two of T is bounded by C for all T. So, what is happening here? And then one equips this with a nice topology. So, what is happening here? We look here at all equivalent classes of geodesic rays, which are Morse. So, Morse, roughly speaking, means that if one has a geodesic ray, then One has a geodesic ray, then a quasi-geodesic with endpoints on this geodesic stays close. And one can just think of it as geodesic rays that behave like geodesic rays in hyperbolic spaces. So the idea of the Morse boundary is to just restrict to those geodesic races and to equip it with some nice topology, which makes it happen that it generalizes the Gromov file. Happen that it generalizes the Grammar boundary. So we have that if gamma is hyperbolic, then the Norse boundary equals the Gomov boundary. And also it's a quasi-isotory environment. So one can define the Morse boundary for arbitrary proper geodesic mitten spaces and then two quasi-isometric coins have the same Morse boundary. Okay, so now we want to understand Morse boundaries of right in the concert group. So Let's look at some examples. So, first you can look at the example. So, first, what is it? White and Coxider group. If you have a graph and stuff, and often, a simpler graph, we look at the corresponding white linear coxider group. And this is generated by the vertex set. By the vertex set, and we have that every generator is an evolution, and we have that two elements commute if and only if they are connected by an edge in our defining graph. So now, if we for instance look at Look at the force cycle, then the corresponding side in the coxalogue is P infinity cos T infinity and the KD graph is an integer grid and here note you'd have to And here, node here is equation more, here is empty. So, second example is type cycle. Now here if we look at the corresponding KD graph, what happens is that we have along each of the vertices five squares instead of four as it was here. And it is continuous this way. So this is partly isolated through the height. Hardly isolated through the hypervolted plane, and there the Morse is a circle. So the next example is the one skeleton of the three cube. Here, this is vertically. Virtually the fundamental group of a finite volume three microwolds, like hyperbolic cusps. We have to get just picture that this is a torus boundary, or we can also have more of them. Boundary, or we can also have more of them. And here, China Code's system showed that the worst boundary is an omega. It's an omega-Yufinski curve. And this is a non-compact connected space. So far, we just saw three examples, and what these three examples will motivate is that right in the cocksote groups, there are lots of interesting Are lots of interesting examples of groups like this interesting Morse boundaries? And we can also now see what I maybe a little bit get an intuition what I meant that the Morse boundary measures hyperbolicity. The Morse boundary of the flesh here is empty, where the Morse boundary here formed this hyperbolic manifold and here from the hyperbolic plane is connected, showing that these groups are hyperbolic-like. Are hyperbolic-like. Now towards left with it is the result of four of us. Can you say this again? The last example around threes. Oh, yeah, this was because I removed one example. Because I removed one example, and in my thing, it's like two, three, five. I forgot the four. Thank you. Okay, so my fountain is technical. Okay, so now for this left of it, characterize when the Morse boundary of the right in the Pexeto group is locally connected, and it turns out. And it turns out that you have always both, like you have that if it is connected, it's also locally connected, and they can read it off the defining graph. This paper is not published yet, but it exists. So it's okay. And so this is nice. So, this is nice, so we know things. Now, we wanted to understand connected components. So, let's look at an example if we have connected components alright. So, we look at two cubes which we glue together along the face. So So I call the left cube delta 1 and the right delta 2. Now the left and the right are nice and diffused subgraphs. So if you write this, the right angled concept is an amalgamated product of that of the two r right angled cocksotopes corresponding to the cubes. Coxotevs corresponding to the cubes along this square in the middle. And we saw already that these here are virtually three mindfulness cusps. So what one can think of is that one has probably actually write more cusps. Like more cusps. Um one can think of two remarkable discussed. Have here some process drawing is that now we glue here these two right together. So here we see a flat along which we glue. This was We glue. This was this here. And here we glue along a 2Y. So you can concentrate on the picture if you like more, depending on if you like writing the coxider groups for three manifolds more. Alright, so now if we look at this picture, we want to understand what happens with the Morse boundary. So we know already the Morse boundary of this thing is an Omega-Slavinsky curve, and of this thing is an Omega-Zlobinsky curve. Now we glue it along something that does not have, like, which has. What does not have like which has empty Morse boundary? So one wants to now this rises the question: if you do that, like it splits your you have something which splits your group apart, which has an anti-mouse boundary. Does this also split your mouse boundary apart? And yes, this is the case. So So this was a study by Piora Anti and B. So that one says, yes, if you have such a splitting, then you have that the Morse boundary splits. And what happens here is that the Morse bound consists of singletons. So you have a bunch of points. Bunch of points and connected components which are homeomorphic to omega-deterministic colors. So now in the picture, intuitively we see that these connected components relate to these groups. So here These connected components correspond to the conjugate of W delta 1 and W delta 2. But now in this sense, and there is a way to describe this without using that we already know that we have this nice splitting here. Namely, we have that if H denotes the stabilizer, so we have our, let's call it just one of these connected components C. So if we look at the stabilizer of the connected component C, in the action of the right-handed potential on the Morse bar ring, which is given by sending an equivalence class to the image of the equivalent. To the image of the variance class, then we have that this is conjugate to one of the right-angle proximal groups, W delta 1 or W delta 2. Now, okay, so now we have found subgroups which correspond to our connected components. Correspond to our connected components, but it could happen theoretically that this does not fit together nicely. So, what we want is that the connected components really arise from these subgroups. And so, what we want is that if we look at the set of equivalence classes, Of our right-hand compositor group that stays close to our standardizer, also connected component. So, we want that this subspace coincides with the connected component C. So, whenever we are in a connected component, So whenever we are in a connected component C, we want to find a representative of a Morse ray which lives close to our stabilizer. And on the other hand, if we have a ray in our stabilizer, we want that it isn't disconnected component. Okay, so now in this example here, this works out. Now one can ask why does this happen? This happened, and in this example, it is because this group splits nicely. So, what do we have here? We have this group spit something that has empty Morse boundary, and we end up with two things which have connected rather than boundary. Connected relative Morse boundary. So this thing here, which I forgot to write, so this set here is called relative most commonly of H in gamma here for us in our right-hand Fox stream and denoted by This. So, what we just should think of is these are all the points at the moist boundary which come from our subgroup. So, in our situation, these two subgroups have connected relative Morse boundary. So, everything, and they like, if you think of these, all the Morse relative. These, all the Morse rays which come from these groups, they correspond to the connected components in the Morse boundary, which are these omega-Zapinski curves. Okay, so now this motivated Bobi-Stefani and me to say, okay, let's give such Let's give such fittings a name and say that Gamma is more accessible if a nice process along groups with empty This empty additive more spaciously terminates after finitely many steps with groups that have Connected relative Morse boundary. So here connected relative Morse boundary, there are two cases. So if you think of the empty set, the empty set is connected. So this is something what is allowed. Or we have it that is not connected, not the empty set. If it is not the empty set, then these groups we will end up in such a situation will correspond to. In such a situation, they correspond to connected components in the Morse part. Yes? So, but nice process, like a hierarchy or something? Yeah. Okay. So, different, like, yeah. So, what is the idea here? Yeah. So what the idea here is, is to say if one thinks of accessibility, there one has splitting or like accessibility of hyperbolic groups. There one has. Of hyperbolic groups. There one has a graph of groups with one-ended vertex groups or finite vertex groups. Now, the idea is to, they are in this situation to exchange finite with empty MOS boundary, because if you are finite, your MOS boundary is automatically empty. But now you allow also empty MOS boundary with some groups which may are not only finite. They can also be one-ended. Can also be one-ended. And for this to make sense of it, you have to exchange the graph of coop with a higher key. So that's the idea. Okay, so now, as I said before. As I said before, Stephanie, Bobby, and I found a criterion saying when non-synchronic connected components relate to subgroups, which is preserved under quasi-isometry, so more successful groups satisfy this criterion. So one special case of what we did is saying that if gamma is finitely generated, is finitely generated and quasi-isometric to a more accessible group. Then we have that for each one singleton component C and the y boundary that the connected That the connective component C is the relative Morse boundary of its stabilizer on the ambient group. But this is everything we know. So we don't know, we don't have any control about these stabilizers. So we don't even know if they are finally degenerated. But we know that they arise from homemade components. Okay, so now we want to know which groups are most accessible and so first of all we have hyperbolic books. First of all, we have hyperbolic MOOCs. Again, we have luckily seen in the last talk that in this situation, hyperbolic groups have a fit as graph of groups with one-ended vertex groups and or finite vertex groups over finite edge groups. And the vertex groups And the vertex groups are hyperbolic. Because of this, we can calculate their Morse boundary. So, like, the Morse boundary is just in this case the boundary of these hyperbolic groups, which are connected. So, this is why things work out here. And the next example are three manifold groups. So, here this can be seen of different sprints. Of transmitted impence paper about three manifolds. So here I should say hypermodic, closed hypermodic. Sorry. So she calculated their MOS boundaries and there the point is that they split along tori and tori give you something empty but it should morse boundary and now luckily those end like the if you have this Like the, if you have the splitting positive, they end in something which has connected relative more sparsely. And now. I don't mean you want hyperbolic about hyper60. You're splitting your three manifolds a lot. Can you say this again? You said you were splitting your three manifolds a lot on Tori, right? So probably they're not hyperbolic three manifolds. Looks like you're even closed hyperbolic three manifolds, which is just like a Yeah, I want to split around to uh cycle bottles to the right. Probably irreducible, but that probably matters. Yeah, it should be fine. You can fix it later. Thank you. Okay, I'm confused now. But yeah, okay, let's fix this later. Okay, so what is a work in progress? So this is a work in progress. So this is a working progress with the fades in the game. So wide angled oxider groups are most accessible. And one can find this splitting procedure or this hierarchy just via splitting the graph in a very nice way. And because of this, And because of this, one gets in particular that the stabilizers of non-singleton components in the Moore's boundary of the right-hand constant are conjugate. I conjugate two special subgroups of our right-hand Coxor group whose final graph graphs can be found by means of means means of an algorithm on the defining one on delta so I will just show this to you by an example but first I want to say consequences out of this so first First, so we get from this, because of the work of Jephani, Bob and E, that if gamma is a finite component, plus the isometric to a right in the oxidable, then every non-singleton non-singleton component C of the borst boundary arises from the like satisfied that the relative Morse boundary of the stabilizer equals the connective component. And what would be beautiful would be if this is maybe Would be if this is maybe the case because this group is quasi-isometric to the original group, which we don't know, but this would be nice and would be kind of a step towards maybe hoping that most accessibility is preserved under quasi-asymmetry in certain cases. As it is for like accessibility is a quasi-asymmetry in variant. And here I want to make sure And here they want I want to make a new head. Alright. And another consequence, and this makes me very happy because it competes by PhD seizes. A right-ended hoxygree has totally disconnected Morse boundary. If and only if every terminal graph is a click. So, what is this terminal graph? These are the graphs of this algorithm I mentioned graph. I mentioned it off. My PhD thesis, I studied this direction, this was my PhD thesis, and now I'm very happy that the other direction is true and that most bodies of right-angle toxins just behave unbelievably nice. So now let me explain this just with an example of a graph. Of the graph. Let's look at this graph. So, what do we first? We first look at the set of all Of all subgraphs of delta which are reduced, and the Morse boundary is empty. These are just all those where the defining graph is either a click or a non-trivial join. So in this example, these are the vertices and the edges. The edges and use this four cycle. Not a good color, but yeah, I should take better colors. Can you see yellow? So, this here it's called C4. Okay, so now what we do is that we check can we write our graph as a union of two graphs so that the intersection graph is contained in one of these guys here. Now, if I have this graph. I can discover that I can this fit along here and I get this on the one hand side, this part on the other side. So why are we allowed to split this way? Allowed to split this way because this intersection graph is an induced subgraph, and it lives in one of those graphs. So it lives here. So if you think of this, this is an amigara, like this here corresponds to an splitting along this dihedral group, which lives in a flat. So it's a splitting along something like it has empty relative cross boundary. Now we can continue here. How can we continue? How can we continue here? Again, we are allowed to split along this thing here. We get this on this side. And on this side, we have this thing here. Now, this here is also contained in the set. This is just one plate, like this is just a vertex. So here I've got a split and you. It and you get this picture. Now we have only this graph. Now, again, these two vertices here are contained in a graph intercept here. So here we are allowed to split along here. So after two steps, like in the first step, we get This one and just an edge here. And here we get then this one and an edge here. So what do we see in this example? So now if you try to split further here, we cannot split further, because no matter which intuitive graph we check, it does not decompose our graph and simultaneously lies in one of the graphs here. Of the graphs here. And now, what does this mean? It means now that this here, this thing corresponds to a connected component in the Moore's boundary. So, again, what happened here, we started with our graph, and now we decompose our graph, and in each step. And in each step, what we do is we do a splitting along a graph which lives in a graph which has empty Morse boundary. Because of this, we do in each step a splitting along something with an empty relative Morse boundary. And if we continue the splitting as long as we can, we will always either in this situation end up with a click or with something which is uh corresponds to a group which is one ended. Which is one-ended. It's kind of nice that this is happening in this situation. And now, if we only end up as clicks, then the most boundaries totally disconnected. If not, then we know that these groups are like, that the conjugates of these groups are star divisors of the connected components in the Mohr spalm group. So this spitting of this graph corresponds to a higher heat of the group. Hierarchy of the group allow groups with anti-relative force factory. Okay, so I just stop here. Any other questions? The singletons that you see the single-post, is it possible to say where they come from? From yeah, so if you have your um, so what is the idea is to understand the waste boundary of the type of um the bassia tree, and now the non-singleton connected components kind of come from the boundary of the basia tree. And that's it. And that's it. That's exactly you get all the boundaries. You get all of the non-single buttons. So one has to be careful because it can happen that you have bar like um trees like Trees, like infinite trees in the tree, infinite paths. It can happen that you have geodesic rays in your KD path, which corresponds to rays in your trees, which are not moors. So one has to be careful. Other questions? Well, I think that's it. I mean, that's the end of the conference. I mean there are there are two more points. But there is coffee break before lunch. Coffee break for lunch to rest. You are done. So thank all of you. And thank once again, Arnette. In addition to thanking our organizers, I think we should also thank our local organizers who are really not a bringing them. Organizers were released on the mountain downstairs, and Jacob and Carlos were making this all so great. Thanks for watching. I think you can say that you all have to figure out the last question. So it's not always going to stop here because you know. Yeah, I don't know. So it is related to the market. So here no matter how fast you have to do it. So for instance, if I get a long time. For instance, you could try to split it on those, but those do not live in something. So you are not allowed to split. So you only split it on something which lives either in like you here are only allowed that graph theoretically to split on something which is in the non-travium joint or in a critical That looks similar to here. Yes, so what is the difference? Is if you look at this, like the important thing is the graphics drivers. So you are now to split here because these two vertices split in this core cycle. But here, going from here to here. Yeah, so what is important, this is why I have written this mass at the beginning, because this is what I'm saying. You have to still look at what you have. What you yes, you have always orient yourself on the graph to start with. Okay, this is interesting. I have to point this out more. So it's really you write at the beginning all of those and then this is what you check. Yeah, okay, does this make sense now? Yeah. When you're looking at joins, it has to be like a join of things which give where both factors are infinite. Yeah, so you want that, if you want to have a direct product of infinite writing a comps of the Of infinite writing a cup to the hoops, so you want to have joints. Both of those things are non-pix. Okay. Nice. I'm very happy about this. What happens with the free cube? The free cube is connected. Yeah, I see. So with the free cube, you cannot split. So the split queue, you cannot split the switch. Right, I see. So you would you then this process doesn't even, yeah. But like anytime you have a surprise, but a first cycle, non-verse cycle. Yeah, it lies in one connected component. So it lies in one of these composite things which you decompose. So you can take your graph. So you can take your graph and take, I mean, which is very similar, right? You have these square clusters. Exactly. The clusters are already characterizing it. Yeah. But right, I see. Once you have, if your graph is completely, it's just a square cluster, then you still have to do more work to try to see, identify what the boundary is. Yeah, exactly. So we don't know what the boundaries is until we know that it's connected. Exactly. Oh, okay, that's perfect. Right? So it's kind of. I was like hoping that you would I was a little surprised that you didn't need to do any doubling or anything like that. Actually it shouldn't be surprising because right this doubling is kind of I mean okay it seems like from what we've been doing this summer that like doubling is sort of only giving you looking within the connected point a little bit create new cycles inside you're not actually by sorry it's maybe not actually by so it's maybe what should actually happen is first you should run this this program and then like yeah and then take the things at the bottom and then you can now study the talk again you know yeah see i think no exactly i'm already you've got me going um so i have this thing that i have to check out but i will come back oh yes that's right okay so we should do that and then i want to i want to run your algorithm I want to run your algorithm on the bad graphs that she makes. Yes. Should fail, yeah. Yeah. Right? Well, because she needs, these are the ones you need to double to get your number cycle. Yeah, so I want to know how like I'm curious about the kind of important things. Yeah, so like I think so I I would I what I would guess like I would guess, like, first, it's enough that you first check the first graph, right? And I would guess that the first graph you start with has already connected most boundaries. So, I think this would be my guess. That you already start with something connected, and then you do the doubling, and it will stay connected. But who's going to be able to do that? Yeah, yeah, I don't want to make you late for a checkout. But I'll take them around. I'll have a bunch here. Yeah, that is probably going to be cool.    Actually, there isn't much best on the background.
