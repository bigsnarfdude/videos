I think it it is already started. Okay. Hi, my name is Wen Yi Wang. So I lead a lab at Daniel Medicine Cancer Center and we focus on developing statistical methods and tools to study tumor heterogeneity and evolution and also personalized cancer prediction modeling. So today I'll focus on telling you about our recent development in estimating tumor cell total mRNA expression. So, the overarching premise here is that more and more case researchers are realizing the importance to understand the joint variations in both the transcriptive pest space, as we all know, is very plastic, high variability, as well as the genome pest space. In the sense that the two spaces, sometimes they vary together and sometimes they vary independently, which makes, we don't know when each happens, making the problem extremely complicated. Making the problem extremely complicated. So, the general consensus is that any progress we make in understanding the joint variation may allow us to identify new ways to evaluate the tumor cells, to enforce the tumor cells to a favorable state that responds to treatment. So, when it comes to the concept of tumor cells responding to treatment and then later on becomes resistant, it comes to the word plasticity. Plasticity. So every clinician has a slightly different definition of plasticity in our mind, but traditionally, when you look at the literature, it is closely linked to what is cancer cell stemness, which is another concept that has been more than four decades old. So, but these concepts have been going up and down and in and out of the fashion because of the conflicting results people have been reporting in literature. So, with the recent advancement of single-cell sequencing profiling, Cell sequencing profiling cancer cells. So, many researchers, including myself, are starting to look at plasticity from a more quantitative perspective in that we would like to consider plasticity as simply changes, quantitative changes in genomes or transcriptomes of the same group of cells. So our central hypothesis here is that a fuzzy biological concept may be improved by mathematical definitions based on new technologies. Technologies. So, our main goal, my lab's main goal, is to use integrative deconvolution models to help define features of plasticity in human tissues in mathematical terms. And today's talk will be focused on our development of transcriptomic plasticity measure for tumor cells. But we also study genetic diversity in tumor cells as well as immune cells. So, long story short, fast backwards and a fast forward in the past few years, we have developed. Few years, we have developed a series of deconvolution tools under the name DMXT. What differentiates us from other deconvolution models is the semi-supervised setting, which is shown in red, that all of the deconvolution tools are aiming to estimate these mixing proportion pi for the tumor component. But we also add an additional job of estimating the gene expression distribution. The gene expression distribution for all of the genes in the tumor component. So, this is completely unknown. So, we believe this is the best way to allow for understanding tumor cell plasticity. So, this framework then introduced quite a few analytical and computational challenges, which are mainly caused by weak model identifiability, such as not having unique solutions, as well as in very high dimensional parameter space. Very high dimensional parameter space. So, over the years, we were able to solve these problems one at a time, which I will skip in this talk so that I can have other statistical models to have time to introduce more recent developments. So, a lot of hard work then leads to the reward, as in we realized that DMXT estimates tumor-specific transfer proportion and not cell count proportion. Cell type, cell count proportion. So, this is a simple illustration, as in we already know different cells express different amounts of transcript, so that these two proportions are different. So, we have validated that DMXT estimate tumor-specific transcript proportions using laser capture microinflex section experiments of cross-influenced tumor samples, and validating it using in cyclical mixed celli experiments of long-caselli and fibroblast immune cells. And by the way, as you probably know, immune cells. As you probably know, immune cells express the smallest amount of transforms. So then, this quantity then presents us with an opportunity. So, going back in history again, there has been long-standing interest in the cancer world in finding tumor cell features such as RNA and DNA content, as development of Floyd, to differentiate atypical hyperpleasure from tumor. Atypical hyperpleasure from truly malignant cells over the past 50 years. So, the main limitation over there is the throughput: the technology only allowed for a limited number of genes or a limited number of cells being investigated. And then there comes the single-cell RNA-seq profiling that allows for large-scale quantification of cells. So, this is a work from Caltech shortly after the invention of single-cell RNA sequencing profiling, where they use this. Sequencing profiling, where they use the spiking quantification to demonstrate there's indeed a significant variation in the total mRNA quantity across cell types. And then this is this work in early 2020 from a Stanford group, Aaron Wingo is presenting tomorrow morning. So he showed that single-cell transcriptional diversity as measured by this single metric, total number of expressed genes, which is a surrogate for the Surrogate for the total number of transcripts is a better hallmark of developmental potential than any specific gene path visible. So we realized that we had an opportunity with this transcript proportion. It gives us a tool to perform a systematic study about effects of telomerena expression levels in tumor cells in human tissues at scale as a feature of cancer cell plasticity. So this work was published. So, this work was published last year, and in this work, we started out first studying single-cell RNA sequencing data from 10 patients in four cancer types, colorectal, liver, lung, and pancreatic. And then colorectal and pancreas were from in-house. So, these patients will have detailed clinical follow-up information. So, first, we confirm using this, I call it a shower head ball. So, it's really an uncle print where Gray is. Uncle print where gray is not expressed and the black is expressed, each row is a cell. So we did observe a much higher diversity in terms of total UMI counts or gene counts in the tumor cells as compared to epicibial cells and immune cells. And again, here, the scale is the same, so immune cells has a much smaller total as is well known in the single cell literature. So we then looking diving into one cancer type. These are two patients. Patient one relapsed. These are two patients. Patient one relapsed in four months, and then patient two remained relapse-free in 15 months. So, on the left, we'll show you the Sora clusters, and on the right are the merged Sorora clusters, where we identify three distinctly different clusters in tumor cells, with the one on the far right presenting the highest amount of total UMI and gene counts as compared to other tumor cells or other cell types. Cells or other cell types. Looking deeper into the high UMI cancer cells, they're not proliferating or cycling. They're presenting epithelial mesenchymal transition, which is an important marker or process to measure the aggressiveness of cancer. And it's enriched with stemness signature gene cells, so presenting a stem-like substate. So we've repeated this observation in three other cancer types in that the high diversity in 2GO. In that the high diversity in total mRNA expression are presented in the patients with poor prognosis. However, we're limited to n equals 1, a very small sample size, so there's no statistical significance in its association with clinical outcome at this point. So we then try to link what we observe in a single cell with bulk. So the first step is to calculate pool all the cells and create a pseudo-bulk and calculate mean u am i counts. So we saw that at the mean level So we saw that at the mean level, there is still the distinction between patients remained to be extremely significant. We therefore hypothesized a quantification of the average. So keep in mind in bulk, we can only measure the average non-distribution, but the average tumor cell telomere mRNA expression in a bulk across large patient cohorts is useful to track the tumor phenotype and presenting its direct link with. So, one may ask, you know, why So one may ask, why haven't people done that? So two challenges prevented the previous studies from addressing this question. So first it was actually Richard Young's group back in early 2010 when there's, you know, people in the microarray era already wanted to study total mRNA because he was studying MIC expression leading to total mRNA expression increase as compared to individual pathways. To individual pathways. But in this paper, he ended up complaining about the sequencing, high-super sequencing technology not allowing them to measure the synchronous because the total mRNA amount is normalized out perfectly. It's a perfect confounding situation together with the technical elements. So this has been already discussed early on. And then the other challenge is, of course, we're interested in tumor specific activity, but Specific activity, but in bulk tissue, we're measuring signals coming from all kinds of cell types as shown here in this histology plot. So our solution is to use one challenge to solve the other by deconvolution. Because when we have a heterogeneity, we have multiple groups of cells. So by doing deconvolution, we are automatically contrasting two groups of cells within the same experimental condition, and hence naturally canceling out the technical effect. Cancelling out the technical effect and maintaining the biological signal as long as the two groups of cells are indeed biologically significant. So the contrast can be captured. So we therefore propose TMS, which is equal to, can be calculated as total mRNA expression per haplogram for tumor cells over non-tumor cells. So there's three major steps. The first step is we calculate the ratio of the total mRNA for tumor cells over non-tumor cells, which is mathematically Results, which is mathematically equal to the odds of the transfer proportion. And this step is, we aim at canceling out the technical facts and focusing on the biology. And the second step, we're interested in part-cell mRNA, and therefore we have to adjust for the number of tumor cells on the top and the number of non-tumor cells on the bottom, which is equal to the odds of the tumor cell count proportion or purity, I'll just refer to purity from now on. And then the last, we're not interested in in dosage effect. interested in dosage effect which is opposite from colour which is measuring dosage effect so here we then we would like to adjust the number of chromosomes which is represented by the side t for the tumors and two we use two for the romance so at the end of the day so with given with a given tumor sample we require a matched DNA see or SNP array where we can calculate the ploidy and then the purity and RNA matched RNA-seq data where we use DNA match RNA-seq data where we use the MXT to estimate the total mRNA proportion pi. And the TMS then can be calculated as an odds ratio of the two proportions and further adjusted by. So the next are a few slides that I would like to take a deeper dive in the technical side, which I don't usually get an opportunity to talk about. So first is this consensus, we calculated the consensus security employment estimate in TCGA. So here I'm showing you on the top row this is the transport On the top row, this is the transcript proportions from TMXT, ASCAT-based purity estimate, and absolute-based purity estimate. So, as we would expect, the transcript proportion looks very different from the purity estimate from the DNA-seq. So, this is slippery-based. But also, we observe some differences, slight differences, between as cat and absolute at the purity space. And then, further, here we compare the ploidy, the ploidy estimate. So, we observe 20%, which is We observed 20%, which is not a small amount, of samples that showed a disagreement between aspect and absolute. But interestingly, so here, we're zooming into these 900 disorder samples and we've compared the TMS estimate. So reminding you that our TMS has a calculation that includes both the odds of the row and the percent. So this somehow, so here the gray here, gray points are Gray here, gray points are TMS values without the ploidy estimate. So the variation represented here is due to the difference in purity. But then once we perform the ploidy adjustment, the blue, then the variation is much reduced. So we realized that interesting kind of side benefit here is that this equation here resolves some ambiguous solutions, whereas sometimes there are two equally likely solutions from Equally likely solutions from the DNA-seq data. You should ask I pick one, ABSL will pick the other, but it doesn't matter because we'll reach the same TMS value. So we therefore decided that we look for consensus at the TMS level, but not at the purity or the purity level. So TMS based on absolute versus TMS based on SCAT, we identified that actually 95% of the entire TCGA data that we can do this calculation are consistent. Calculation are consistent, and then we throw away the remaining 5%. So, again, unexpected benefit that the TMS calculation is insensitive to the often ambiguous solutions of the purity and floidy combinations. And next, moving on to how do we make sure that we are accurately estimating transcript proportion. It's a biological concept. It's important to make it right. So, remember, so we're using these two components. We're using this two-component DMXT with a very strong assumption that given the gene, we have one single modal distribution from the normal or the adjacent normal and a single modal distribution from the tumor. But we all know that there are many genes that will follow other distributions, multimodal in the tumor component or similarly distributed between TNN or presenting large variants. So we don't necessarily like these genes. However, the T. However, the T component is hidden. So, what we observe is Y. So, what people usually do, or the easy way to get out of this, is to perform a Y versus N differenti expression analysis and then take the genes that are highly differentially expressed and say, we assume these are the genes that will follow this distribution nicely. But we were not happy with that approach. We instead proposed a profile likelihood approach, which is profiling. Which is profiling this hidden T distribution, gene expression T component, and give it a gene selection score. And then only pick the smaller the score, then the more likely the gene follow this distribution. So that we only pick the top-ranking genes to then perform the commotion. So here's one slide of math. Let me see if I can convince you that we're doing something sensible. So we consider the model that this is traditional. Traditionally, model identifiability can be addressed by an approach called profile likelihood. So, here, first we introduce the concept of confidence interval, that when we build a confidence interval around the desirable parameter theta, then we say the smaller the confidence interval, then the more identifiable this parameter is. So, that's the foundation. And then, how do we do this? So, we first need to derive a profile likelihood for a A profile likelihood for a given parameter. So this is the mean expression of the tumor component for gene k. So what we do is we fix this μ tk at a value. So then we take this parameter out of the maximum likelihood equation and then say this profile likelihood is simply the maximum likelihood with all of the other parameters identified. With, but is based on a fixed value of this mu Tk of interest. So that we're profiling mu T K. What do I mean by profiling? So here are four genes. As an example, let's focus on one gene here. And then we have a blue curve. This is its profile likelihood. So the x-axis is basically changing the value for the mu TK. So we first fix the mu TK, and then we look for its corresponding maximum likelihood. Maximum likelihood. So when we look for the confidence interval, we're asking which was the minimum x and what's the maximum x that will help make this blue curve to increase to a certain level. So notice that this horizontal line demonstrated the same height between the horizontal line and the lowest tip at the bottom. At the bottom, which is the true maximum likelihood. I hope I explained it correctly. Alright, so the 95% confidence interval, which then corresponds to the distance between the minimum x and then the maximum x, that satisfies the corresponding base. Alright, so then the blue. So then the blue curve, unfortunately, is computationally intractable because you basically have to run the EXT on the entire data set 20 times, well, to generate 20 points for one gene. And each time it takes six hours to finish running. We therefore resort to the asymptotic solution. So we can approximate the profile likelihood asymptotically, which in our case when we have 200 samples, we assume it fits using the feature information. Using a feature information. And then the 95% confidence interval can be simply calculated using this equation. Could ask you an extremely naive question. So when I think of something that's not identifiable, it means that no matter how much data I have, I can't actually define that parameter. No, so in here, yeah, see, see, that goes back to definition. Of course, everybody's definition can be different. So here, my definition, I should. So, here my definition, I should give you an extreme example: is that it's basically no matter what x that I have, I'll get the same maximum likelihood. Then that parameter is unidentifiable. So I can keep changing the x, right? So these are good identifiable cases, but the bad case will be a really, really flat line, which then means that no matter what values that we assign to that. What values that we assign to that particular gene, to that particular parameter? So that's my definition of the identifiability of that parameter in our model. So then more data doesn't change that? Oh, well, the more data, it is good because we're doing asymptotic. It doesn't change the property of profile likelihood. But we are, in reality, we can't calculate the exact profile likelihood. So then when we use the asymptotic property, When we use the ACTALIC property, we do the larger sample size of that. I see. Okay, so it's approximation, because more data will strengthen confidence interval, right? Usually. Yeah, but it's the same data set. Right, it's the same sample size where we order the cheese. Yeah. And but also the other, I think the relativity, that is a very good point where I actually have a plot on that. A plot on that where we look at, we can make this curve for each cancer type, and then we definitely see that the curves don't line up, right? So some curves are very low and some curves are higher. And then we did look into the sample size correspondingly. So my hypothesis is that the smaller the sample size, the higher. And I remember that was the case. So to make, anyway, that's the next project, to make this approach actually kind of more. Actually, kind of more well calibrated and insensitive to sample size. I have some ideas, but still need a mathematician to do it. Good comment. Any other questions? Yeah, I have another simple question. Can you go to the next slide? Yeah. So how exactly are you finding these confidence intervals? Is it because typically you have a point estimate and then you do like find area that has 95% of the mass, right? 95% of the maths, right? Under the probability distribution. This isn't necessarily, this isn't like a no, no. So we basically start, like I said, so it's literally what we are seeing here is that we start from the lowest point. So that's like your point. And then we have this bar here, and then so the height is fixed, which is this value. So basically, we fix the height and then see how wide do we need to go on the x values to be. To go on the x-lines to be able to reach the height of the wall. And then, of course, I'm showing the really good examples here that asymptotic approximation fits the real actual profile I could have very well. And so sometimes it doesn't fit that well. But overall, we think this is a reasonable approach, which I'll show you later in the next slide in the real data. Next slide in the real data. But here, this is a simulation. So, here, since it's simulation, we can simulate genes that follow the different desirable and undesirable distributions. And what I'm showing you on the top, on the left, is the GS-based ranking, and then on the right is the DE-based ranking. So we see the DE is not doing a bad job, but definitely GS can separate the desirable genes with... The desirable genes with a much smaller score as compared to other genes. So, when we look at, say, top 1500, this is a number that we use in TCGA, so we're interested in this number, that the profile likelihood is really enriched in desirable genes, but the DE-base is already contaminated quite a lot by other types of genes. So then we start to think about, okay, Well, we start to think about, okay, identifying these genes that are actually presenting a single modal distribution, there must be some biology behind it. We're talking about genes, so this, we're not the first to talk about focusing on genes that are stably expressed across tumor samples. So we then took these genes in TCGA, top 1500 to top 2,000 in each cancer type across 15 cancer types. And then we did gene set enrichment analysis. We did gene set enrichment analysis, and indeed they're all consistently enriched in a MIG target and then DNA repair pathways, spliceosome, proteasome, and RNA degradation, obviously very important biological processes for mRNA. And on the right is where we compare the gene names across cancer types and observing that it's definitely not random, as in they're most frequently annotated as housekeeping and essential genes. As housekeeping and essential genes. And there are 2,000 genes that are selected, a total of 2,000 genes that are selected in five or more cancer types. So there are a lot of overlap in the genes used as the basis of our decomposition across cancer types, which is reassuring. Okay, so being happy, having done this modeling to ensure a consensus estimate of purity, employee. Of purity, ploidy, and transcript proportions. We then went ahead and calculated TMS for 15 cancer types in four consortium. So here I'm listing across 6,580 patients. Here each dot is a patient. So here I'm ordering, oh, so first thing is we compare with this is a benchmarking study where we actually calculated the RNA content using qubit. So it's experimental validation. And then, and this allows us to evaluate the uncertainty associated with our estimation. So, as you can see, that the patient's TMS presents much larger variation than what we observe in a benchmarking study, suggesting biological variation. And the cancer types here are ordered based on the median TMS from low to high. And the first site is that the low TMS cancer types tend to be more ambulant, and then Tend to be more indolent, and then the cancer types presenting high TMS tend to be more aggressive. So, we then hypothesized that TMS might be associated with prognostic characteristics. So, we looked into these well-known prognostic characteristics that are currently used in clinical decision-making, such as HPV status in head and neck, the triple negative ERPR PIN50, and make amplification in breast cancer. Conflication in breast cancer, recent score in prostates, and luminum basal in bladder, and type 1, type 2 immunoplane. In all of them, there's significant correlation and that the more aggressive prognostic feature is associated with high TMS. And breast cancer, we further validated in additional 1,500 patients using the metal break data. So, this is probably the most impressive result as NTMS. Impressive result as NTMS further refines prognostication on top of pathological stages, which are currently mostly the most used decision-making tool in the clinic in all 13 cancer types in TCGA where we have the stage information. So, here I'm showing you a forest plotted hazard ratios. The middle point is the point estimate, and then the bars represent that 95% confidence interval was the main effect of the black for TMS, and then the main effect of And then the main effect of stage, and the green is the purple, and then the green is interrelated. So, overall, most of cases we have observed a significant positive effect of the main effect of TMS. So, high TMS, worse prognosis across cancers. But when it comes to breast cancer, the effect began to flip. So, higher TMS, but better prognosis, which we then found. Hinesses, which we then followed up with the Metabrick and replicated this finding. What's good with Metabrick is that it has much better comprehensive documentation of treatment as well as 20 years of follow-up as compared to five years in TCGA. So here we confirm that it is indeed the patients who were treated with chemotherapy where we observed patients with high TMS presenting significantly better pot mixes. Significantly better pot mixes. But I'll leave this story to Yao Yib, who will talk more about the follow-up study that we performed. So you separate TMS has the potential to serve as a marker for worse prognosis as well as for better response to chemotherapy and mass cancers. Moving from inter-tumor heterogeneity to intra-tumor heterogeneity, so here we got hold of the TRACER X, all the Tracer X100 study. All the Trease Rex 100 study, we calculated TMS for every region of these lung cancer patients, early stage lung cancer patients. And then at the patient level, we calculated the maximum of TMS. So one highlight of the original tracer action is that the percent subclonal copy number aberration measures ongoing chromosome instability and are important for tumor progression than overall CNA burden. So we indeed observed that TMS max is more correlated. Max is more correlated with percent subclonal copy number aberration than the overall copy number aberration. And this curve is kind of curved because the range of TMS and number region also work significant contributors, but the coefficient for the percent sub CNA is much bigger. So we then validate that TMS max can dichotomize patients' prognosis, and this effect is in addition to the percent of colossine. Addition to the presence of colocamin, which was previously reported as the main prognostic effect in a New England journey paper. So, here summarize a regional TMS can identify spatial heterogeneity in transcriptomic discriptome dismal division. So, I hope I have convinced you by now that tumor cell total mRNA expression of transcriptome floidy in analogy to genome floidy provides a key feature to track tumor cell phenotype. So, we have recently developed this. So we have recently developed this shiny app with all the values, six thousand patients, the TMS values available there. And then the motivation is for clinicians and biologists to not need to do any R or anything and then go there and then click TCGA, say HEDANAC, and then look at the favorite genes. So for example, here, this is within HEDANAC, we found SNRPE, which is a key component for pre-MRE. Which is a key component for pre-mRNA processing status as the facility in the highest correlation with TNS, which makes sense. We can also provide a kind of pathway level analysis. So here across cancer types, proteasome and ribosome and DNA replication came out to be significantly correlated with high TMS. And then the negative correlation, what's interesting, is TGF rate type, where PTC came out as the main As the main biological passage. So, I'll end with kind of a snippet of the work in progress. We're definitely interested in following up on TMS in various cancer types. One of the interest is in colorectal cancer. So to me, by performing PEN cancer analysis over the past many years, I always had the impression that colorectal cancer is the most heterogeneous cancer type of all, because every time I look at cancer cancer cancer can Because every time I look at a potential transcriptomic characteristics, there's always a small signal and not at the border of significance in the CIC as compared to other cancer types. It's always more significant. So my hypothesis here is then that we should really first phenotype the colorectal cancer and then look at more meaningful, clinically meaningful subgroups, and then ask whether we can identify one increase. So, just here's one example. So, we compare young onset versus late onset. Young onset CRC is defined as those CRC diagnosed between age 18 and 50. Or right now, people are maybe changing the guideline to 45 and then say 45 to 60 is the middle. Anyway, so it is an increasing global problem that needs to be addressed urgently, but remains poorly understood. And I totally relate to that. And I totally relate to that. I don't know many people who have cancer, but I know three people, including my classmates, who already have color to cancer. So in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. So I'm very motivated to study this disease. So what I'm showing here is that when we take, so we calculate CMS, yeah. So when we look at the TCGA and then dichotomize CRC into the 2H group, we didn't really see a difference. But that again speaks to the importance of phenotyping. The importance of phenotyping and then clinically select comparable samples in the colorectal tumor, which is what we did in a more recent study as a Moonshop program with CRC investigators. So here we feel that our control group, these tumor characteristics, are more comparable. So in that case, of course, this is very preliminary, so it's in progress. And here, then we see a much significant difference. A much significant difference, and that the direction is expected with the early onset CRC presenting a much higher TMS, because early onset is known to be more oppressive. And the late onset presenting lower TMS. We also looked at the signature genes, intrinsic tumor signature genes. We found half overlap between the two studies, which are completely different studies, different types of tumors. I mean, they're all CIC. And then it was half being unique. So I thought that's also interesting. So our next step is to look at biological pathways enriched in overlapping, which my hypothesis is correspond to the general cancer process or colorectal cancer process. And the unique genes might point, we have a chance of understanding a little bit more about beyond onset versus late onset CLC. And the other snippet is another aspect of colorectal chemistry is metastasis. Colorectal cancer is metastasis. Again, so metastasis is the driver of cancer deaths in the majority of the 50,000 Americans who die of CRC every year. So here, oh yeah, yeah, this is that. So here, again, with collaborator at the Anderson, they actually generated single-cell RNA-seq data from hundreds, more than 100 CRC tumors, which then boils down to when we say liver mats. When we say liver metastasis with relapse information, which is 33 tumors, much better than n equals to 1. So we can then just calculate pseudo-bulk TMS directly from the single cell RMAC. And indeed, we observe a significant difference this time in the expected direction that tumors, liver mass that do not relapse has lower TMS as compared to those that relapse. And of course, then we have the single cell data, so we can also calculate the cellular trait. Data, so we can also calculate the sadotrace score, etc. etc. And then, indeed, we observe much higher sadotrace scores in the high TMS samples at a single cell level, presenting a de-differtiation state, and then they have present ENT and standard signature gene sets, etc. But the key point here is that also we found similar things in the metastatic prostate cancer. So, these observations further expand the utility of tumor cell plasticity feature evaluation from primary to Evaluation from primary to metastatic tumor, which I didn't want to make any assumption before looking at the data because they have very different tumor macro environments. So, with that, oh, and then just highlight Chauncy here, who couldn't make his way here because his wife got, their car got hit by another car, was a four-car accident. So he's like, Yeah, very struggling with the insurance company. But yeah, this result is right. So, in summary, So, in summary, we have developed integrative deconvolution models to help define features of tumor plasticity in mathematical terms in order to improve the genomic, which I didn't talk about here, but it's also an interest of my lab and transcriptomic definition of heterogeneous tumors. So, our focus here is to maximize patient samples, sample size, with kind of the quantified features in order to perform clinical associations. In order to perform clinical association. And the models, the methods, software tools I talked about, DMXT and then TMS John Diab, are available for these. And I'll end by thanking my lab for their outstanding work and also the large group of collaborators were brilliant and it's so helpful, a conversation with biologists, physicians, scientists, and cancer biologists. Thank you. So in the single cell study, the TMS, I don't know if you could go back to that slide, but it's hard to. What's the are the different Dave? Sorry, the very last one though. Are the are you computing TMS TMS over the individual cells? Or is it always over suitable? Or is it always over pseudo voltage? Oh, it's the pseudo volt level. So, can you compute it over pseudo volts for different cell clusters or cell lines? Yes, you can, of course. Yeah, absolutely. You see interesting it? Yeah, and then I guess my point is, then it's not really the utility of TMS. So, then I guess that's my question. What's the utility of TMS? Yeah, well, the utility of TMS is a bulk, of course. Course. Yeah, and it can serve, okay. The utility in the bulk we already talked a lot about, but I guess the question is, what's utility when we have single cell data? There are two things. One is the single cell data, there's always the question of how many clusters do we want and then which cluster is more interesting. I think TMS is basically average total unique. So it's a summary statistic. Total unmax. So it's a summary statistic. And then if we have enough patient samples and then just try looking at the summary statistic and then just go straight and then perform an association analysis, that can give us some insight before we dive into the single cell clustering and annotation analysis, which is very time consuming. So that's one thing. Oh, and the other thing is the reason we look at the metastatic meds first is that in the meds, the tumor cells are easily identifiable. The tumor cells are easily identifiable. So, with CRC primary tumor single-cell data, we were always concerned about what are the true tumor cells, what are the normal epithelial. So, that's a step that we were not convinced that fairly available method is that accurate. So, there's always like all these complications of processes in mosaic that can be avoided by looking at liver metastatic tumors and calculating TMS. Oh, actually, I can't stop recording.
