Comprehensive survey. In particular, I'm not going to talk about some of the important work of Danny Wise on cube complexes, but I decided to think about it this way. I want to talk about subgroup separability and some related definitions, and then give some examples of why a low-dimensional geometric topologist might be interested in subgroup separability. So, I want to give you some specific examples. Give you some specific examples of where it's used, and then I'll talk a little bit about how you might prove results involving subgroup separability. So, first the definition. I have a subset of a group gamma, and often that subset is a subgroup, but not always. Then we say that that subset is separable in gamma if for every element outside of that subset, there exists a group homomorphism. Exists a group homomorphism onto a finite group where that element, the image of that element remains outside the image of that subset. So you have your subset and you have your element and they're distinct and you want them to remain distinct in a finite quotient. And if you happen to have a subgroup, there's an equivalent definition. So if you have H and gamma, which is a subgroup. Gamma, which is a subgroup, then H is separable if and only if for every element G outside of H, there exists a subgroup N in not normal, but a subgroup N in gamma of finite index such that H Such that H is in N, but G is not in N. So you can separate H and your element with a subgroup of finite index. So these are equivalent if H is a subgroup, but not in general. So we say a group gamma is residually finite if the subgroup consisting of just the identity element is separable, and then it's subgroup separable, sometimes called It's subgroup separable, sometimes called LERF, which stands for locally extended residually finite. If every finitely generated subgroup of gamma is separable in gamma. So here are some results that relate to low-dimensional manifolds. So free groups are LERV. Surface groups are LERV. For three manifolds, we have fundamental groups of compact ciphered fibered spaces are LERV. This next result was open when I was in a Result was open when I was an important open problem when I was first working in this area. But Ian Agel proved, I think it was around 2012, that fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic three manifolds are LERF. And then fundamental groups of hyperbolic three manifolds that contain an embedded geometrically finite surface are LERF. I'm going to talk about a sort of a non-example a little bit later. Okay, so here are some really Okay, so here's some related definitions. So we say a group gamma is double coset separable. So here's where we're looking at a subset that's not a subgroup. If for every pair of finitely generated subgroups and every element in the group, that double coset H gamma K is separable in gamma. And then gamma is conjugacy separable if every conjugacy class in gamma is separable. So there you would take two elements. So, there you would take two elements in gamma that are not conjugate, and you want a finite quotient where they remain not conjugate. And we have some examples there. Some of the examples are similar. Free groups, surface groups, fundamental groups of compact ciphered fibered spaces, closed hyperbolic three-manifold groups are all conjugacy separable and double cosets separable. These are various people that have worked on those results. And then, in joint work with Wilton and Zelewsky, we proved that fundamental groups of compact orientable three-manifolds are conjugacy separable. And for that, we needed to use a result about double coset separability, which I'll mention later. Okay, so I want to talk about some applications. The first application is in combinatorial group theory. So, subgroup separability and sort of related ideas. And sort of related ideas have been used to solve the word problem. So, suppose you have a finitely presented group. So, you have your generators and your relations. You'd like to have an algorithm which is going to decide in a finite number of steps whether a word in your generators is a trivial word or not. And you can do this if the group is residually finite. So, you can kind of run two algorithms at the same time. Algorithms at the same time. So the first algorithm is listing all of the words that represent the identity, and you can use the relations to start listing that. And then the second algorithm is going to list all the elements that are not equal to the identity. So if your group, I mean, if your element is non-trivial, then it's going to map to something non-trivial in a finite quotient if your group is residually finite. And so you can start listing. Start listing all of the finite quotients of your group and checking your element to see if it maps to something non-trivial. So, this isn't necessarily a fast algorithm, but you're running both things at the same time. And so you're guaranteed that eventually your word is going to show up on one of the two lists. And that's when the algorithm stops. So you can use residual finiteness to solve the word problem. And if your group is subgroup separable, then it has a solvable generalized word problem. Generalized word problems. So you'd be able to tell if your word is in a particular subgroup or not. And then if it's conjugacy separable, then you can solve the conjugacy problem. So if you have two words, you want to know whether or not they're conjugate or not. So these ideas have been sort of interesting to the geometric group theorists or combinatorial group theorists. But I want to talk about applications to three manifolds. So, I'm talking about two applications. One is, I think, when three manifold topologists maybe first started being interested in this topic, and then the other one is more recent. So whenever I sort of give a talk on this subject, I'd say that subgroup separability has been used to solve immersion to embedding problems, and I sort of go on from there, but I want to be more specific right now. So here's the lifting problem. Lifting problem. You have a compact three-manifold and you have an immersed, incompressible surface. And so the question is, when does that immersion lift to an embedding in a finite sheeted covering space? And so people were particularly interested in this before the solution to the virtual Hawking conjecture because if you had an incompressible Had an incompressible surface, then, and this was true, then you would have a finite cover, which was Hawken. So if your group is subgroup separable, then the answer is yes. So the idea is you have your immersed surface. Into your manifold M. And what stops that from being an embedding is self-intersection. So you might have a curve over here where these two points are identified in the manifold. And so that's going to correspond to a loop down in the manifold. So since this is pi one injective, you can view the subgroup of this. One injective, you can view the subgroup of the surface as a subgroup of the three-manifold, and so this loop corresponds to an element in the fundamental group of the three-manifold, which is not in the fundamental group of a surface. It's just a curve over here. And so you want to remove these sort of problem points. So if you know that the fundamental group of that surface is separable in the larger group, then you can find a, you grab sort of one of these cells. A you grab sort of one of these self-intersection points, which are coming from an element in the fundamental group. You can find a subgroup of finite index that contains your surface subgroup, but doesn't contain that problem element. And that corresponds to a finite sheeted covering where you've kind of removed that self-intersection. And kind of, you can use compactness to show that you only need to do this sort of finitely many times. You can kind of use, look at the intersection. You can kind of use look at the intersection of all those subgroups of finite index, and that would be a covering. So that's sort of the idea of the immersion to the embedding. This was all formalized, though, by Peter Scott. So Peter Scott, I think this is the first part was in 1978. And he gave the sort of the connection between. Gave the sort of connection between the algebraic definition and then the geometric property. So, and this doesn't have to be a manifold. So, X is any Hausdorff topological space, and we have a regular covering X tilde and a covering group G. Then G is separable if and only if, given any finitely generated subgroup of G. Use this pointer. Okay, so we have a Okay, so we have a finitely generated subgroup, and then we're looking at x tilde mod H. You can take any compact set that you want in there. So I sort of picked a particularly interesting one. That compact set would normally be immersed in an X, but that would lift to an embedding in some finite cover. So the group is separable if and only if you can do this for every finitely generated subgroup and every compact subgroup. Generated subgroup and every compact set. So I'll say just a tiny bit about the, I guess, the forwards direction of the proof, because that's the direction we're mostly interested in, is how can subgroup separability give us these properties. And the idea is pretty similar. So you have X tilde, and that's covering X, which is going to be X tilde mod G. Tilde mod mod g and then you have x tilde. I need to draw something. You have your compact set in here. So you would find a compact set D upstairs that projects down to C. And then you would look at the elements in the group G that take this set such that G of D intersect D is non-empty. So those are elements in the group that are giving you self-intersections. And you can show that that's a finite set. And so by the argument that I just And so, by the argument that I just talked about, if this is subgroup separable, then you can find a subgroup, a finite index G1 that contains H but doesn't contain those elements that are causing intersections, and that gives you your finite cover. Okay, well, that's great, but that doesn't actually answer the question. So, this doesn't really have that much to do with subgroup separability, but I posed the question, so we should go back to it. The question, so we should go back to it. So, we have the lifting problem. We want to know when an immersion lifts to an embedding in a finite sheet of covering. So, we know that if the three-manifold group is subgroup-separable, then the answer is yes. And so, people were trying to prove that fundamental groups of three-manifolds were subgroup separable. However, there were examples of three-manifold groups that were not subgroup separable. So, the first examples came in 1987, and this was the And this was the sort of the BKS group. So it's a pretty simple group. It has three generators and two relations. And they showed that it was the fundamental group of a three-manifold. It's a mapping torus of a, do you have a punctured torus? And then, but that was a three-manifold with boundary. And so two years later, Long and Nivlow used the BKS group and construction. Group and construction to come up with an example of a closed three-manifold whose fundamental group was not LERF. But that still doesn't really answer the question because while subgroup separability will give you a positive result, you don't necessarily need it. It's stronger than what you need. So it wasn't until 1998 that Rubenstein and Wang gave the first examples of pi1 injective immersions of surfaces. Immersions of surfaces that didn't lift to embeddings in any finite sheeted covering space. And so here's a, they actually gave a criteria where you could check any horizontal surface. They're looking at graph manifolds. So if you look at graph manifolds, they have a criteria where you can check when this happens. But here's an example. The three manifold is down below. So you have a punctured torus cross S1, and you have two copies of that. And you have two copies of that. So the boundary is the torus, and you're gluing the toroid together using that map. And then there's a, I'm not going to go through the details, but there's a genus V surface that is immersed and it doesn't lift to an embedding in any finite sheet of covering. So that kind of solves that problem. And then, but subgroup separability was a way to get a positive answer. Answered. Okay, so now I'm going to look at a more recent application. So, this is another geometric question that three-manifold topologists might be interested in. In fact, I think it's even came up a little today. So, now we're going to be looking at hyperbolic three-manifolds with a cusp. So, that will be what we're looking at throughout the talk, finite volume. Topological ideal triangulation is a decomposition of M. Is a decomposition of M into finitely many tetrahedra with vertices at infinity. The sides are identified in pairs. And then the ideal triangulation is geometric if each tetrahedron is isometric to a totally geodesic tetrahedron that lives in H3. And then the gluing is done by isometries, which give the hyperbolic structure. So, every cos3 manifold admits a topological ideal triangulation. I'm sure you all know maybe that geometric triangulations are useful. They're central to the computations in SNAPI. And Thurston's original proof of the hyperbolic Dane surgery theorem kind of assumed the existence of geometric triangulations. Yet, despite that, this Yet, despite that, this first conjecture remains unknown. So it's not known whether every cusped hyperbolic free manifold admits a geometric ideal triangulation. So that's open. In the 1980s, people thought that the first one was true. And I'm going to actually talk about this construction so you'll see what they thought, why they thought it was true. And then there's sort of a strengthening. And then there's sort of a strengthening of the conjecture that, in fact, it admits infinitely many. So there aren't that many direct constructions of geometric ideal triangulations. They're only known in some specific examples. But Lowe, Schleimer, and Tillman proved that the first conjecture is virtually true. So every cusp hyperbolic three-manifold. Hyperbolic free manifold has a finite cover that supports a geometric triangulation. And I want to talk about their proof first and then talk about some work that we've done to look at infinitely many triangulations. But I want to talk about their proof because it's a really nice argument and it's another way to see how subgroup separability comes and gives you something that you want. So the idea is to separate. The idea is to subdivide the Epstein-Penner geometric ideal polyhedra decomposition, and I'm going to talk about that now. Okay, so if you have a cost hyperbolic three-manifold, you can always break it up into finitely many geometric polyhedra. And so I'm going to describe that. So we have our cost. So, we have our cusp hyperbolic three manifold, and we have a fixed set of horror cusps. And this will depend on the horror cusps that we pick. So, we could shrink them, and that would change things a little bit. Then, the Ford Roney domain is the set of all points in the manifold that have a unique shortest path to one of the horror cusps. Then, the complement of that is called the cut locus, that's a two-dimensional cell complex, and then the combinatory. Complex, and then the combinatorial dual to that is the polyhedral decomposition. So, let me just show you this picture. This is one dimension lower. The pictures are sort of easier to draw one dimension lower. So, now I'm looking at a hyperbolic surface with cusps, and then I'm looking up in the universal covering space. So, one of my parabolic fixed points is at infinity. And so, I have this horror ball up there. This is hard to use. Ball up there. This is hard to use. The horrible ball up there. So that's my kind of horrible packing. And then the cut locust is in red. So you can see that those are points which are sort of equally close to two or more whoreballs. And then the edges of the decomposition, the polyhedral decomposition, are in blue. And it's dual to the cut locus. So, for example, if you take a vertex. Locus. So, for example, if you take a vertex in the cut locus, that's equally close to three of the horror balls. Those horror balls have parabolic fixed points, so you would take kind of the convex hull of those three parabolic fixed points, and that gives you your face that's dual to that vertex. So, it was known that you could always come up with a geodesic polyhedra decomposition, but Decomposition, but we want to break them up into tetrahedra. And if you take one, you can always break it up by the process of coning. So here's the process of coning. It doesn't really look ideal or totally geodesic, but there's your polyhedron. And you just grab a vertex. I grabbed this one in the back. Actually, this picture is not due. One in the back. Actually, this picture is not due to me, but we grabbed one in the back. And by coning from that vertex, you can break the polyhedron up into pyramids. So the apex of the pyramid is going to be that vertex that you grabbed, and the base will be all faces that don't contain that vertex. So you now have broken it up into pyramids. And then you go to a pyramid and you grab one of the vertices on. And you grab one of the vertices on the base and cone from there, that's going to break up each pyramid into tetrahedra. So if you just have one geometric polyhedron, then you can always break it up into these geometric tetrahedra. The problem is when you try to glue. So when you break it up, you've created kind of edges along the faces, and you're going to be gluing that to another face, and you need to make sure that you're gluing it consistently. Make sure that you're gluing in a consistent manner. So, I think maybe that's what people thought you could do in the 80s, and then they found out some of the problems with that. Okay, so going back to their paper, they sort of gave a condition about when this process will work. So, if you have a total order on the set of cusps of your manifold, so you can do that. You have finitely many cusps. You have finitely many cusps, just give each one a number, and then you can sort of use that. If you kind of look at your polyhedron up in the universal cover, you have the ideal points and then you have the cusps that they map to. So you can always give them the corresponding number. If that gives a total order on the vertices of every polyhedron, then you're able to do this process of coning. You're able to do this process of coning and it'll be consistent. So, the way that you would cone is you would take your polyhedron and you would grab the smallest vertex and cone from that. And then when you go to one of the faces, when you go to a pyramid and you go to the face, you take the smallest vertex there and cone from that. And that will be kind of a consistent way to break up all the polyhedron into tetrahedra, which is consistent when you glue. Which is consistent when you glue. So the problem is creating something like this. And their argument showed that you could do this in a finite cover. So the obstruction to this is something we call a returning diagonal in your polyhedron. So you have two vertices which correspond to parabolic fixed points, and they might be sent to the same cusp in your manifolds. The same cusp in your manifolds. You might have an element in your group which is taking, say, V to W, then those two vertices are going to have the same number. And so you don't necessarily have a unique smallest vertex in your polyhedron. So that's sort of the same issue over here. You have group elements which are identifying things and you don't want them to be identified. So we let H be the, I'm grabbing one of the vertices. Be the I'm grabbing one of the vertices V and I'm going to let H be the stabilizer of V. So this is a maximal parabolic subgroup. And okay, so it's known that if you're in a residually finite group, our groups are finitely generated linear groups, so they're residually finite. If you have a maximal abelian subgroup in a residually finite group, then it's separable. And that's a sort of a cute short argument for that. So it was known that these stabilizers of these parabolic The stabilizers of these parabolic fixed points are separable. And so there will exist a finite index subgroup K of G that contains H but doesn't contain G. And so if you take the cover corresponding to that, this will no longer be a returning diagonal. So these two aren't going to be identified anymore. That won't necessarily be a regular cover, but every subgroup of finite index contains. Every subgroup of finite index contains a normal subgroup of finite index that you can just go up a little higher. And then you would have a regular cover where you've eliminated that returning diagonal and you just sort of do that one diagonal at a time. So that was the idea of their proof is you use, and what they're using is just the subgroup separability of these maximal parabolic subgroups. You can go to a finite cover where you don't have these returns. To a finite cover where you don't have these returning diagonals, then you can label the vertices and you can cone and get a geometric triangulation. Okay, now let's go look at the second conjecture. So the second conjecture is not satisfied with just one, but we want infinitely many geometric ideal triangulations. So this is joint work with Dave Footer and Neil Hoffman. Dave Fuder and Neil Hoffman. We were still looking at a cusp hyperbolic three-manifold, and we're sort of fixing one of the cusps. Then, again, we showed that the second conjecture is virtually true. So there's a finite cover that admits infinitely many geometric ideal triangulations. And sort of a bonus, you can do Dane filling on the other cusp and you still preserve that property. So this also. So, this also uses a geometric argument and some separability. So, here's the strategy for that. You again, we start with what I just did. So, you can lift to a finite cover where you have a geometric ideal triangulation. And then, under more conditions, so you have to sort of lift higher. You can look at your cusp, and your cusp will have. Look at your cusp, and your cusp will have the structure of a drilled animus. So, I'll say what that is a little bit later. And then that will admit an infinite sequence of geometric ideal triangulations. So, I'll show you the picture of that in the next slide. Okay, so this is the cusp. We have our geometric triangulation, and we're looking up in the cusp. Cusp. And suppose you have two ideal tetrahedra, which are glued together along the faces to create the cusp. We're going to call it the union of that, the drilled ananus. There's another case of that, but I'm not going to talk about, but this is sort of the generic case. So we have a fixed triangulation. You're seeing two of the tetrahedra. You can just ignore the rest because we're not doing anything with them. And we're going to do a sequence. And we're going to do a sequence of two, three moves. So you look at the faces that are being glued together, and we want some convexity, so you have to control that angle a little bit. And then you look at the edge, which is dual to that face. So that's beta prime there. And then you replace your two tetrahedra with three tetrahedra that all share that edge, that dashed edge. And so you can see we have three. We have three. We have a lower one and two upper ones. So you would sort of then ignore the lower one. And when you look at the two upper ones, that's another drilled animus and you can repeat. So you can kind of keep repeating this process. So when you do this once, you have a new triangulation, you have one more tetrahedra. And then you do it again. And the next time you would do it on gluing some of the outer faces. And you'd kind of keep repeating. Yeah, and you keep repeating this to get an infinite sequence. Okay, let me okay, so we needed to lift to get two things to happen. One was to be able to get the triangulation to begin with, and for that we just needed the maximal parabolic subgroup separability. But to get the drilled on on us, But to get the drilled on on us, we needed stronger results, especially in the bad case that I didn't talk about. So the generic case, we needed double coset separability to get that case, but there was one sort of bad case that was causing problems, and we needed a stronger separability result for that. So this is the separability result we needed. It's almost like double coset separability, but it's a little bit stronger. You still have your two. Stronger. You still have your two maximal parabolic subgroups, H and K. And then you have an element G such that K is disjoint from every conjugate of the coset GH. I'm going to show you a picture in a minute. But if that's true, then you can preserve that in a finite quotient. So not exactly a separability result. Well, I mean, it's related. So you have things that are disjoint in the That are disjoint in the group, and you want them to be disjoint in a finite quotient. So, let me show you the geometric picture for that. This is a geometric interpretation of that separability result. And this is what we needed to do. And so that's why we needed to look at that theorem. Okay, so remember we have our two maximal parabolic subgroups, H and K, and then we have this element G. We have this element G. Which one is it? H is going to be the stabilizer of that horrible, B tilde, and then K is not pictured. So just imagine it. It's another parabolic subgroup somewhere. So we're interested in the coset GH because those are the elements in the group which take B tilde to G of B tilde. So we have this geodesic arc, beta tilde, between those two. Beta tilde between those two horror balls, and that projects to an arc in the manifold. We needed a finite cover where K lifts. So that cusp had to just lift. It's not shown. But we wanted every lift of beta to connect distinct cusps. So we needed that, and the subgroup separability result guarantees that. Separability result guarantees that. So, I would say, in general, subgroup separability is useful when you're trying to build a cover that does something very specific. And so feel free to contact me if you're trying to build a cover that does something because that's how I got involved in this project and it was a lot of fun. Okay, so I gave two examples. I gave two examples of how you would use subgroup separability to prove something geometric. And now I want to talk a little bit about how you might prove that groups are separable or how I often attack them. Okay, so the main thing that I've used is congruence quotients. So you have your, right now we're looking at a hyperbolic pre-manifold, a finite volume. Hyperbolic pre-manifold of finite volume. We know that there's a representation into PSL2C that lifts up, I mean, PSL2C that lifts up into SL2C. And you can, you have a finitely generated group, so you have finitely many matrices, and you can look at all their coefficients and form the coefficient ring. And you can conjugate your group so that that ring is a finitely generated ring and it lives in a number field, which is a Lives in a number field, which is a finite extension of Q. So you have a finitely generated ring in a number field. If you can get a ring homomorphism from the ring into a finite ring or a finite field, then that's going to induce a group homomorphism from gamma into this finite group SL2A bar. And we call something like that a congruence quotient. And you can use results from You can use results from algebraic number theory. I like the way this conference has had a number theory theme. I think it's been mentioned in multiple talks. So you can use results from algebraic number theory to construct the ring homomorphisms and to get your finite quotients. So I was going to give an example of this. I'm going to give a kind of this, the simplest example you could look at. Let's look at a cyclic subgroup. So suppose we're going Look at a cyclic subgroup. So, suppose we have a closed hyperbolic three-manifold and we have a cyclic subgroup, and we want to show that it's separable. So, my cyclic subgroup is generated by H to the N. I wrote it that way because H is generating the maximal cyclic subgroup in gamma. So, I have a maximal cyclic subgroup. The one I'm interested in is generated by H to the N. H to the n. And I'm going to assume right now that it's loxidromic. I take an element outside of it, and I need to map into a finite group where G stays outside of H. Well, we already know that maximal abelian subgroups are separable. And so if G lies outside the maximal cyclic subgroup, then we're done. So you can assume that you have this situation over here. So H is So H is generated by this matrix, and then G looks like that. And since G is not in H, N does not divide M. So you grab an eigenvalue. The eigenvalue, lambda, is not a root of unity. And so you can prove that if you take a finitely generated ring in a number field and you have an element that's not a root of unity, then you can map into Then you can map into a finite ring, actually a finite field, where you can kind of control the order of that element. So you can show that it's divisible by n. You can even hit an order on the nose if you make it big enough. So like there's some integer where if you want your order bigger than that, you can always get it on the nose. And you can use results from algebraic number theory to show this, like the Chevatar. Number theory to show this, like the Chebotov density theorem. And then you look at that congruence quotient, then you're guaranteed that the image of G is not in the image of H. So I'm saying that I'm looking at the multiplicative order of the eigenvalue because that determines the order of the element in the group. And I'm saying it's divisible by n, so it's going to be this nb right here. And so if it's And so, if G did land in H, then you would get this congruence, which would imply that N divided M, which is a contradiction. So, if you want to look at subgroup separability of a cyclic group, you really just want to control the multiplicative order of an eigenvalue, and you can do that. Okay, parabolics are always Are always causing a little bit of trouble. So now let's look at a cyclic subgroup generated by a parabolic isometry. So in this case, I'm going to assume maybe little h just looks like 1101. So you can conjugate your group. Conjugate your group so that it looks like that. And just I'm just picking a random example. So suppose my subgroup is cyclic. So suppose it's generated by 1,501. And then my element, little g is 1,701. So it's outside of that. I want to separate them in a finite quotient. So I don't know, maybe you can see the problem here. You could try the strategy that we try with the loxodromic elements. Loxodromic elements. If you could find a group homomorphism into a finite group where the order of the image of H was divisible by 5, then the same argument would work. But the problem here is that while with the loxidromic elements, the order was determined by the multiplicative order of the eigenvalue. For the parabolic elements, the order is determined by the eigenvalues. Elements, the order is determined by that additive order of one. Because when you keep adding this, you get multiplying the matrices, you get adding this entry here. And so the order is going to be determined by the, if you're mapping into a finite field, it's going to be determined by the characteristic of that field. So, and I may not be able to, you know, send it to Z, send the coefficient ring to Z mod 5Z because 5 may be a unit. Because five may be a unit, one-fifth may be in my coefficient ring. So the congruence quotients aren't really going to work in the same way. So you need a kind of a new idea, and the idea here is to use Dane surgery. So Dane, the parabolics were causing trouble because their orders were determined by the characteristic, but you can. were determined by the characteristic, which you can't necessarily control. So you can use Dane filling on the cusp, which will send your parabolic element to a loxodromic element. And then you can do what we did in the first case. And so you can look at the composition. So you go from your original group into the fundamental group of the filled manifold. And then you can send that element to sort of different orders. And then you can look at the compositions. And then you can look at the composition to prove that it's separable. So let's see, I have a question I want to ask you guys. I think I'll just spend a couple minutes just saying a tiny bit about double cosets. Okay, so for the result with Dave and Neil, we needed. With Dave and Neil, we needed subgroup separability of double cosets of abelian subgroups. So if you look at an abelian subgroup in a cusp hyperbolic three-manifold, you have sort of two types. You have the cyclic ones generated by loctodromic elements, or you have parabolic ones. This is the maximal parabolic one. And so it's going to look like this. So this would be generated by 1101 and 1t. And 1t01. And so the coefficient sort of right up here would be in this set. So this is just a set. And so there are different cases for double cosets. The hardest one is parabolic-parabolic. So you conjugate everything simultaneously, you conjugate so that your parabolic subgroups have the nicest form possible. This form possible. So you can conjugate where H has that upper triangular form and then K has this lower triangular form. And then you can just write down what the double coset looks like. So there's your double coset where R is in the set R and S is in the set S. So you want to show that that's separable. You take an element outside of it. You can assume that this element right here. This element right here is one, because if it wasn't one, then it's easy to separate. You would just find a congruence quotient where it remained not equal to one and you've separated them. And so that's going to force G to have that form. So there's your element G, there's your double coset. And so since G is not in the double coset, that means that B is not in R, that set R, or C over Or C over V is not in the set S. So we're going to assume that we're in the first case. We're going to assume that B is not in R. So there's this strategy then. Maybe you can find a ring homomorphism into a finite ring where B remains not in R. So if you could do that, then you're done. You've separated them. The problem is. The problem is that that's not true. The parabolics often sort of cause trouble, so that's not true. So it would be nice if you could show a result like that, the result with the asterisk, but it's not true in general. The loxodromic case was nicer, so this was the sort of result that we needed for the loxodromic case. Speak over that. However, something sort of stronger. Something sort of stronger is true. So, if your element lies outside this bigger set where the coefficients are in Q but not in Z, then you can apply that strategy and you're done. And so you end up with these troublesome cases like this, an element like that, where there's actually no way to separate that out in a congruence quotient. Because one-third is in there, it's going to have to go to something that's a unit. To go to something that's a unit in Z mod NZ or wherever you go, and so you're not really not going to be able to separate that outside of your coset. So again, you have to use Dane surgery and you're sort of in a particularly, you know something about G because you're in the case where you can't use this theorem up here. So you have sort of specific information about your element and you can combine that with. And you can combine that with Dane filling to take like a combination of maps that work. So, in general, to prove these results, I kind of use results from algebraic number theory combined with congruence quotients and Dane filling. I have a sort of a question for you guys. I've been looking at double cosets in higher dimensions. In higher dimensions. So if you take a double, if you take now a finite volume hyperbolic n manifold, say where n is greater than or equal to four, you can show that double cosets of loxodromic elements are separable, but I'm having trouble making progress on the parabolics. And you need to get off the ground and need some result that says that I can sort of. I can sort of map into a finite group where I can control the order of the image of my parabolic element. And the problem is that we don't have the Dane filling. In dimension three, we had, say, our parabolic element. Eigenvalues are equal to one. Congruence quotients aren't really working, but I was able to sort of map over into. Able to sort of map over into another linear group. I was using stain filling, so I was still mapping into SL2C. And so gamma was going over here, and my parabolic element suddenly went to, or something similar to it, suddenly went to a loxodromic element. And then from here, I can map into a finite group and control the by controlling the eigenvalue. The um by controlling the eigenvalue, I can control the image of the element. Um, the problem now is in higher dimensions. So, in higher dimensions, you now have this element where all the eigenvalues are equal to one. And I want, so I have a uniform, I have this element and I want to map it into any linear group. So, it doesn't, I don't need a discrete or faithful representation. I want to map into any linear group where my elements, my unipon. My elements, my unipotent element, is going to something with one eigenvalue that's not a root of unity. That's sort of all I'm asking. And it's sort of hard to, like, you can't look in the world of algebraic groups because they'll send unipotent elements to unipotent elements. So you need something geometric. In three dimensions, we had Dane surgery. There are analogs of Dane surgery in higher dimensions, but they don't necessarily send you into a linear group. Necessarily send you into a linear group. So, if anybody, I know at some of the earlier talks, we were talking about deformation spaces. So, if anybody has any ideas, please let me know. So, that's it. Thank you. So, what what's it about I think we should bring this up? I think we should bring this up to be able to get how they're all worth yeah they're all they're all residually finite any finitely generated linear group is going to be yeah residually finite and then I've I've looked at like double cosets of like loxodromic elements they're residually Loxodromic elements, they're residually finite. You can show that the cyclic, the cyclic subgroups generated by laxodromic elements are separate. Well, there are any other question. What do you think about these conjectures about the existence of I don't think there's a lot of evidence for that necessarily other than our result but we thought we thought that so we kind of we posed that that conjecture in our paper and we thought that searching for like infinitely many and For, like, infinitely many and flexible geometric triangulations might help you find a root to one if you have to run one of them at least. I don't so, are there concrete examples where it's not known that it's well it's not known in general. I mean, is there a specific so so so so if I gave you So so so so if I gave you like a custom you can be able to practice the triangulation um I'm not sure about that. I mean I think if I could answer if there's like there's no known algorithms um I'm not I'm not sure. Which is the problem in the Epstein-Penner paper? Problem with their construction or? Yes. They give the polyhedral decomposition, so that's fine. But you can't necessarily subdivide them into tetrahedral. subdivide them into tetrahedra. So their paper, they're not breaking it up into tetrahedra. They're breaking it up into the poly. Any other question If not, let's thank the speaker again.
