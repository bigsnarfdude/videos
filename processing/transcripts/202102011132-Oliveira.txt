And so let me start by reminding how monopoles came around with in Monopoles came around with in the 30s when Dirac supposed the existence of a magnetic monopole charge and realized that implied that the product of the electric charge and the magnetic charge were to be quantized. Nowadays, we can interpret these as the monopole charge, the degree being an integer, but But later that was a U1 monopole, so an abelian monopole. And we have since then been interested in working with monopoles with non-abelian gauge groups. And so let me tell you what one would try to think of as being a monopole. So it would be a time-independent finite energy solution to the classical fields equations, which both exhibit bit symmetry breaking. Exhibit bit symmetry breaking at infinity, so we could restate this as saying that it's asymptotically reducible, and the asymptotic behavior of this solution to the monopole equations are asymptotic to the magnetic field generated by a magnetic monopole. So, in generalizing to eigen dimensions, we would need a pair of groups, H. A pair of groups H and G, so G, the gauge group, and H the subgroup to which it reduces at infinity, and a non-compact manifold with a suitable end to end the PDE, such that the solutions of the PD in this non-compact manifold at infinity are asymptotically reducible and resemble a magnetic mono. A magnetic monopole. Okay, so this would lead you to a monopole charge, which are a motopy types of maps from this asymptotic boundary to the coset G mod H. And for example, if G is SU2 and H is equal to U1, then of course there is a map from these homotopy classes to the second cohomology. The second cohomology, which is which simply does, what this map does is to pull back the generator of the second homology of the sphere to the boundary. So this map is the pullback of the generator of the second homology here to here. Okay, so remember this degree two cohomology class, it will appear later. So, but the point I'm talking about So, but the point and all, let's try and find these PDEs that I'm mentioning here, which will generalize monopoles to eigenvention. And the key to find them now is this word here, time independent. Time independent, we also refer to it sometimes as dimensional reduction. So what we are going to do is pick some equations in some higher-dimensional manifold, then start dimensional reduce. So, in order to do that, I'm going to fix. So in order to do that, I'm going to fix an homogeneous space M. That's the thing I'm going to do reduction on. And a bundle, an n-bundle over an n-dimensional manifold M. Okay, so M is the manifold on which we want to define our monopole equations. And X is going to be the big manifold where we have some other equations which are going to reduce. And we are going to reduce along M. Okay, so that's why I want. n. Okay, so that's why I want n to be an homogeneous space. So I have a notion of being constant along it. So the equation that I'm going to reduce is the generalized instanton equation and for that I need to fix a degree n plus k minus four differential form, which I suppose is a calibration on x here. Here. You may want to suppose it is a calibration, but it's not necessary. You can just think of this as a degree n plus k minus 4 form. So these maps, this gives you a map which wedges with psi and takes the odd star from the two forms to the two forms. So if you pick a two form and you wedge with psi, you have a n plus k minus two form. Then you take the odd star, you have a two form again. And what you need is that this s minus one. And what you need is that this is minus one as an eigenvalue. Okay, so there are several settings when that is true. And now let's pick a connection, nabla A, on a bundle in X which comes back from pulling back something from M. And we are going to write that connection as the sum of a connection which is pulled back from M also and a vertical part, a vertical one form. Part, a vertical one form with values in the adjoint bundle. Okay, so that's so this part is supposed to be vertical, so lambda one in the kernel of pi star. Okay, and we are going to do dimensional reduction of the instanton equation, this generalized instanton equation. So you ask that the curvature of the connection nabla A be in the minus one eigenspace of this operator. So this is um So this is a way to generalize the instanton equation and you impose invariance along m and you get an equation for nabla and phi down in m. Okay, so this is the procedure we are going to do. And so I'm going to tell you now a list of equations that you get. It's not exhaustive from this procedure, just to give some examples. And I will introduce a bit of notation in doing that. So don't Notation in doing that. So don't get lost. Don't worry if you get lost in the notation, because in the end, what I'm going to do is to pick one of those equations, restate it again, and we will stay the rest of the lecture studying that equation. Okay? So the first example is to start with n plus k. So this is the most standard example: is to pick n plus k equal to 8 and decide the 4 form which has stabilizer spin 7. It's a specific. It's a specific type of four form. But this is not exhaustive. You can do this with many other examples of n plus k equal to any even number, at least you can find examples of forms that you can pick to do the reductions like this. So in this example, I'm going to pick m equal to r and I'm going to take the product of r with m7 and m M7 and M7, this seven-dimensional manifold, I'm going to suppose it as a G2 structure. You can think of that just as a three-form phi. If you don't know what a G2 structure is, think of it just for now as a three-form which has some properties. And then the psi is dt h phi plus dH star of phi. So if phi is a three form, if phi here is a three form, then star phi is a four form in seven dimensions. form in seven dimensions and the connection I'm going to write it as before a connection on M plus the T times phi where phi is a section of the adjoint bundle is the X field and then you do you look for solutions of that equation and you get this type this monopole type equation which is called the G2 monopole equation or because Sergei Cherkis is here and he would want me to call it octanionic Would want me to call it octanionic monopole equation. I'm going to also call it octanionic monopole equation. So, what you do is that you take the covariant derivative of phi, that's a one form, you take the odd star, that's a six form, and you require that that is equal to the f wedge star phi. So recall that star phi is a four form, and f is a two form, so you get here the six form also. Everything with values in the adjoint bundle. So, that's the G2 monopoly equation. Monopoly equation. And another example you could do is to pick M not R, but R2. And M now is six-dimensional. And it has an SU3 structure. And if you don't know what that is, think of it as a two-form, little omega, and a complex-valued three-form, capital Omega. And you write psi in this way. So it's dt1d2 wedge little omega. wedge little omega plus dt1 times the real part of the capital omega minus dt2 wedge the imaginary part of capital omega plus omega square and now you write the connection not just as nabla plus dt one times phi one but also you have another guy here from the d2 dt2 component and i'm going to put these two phi's phi one and phi two together into a complex valued field which is phi Valued field, which is phi 1 minus i phi 2. So there is here the typo, this should be phi 2. Okay, and then you do the dimensional reduction, and you get this set of equations. So here, lambda f means the lambda is the dual of wedging with phi. Okay, so lambda brings a two-form to a zero form. And lambda f is equal to basically phi commutator phi bar, and then you have bar and then you have the del bar A which is the zero one type so this SS3 structure gives you a complex structure in your manifold an almost complex structure and del A bar is basically the covariant derivative of phi with respect to the connection nabla and I should have written nabla not A and then you take the 01 component of that and that is related to the 0 That and that is related to the zero two component of the curvature via this equation. And this equation can be usually is usually called, or I've called it, the Calabiel monopole equation, but it can also be recast in a different way into something called the DT instanton equation. And those have been investigated by Yushitanaka mostly and jointly by Gavin Ball and myself. So, another example is to come down to four dimensions with an SU2 structure, which is basically a triple of two forms satisfying some conditions. You can think, for example, this is giving an hypercaler structure. And yet, now you write the connection as the sum of nabla plus the dti's phi i's, and again you get. eyes and again you get that you get some equation like this the the component of the curvature which lies along the Kayler form omega i is given by these commutators and then you have this sort of it's it's sort of um quaternionic version of the of the Cauchy Riemann equations these Ii s are almost complex structures induced by each omega i. Structures induced by each omega i. Okay, so you obtain that equation. And again, this thing as written is not what is usually called the Waffa-Witten equation, but it can be recast as if it is. And just to give you an example, which is not a product, so these equations, there are conjectural relations between some of these dimensional reductions. There is a paper of Sergei Cherkis about it. And I think Benoit Shaboneau and Sergei Sherkis have joint work in progress. Sergei Sherkis have joint work in progress intowards that. And Sichi, he also mentioned to me some things related to this. I don't know if they have been already done or not. So to give you an example, which is not a product example, let me mention the case when M is the product of S3 times R. So now I don't have an R3 here, I have an S3, and I'm also going. Here, I have an S3, and I'm also going to suppose that N, I have an N bundle over M is not just a product, and I'm going to do reduction on N. So, if I have an N bundle over M, then that bundle has some curvature coming from this S3 component. And that curvature gives me a bunch of two forms. So, this is basically the self-dual part of that curvature. Of that curvature. But just remember that there is the curvature of this bundle gives you some forms, and some two forms, and I'll call them alpha i. And then you can modify the previous equation by including these two terms over here. So this first term, this phi i, comes from the fact that I have s3 and not r3. And then there is here some other term, which is given by the curvature of the. Of the bundle. Okay, so it gives you an algebraic modification of these equations here. Okay, so this is. And there are many other, as I said, I'm going to stop giving examples now, and I'll just pick one and talk about it. But there are many other things you can do, and many other examples you can take, and many other equations you can think about. But I'm going to pick one of these equations, the G2 monopole equation, the first one I presented, and then The first one I presented, and I'm going to show you that it satisfies some of these requirements I've asked in the first slide. So let me just go back quickly to the first slide to remind you. So these requirements of exhibiting symmetry breaking at infinity and being asymptotic to a magnetic monopole H field, I'm going to show you that under certain conditions, the G2 monopole equation satisfies those requirements. Okay, so let's recall what a G2 monopole is. So I have a G2 monopole is. So I have a pair consisting of a connection and the Nix field on a seven-dimensional manifold with a G2 structure, so which is a three-form. So this is a three-form in seven dimensions. Its H star is a four-form in seven dimensions. And this is the G2 monopole equation. Okay, so in this case, we can look at the Young-Mills X energy with no potential, just the L2 norm of the curvature and the covariant derivative of the X field. The covariant derivative of the X field, and doing an integration by parts, if you can do it, you can rewrite it in this manner here. Okay, so you have here a term using F wedge F, here you have a boundary term, and here you have the error from being a monopole, the ultra-norm of the error of not being a monopole. Okay, so for example, if you had no boundary, then this term. You have no boundary, then this term would vanish. And let's say that you have no boundary and phi is closed. So this little phi is closed. Then this first term here is basically the second character of your bundle or the first quantiagonic class if you have a real bundle with cap the cohomology class of phi. So this would be a topological quantity determined by the bundle and the three form phi. And so you would have this topological quantity here, this would be zero, and this guy here would be greater or equal than zero and would vanish exactly if you had a monopole. And this would prove that monopoles minimize this energy. So this would be a sort of a version of the Bogomoni trick in 4G2 monopoles. But of course, I'm interested in the case when M is non- Let me just mention that studying these equations on compact manifolds may be an interesting thing to do, and there is virtually no work on that. So, if you want to try to think of studying this equation on a manifold with a closed G2 structure, then you would be the first one, maybe. Okay, so except I say here with nabla phi different from zero because if nabla phi is zero, If nabul phi is zero, then there is an equation that you obtain here, which is called the G2 instanton equation, which has been studied. So, if Nablifi, if you're on a compact manifold, is it clear there will be a solution with Nablifi not zero? Well, if star phi is not closed, then there is no reason for the covalent. Reason for the covariant derivative for phi to be for the norm square of phi to be subharmonic. Okay, what Derek is thinking is that if you differentiate this equation and if star phi would be you guys can see when I underline? Yeah? And if star phi was to be closed, then you could take an exterior derivative of this equation, a covariant exterior derivative, and you would prove that phi and you would prove that phi is covariantly harmonic and that implies that the norm square of phi is subharmonic and and therefore you would on a compact manifold you would never have that nabla phi is different from zero but if if star phi is is not closed then you cannot you cannot do that so there is potentially there could be solutions to this equation Solutions to this equation on compact manifolds with a closed G2 structure which have naplified different from zero. Okay, so and this equation is elliptic up to gauge. So I did not mention that, but that's also true. Okay, so but when M is non-compact, which coming from the generalizing monopoles point of view would be the natural case, it's easy. Be the natural case, it easily happens that this Young-Mills X energy is infinite. So maybe instead of working with this Young-Mills energy, we work with something else, which I'll just call EI. The I stands for intermediate. And instead of looking at the full square norm of the curvature, what you do is that you wedge the curvature with star phi. And that kills some components of the curvature. And that kills some components of the curvature. And by killing those components of the curvature, you get a smaller quantity here. And this quantity turns out in examples, this quantity is in general finite, even when the other one is infinite. But I'll mention those examples later. And again, suppose you could integrate by parts. Now, you don't obtain the other term that we had in the previous slide, but you would obtain this boundary term here. And you obtain again. And you obtain again the error from being a monopole. And supposing that you could have done this integration by parts and that the first term here was a topological quantity, then this same computation would prove that monopoles minimize this intermediate energy. But you may wonder when does it happen that you can actually carry out this computation and do this integration by parts? Computation and do this integration by parts and obtain that this first term is a topological quantity. And it turns out that a situation where this happens is also a situation where there is a symptotic symmetry breaking and the monopole at infinity looks like the monopole produced by a sorry, the magnetic field produced by a monopole field. Okay, so that situation is So, in that situation is, so let's go and see what that situation is. So, now I'm going to suppose that my seven-dimensional manifold has holonomy. Oh, by the way, is there any question other than Derek's question? Or Derek, if you have another question, of course. If there are questions, you can just interrupt me. Okay. So, let us consider the case when M as the case when M has allonomy G2. In this situation, both phi and star phi are closed and the volume growth of a geodesic ball of radius R centered at some point grows in between R and R to the seven. It's bounded below by these two polynomial volume growths of R and R to the seven. These follow from Bishop Gramo's own comparison. Grammo zone comparison, both of them, the upper and the lower bound, surprisingly. So let us consider one of these cases when the volume grows polynomially, like R to the L. And remember that L is some number between one and seven. Then in the case when L is greater than seven halves and the intermediate energy is finite, Energy is finite, and this component of the curvature is bounded. It turns out that if you look at the limit of the norm of the X field as you go off to infinity, this is well defined in this constant. So this thing gives you a constant at infinity. It doesn't vary depending on the direction on which you go after infinity. It is the same constant. And this constant is called a mass. And this constant is called the mass. So that is the first result. So these results are by Daniel Fadell and Dako Schnogg in collaboration with me. And now suppose another case, more strict case, when L is exactly equal to seven, so the maximal possible volume growth that you have, that the intermediate energy is finite, and now you suppose that the this component of the curvature decays. component of the curvature decays. Then the X, the connection and the X field are asymptotic to some model at infinity which satisfies some equation called the pseudo-Romiching-Niels equation. And it turns out that this asymptotic Higgs field is parallel with respect to the asymptotic connection. Okay, so yeah. Yes, Mark. Can you remind me of the Can you remind me of the assumptions on the growth of fee to begin with? There are no assumptions on the growth of fee. All right. Okay, thank you. Yeah. So this asymptotic X field phi infinity is covariantly is covariantly parallel. Parallel. So this justifies the first thing I mentioned: that your monopoles are asymptotically reducible. They have a symmetry breaking at infinity. And the second part says that the covariance derivative of the Higgs field goes like r to the minus six. And this is the part that tells you that it looks like the magnetic field generated by Generated by a monopole particle in seven dimensions. And then it further says that the other components of the X field that are perpendicular to itself decay exponentially. This is analogous also to what happens in three dimensions for a monopoly. And the important corollaries of this result is that under the conditions of this second theorem, you have This second theorem, you have a good Fredon theory for monopoles, so you can talk about moduli spaces. And the second important corollary is that you can carry out that integration by parts I mentioned in the previous page. And G2 monopoles do minimize the intermediate energy. Okay, so before I continue, are there questions? So, but basically the takeaway message is that these G2 manifolds with maximal volume growth and the G2 monopole equation on them, they have the same properties that monopoles in R3 have, those same defining properties of monopoles in R3. So, I can say that this is a generalization of the monopole equation to Eiger dimensions, even that there. Eiger dimensions, even that is the title of my talk. About the other equations I mentioned in the beginning, the Calabia monopole equation, I expect something like this to happen. The other ones, I don't know. Okay, so I'll go on to the next slide. So the next slide comes back a little bit to this first theorem. Let me just Bit to this first theorem, let me just recall that there is this mass, the asymptotic value of the X field, and this mass is a non-negative parameter, and you may ask what happens when you move this mass, when this mass changes. And the way you should think of monopoles is that, so I mentioned previously in passing that in this situation, the norm square of the X field is subharmonic. Siege is subharmonic. So you have a subharmonic function that goes to a constant at infinity. And you are trying to minimize the young-mill, the intermediate energy, which involves the covariance derivative of the X-field, its norm square. So we are trying to minimize the L2 norm of the X-field, of the covariant derivative of the X-field, but it needs to go to a cost. but it needs to go to a constant at infinity. But for some topological reason, it may have to come down to zero. Suppose that your bundle does not split off a factor, then it will have to have a zero somewhere. But it will try to do it in the way that consumes the least amount of energy. So it will try to come to zero in the way that perturbs the energy the least. And in the next slide, I'm going to try to convince you that as you increase the mass, then this energy should This energy should increase, right? Because it gotta come more to zero. It has a bigger distance to come down to zero, so that covariant derivative will be bigger at some point. And it will try to do it in a very small amount of space. And you will obtain in the limit a minimal sub-manifold called a co-associative sub-manifold, the manifold that minimizes volume. Um, volume. Oh, thank you, Marksten. This is the last thing of this slide for having taught us the techniques we used in proving at least for sure all the second theorem. Okay, so changing the mass and relations with co-socitives. So, in this slide, suppose that the G, the gauge group is SU2 and DM by. Dm bar, so this asymptotic boundary is going to be the link of the cone to which this G2 manifold is asymptotic to. So this G2 manifold is growing like a cone, and the link of that cone is going to be this DM bar. And because the monopole is asymptotically reducible, it is going to be reducible to a complex line bundle over this link. And L is going to be that complex line bundle. That complex line bundle. Okay, so that complex line bundle determines a charge, which is a degree two homology class of this DM bar. Let's call it monopole class. And that first term in the integration by parts is this topological quantity given here, written here, which depends on that monopole charge. And you have this extra term here, which vanishes for a monopole. And you can see that as the mass increases, this energy is going to increase linearly. And the Higgs field will try to come down to zero in the way to penalize the least the energy. And it is going to do it along what is called a co-associative sub-manifold, which is a very special kind of area-minimizing sub-manifold. So that's what I wrote here. As the mass goes to infinity, we expect G tomal. Goes to infinity, we expect G2 monopoles with monopole plus alpha to concentrate on a collection of co-associative submanifolds, of compact co-associative submanifolds, whose cohomology class, the Poncagé dual of their homology classes, is related to the monopole charge alpha in a certain way. So if you pick these long exact sequence in cohomology, Sequence in cohomology, you pick here in H2 the monopole charge, you map it to H3 compactly supported via this map I, and you ask that the co-associatives on which your monopole concentrate are related to that class alpha. So, this is the expectation. This is mostly conjectural, but there is good progress by Danielfa-Well and Mit. By Danielle Fadell and me to prove parts of this conjecture. And there is a similar story for monopoles on Calabiel manifolds and special Lagrangians. So, but now in the next slide, I'll try to give you some evidence that this is true, that this picture here about co-associatives and monopoles with mass going up to infinity is true. And that is, so that is a theorem, is a result that of an example. A result that of an example. So there are examples of two of these G2 manifolds, which contain only one compact co-setive submanifold. So they contain only one compact cost-occitive submanifold, and they have a lot of symmetries. And I'm going to use those symmetries to talk about the moduli space of monopoles, which is invariant under those symmetries. So these are finite mass invariant monopoles, irreducible monopoles that are invariant. Irreducible monopoles that are invariant under those symmetries, quotient out by the relevant symmetry of invariant gauge transformations. And the result says that for all monopoles in the so first of all, this moduli space is non-empty, and for all monopoles in there, the zero set of the X field is this co-sociative submanifold. And furthermore, there is a bio. And furthermore, there is a bijection between the modulus vessels invariant monopoles and the positive real numbers, which is given by the mass. So for each mass, there is only one monopole. That's the Turkoway message. There was also only one compact co-successive sub-manifold. There was only one compact co-solitive sub-manifold, and there is also only one monopole with each given mass. And what happens when you send the mass? And what happens when you send the mass up to infinity? So, if you pick a sequence of monopoles whose mass goes up to infinity, then after appropriate rescalings, there is a monopole on R3 that bubbles off in the transverse directions to this co-source semanifold. So, these co-sources semanifolds are four-dimensional, so they have co-dimensions three, and in the transverse directions, you see a BPS monopole bubbling off, and they are. And then let me jump 2. 2 is not too important. And I'll go to 4. If you look at the energy density of these monopoles and you divide by m, the mass, remember that the total intermediate energy was proportional to m. So if you divide by m, you have this thing is bounded independently of m. That converges as a current to 4 pi times the delta current associated with this cost-osity. Current associated with this co-sociative plus some E infinity, which in these examples vanishes, but may be different from zero in other cases. So I left it here, but in these examples it vanishes. And an important question is to ask if these are general phenomena or not. Now, there is also examples of these G2 manifolds, which you have no G2 manifolds, which have no compact co-source manifolds. And in that case, you can prove that there are also no finite mass monopoles. So if you have no compact cost manifolds, you also have no finite mass monopoles. And there are similar results for Calabian monopoles, like this theorem and like this vanishing here. Vanishing here. Even though this vanishing here requires some work that we have done for G2 monopoles that in the Calabio case should also follow, but it's maybe not written nicely in the literature. Okay, so thank you for your attention. I was super fast. Thank you, Gonzalo. Thank you, Gonzalu. Questions? I should have gone slower, sorry. Okay, so maybe the first question is: so, when you mentioned this, delta phi converges to delta infinity, phi infinity at your infinity, do you mean convergence smoothly or do you mean more? This is a scalar. This is weak convergent as current. I mean, sorry, the previous slide, I think. Oh, so. slide I think. Oh sorry what sorry sorry. So your theorem about if f which star phi is the case then you said there's some kind of convergence result to pseudo Hermitian. Yeah so so in this case so you you have an asymptotically conical manifold okay right and so it you have the link of the asymptotic cone and you have the link of and you have Link of, and you have these slices you can restrict to each level of as you go off along the cone. Okay, so if you pick those restrictions there, that depends on the distance, on the radius, that uniformly converges to these models with all derivatives. So, this is uniform convergence with all derivatives. Well, that's a bit surprising to me because if you forget about Hicksfield, just talk about Yamiels. Typically, you have a singular set, possibly with a measure constant. Oh, but the curvature is bounded in C0, not just in L2. But I mean, you are in a high-dimension case, right? So the curvature bounds. But there is, but the curvature is not constant. The curvature is not controlled just in L2. If the curvature was controlled in L2, if you had control on the curvature in L2 only, and you take the limit, then you would have a singular set which has co-dimensional 4 by Ullenbeck. But you couldn't do better than that, because you have more control on the curvature. But I don't think you have more control on the curvature. I mean, your assumption doesn't assume a curvature are infinity bound, right? You don't assume that. But you obtain more. But you obtain more control on the curvature. We obtain very, very fine control on the curvature. But suppose I'm just working with R7 and suppose this phi actually vanishes. Then I'm just working with a G2 instanton on R7 and I don't think you can. But no, because G2 instanton is different because then this guy here vanishes, right? Yes. So is that not a special? So, is that not a special case of yours? Well, I mean, a G3 incentor R7 has no reason to have bounded curvature, right? I mean, you agree with that. But it will not have finite energy. Yeah. No, it will have zero. It will have zero in this case. So it is more than normalized energy. Okay, no, that's fine. Uh maybe the second question. So uh you expect concentration near a colour sensitive, but uh do you expect to wrote the result incorrectly. It's not F13 decay. It's not F watch F decays. Um it's F14, but I when I was changing the slides yesterday, I made a mistake because I didn't want to talk about F14. Because I didn't want to talk about F14, so I inserted this. So, this hypothesis here, it's wrong. It's F14 that decays. So, that is very strong. So, in the instanton case, that would tell you that it's flat, basically, the limited infinity. You see, Young? So it's not the F7 part. I mean, I thought. No, no, I'm sorry. This is I understand your doubt is because I stated this incorrectly. I stated this incorrectly. In fact, the whole curvature decays quadratically in this case because the energy is finite. Yeah. Okay, then. Okay. Other questions? Well, I guess the second thing is, so you said concentration near co-assetive, but when you say co-assative, so So, I mean, there's a difference between co-sensitive rectifiable current and kind of like interval currents. So, the difference is if you know the boundary actually vanishes. So, obviously, you're talking about a situation where this thing can define a homology class. So, you must have some kind of a priori argument about this thing being closed. Yeah, so. Yeah, so I don't have proofs of this, but I do expect it to be an integral current, an integral rectifiable current. Well, there are some intermediate results in that direction in the Niel-Fadel thesis. But probably not the rectifiability part there. Is it there in your thesis, the rectifiability part? Yeah, but I assume some technical hypotheses for, I mean, that work for the existing examples that we constructed on Brand-Salamon manifolds. So, yeah, yes. But In general, but yes, young, so the point, the point, this is conjectural, this thing here. But if you want to make the conjecture precise, you can put integrable rectifiable co-sositive currents. Okay, so another thing is about the reasonableness of your Is about the reasonableness of your assumption. So you seem to say that this whole energy is bounded, but that seems to me to be not a natural condition for general non-compact case. Because usually... So for instance, for G2 instantons, you can't have that, right? I mean, if that's true. No, for G2 instantons, that is zero. Yeah, that's what I mean, right? So well, you. Well, you it's for G2 isy domes that is zero, but if you like better some other asymptotic condition, so in the suppose L is seven here, then it turns out that these two conditions here, that the intermediate energy being finite and F14 being bounded, I incorrectly wrote it here, F wedge star phi. Is equivalent to the existence of this M. So if you prefer the M, this finite mass, that is another asymptotic condition that you can write down and it is equivalent to these two. Right, but typically what what I regard as a kind of A kind of typical asymptotic condition would be something like a conical connection. That is more restrictive, I guess, right? If you suppose there is a but that is also what I do in my thesis, actually. If you suppose that there is a model connection at infinity, if you suppose the result of this theorem, basically, that is what I do in my thesis. If you suppose the existence, well, okay, so let's say suppose you have an asymptotic conical setup. Normally, the curvature decays quadratically, at least in typical cases. But if that's the case, then this curvature integral tends to be infinite, usually. No, so let me say that. So if you assume that you have not lined infinity and phi infinity, infinity and phi infinity. And then these all hold automatically. And yes, the energy is infinite, by the intermediate energy you can prove is finite. And the argument is actually quite simple. In this case, is the intermediate energy the L2 energy of the gradient of phi? Yes. Okay. Yeah. So it's basically, you can suppose you take a cutoff function which vanishes r, a distance r away from some interior point. You integrate that against the covariant derivative of the Ixield square. You can integrate by parts, obviously, because you have this cutoff function. And you get the Laplacian on the cutoff. And then you can. And then you can use the bounds on the cutoff, you can make it vanish in a way that you get an R-independent upper bound on this. And that proves that the L2 norm of the covariant derivative of the X-field is finite. Sorry to interrupt for a second, that this discussion seems pretty good for the longer discussion format for the afternoon. For the afternoon, uh, but since we're recording now and there's another talk soon, uh, let me ask if there's any other uh short questions, and please please do continue later on in the discussion section. But it seems like there's more to talk than just a couple of minutes here. If there are no other questions, uh, then let's thank uh Gonzalo once more. Thank you. And our second talk for the afternoon session will begin.
