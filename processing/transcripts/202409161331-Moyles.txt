That being said, I'm starting with operation. This is what, this is like a classic SIR model, okay, which hopefully everyone has either seen and or heard of. And why I want to bring this up in the context of why I think this is the importance of behavior, the way mathematicians think about it, is that if you focus on this one, these dots are saying brains are changed. So this is an infection, so cell infectious recovery. Recovery. The amount my infection is going to change is something. And this thing in here is often called a reproduction number, which is probably a determiner's word. And so you can see if it's bigger than one, this thing's a positive thing, so affections grow. If it's less than one, they decay. That's why this is such an important thing. Okay, so this reproduction number appears everywhere in this basic model. It's the transmission coefficient, theta, times. Times the number of people who are susceptible divided by how fast I recovered. And if you think about recovery rates as inverses, like recovery times, it's like how many people can get infected times how fast they get infected times how fast they're infectious. How long the infectious gives you an idea if that's bigger, big enough, people get infected. If it's small enough, they won't. And so you can imagine, and again, in this basic context, Imagine, again, in this basic context, the number of people who can get sick is pretty much what it is, right? The recovery rate, well, it may fluctuate by pharmaceuticals or therapeutic sort of things. It's sort of a function of the disease, the virus that's getting it. This beta though, there's a lot of information in there. This is the thing that tells me the probability essentially of getting infected on that. And so going back to this, if you look at the And so, going back to this, if you look at this, this has a negative sign. So, I'm only letting people, so some people get sick. There's no like loss of immunity and all this stuff that comes in more advanced models. This is always decreasing. So, this is always getting smaller. So, if it's ever bigger than one, it can only get smaller from there. Which means in that very basic idea, you have a single peak infection. Infections grow, I lose susceptible people, and they peak, and they drop off. And they drop off. But yeah, when we look at real data, we see many multiple infection, many diseases have these multi-infection peaks. And so, what I'm saying here is if the parameters are constant, infection can only have a single peak. And so therefore, this thing must be very special. It's going to create multiple peaks. And that's where all the behavior is. It's a very basic idea. Now I put an asterisk, of course, because there can be weighting and things that can induce multiple peaks. But in this very, very basic idea, you have to capture behavior. You have to capture behavior in that parameter. So, that's really what we're going to get to in a bit. So, this is what I think of as behavior in models is when it's not actually included as part of the model. So, it's this exogenous idea of behavior. So, some examples of that are taking a parameter as a changing constant with time. So, you say, okay, I'm going to fit it over these this week, I'm going to refit it next week, refit it next week, it's going to change. So, there's some behavior in that. You don't really model the behavior, capturing. Not really modeling behavior, capturing behavior, right? Similarly, you could do things like non-linear transformations, impose thresholds. You say, okay, I'm going to decide that when this many people are sick, people are going to act differently. When 1,000 people are sick, all of a sudden, people are going to act differently. So the overall idea is these are model-imposed things. The modeler is imposed into the model. So behavior is there, but it's not really being modeled. And I don't want to say this is necessarily bad. Necessarily bad. This is something we did ourselves in our own work, where we do just that. We fit this evolving parameter. So it can be useful. This is kind of capturing cases. And there's reasons you may want to do it. So these dates were dates of different government policies during COVID. That's a type of behavioral change that might be very, very hard to do. Because it can be instantaneous, it can happen very suddenly. So you might just want to capture effect of something without actually worrying about what's going on. So for the rest, I want to summarize where people. So, for the rest, I want to summarize where people actually try to do the modeling of behavior. So, one of the first things people do are these things called compartmental models, where they associate extra compartments like the SIR framework from a perspective of actually building behavior into them. So it might be that it's like an SIR thing, and then this might be a group of people who reduce their contacts but act in a very otherwise epidemiologically similar way, etc. This is an example where. This is an example where the model includes behavior through fear. So you interact with people, you become afraid of the disease or the vaccine. These are compartments you can be in, which affect how you think about making your contact decisions. The next layer is typically to add some sort of game theory idea to that, to say that I'm going to kind of have different types of people, normal behaviors, adopting behaviors. It's really big in the context of vaccines, social learning, or this idea that. Social learning, or this idea that there's a payoff or a cost to taking a behavior. You know, if I get a vaccine, there's a chance I could have an adverse reaction. There's also a benefit that I might not get the disease. And so there's this game theory idea which comes from, I want to make a decision based on maximizing my payoff to myself. And so it's really great in this context because you might see things where you say, well, I don't need to vaccinate because everyone else is. To vaccinate because everyone else is, so I don't have to worry about the disease benefit, like I'm getting that, but I don't have to pay the cost to take the vaccination. That gets incorporated there. Now, with these things, they're still kind of homogenous in a way. There's compartments of people who next layer from that typically is adding some heterogeneity to it. The concept of networks, where you say, I'm not just going to have a group of susceptible people, I'm going to have susceptible people who interact. You have to set up people who interact with each other in a very specific way. Okay, so you add these edges to these nodes, and then when you get behavior involved, you can even have different networks. So there may be the physical network, I'm bumping in with people in this workshop, or we have a social network with people we talk to, chat names, et cetera. And they can be different, right? And there's some function that connects these things. That we can go all the way into heterogeneity, which I think is kind of the furthest level in this idea. Which I think is kind of the furthest level in this idea of agent-based model. That's where every person has their own agency. And for that level, you can add as much as you want. Everybody can have a school they go to, a workplace they go to, a home they live in, family structures, et cetera. You can behave differently. And so, if you're not a mathematician, many of the times I work with people in many fields, this always sounds the best, right? Right, because many things are very heterogeneous in nature, they're very complex, so this is the most realistic representation. So, I want to kind of talk about next about where these things all fall in spectrums and why we do different things at all. This is kind of a little graph I have, which is the model, complex or simple. And then it's it said reality and I didn't know what the opposite of reality was. It's probably probably right. Academic is probably right. And so the behavior in models, that's sort of, it's in there, but you're not really modeling it. That kind of sits down here. And I want to be careful. What I mean by reality is the reality of modeling capturing behavior. As we saw, this can be very effective at capturing, say, case samples or something. There's realism to it, but not the realism I'm talking about here. But it's also very simple. It's why we like to do it. You have some data or something, and you've got a model, you just have to fit. And you're got a model, you just fit this parameter to that data as many times as you want. But it doesn't tell you much about why the particular parameters involved. The agent base is the other side. It might be very realistic, but it captures people, but it's also very complex. You know, you need to know everybody's individual behavior profile. You want them in there, and you want it to be representative. You need to know things about every person. Representative, you need to know things about every person you can put in. And the other ones, they're in some cloud around this space. So sometimes you can have network or compartmental models that are simpler or complex. The degree of realism like the internet. So what do I think that mathematicians like to do? Because lots of people can do modeling. People in theoretical sciences do modeling all the time. So what do I think mathematicians bring here? So, what do I think mathematicians bring you to this is my perspective on it? So, sometimes there'll be something here in this kind of space. There's a couple ways you might do it. A mathematician might look at this and say, okay, let me see how I can take this model and level of reality you have and do the best with it. So, maybe some statistical or data science methods in the background to try to ascertain parameters and give you a good simulation of your model. But maybe that's not possible. And so, when I think a lot of That's not possible, and so what I think a lot of applied mathematicians try to do is to sort of say, How can I increase the simplicity at a lower penalty than I do? You know, sometimes we're not great, it might be more even-sided triangle here. What we try to do is say, how can we use the tool that we are trained on, this structure of mathematics, where we understand the tool from a very technical level? How can we exploit that in the context of a mathematical object? In the context of a mathematical object, a model, to improve its simplicity. But hopefully, in such a way that it doesn't have a high penalty on realism that it's wrong. Okay, that's not to say sometimes we do end up down here, and that's not bad either. There is value in understanding models and the kinds of things that they can say, even if it's no longer predictive or in a realistic context. So, why do I think we're here? There's a great So, why do I think we're here? There's a great, I think it's a pretty good review paper, from about six years ago now, that did look at some of the stuff I'm talking about, different ways people model things where models included. One of my favorite figures is they counted the papers, they looked at papers, and they listed what their literature review section was reviewing. And you'll see, see, most of the modeling literature, the literature review, was modeling. Review was modeling literature. So it's mathematicians mostly getting their belief that they can model behavior because of other mathematicians who did something wrong. The other one was economics, and that's because there's a lot of behavior in economics with understanding stocks and pricing and adopting behavior. So they're pretty equal in that way. Psychology, where I think most of the theory comes from, not so much. In fact, only 12% of the papers they looked at. Actually, 12% of the papers they looked at had cited psychological theory in their justification for their modeling approach or idea. And so I, part of why I'm here, why I think this is great, because I'm hoping over time that bar comes up after the approach. We're working together to have our models actually corroborated through the experts that I've made. But there were all the references there for models in case people were interested in some of the things. But they're all there in case people were interested in some of this stuff. And I have extra slides, but I've got it on time, so I'll stop quick. Thank you. We've got a couple of minutes for questions. So in the way that you described, I really like that chart, by the way, the reality and an academic side, part of the one addition is thinking about the kinds of idealizations you make before you view the model. kinds of idealizations you make before you can do the modeling. So with the H-base modeling, yeah, you can have a realism, but lots of people use H-based modeling to try to understand how there might be certain patterns at the individual level that attribute to the, and so if there's already a level of simplicity that shoots it way off, right, and maybe even the academic. So I guess this is an invitation for you to say something about what do you think the role of that idealization process before you can get to the model part that is involved in that space? Yeah, so you're saying like, Yeah, so you're saying like the assumptions you're building before you start modeling. Before you do it right. Because comparable models you can also make. Yeah, yeah, of course. Anytime, you know, it's a good point. There's two types of assumptions. When you make a model, you're inherently having an assumption because of the limitations of the structure. But then you're right. There's also the assumptions you can take before you start modeling, which is we're going to assume people are well mixed or not well mixed. We're going to assume that they have this behavior that activates at the same time around the same time. So the role that it plays, I think, I think it depends on your motivation. What I do think is very important is to be very clear about your assumptions early and to also, for people who read the papers, to be able to separate an opinion about an assumption versus its scientific value. Does that make sense? So it's like, sometimes you'll see these papers say, well, I'm not going to read this paper because I would never read that assumption. It's like, okay, but there might be value in seeing what comes out from that assumption. See what comes out from that assumption. And then maybe I might assess how you feel about it or how you might adopt it or change the assumption of why you think it works here or it doesn't work there. I'd like to ask a very naive question. Please. Where do you get the information to make your assumptions? Yeah, that's a good question. It's probably very similar to that bar chart, right? Most people say, well, we'll assume they're well mixed. Say, well, we'll assume they're well mixed because that paper assumed they're well mixed. And again, it goes back to this academic reality thing. Sometimes you do this because you might see a model and you might see a simulation of it. And you might say, well, I think there's an interesting structure here, purely academic question. And I take these assumptions, I can exploit that. Other times, there's the realism of the science, right?
