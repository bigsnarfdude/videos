Yeah, Fabia, please. Well, thank you very much, Yunchen, for the introduction and to all the organizers for the invitation. So I'm going to talk about, as I say, Klein-Gordon equation here in three dimensions and something that's called internal modes and a phenomenon of radiation damping, which is something classical, but we have sort of a new take on it and new results. Now I have a same disclaimer as before, it's not exactly singularity talk. Before it's not exactly a singularity talk, it's not about singularity formation, more like what prevention, if you want, of singularity or sort of bad phenomenon of growth happening, and maybe more like trying to prove stability, where you don't know a priori what to expect, actually. And in some sense, there is some singularity here in frequency space that forms in the sense that some very natural quantities and norms that you Quantities and norms that you would like to measure actually grow with time. So, in that sense, we see this as a singularity and we see it in free space. And the main phenomenon that we want to study is the interaction between discrete and continuous modes in a linear PD. So, that's also relevant, I guess, to similarity formation. And we want to describe the long-time dynamics of what happens in the system and how the energy moves from the discrete to the continuous spectrum in this case. Now, I believe this is relevant to. Now, I believe this is relevant to several problems. I've mentioned just some, things that are related. But one analytical tool of interest that we use, and a theory that we're trying to develop and push, is the non-linear use of the Fourier transform adapted to the Schoenier operator. So this I will explain a little bit. And this should be helpful also in many other applications in studying IPR. So we want to study oscillations and interactions of localized waves under the influence of large external potentials. Inference of large external potentials, and that's where the Schneider Bedo will come in. And we want to do Fourier analysis there at a non-linear level. And this will be helpful, hopefully, down the road, to study localized perturbation of stationary states. So in one dimension, there are several results recently about this. My talk is about three dimensions. So this will be one important feature. Now, the main result is joint work with Tristan Léger. So we should be able to put it out soon. Although I said the same thing two months ago at the Banfork show. The same thing two months ago at the Banfordshop, the Junction Oze. So, hopefully, that will happen soon. I will give the result, some connected problems, maybe to put into perspective these results and give some ideas of the proof and discuss a little bit the Fourier transform. And we'll see how much time I have to discuss the harmonic analysis part at the end. All right, so just jumping into the problem. So, I'm considering a Klein-Gordon equation. Here, the mass is M, and then I'll risk. Here, the mass is m, and then I'll rescale it to one. So I have my dtu squared and then the Schrodinger radio minus Laplacian plus V, the mass term, and then the linearity, which is quadratic here. Dimension is three. And I'll assume that V is real, decaying and generic. I'll define generic just a little bit later. And H will have continuous spectrum, zero to infinity, plus possibly it will have eigenvalues that are negative. But what I'll assume is that. But what I'll assume is that there's only one, and this one is not so negative, but it's such that if I look at h and add the mass, then I get a positive eigenvalue. Okay, so there is the picture is like that. So I have zero here, then if I look at the mass, it's here, and then I'll have an eigenvalue which sits here. This is with respect to the massive Schrodinger operator. So please interrupt at any moment if you want. So, please interrupt at any moment if you want, and you know, I can write. So, this phi, this eigenfunction here, is called an internal mode of oscillation. And we'll see just in the next slide why. Now, before that, there's another assumption, which is we also assume that the eigenvalue is close enough to the bottom of the continuous spectrum. And then there's a Fermi-Gordon rule. So, this I will also explain and define later. But this is a resonance condition, essentially, to ensure that there is coupling between the discrete spectrum. Coupling between the discrete spectrum, so this mode φ with oscillation lambda and the continuous spectrum, so that there can be transfer of energy from discrete to continuous. All right, so now because I have this eigenvalue and it's positive, I have bound states. So these solutions that are localized in space, because phi is very fast decaying, that's the eigenfunction C to lambda, and oscillating in this form. In this form, that solves the linear equation. So, because of the eigenvalue, I have many spatially localized and time-periodic solutions of the linear flow. And then the main question is, what happens once I turn on the non-linearity and I try to perturb these states, whether they disappear or they persist, or they become something else. So, this is some kind of a classical question, right? I have these orbits here, and do they persist? Here, and do they persist when I look at perturbations of the system? And so, the question is: okay, do they still stay there? If not, what happens to them, to these internal oscillations, and how does the whole full non-linear solution of the non-linear Klein-Gordon behave for long times? So, that's the question I want to ask. And it's a classical question, it's been already answered in some cases, as I will mention just shortly after. So, the answer is no. So, the answer is no to the question: do they persist? This was already proven by Siegel at the beginning of the 90s. The energy, under the assumptions of coupling continuous to discrete, gets transferred, but the whole solution decays very slowly over time. So, in some sense, you still feel the presence of these bound states, although they become they start decaying, but much, much more slowly than a regular solution of the Klein-Gordon, for example, would do. Solution of the Klein-Gordon, for example, would do. So you kind of feel this impurity, these nonlinear effects of the discrete spectrum. So this is the problem. And so Sopher and Weinstein, in a seminar paper in 99, they answered this question for the cubic Klein-Gordon. So they look exactly at this problem. By looking at cubic nonlinearity, you have an internal mode of oscillation. So what happens for very long times to small solutions of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon? Linear Klein Gordon. Now, if you're in dispersive wave equations, it's well understood that in a perturbative setting, lower powers are harder to do. And also, if you're looking at physical perturbations or applications, you do want to look at quadratic non-linearities, because those are the ones that will come up in many applications. And I think an interesting feature of this problem is that even if you look at the Klein-Gordon, so H is minus Laplacian plus V, just quadratic, and you Just quadratic, and you assume that there's no bound states. So, a much simpler problem. Even that, I don't think, was known. A very strong notion of stability and decay and scattering, for example, as t goes to infinity, was not known. But we had some work on the NLS with sofer about a year and a half ago. And these are more references. So, as I said, Siegel proved that these states don't persist and actually decay. They don't, so the periodic orbits don't become. They don't, so the periodic orbits don't become quasi-periodic or something else, but they just decay. I mean, actually, you know, you prove that they don't persist. That's the only thing. Then, software and Meinstein proved actually what happens to the whole solution, and then these states eventually decay, although slowly. And then there's already the important work on NLS by Tsai and Yao and more works on this question of interaction between discrete and continuous modes in the non-linear Klein-Gordon, also in different dimensions. Gordon also in different dimensions. And so, the relevance of these problems is that they model topological defects. Imagine you have a medium, waves can disperse, and there's an impurity. That's the bound state. And then you ask, okay, what happens once the wave pass through and whether they're influenced by the bound states. Or you can think of a particle and feel the interaction, where the bound state is a particle, and then you have a radiation field and see how they interact. And it's also relevant to topological solidons. Also, relevant to the biological solenons. Now, I'll explain just one example that's sort of similar, looks very similar. And so, I'm gonna say one example in one dimension, but keeping in mind that what will happen in the problem once we analyze it is that part of the analysis actually has 1D features. So there's a connection in that they look similar, but also the analysis, I think it's relevant to also lower dimension. I think it's relevant to also lower-dimensional problems. And one famous model is the 5-4 model, which is this wave equation with the double well potential, looks 1 minus 5 squared to the square, and has a static solution, which is the tangent everybody of x called the kink. Now, the kink is the simplest example of a topological soliton. It is not localized. And the main question is, is the king actually stable? Now, if you do take Now, if you do take this FIFO model, linearize at the kink, you exactly get the same model that I'm talking about. So you get a quadratic Lang-Gordon equation with an internal mode. In that case, there's also resonance, but you get exactly the same equation with the same presence of bound states for the linear evolution. Although this will be, of course, in one dimension. And just to cite here, there was an important work recently, or last year, by the Lauren Mass Modi, where they proved that this. That this king here is stable for times up to the order epsilon to the minus four. Now, and the key is to look at the linearization and prove stability up to that time, so that where epsilon is the size of the perturbation. So they can go to size of the perturbation to the minus four. Now, in three dimensions, we can go to infinity and describe everything. Of course, three-dimensional is easier because you get more dispersion. But you know, some parts of the analysis are also one-dimensional. So, these two things are kind of related. And so, it is an active area of. And so it is an active area of research. And I think also William Schlag will talk about something related to these one-dimensional field theories just after me. And if you want something in between one and three-dimensional, there's two-dimensional models that look like Klein-Gordon-like. When you linearize, you will get Klein-Gordon equations. And when you're looking at with quadratic nonlinearities, when you're looking at the stability of objects that don't decay, so they're not localized. Objects that don't decay. So they are not localized, such as the vortices here. Now, I don't have anything to say on the two-dimensional case. There's results on the 1D about Langordon, but I won't talk about that. So just focus on the three-dimensional picture here. Then at the very end, if I have time, I'll make some, I'll cite some works in 1D. Okay, so this is just to put like a little bit more of a slightly broader picture about these problems of non-linear equations and with large potentials. With large potentials, possibly discrete spectrum, and what happens in a long time. So, this is kind of the general umbrella of these problems. So, now here, to set the results, so let me recall the notation. I have the Klein-Gordon equation, mass is one here, quadratic nonlinearity, the eigenvalue is between one half and one now. And the first thing we do is naturally take the solution and decompose it, so projection on the continuous. On the continuous spectral subspace and the projection onto the eigenfunction phi with amplitude calling A of t. Okay, so this is orthogonal decomposition. And then I state the theorem with different properties for the two parts. So the theorem with the Tristan Léger is the following. So assuming what I said at the beginning about the potential and the Fermi-Codden rule, which I again The Fermi-Goden rule, which I again I will just precisely define in a bit. If I look at small solutions that are sufficiently regular and localized, then I can construct a unique global solution. And the important thing is that one can prove that the amplitude here of the internal oscillations decays, but at a slow rate, like t to the minus one-half. So this should be compared if you think of the Klen-Gordon without internal modes, you would. Internal modes, you would expect, I may say with B equals zero, for example, you would expect a rate which is comparable to the linear case, which is three halves. So, this is much slower than the linear case. And also for the other part, so the continuous part or radiation, we can prove some dispersive properties, but not really optimal, so not even three halves. So, something quite weak, less than integrable. So, this is, and usually when we look at nonlinear problems in the And usually when we look at nonlinear problems in a perturbative setting, integral decay is something very desirable. So here we can prove it. Nevertheless, we can close the bootstrap and study the asymptotics under this weaker decay. Now the second part of the statement is something about actually how the solution looks like as T goes to infinity. So really the asymptotics. And to state it, I want to use the distorted Free transform. So for now, let's just think that it works like the Free transform. So you apply it, you can invert it. You can invert it, right? It's an isometric 2 and so on on the continuous spectral subspace. So, first I take my solution, my radiative part of the solution, so the continuous projection on the continuous spectrum, and pull back the linear flow. So, just that, because I want to compare to linear solutions. And then I can give an asymptotic formula for this, and I express it in Fourier space, because we work in Fourier space for the proof, so it comes out naturally and also. And also, it's not so clear to me how to translate it into real space because the bounds we have are not, and maybe they cannot be that good to be able to actually translate it well. But this is quite natural and should give you already an idea of what happens at infinity for these solutions. So, this F, which is called the profile of your radiation V, splits into two main parts. So, one part which is G. which is which is g and one part which is h so i call g and then h tilde here so g has this expression so it's an integral over time of something that decays like one over s so kind of a logarithmic feature diverging here and there's some oscillating phases of which the main one i just want to point out is this one which says that basically once you are when you're approaching basically once you are when you're approaching a bad frequency so when xi which is your fourier frequency approaches the value such that the japanese backdrop c becomes to lambda well lambda was the eigenvalue then here you don't have oscillations and so in some sense you're like integrating one over s so there's like a logarithmic kind of divergence of this amplitude which you would otherwise expect to be bounded for regular solutions so this is So, this is just, I guess, one way to explain what's interesting in this formula. And while the other part, H, it's kind of better behaved. So maybe that's some regularity, for example. While the first part, G, if you go and measure its regularity in Fourier space, which would be equivalent to its localization in real space, it's actually quite badly growing. So if you look at DX C of G, this. look at dx c of g this you expect it to be actually root of t so in that sense there is a singularity in foul space that comes up as your frequency approaches the zero of this expression yeah but fabio the logarithm in your phase stabilizes you at that resonant frequency you mean this one yeah uh well you get yeah that's right so in the sense that right that's right so you don't diverge lower either i agree with you so you will get something but you get something that is not small get something but you get something that is not small yes you lose the smallness yes you get right right you get idle dilogue yes so exactly this be it's like idle dialogue yes i agree yes yes absolutely yes sorry i should have said that there is that there is a logating kind of flavor divergence but the whole thing uh behaves which you know well from other similar phenomena so the whole thing if you disregard this part once you're close to the bad frequency and then you can integrate actually explicitly so you'll get something like that So you'll get something like that. Log S, let's say. More process. Absolutely. Yeah, well, thanks. Right. The other main feature is if you measure actually now the weighted norms. Right, so this is something, so there is in some sense some divergence as you approach that bad frequency. All right. Yeah. Yeah. So then, okay, let me just say a little bit about the proof. So how do we set it up? So this again is the same notation as before. So we split the U into the part along phi and the irradiative supposedly part. And you get a couple system of the PD for the amplitude of the internal mode and a PD for the A PD for the V. So we call V the radiation or continuous component, and then AT is the internal mode amplitude or discrete component. So this is all very natural. Now they're kind of coupled heavily in the sense that the radiation V will feed at leading order into the ODE and vice versa, the internal mode also forces at leading order the PD. So you kind of have to study these two things at the same time. At least a priori, it's kind of unclear. A priori is kind of unclear what could happen. So, this is again the same system I just expanded non-linearity. And all I want to say is that the ODE conceptually can be approached like Sophie-Weinstein. And I'll explain this in the next two slides. You can use normal form ODE for ODEs, the Fermi-Gorner lunar Schoder radiation, which is that despite where in an Hamiltonian setting, you can actually get damping for the amplitude and get a decay of 2 to the minus 1 half, which is kind of the maximum allowed here. Here. But then at the technical level, even though ODE is kind of harder to treat because to be able to identify the leading order dumping dynamics that gives you this, you have to separate it from the remainders. And for a quadratic nonlinearity, this is actually harder than for a cubic. So this is one thing that I'll try to explain briefly after this. Now, the PDE, instead, I think it really requires a new approach. And this is what we try to do. We try to do because even if you have just a quadratic Lein Gordon, forget that it's similarly forced by the internal mode, then even then, I mean, I didn't know before this if there were works like proving actually some decay estimates for this case. And so a strong notion of stability. And one thing that we'll do is we'll take the radiation and split it into a bad part, which comes from the singular forcing, then a good part, which has better Part, which has better localization properties, and try to propagate different information on both for them. And for this, especially to propagate information on the good part, we will use the deserted Fourier transform. So that's kind of the basic idea. Now, maybe briefly for the ODE, if you write it out in terms of, again, after filtering out the linear oscillation. Again, after filtering out the linear oscillations, and you want to study what happens to the amplitude here at capital A after you filtered out the e to the minus lambda t, you look at what's the feedback from the continuous part. And this is the same argument that software and Weinstein has. So if you compute a leading order, assuming that you're solving just this Klang-order force by internal mode, you can see exactly what the contribution is, solving explicitly. And once you plug it in inside here, Plug it in inside here, you will get just a term that is cubic in A, so you get an OD with some coefficient. Now, this coefficient is given here, and it's so I put here something negative, whatever is left here is this red part. This is non-negative, but it could be zero. And the Fermi-Golden rule is the assumption that this coefficient is not zero, and this coefficient is exactly actually the square of the Fourier transform of transform of well yeah of the square of the eigenfunction at the bad frequency to lambda so this is kind of say so this is the transposition of the quadratic equation of what soffer and weinstein had for the cubic so there's nothing really conceptually very different here and if you have this assumption your ode will become something like a dot is minus a squared a which will give you the dumping plus possibly other rotating parts that don't affect Plus, possibly other rotating parts don't affect the amplitude. But the problem is that if you're plugging back all these dots, those dots that I disregarded up to now, but that you will have to actually estimate, one thing, for example, you have to prove is that you have an L infinity estimate, say, of this type. So if you look at it, it's like a Duamel term in a quadratic line-gordon. And you want to prove that this is integrable, so that when you integrate it, A. A, the dynamics of A don't see it. And this is something quite non-trivial, because if you have, if you don't have a potential, okay, this was proven back in the 80s. Now, if you do have a potential, it's not so easy. At least I don't know if there's other ways to do it than what we do. Okay, so this is one thing that even in the ODE, you have to be able to control very precisely or in a strong enough way the radiation. The radiation. And so now let me actually go to the PD and disregarding all sorts of less important terms. The PD will look like a linear evolution. Then there's a quadratic term in the PD variable. And then there's a forcing. So now if you write out Duhama's formula, you'll see that the forcing is responsible for a term like that, which Like that, which is an integral between zero and t and something that becomes singular at the frequency 2 lambda. This is the same term that we saw in the asymptotics wasn't small. And also, as I mentioned before, you expect that weather norms for this will be kind of badly behaved. So, if you don't have control of the weather norms, you lack localization, then you lack decay, then the linear control becomes harder. So, that's kind of very general. So that's kind of a very general thing for this type of problems. While what you hope is that once you eliminate the singular part, what is left here, once I eliminate this G, is this H, and you hope that H is under control. That is something you want to prove. So the whole kind of scheme is: let me try to eliminate this, which is kind of explicit, and I can have some weak bounds, and then let's hope that the rest is actually well behaved. Well behaved. And so the question becomes: okay, now how do I control localization for a dispersive wave on the background of a large potential in a low power nonlinearity setting? So this is the question. How much time do we have still? Because I lost time of what when we started. Just one moment. You still have. You still have seven, eight amines. Yeah. Okay. So I'll just try to speak up maybe a little bit. Right. So the question here: how do we control this? Let me maybe skip. This is more like a general discussion. So let me skip it. So I already said that this is kind of in the theory of this perturbative non-linear regime, having a potential is complicated. So let me just maybe go here. So once you have a potential compared to when you don't have it, Compared to when you don't have it, of course, you don't have invariance for the equation, and that makes it harder to control weight and norms because you don't have, for example, vector fields, you don't have standard Fourier analysis because the frequencies get perturbed, and you create more coherent and non-linear interactions. So, this is something you have to keep in mind. Now, what we want to do is still try to use the Fourier transform, but adapt it to the Schrödinger operator, and try to do multilinear harmonic analysis in this setting. And the reason we want to do it is because when v is equal to zero, Do it is because when v is equal to zero, Fourier base techniques have been quite successful, and also for v not zero, there were indications that something can work, and of course, also the storter-fourier transformer has been very heavily used in many non-linear problems. So, somehow, right, so this is what gives us hope that something like this can work. So, now let me try to explain how we do it. So, very brief introduction to the sorted free transform. You look at the generalized eigenfunction for the Schrödinger operator. This behaves. Schrodinger operator. This behaves like pain waves, and then you can have negative eigenvalues. And you can define the Fourier transform by essentially so integrating a function against the generalized eigenfunct and plus looking at the projection on the discrete modes. And you can reconstruct it. Okay, so sorry, this is very brief. The important thing is that Fourier transform diagonalizes the operator, just as the regular transform does. As the regular transform does. There are these objects that are the wave operators that actually conjugate the Schrodinger operator with the one with no potential, and they can be expressed in terms of the distorted Fourier transform and the Fourier transform. So somehow you can use them, for example, to transfer linear estimates from the case of V equals zero to the case of V not zero if the potential is generic. So for example, if you have subdoloregularity, decay, and genericity, then these are bounded. Then these are bounded on subless spaces. Genericity means that you don't have solutions of h phi equals zero such that phi doesn't grow too fast. In this sense, let's state it here. Let me maybe skip the references, just keep them a few seconds for the recording. Okay, and as I said, with this, for example, with the wave operators, you can transfer decay estimates. So, whatever you know for the flat case, which is the one with B equals. Case which is the one with B equals zero, you also know it for the case with B not zero in terms of linear estimates. These are two kinds of useful things. Now, as I said, we want to control weighted estimates, weighted norms. So we have to do weighted estimates. And how do we do that? So let's assume I have, so I go to my nonlinear problem with nonlinear edu squared. I take the Fourier transform after filtering out the linear oscillations, and then I write the nonlinear Duhamod formula for this. And if I do that, This. And if I do that, I see that I get what would be a convolution if there was no potential once I go to free space. Here becomes this kind of integral of these two profiles through this distribution, which is not a delta now, as if it would be v is equal to zero, but is the product of three generalized eigenfunct at the three frequencies, k, l, and m, are my names here, integrated in dx. Plus you have, as in Charles Stock. As in Charles' talk before, you have the sum of all the oscillations of each of the functions that are involved here, of the linear oscillations. Now, we call this mu the non-linear spectral distribution. And as you can imagine, if you want to prove bounds on things like that, you kind of have to understand quite precisely what this mu is. Now, in the free case, this would just be a delta. Otherwise, the frequency is KNL. The frequencies K and L and M can actually interact much more freely. And this is a problem. Now, I wrote here again the same formula after integrating in time. So the goal is to try to control this frequency and time integral, exploding the oscillations. So you need to understand how mu looks like and where is it singular. So for the delta, we know exactly where it's singular, but we also know that it's regular, for example, in the L minus m direction. Now here, it turns out that this mu Now here it turns out that this mu in general, so it's not regular in any direction. But, and I think this is the main reason why even simple models, like, you know, with no bound states were not really understood so far. Because you have to understand the mu and where it's regular. And it's not regular in no direction. But you can split it into many different pieces, kind of simpler parts, know exactly what the similarity is, and then avoid it to try to exploit the oscillations. The oscillations. So, in a non-linear problem, you have here you see if this was your solution, so your non-linear problem to the equation, you have the problem of possibly lacking oscillations here, because they're solutions to this equals zero. And because the frequencies are kind of free to be, more or less, you have more solutions to this equals zero than if they were related by k is equal to l plus m, for example. You have the problem of your solution having limited regularity because you cannot provide. Because you cannot propagate too much spatial concentration along the flow. In our case, it's also singularly forced, so it's not regular at all. And you have the problem of the mu being singular in this oscillatory. So if you take this oscillatory kind of integral point of view, you have all these issues. Now, it turns out that, maybe let me skip how we get there. If you do an expansion of the eigenfunctions, you can see how this mu looks like. So, for example, if I just do the first orders, I will have a Do the first orders, I will have a delta when each of these psi is a plane wave, and then I have the interaction of two plane waves and the first scattered wave. You can compute this by stationary phase on the sphere, and you will get there it looks like a principal value of one over mod of p minus mod of q. So, here p and q, one would be a frequency and one would be the sum of two frequencies. So, if I write it out later, here you see it will look something like that. Will look something like that. So, this mu will have this form plus this form plus all sorts of other combinations. So, all together is not regular, but each of them, you know, have a specific singularity, and you want to try to integrate tangentially to the singularity. And the way this looks like, a posterior at least is justified, so I justified by the fact that the potential causes uncertainty in the way that the frequencies interact. In the way that the frequencies interact, and so, in particular, you cannot tell very well the direction of the frequencies because once something, you know, a wave is coming in, kind of bounces off the potential, then you don't know where it's coming out. So, maybe you can tell the intensity, the speed, but not the direction. So, whatever is singular should be in terms of the length of these frequencies, not the direction much. And so then this brings to some harmonic analysis in finding, establishing. Establishing theorems about bilinear bounds with the singular kernels, and finally, I think this is my last slide. Should I go? If we go back now to our original problem, so I go to the Klein-Gordon, and I remember that my radiation was split into two parts. This was a similar one and a sort of better one. I plug it into my Duhambel formula and distorted Fourier space. Now I kind of know a little bit how my A little bit, how my distribution here looks like. This is just one piece, then you have many other pieces, but they kind of look more or less the same, up to some changes of variables, possibly. And I try to say, okay, now what should I do? And I notice that I have fewer oscillations than if V was zero because of the uncorrelation of the frequencies. I have a singular kernel, but at least I know how it looks like. And I should just avoid all directions that are singular. And I have only one, basically. And I have only one, basically, where it's not singular, so that I will use. And I have to remember that in the problem with the bound state, because of the forcing, I have one part which is irregular. So that's not very regular in free space. So I have to be careful what kind of information I try to propagate. And also, because of that, the other part is also not so regular. So the H is better than the G, but limited regularity, limited decay. Nevertheless, we can carry out the non-linear analysis. Carry out the non-linear analysis, and I guess that's basically about it. Yeah, I think just final comments is that more general takeaway, which I think it's worth, is that we can do some robust non-linear Fourier analysis in the presence of a potential. And in particular, we can prove this radiation damping for the Wadder-Declan-Gordon. And hopefully, we can use this for more applications further down the road. Further down the road. And maybe I'll just leave here references to one-dimensional, a lot of one-dimensional work that was done recently in this same kind of mindset and framework. And I guess Rider will talk about more about this later. Thanks. Okay. Yeah. Thank you, Fabio, for the wonderful talk. Thank you. Are there one questions? Are there some questions? Well, you have a question? Yeah. Yes, Fabio, thank you for the great talk. Fabio, thank you for the great talk. Can you go back to the slide where you split into two terms, G and H tilde? Yeah, sure. Maybe before this, here. This one? There was one with a logarithmic expression in the face. A logarithm in the face. Yeah. That that yeah there there. Um There, there. Epidemic lean lock. So you noted that there is a loss of smallness, even though you don't have a logarithmic divergence along the bad directions, you lose the smallness. How do you deal with this loss of smallness in your bootstrap? That sounds like a very unpleasant issue. Right, so but yeah, that's a good point. But in some sense, you bootstrap, so you remove the bad part, and then you look at the equation just for the good part. For the good part. And how do you control the bad part? So the bad part, the bad thing is that the bad part, if I just go maybe to the next, the bad part is explicit because it's just, it doesn't depend on Xi except on the phase. I mean, you know this problem very well because you get something similar for the resonance, right? So you know very well this problem. But right, so in this context, you have to think also here we are in 3D, right? Maybe let me put the what the bad part is exactly. Sorry, the bad part is here. The bad part is here. Right, so this is, you see. But this is kind of explicit because, you know, the A is your internal mod oscillation. So it's like one over root of S, let's say. Right? And X C is only here. So, you know, you have whatever bound you have here. You just let it be. You know, you just say, okay, whatever the best you can do here, not much. You know, you can get one over TDK almost. You can get DXE is growth. Then the H, so then you look at the equation for H, and the equation for For H and the equation for H only has terms either mixed in H and G or H. Right? So that, okay, now, okay, the HH is, you can do it. And then the HG, yeah, so you can see the point is that you have to measure, so you never have to, for example, measure dx of G hat, of G tilde. So never do that, right? Because that's bad. Right, because that's bad. And if you can kind of do this and you know, use the triggers, for example, it's helpful here because you don't have one over TDK, so you need something to kind of bring you past the edge of not causing energy estimates, for example. So, this is something you'll always see. And the striggers can help you. There's various, you know, kind of tricks. I'd be happy to look more in details, of course, if you want to share it. One last question coming in your multilinear harmonic analysis for your Analysis for your non-linear singular, no spectral distribution for the NSD. You have all these small devices, one of absolute psi minus absolute something, like that. So here I'm wondering, do you need to use restriction phenomena for the Fourier transform? Because you are dealing with spheres. You have curvature. Your absolute value is Euclidean norm in three-dimensional. Right, right, that's right. Yeah. Right, right, that's right, yeah. No, but I think now, here, so you want maybe, yeah, I don't know if that what you're saying could be also helpful. No, but something a little simpler, because you at least, I think, uh, yeah, so you have this, but it's a principal value, right? So, you know, once you're very close, you kind of maybe say use this irregular in some sense. Let's imagine that you just want to say, you know, an LPLQ bound for this, right? So that's your first building block. It's true, it's singular on. Block. It's true, it's singular on an annulus, that's right. But you know, if you're too close to the annulus, then you use the regularity of the input, kind of like how you would do like a trivial bound for the Hilbert transform. Let's say that you don't want to prove the LP bound, but you know your input is smooth, right? Then that would be very easy to bound, if you know that you know, it's kind of like that. And then on each annulus, then you do the LPLQ, but you're on a fixed annulus, right? So then, and then you can, but you can sum. Can but you can sum. Is your so you use the smoothness near the small devices, near the vanishing of the denominator? Right, but here, so there's not there's not much. So once you shift, right, so if say you shift to L plus K, right? Right, so you have to look when L is equal to M. Absolutely. But then there you approximate, so it's for M, you substitute L, you know, in, okay, in the on the sphere, right? So radial, right? Then you go to L. Radial, right? Then you go to L, and then that will vanish. That contribution, the difference will be small because you exactly use that f tilde is regular, say. Okay, so you always need a bit more than what you're trying to. So it's not something so refined, if you wish, right? Sounds difficult, but this part was also in writing in the work with software. We started this part. Okay, thank you, Fabio, for the very nice talk. Very nice talk, and so
