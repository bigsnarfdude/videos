My goal today is to tell you about my work on endoscopy and stabilization for relative trace formulas associated to symmetric varieties, which is something I've been working on for a few years now. But I guess before I begin, I could ask the question, which is given the title of this workshop, aren't we supposed to sort of be beyond in this copy of this project? To sort of be beyond in the scoping at this point. And so, maybe if you take nothing else away from the talk today, I'd just like to say that there does seem to be strong evidence and many interesting examples where the notion of endoscopy and stabilization seems pertinent in the relative language program as well. And so, what I'd like to do in order to try and argue that is to first recall the as far as I As far as I am aware, the first case in which the need for a relative theory of endoscopy was observed, and that's the notion of twisted base change. After I've reviewed that, I'll then discuss the example, which will be the sort of meat of the talk today, which is the relative trace formula associated to unitary Friedrich-Jacques periods. So I'll talk about those, why they're interesting. Talk about those, why they're interesting, and also some work in that direction. And in that, I'll state my results about stabilization of the relative trace formula, where I'll introduce a notion of an endoscopic symmetric space. And so that's a general notion that I've recently developed. And so I want to quickly review how one defines those for a relatively general symmetric space. General symmetric space. And then, once I've done that, I want to review the local harmonic analytic results, which allow for the stabilization, in particular, the proof of the fundamental demand. So to begin, as I mentioned, the first instance in which there was a recognition for a need of relative endoscopy was in the context of twisted base change. So what I'll do is I'll let F be a number field and Be a number field, and G will be a classical group. So here I'm thinking specifically of G as a fixed point group of some involution on a linear group, and I'll let H be a spherical subgroup. And so the idea of twisted base change is to try and understand distinction questions on this classical group by transferring them via some trace formula. Some trace formula comparison. Yes. Hello? Yeah, I've lost the video, the audio. Are you? Can you speak? Can you hear me? Yes, I can now. Yes. Oh, I'm sorry. Is there... It just sort of faded out. It's fine now. Okay. I lost my train of thought. Okay, so in particular, let's what. What twisted base changes was this is an idea put forth by Jay Sketz and Eric Wambuck about 10 or 11 years ago today, or 10 or 11 years ago, when this subgroup H is a symmetric subgroup of a classical group. So just to give a little bit of the setup, as I've said, I'm thinking of G as a fixed point group via some involution on GLN. So I'll call that theta. And I'll let sig. That theta, and I'll let sigma be an in a second involution on GLN that descends to an involution on G. And so the setup is to let consider the fixed point subgroup of sigma in my classical group. So this is my symmetric subgroup of G. And in the setup, I have now a couple involutions on GLN. In particular, since I started off with sigma and theta on GLN in such a way that these GLN in such a way that these commute, their composition gives me a third involution on GLN. And so I'll take H1 to be the fixed points of sigma, and I'll take H2 to be the fixed points of this new involution, tau. And so the general principle that Getz and Wambach put forth in sort of a rough form is that in this setup, distinction questions on the classical group with respect to the classical group. Group with respect to H are related to distinction on this on the linear group with respect to H1 and H2. So, more precisely, if pi is some cuts form on G, I'll let capital pi be its standard functorial lift, then pi, capital pi should be H1 or H and H2 distinguished, if and only if there's something nearly equivalent to little pi on the classical group, which is H distinguished. And so this is a general. And so, this is a general principle in a course form because, in any particular case, it may need to be augmented by maybe some characters in order to address the appropriate problems at hand. But what was interesting about this proposal was that beyond just isolating this principle, they put forth a strategy for trying to prove cases of this. And so, that was their notion of relative twisted endoscopy. And so, this idea is that if you take the trace form. Is that if you take the trace formula, the relative trace formula on the classical group that encodes period this periods with respect to h, then you should compare a stabilized version of that trace formula with the appropriate twisted trace formula on the linear group. So this is quite an involved procedure, but they're actually able to establish many of the preliminary results in this direction. In particular, they give a definition for the twisted trace formula, they define a norm map. Twisted trace formulas, they define a norm map. And so this seemed like a pretty interesting line of questioning in order to establish new results about automorphic periods. And as a test case, what they were able to do was affect the strategy in the following special case. So this they call the bi-quadratic case. So I'll let E and M be two quadratic extensions of my field F such that the compositum is a That the compositum is a biquadratic extension, and I'll let H be a unitary group associated to one of these extensions, and G will be the restriction of scalars of the base change to the other extension. So this is going to be a unitary group of twice the rank of H. So in this case, my involution sigma is a Galois involution. Then following the setup from the previous slide, the larger The larger group is the base change to the pi-quadratic extension. H1 is a linear group on M, and H2 is a unitary group associated to this third quadratic extension inside of the bi-quadratic extension. So in this case, they were able to affect the comparison of the twisted relative trace formula on GLN to the relative trace formula on G and relates these. And relates these Galois periods on g to a psi l functions on the base change to this bi-quadratic extension. And so actually, in order to do this, they set up this procedure, but they end up relying on some special simple trace formula techniques in order to avoid the instability issues that arise for these relative trace formulas. And so they isolates that there should. And so they isolates that there should exist a theory, but sort of left open the question of whether or not there exists a good notion of relative endoscopy. And so that's sort of the starting point for this theory. And what I want to do is isolate an interesting case of that's the focus of my work. And these are what I call unitary Friedberg-Schaut K periods. So now I'll let E over F be a quadratic extension, and I'll take my big group. Extension, and I'll take my big group G to be a unitary group in two n variables. And I'll let sigma be an involution, an inner involution, which fixes a subgroup of type un cross un then following the same procedure as before, I have this linear group, the base extension to E, and I have two subgroups. H1 will be this linear period, GLN cross GLN, and H2 will be... And H2 will be some inner form of G. It's just the fixed points of the Galois involution fixing G and this inner involution. So I have some other unitary group. So what is, so the comparison here is what Getz and Wombach propose. And so what does this tell us to expect? Well, work of Friedberg and Jacquet tell us that H1 distinction cuts out, among other things, symplectic type representations on GLN. So their L function here. So their L function here will have a pole at S equals one. And on the other hand, distinction by H2 cuts out the image of base change from GL2 and F. So in this case, we make the following more precise conjecture. And this has been refined by Jing Weizhao and Wei Zhang, whose work I'll mention on the next slide. So I'll let pi be a tempered cuspidal representation on GL2, GL2N. G L 2n over F assumed to be of symplectic type, and I'll let capital pi be its base change. Then the following are equivalent. The central L value of the base change L function is non-vanishing if and only if there exists some pure inner form of my unitary group and subgroup H and a cus form on G such that it has the same base change as little pi and it is H distinguished. H-distinguished. So, this is the conjecture. And actually, we know pretty strong results in one direction, namely that if the L value is non-vanishing, or sorry, sorry, if the two implies one is known by results of these authors here. But one of the reasons that this case is of particular interest is that these peers. Particular interest is that these periods can be related to special cycles in unitary Shimura varieties with applications to the Tate and Lockado conjectures. So, this is a particularly enticing case in the relative program. And so, following Getz and Wombach, we would want to make some relative trace formula on GL2NE. But actually, there's a separate trace formula that was recently proposed by Jing Weizhao and Weizhang. Weizhao and Weizhang that we're going to use. So, the strategy to prove this conjecture is, on the one hand, to consider the following trace formula. So, here, this is essentially cooked up. So this is a relative trace formula on GL2N over F. And the specifics are not that important for the talk. The idea, I mean, there's an Eisenstein series. I mean, there's an Eisenstein series involved in the construction, but the idea is that it's precisely designed in order to detect symplectic type cuts forms on GL2N. And when you affect the spectral expansion, it encodes the base change L function. So this is a very delicate trace formula, but they were able to define it. And it gives precisely what the conjecture wants to see. And so the idea is to compare this trace formula to the Compare this trace formula to the relative trace formula for these unitary preverged RK periods. And so in that case, we're going to do something a bit more traditional. So I'll let x be this quotient of this homogeneous space. And I'll consider the distribution where I average some test function over the rational points of x. And I take some regularized period integral of this average. This average function. And so, if you haven't seen a relative trace formula expressed this way before, all I'm doing here is I'm essentially encoding some of the different peer-interforms that arose in the conjecture just in a single integral. So if I the spectral expansion of this integral, or at least the cuspidal part, will be a sum over certain pure inner forms of my unitary group with the period integrals that we're interested in. Integrals that we're interested in. So, this is precisely what we want to see. But what we're interested in is the geometric expansion. So, right here, I've isolated what I'm calling the elliptic part. So here, x is ranging over my h orbits on a certain open subset of x. And I have, as in the case of the classical trace formula, some volume form and some orbital integral form. And there's And there's, of course, in order to make this precise, there are certain higher order terms that I'm not going to talk about for this talk. Okay, so these are the two formulas that we would like to compare, and they are cooked up precisely to tackle this conjecture. So, the question is: Does there actually exist a comparison? And this is where. And this is where the need for stabilization comes in. So, both. So, I've explicated a bit of the geometric expansion here, but there's also a geometric expansion on this side. And what happens is that we get a sum over orbits of the following double cosets. And so, what is true is that there exists a matching of stable regular semi-simple. Of stable regular semi-simple orbits, where on this on the Zhao Zhang trace formula, we are summing over orbits of this form, and on the unitary relative trace formula, we're summing over orbits in this form. But this comparison does not descend to orbits over F. And so the conjecture is that you have a matching of test functions, one on the unitary group, and then some input data. Group and then some input data for this Zhao Zhang trace formula with matching stable orbital integrals, at least when the special value is equal to zero. So again, here this trace formula has some parameter. And so when F is equal to zero, I get my central L value. And the conjecture they have is that we have a matching of stable orbital integrals in that case. And I just say you don't mean classical orbital integrals, you mean orbital integral. Classical orbital integrals, you mean orbital integrals, relative orbital integrals? Yes, thank you very much. I tend to call orbital, relative orbital integrals orbital integrals, but that's just because I trip up over the word relative if I say it too many times. But thank you. Yes, these are relative orbital integrals. And in progress, they actually prove the fundamental lemma for the units for this comparison. So this conjecture has a lot of strong results. This conjecture has a lot of strong evidence. And so the goal for my work is to stabilize this relative trace formula on the unitary side in order to compare with this trace formula of Zhao and Zhang. And so this proceeds in a couple steps. The first one is, so what I'll do is I'm going to focus on the elliptic parts because that's in some sense the main term. In some sense, the main term. And so the first step is to isolate the part that we can compare to the Zhang Zhao trace formula and then try and interpret what we get left over. So using techniques of Lebesgue, the first step to do is the pre-stabilization. And so, right, here is this elliptic part is just that first term that we saw in the geometric sum. It's a sum over. It's a sum over rational orbits. And now I'm expressing it as a stable piece plus a bunch of kappa terms. So here, this outer sum is a sum over now the stable orbits of H on this relatively elliptic locus. So the precise definition here is not that important. It's just some dense open sub-variety where the orbits. Where the orbits, these orbital integrals converge. And this inner sum ranges over certain characters for cohomology groups of the stabilizers. So this is precisely the form of the pre-stabilization for the elliptic parts that was studied by Langlands and Kotwitz in the context of the Arthur Selberg trace formula. And the point of this slide is that it's the first step to trying to isolate what we can compare to the Zhaozhang trace. Compare to the Zhaozhang trace formula. In particular, this stable piece, which is a similar sum here, it's a sum indexed by stable orbits, product of a delicious stable orbital integrals, may be compared to the Zhaozhang trace formula. So this is the part which can be related to L-functions with their technique. And so now the goal is to interpret these kappa terms in terms of In terms of terms which can be related to period integrals on some other groups. So, this was the goal is to interpret these additional terms. And so that's the so-called stabilization. And so what I'll do is I'll introduce for each decomposition of N, A and B, what I call an endoscopic symmetric variety. So, what this is, is it's just going. So, what this is, is it's just going to be a product of two smaller rank analogs of the variety we began with. And the claim is that these kappa terms in the pre-stabilization may be expressed in terms of these varieties. And so this is the main theorem. And it's sort of a combination of work over the last few years, a couple papers in 2019, a paper last year, and also some work. And also some work in preparation. So, what I've been able to prove is that the elliptic part for this relative trace formula admits the following stabilization. So, here I'm assuming this term regular refers to a support condition at one place, which I may say something about later. But now the right-hand side, this original sum where I had a stable piece. Sum where I had a stable piece and then a bunch of other terms is now expressed as a finite sum of stable terms associated to these lower-rank endoscopic varieties. And so this is analogous to the stabilization of the elliptic part for the relative or for the Arthur Selberg trace formula, which is due to an enormous amount of work of many authors, including Langland, Shelstad, Kotwitz, Waltz-Bershet, and Goh. And go. And in particular, this is the first case of such a statement for a relative trace formula. And this actually has some very nice structure to it. There's somehow an inductive structure to it, the fact that these endoscopic varieties are also unitary Freeburg-Checay varieties. In particular, each of these endoscopic terms are smaller ranked versions of the Smaller rank versions of the stable part of the trace formula that we saw in the previous slide. And so each of these can be compared to lower rank versions of the Zhaozhang relative trace formula. And so the strategy of comparison should prove not only that conjecture, but also the non-tempered extension. Okay. So this is the main theorem, and it's taken This is the main theorem, and it's taken many steps in order to prove it. And so, what I would like to do for the remainder of this talk is I'd first like to explain how, in some generality, I define these endoscopic symmetric varieties. And that will lead us to a form of a pre-stabilization for a relatively general relative trace formula. And then I'll turn back to the unitary Friedberg-Jacques case and explain. Case and explain the local harmonic analytic results, which allow me to prove this theorem, in particular the fundamental lemma. But before we do that, are there any questions? Okay. So now I'll move to the local field and try to explain where these kappa, how kappa orbital integrals are related to these endoscopic symmetric varieties. So let F be a local field of characteristic zero. So let f be a local field of characteristic zero. And so I'm just going to assume that x is what's called a regular semi-simple element. So there's again, in the general theory, there's this good notion of semi-simplicity so that my orbital integrals are all well behaved and converge. And so what we're seeing on the geometric side of the pre-stabilized trace formula were these kappa orbital integrals. These kappa orbital integrals. So here, my sum is ranging over the rational orbit inside the stable orbit of x, and I have a cohomological invariant which detects the relative position between these two rational orbits inside the stable orbit. And so that gives me a class in H1 of the stabilizer. And kappa here is just a character of this cohomology group. And as was pointed out earlier, And as was pointed out earlier, I'm really working with relative orbital integrals here. So this is an orbit over a point in this variety x. I just dropped the term relative. So what I now want to explain is how this character determines an associated endoscopic variety like was seen in the trace formulas stabilization. So I'm going to define. So, I'm going to define this in greater generality. So, if X is a symmetric variety, satisfying some assumptions so that I can talk meaningfully about a dual group, then using work of Nadler, Gates-Scorey, and Kanop-Shalky, there's a good notion of a dual group on the Languin's dual side, equipped with a morphism such that Such that if T is a maximal torus of my group G, then it generically, for a generically chosen torus, it will act through some quotient. And this is called the canonical torus associated to the variety X. And there's a diagram on the dual side where G check is my dual group of G, G X check is the dual group for the variety. And this morphism realizes. And this morphism realizes this quotient Ax check as the maximal torus of GX check. So we want this diagram to commute. And this is an important diagram in the context of the relative length program because briefly, the Soklaritis-Fankatesh conjectures seek to parametrize the spectrum, both locally and globally, of the variety X in terms of parameters of Arthur parameters, which factor through this morphism. Through this morphism. And so in our case, G is GL2N, and GX check is SP2N. And so an important observation here is that FP2N is a symmetric subgroup of GL2N. And so this actually holds in general. In our case of assuming that I have a symmetric variety, there exists a complex dual symmetric variety, which essentially goes back to ideas of Nadler in his thesis. Goes back to ideas of Nadler in his thesis, which I'll call X check, where again g x check is the dual group of x, but now there's some distinguished levy sitting inside g, which for the purposes of this talk, we'll just assume is equal to g check itself. Okay, so this is the tool we're going to use in order to define these endoscopic symmetric spaces. How do we relate it to these characters kappa? So there's a couple of diagrams. There's a couple of diagrams. If we start off with a regular semi-simple point X, then its centralizer HX sits in a short exact sequence of the following form. So here, T is a maximal torus in G, and Ax is that quotient through which it acts on X from the previous slide. And so if I dualize this sequence, I have the following short exact sequence of complex dual tori. Short exact sequence of complex dual tori. And the point is that this extends the diagram from the previous slide, where now is acting on this symmetric space, X check, through the quotient, which is the dual of my centralizer. And so this is the important observation because using Tate-Nakiyama duality, these characters that we saw on the geometric. These characters that we saw on the geometric, on the pre-stabilization can be related to Galois fixed points in this dual torus. And so it takes a bit of working, but we using this and ranging over all possible choices involved, this character kappa induces a GX check orbits on this symmetric variety. And so how does that? And so, how does that give us our symmetric space? Well, we use the theory of descent. So, given a character kappa, we thus obtain semi-simple elements in my dual variety. And using a notion of descent, which is, as was mentioned in Professor Delorme's talk this morning, is the notion of a boundary degeneration. Then the point kappa gives rise to a Then the point kappa gives rise to a following diagram. So here kappa is a point in x check, and there's a notion of a centralizer group GX kappa or G kappa that sits in a diagram of this form. Can you guys see my cursor, by the way? Yes. Okay, good. And so here, this square here is going to be Cartesian. square here is going to be Cartesian and G check kappa acts on this symmetric variety and produces the orbit of kappa G X kappa check. And so the point here is that this is some smaller dimensional analog of this quotient to the dual symmetric variety here. Spencer, is the kappa for the G-Chat kappa a lift of the kappa? Check kappa a lift of the kappa? Do you need to make a choice there? Yes, when you're in the non-elliptic setting, you do have to make a choice. And so there's a bit more a bit more to say there. But in general, when working on the relative, in the relative setting, you want to work with all pure inner forms to begin with. And so certain amounts of the lift is kind of forced on you. Forced on you. But at least in the case of the symmetric, the Friedberg-Jacques periods, if X was elliptic, then we could just get a kappa as opposed to a lift. But I thought it's AX check goes to T check goes to the quotient, and you have an element in X, HX check, and you have an element in HX check. That's the kappa. How do you get a kappa back in T check? Get a Kappa back in teach? Oh, so this is again, I'm using the fact this short exact sequence here. Um, it it's there's a notion of a maximal split torus. This was associated, this is a symmetric variety. And so there's actually a splitting here. We can embed this as a sub torus. That's in some, I mean, there's many components of this argument which fundamentally rely on. Which fundamentally rely on the fact that we're working with symmetric varieties rather than a more general spherical variety. Actually, yeah, so at least the arguments do. It's not clear to me how to avoid that in this case. Okay, thanks. Yeah. Okay, so I have this descent diagram. And the point here is that this diagram provably is dual to a Is dual to a symmetric variety for the appropriate endoscopic group of G. And so this is a theorem. So if X is regular semi-simple and kappa is one of these characters, then there exists an F rational symmetric variety unique up to isomorphism of the quasi-split endoscopic group G kappa, such that this top row here is dual to X kappa. And so this And so this is where the notion of endoscopic space comes from, the fact that we can actually produce these varieties. And the real point here is existence of this symmetric variety over F bar is pretty straightforward using the structure theory. It's the rationality, the appropriate F form, which is not obvious. And so this uses some refined work of Helmink on rationality of symmetric varieties. But once we have this, now we have a procedure for producing the notion of an endoscopic symmetric variety. And so we would like to use this to affect a notion of stabilization for the relative trace formula. And so the point here is that this actually can be done. Starting off, we can relate stable orbits between these two varieties so we can hope to compare. Two varieties so that we can hope to compare stable orbital integrals and kappa orbital integrals. So, more precisely, if I let x be my symmetric variety and x kappa be as before this endoscopic space, then there exists a morphism of invariant quotients, which gives rise to a matching point matching of stable semi-simple orbits. So, this is a generalization of the point comparison in the theory of endoscopy to the case derived. To the case, the relative setting, and so it allows us to compare stable orbits on X to those on the endoscopic variety. And in a work in preparation, you can use this theory to affect the pre-stabilization of the relative trace formula for a very general class of symmetric varieties, where again, here I have my stable term, and these cap out terms have been packaged where the sum is ranging over isomorphism. Is ranging over isomorphism classes of elliptic, relative, and discostic data. And so at this point, what's missing from the stabilization is the theory of transfer factors and the local harmonic analytic results actually matching the Kepler orbital intervals. And so this is what distinguishes, well, so this, right. Right. So, what I want to now do is now that I've explained where these elliptic endoscopic varieties come from, I'd like to turn back to the case of unitary Freeberg-Jucke periods and complete the stabilization. So, in this case, the point is that there does exist a good notion of transfer factor. Exists a good notion of transfer factors. And by good notion, I mean I can explicitly match kappa orbital integrals on X with stable orbital integrals on these endoscopic spaces. And this regularly supported condition is what came up in the statement of the theorem. There's some support condition I have to put on the functions f at current. So a few statements is that A few statements is that this comparison of orbital integrals actually only exists when I include pure inner forms on both sides. And so in particular, it's probably best to state this in terms of matching of orbital integrals on quotient stacks, but in any case, I don't want to introduce that for this talk. And this regular support constraint comes from the depth. Support constraint comes from the definition I have of the transfer factor, which relies on the fact that there's an algebraic morphism from my variety to the space of n by n Hermitian matrices. And over the regular, the smooth locus of this map, everything works out fine. And so I just need to impose a support condition on my functions so that it avoids the singular locus of this map. But using global But using global techniques during for current work, this will be, I can remove this, or I plan to remove this, but that's work in progress. And that work relies on the fundamental lemma. And so let me go ahead and state that. So in this case, we have the following fundamental lemma that the basic function, which since my variety here is smooth, is just the indicator function. Smooth is just the indicator function for my integral points. The capital orbital integrals of the basic function match the stable orbital integrals of the basic function on my endoscopic varieties. And so this statement here is really the analytic core of the stabilization. Much of the work for the main theorem sort of reduces to this statement. And so for the last seven or eight minutes, I want to say a few. I want to say a few words about its proof, but before I do so, are there any questions at this point? Okay, so the first step in the proof is a reduction to the Lie algebra. And since I'm working on a variety, what I really mean here is the reduction to the tangent space at the distinguished point. Distinguished point of my variety, which is as a vector space representation of my group H, is just identifiable with the space of n by n matrices over the quadratic extension E. And so that gives me the following explicit matching of orbital integrals. And so this second theorem, the linearized version, as is the case with the fundamental lemma. Fundamental lemma for the Arthur Selberg trace formula. The main part of the proof was proving this linearized version. In that case, this was famously work of and Goh. But before, and so I want to say a few words about how this proof goes. But before I do that, I just want to point out that this reduction relies on proving that in the context of p-adic symmetric varieties, there's a good notion of There's a good notion of a topological Jordan decomposition. And so that allows me to systematically reduce these orbital integrals or descend these orbital integrals to the Lie algebra. And so I just want to say that because I'd be very interested if people who think about explicit formulas for characters using these decompositions, if this result may have any applications for the relative characters in the setting. Relative characters in this setting. Okay, so with that, I want to say a few words about how this fundamental lemma is proved. So as a brief outline, the idea is to reduce this explicit matching to a fundamental lemma for a full Heke algebra, or maybe more precisely, a module for a Hecke algebra associated to a stabilization of a different trace formula. So which stabilization is a formulation? So, which stabilization is that? I take my large variety y to be the space of non-degenerate Hermitian matrices, and I want to stabilize the relative trace formula associated to these unitary periods on GLN. And using the theory from earlier in the talk, this will be stabilized with respect to the endoscopic varieties associated to these products of. Associated to these products of Hermitian non-degenerate matrices, Hermitian matrices of rank N and rank B. And so once I reduce the fundamental lemma to this more general statement, I then use a series of reductions of orbital integrals and ultimately prove this statement using a comparison of relative trace formulas. So let me say a few more words about that. So I want to explain. So, I want to explain this reduction. So, I mentioned that in the fundamental lemma on the Lie algebra, we're looking at an indicator function of integer matrices over the quadratic extension E, but we're only evaluating this at regular semi-simple elements. And so, a happy occurrence in this situation is that a regular semi-simple element here. Is that a regular semi-simple element here is actually necessarily invertible, and so we can actually just consider things despite the support of our function, we can only need only consider things where x is invertible. And so using the map, just taking a matrix to itself times its conjugate transpose, I get a map to this symmetric space, we can analyze this kappa orbital integral by analyzing orbital integrals of the non- Analyzing orbital integrals of the non-compactly supported function given by pushing forward along this map R. And so the nice thing about this is that this push forward, despite originally just being invariant with respect to the unitary groups that we're studying, this has additional invariance with respect to this larger compact group, G Ln over O. And so what we're reduced to is studying kappa orbital integrals of functions. orbital integrals of functions in this space of G L N O E invariant functions on the space of n by n Hermitian matrices. And so this is naturally a module for a certain Hecke algebra. And so this hopefully motivates the following explicit comparison of orbital integrals. So what I do is So, what I do is I introduce a weighted parabolic descent that sits in the following diagram. So, here I have my spherical Hecke algebra on GL and E, and it pushes forward along that same map we saw on the previous slide to give me functions on my symmetric variety. And I also have a parabolic descent to the tensor product of Hecke algebras on some Levy subgroup, GL and A, G L and E. So G L and A, G L and E. And on this space, we can also push forward to this endoscopic variety YA cross Y B. Then the theorem is that the two paths you can take in this diagram gives rise to explicit transfers of orbital integrals. So what I mean here is that Yn sits as an open subvariety in the space of n by n Hermitian matrices, which is naturally identified. Which is naturally identified with the Lie algebra of a unitary group. And so it makes sense in the context of endoscopy on Lie algebras to ask about comparing orbital integrals on yn, kappa orbital integrals on yn to stable orbital integrals on this endoscopic space, because this is just sitting densely inside unitary Lie algebras. And so what this theorem shows is that if I take a spherical function. That if I take a spherical function in this Hecke algebra, take its parabolic descent and push forward, the stable orbital integral of that function is equal to the kappa orbital integral of its push forward to the larger variety. And here, my delta is just the Langlands Shell-Stad transfer factor on this unitary algebra. And the point is that this implies the previous theorem. So we can prove the fundamental limit for unitary Freeboot JK periods if we can prove this matching of orbital integrals for this entire Hecke algebra. How many minutes should I can I take two more minutes? Sure, that's fine. Okay, thanks. Okay, so we've now We've now reduced it to this statement. And so, in order to prove this, I need to use what I think are honestly two extremely beautiful results on orbital integrals. So I kind of wanted to get to this slide just to advertise some results that are not mine. So the first result is due to Zhingwei Zhao in his thesis from 2019. So, okay, so what I've done is I've reduced this to a statement of Reduce this to a statement of explicit transfers on unitary Lie algebras or stated in terms of Hermitian matrices. And so what Jingwei does is he actually gives a new proof for the endoscopic transfer on these spaces of Hermitian matrices, showing that he can recover endoscopic transfer as a limit of the Jacques-Rawlis transfer of relative orbital integrals between integrals between a space of this form where Vn is just the n by n Hermitian or sorry the n-dimensional Hermitian space so En with a Hermitian form and orbital integrals on gln across Fn and Fn dual. So this is I think a very beautiful theorem and how it's used And how it's useful for me is that using this new proof, I can reduce the fundamental limma on yn to a novel explicit transfer statement between spherical functions on these spaces. And so one more result is necessary, which I also think is a truly beautiful result on orbital integrals. It's a result of Raphael Bazar. It's a result of Raphael Bazar Plessy, who studies the Vay representation of an SL2 on smooth functions on this space. And he uses this Vay representation to give a new proof for the fundamental lemma for Jacques-Reyl's transfer. But what I do is I take, I generalize his idea to reduce the explicit transfer of orbital integrals here to an explicit transfer of orbital integrals on these smaller spaces. And the reason that I want to do And the reason that I want to do that is because now I'm in a situation where I can relate this transfer of orbital integrals to a spectral statement and use global techniques. So what I mean here is I have the space of n by n Hermitian matrices and n by n matrices. So now I'm just going to pass the invertible locus. So I have a diagram of the following form. The spherical Hecke algebra that I had at the beginning maps. Had at the beginning maps via this push forward to spherical functions on y, which is dense inside Hermitian matrices. And I have the base change map to the Hecke algebra on G Ln over F. And so the theorem is that if I consider Jacques-Rolis transfer between these two spaces, functions on Hermitian matrices and functions on GLN, then I can relate relative orbital. Orbital relative orbital integrals on functions in these two spaces. And so the theorem is that for any spherical function phi, the functions R phi and B C phi are transfers. And so this is the final form of the fundamental lemma. And in order to prove it, I prove this by introducing a new comparison of relative trace formulas. The point here is that now I'm in a situation where both sides can be interpreted spectrally. Interpreted spectrally. And by globalizing and using results of Fagan-Lopiedoffen on unitary periods, I can prove the result. Okay, so I'll stop there.
