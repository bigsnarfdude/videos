I'm Dahi Stone. I'm coming from New Zealand right now. I have a confession to make. I'm a climatologist. My understanding of statistics is formally based on two early year university degrees, and my formal education on causation is nil. And therefore, I've built a career on statistical analysis to understand causation in. Analysis to understand causation in climate change. So basically, it's provided like using for other simple statistics for detection and attribution purposes, understanding long-term trends, what Limbo is kind of talking about, structured models there, usually multiple linear regression. But what I'll talk about today is the other thing, and Orle Liam was mentioning this as well yesterday, about what we call event attribution, so understanding extreme weather that's occurring. So, understanding extreme weather that's occurring now in the context of climate change, which is done more in terms of the probable cause, wasn't the technique he was, that was what Limbo was calling it yesterday. It's more that sort of technique we use. And this talk will, the purpose of this talk is in many ways to not talk about statistical inference at all or anything like how we actually went about the details of this. We actually went about the details of this, but to give an impression of the different types of data sources we have to work with when we're looking at this sort of problem and what difference it makes and how they can be very different. So nowadays we have this case where an extreme weather event happens. This is a picture from one of the two roads, well, then into Wellington in December. That third one is actually. In December. That third one has actually since opened after many years of delay. And this is actually the way I need to get into Wellington from my house along the coast. And you hear about earthquakes and volcanic eruptions for New Zealand, but those are actually reasonably rare. The thing that happens monthly are landslips, which are entirely related to heavy rainfall events and occasionally flooding. And occasionally flooding as well, but particularly landslips. And so here's one that's blocked off the main road. And so the country is built up on this resilience idea. Just the landslips happen, you clear it out of the way and rebuild the road if you need to and just wait until the next time it happens. There's no real prevention work. So a common thought process though is humans are affecting the climate. You know, so okay, extreme weather is part of the climate, therefore. Part of the climate. Therefore, are emissions involved in this event? There are a number of ways you can look at this. The one I'm going to focus on is kind of the factual-counterfactual comparison. So the factual case is the climate that we have right now, which sometimes you'll see here is called all-forcing. So just includes all of the factors that we know about. And then a counterfactual, which is And then a counterfactual, which is where you remove all of the anthropogenic, all of the effects that humans have had on the climate, and you're left just with all the natural cases, volcanic eruptions, variations in the solar intensity still happen. And so sometimes I'll call that natural. And so we're looking at an extreme tail. And again, there are a number of ways you could look at this. One is that you have One is that you have so two possible metrics are where you have you're concerned about a specific fixed threshold that you don't want to exceed. And in that case, you're looking at how the probability changes between those and a popular metric. And the simple one for that is the risk ratio, sometimes called the probability ratio, which is just the ratio of the two probabilities. And another one is actually where you're looking at a certain return level, and you're just so a certain probability, and you're looking at the shift in this case horizontally in terms of how the magnitude changes between those two events. And you just look at that difference. And of course, the problem, or one of the problems, the biggest problem we have probably is that we can't actually observe the natural count. Can't actually observe the natural counterfactual. We don't have, it doesn't exist. You could do various things, perhaps looking at the past, but that gets a bit complicated. And you're still, you're fundamentally limited on how much data you have then. First of all, you can only do that for in terms of observations for a few locations in the world, not many. And even there, you're looking at 100 years of data. It's not that much. So, the other approach then is to work with dynamical models of the climate system. So, computers that actually simulate computer codes that actually simulate the weather. This is a snapshot from some simulations being done by Peter Gibson. And it helps. I'll be focusing on New Zealand here, which is right in the middle of the map. It's a little hard to see against the cloud there. But this is kind of a typical situation in New Zealand where you have this long. This long linear flow, a thin flow of moisture, not just what the color is there, coming in and slamming into the 1,500 kilometer long wall of mountains that is New Zealand. And all the moisture falls out as soon as it hits the mountains and has to go over. And so you get situations. Milford Sound gets about 10 meters of rainfall a year. You can have urban areas that get 500 millimeters in a day. In a day. So, Aurelien talked about these models a bit yesterday, but he talked about a very specific kind, which is, I'm going to call here the Global Earth System model. And these are the kinds you find in the CMIP project that Audrey was talking about. The idea of these models is that they simulate everything relative to the climate. So, not just the atmosphere, not just the ocean and the land, but also. Just the ocean and the land, but also all the various ice processes, including ice sheets, chemistry of the atmosphere, and also the biosphere to some degree as well. These are designed to address the most general questions, usually about global climate change. And so, if you're looking at extreme weather, you'd be talking about the effect of humans on a The effect of humans on a class of events generally, with no conditions attached, other than, of course, that you're using this particular model to look at it. There are a few issues with these models. One is that computational limitations on the spatial resolution or computational limits mean that you can't go beyond a certain spatial resolution, really, or sample size in terms of running the simulation over and over again with slightly different initial conditions. Slightly different initial conditions and letting chaos create a pseudo-statistical ensemble for you. And this is an example of these collections of models. The highest resolution one is about 100 kilometers and resolution. And this is what New Zealand looks like in that model. And if you're looking at that and saying, oh yeah, that's New Zealand, you've got quite a good imagination. And a very important thing is that you don't have any mountains. You don't have any mountains there. So it's hard to see in this plot. In the gray area, the Tago there, we're looking at an extreme weather event. I'm plotting the atmospheric circulation and the low atmosphere during the time of the three wettest days that you can find in these model simulations that we have from this model. And in all the cases, the flow is coming from the north. Is coming from the northwest, where, of course, that's where, as I was pointing, that's where the typical flow you get in New Zealand, where the moisture is coming in. But of course, that makes no sense because in reality, you have mountains in the way that will block that, and you're in the dry lee of those mountains in the rain shadow. And so, the actual way that you get an extreme weather event on that coast, on the east coast, is by when those systems come over across. When those systems come over across to the north and then loop around and come in from the east. And Richard will appreciate that in New Zealand, they call them in-swingers after a cricket term. Another issue is that they have substantial biases at regional scales. Just hooking the atmosphere and the ocean together amplifies their biases. And you can have a situation maybe where low. You can have a situation maybe where locally the ocean is too cold by a couple of degrees, and that can have a huge difference on what it does in terms of extreme weather. You don't get the spatial gradients and so on that you get. So actually, I mean, this is a special case with New Zealand, but I actually don't like looking at these models for extreme weather generally. I don't think they do a good job. They're not designed to do that unless you're looking at very large-scale sorts of things like the globe or maybe the El Nino, you know, what's happening. Maybe the El Niño, you know, what happens in the tropical Pacific in terms of the El Niño southern oscillation. Another option is to simplify things, realize that you don't really need ice sheets or the biosphere or anything like that. And so you simplify the modeling. And hey, why don't we throw out the ocean while we're at it as well? And so you just retain the atmosphere in these models. And you impose the observed ocean temperatures. For your natural counterfactual. For your natural counterfactual, what you'll then do is cool the ocean according to some estimate of the attributable warming due to human activities, as well as reducing the greenhouse gas concentrations and so on. So this is a conditional question. It's conditional on a given ocean state, which could matter quite a bit if you're, say, in Peru, where it's kind of all dictated on whether you're having an El Niño or not. Whether you're having an El Nino or not, but in mid-latitudes, perhaps less so. A big advantage of this is that it's computationally parallelizable. I think that's a word. So basically, it's not so much that throwing out the ocean and everything makes the model all that much faster because the chemistry is a big deal, but the atmosphere is the main slow bit of these models anyway. But because the ocean has a very fast spin-up time, you can actually run just a year. You just have to worry about give it a couple of weeks or so for chaos to help diverge and give you a pseudo-ensemble. So actually, you can parallelize this. And there's, for instance, a project called Weather at Home, which some of you, I think it's been mentioned a few times already, where they run these models on home PC. These models on home PCs by people around the world. And we'll look at it in a moment. And they can do thousands of simulations because of that. Another advantage, and actually I think the biggest one in my view is that you remove the ocean biases and as much as our observations are good. And that helps reduce some of the atmospheric biases as well. And so, but with the computational efficiency, this is the sort of resolution you get. This is the sort of resolution you get. Oh, actually, it is weather at home that I've got up there. So you're looking at about 50-kilometer resolution in that one. Now, New Zealand's starting to look a bit recognizable. You've got the Southern Alps, the mountainous spine there. And if you look at the, if you can see those arrows in that plot on the side, and see that it's now producing its extreme rainfall on the East Coast for the right reason. We can go further while we're doing that and do something rather different. And do something rather different and think about design experiments. So, what about using a weather forecast? They're actually the things that we use to understand extreme weather, particularly in real time. And you can ask the question: well, what if we changed that weather forecast and naturalized it? So, do what we've been doing before, put the greenhouse gas concentrations to 280. Greenhouse gas concentrations to 280 parts per million, cool the ocean, but also cool the initial conditions in the atmosphere and reduce the moisture accordingly and rerun the forecast. So this is kind of the insurance companies have been using this sort of setup as a design storm experiment for quite some time, but not in the context of climate change. It addresses a very highly conditional question. So how would this event have different How would this event have diff this particular event? You're not looking at a class events, you're talking about this event. This event's going to happen either way. So we're ignoring on whether it would have happened or not. How would it have differed under this different environment? It's computationally very simple. It's also, there's already a workflow if you're doing this as it's happening in New Zealand with the Met service. Met service, there's already a workflow in place, really. You just have to set up a parallel workflow. And it's tied in with the official forecast. In the case, you know, here, the Met service in New Zealand are the official source of weather warnings. So you're tying it in with the authorities on extreme weather. One question we'll ask is whether Whether the problem you get when you do this, though, is you have to ask the question: is it actually the same storm in the end? And we have had this problem, and we'll see it momentarily, that if you have, if the conditions you've, that these perturbations you've imposed on it move the storm system so that it now hits the mountains 50 kilometers, 200 kilometers. 50 kilometers, 200 kilometers off, or a few hours later, it can change the entire way it interacts with topography or how you measure it as an extreme weather event on a given day. So in that case, you have to ask, is it actually the same weather event? And so that's something we're still grappling with because it does happen. So this technique has been used very effectively for tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones. For instance, you have Typhoon Haiyan Yolanda about eight years ago, I think, hit the Philippines. It was just an absolute monster. It was going to hit the Philippines no matter what perturbation you apply to it. The atmosphere would apply to it. It was just so big, it was going that way. And so you can then see how it fed differently and how its intensity differed because. its intensity differed because of that. I was involved in a project where we tried to do the same thing with Sandy, which was a complete disaster. Well, the project, the attempt was a complete disaster, because Sandy was all about how it hit the coast and when it hit. So any sort of, it ended up, we were, if you're off by about 10 kilometers, it changes the storm surge utterly. So it's all about the timing. So, it's all about the timing and the angle and everything. So, each of these experiments, as kind of pointed out, is asking a different question. You know, these are kind of what is the human effect on this type, this class of event, or perhaps the same question, but given a current oceanic state, like the El Niño state, to what is the human effect on this specific event? Event. So these differences might matter in terms of the kind of answer that you get, but that's fine as long as you know what your question is and you just follow that thing, that approach. But we cannot always be choosy about the way that we approach. The global earth system models might not be fit for purpose, as we've seen there. The design storm. The design storm approach might not work because the counterfactual forecast may be off. Or there might be a computational issue or the fact that we don't have a good forecast tool or something like that. So a question then that arises is how transferable are all these experiments? How can we use one of these experiments designs to answer the questions being addressed that should have been addressed with another experiment? This is sort of a bit of an example in the top. I'm just looking at, so you've got a couple of red is the top left there, probability density functions, kind of the unconditional ones in red, the big one in red for the factual and in blue for the counterfactual. And we're just looking at a linear shift of one degree Celsius here, a warming degree. Us here, a warming degree in this example. And then you gradually constrain through some sort of conditioning to a tighter distribution. And that will have an effect. It won't have any effect in this case on the temperature shift on the right-hand side there. You can look at the degree of the conditioning scale, the conditioning factor, as I've called it. But it will have an effect on the risk ratio, and that effect will depend. Risk ratio, and that effect will depend on where you're putting the threshold in relation to where you're conditioning on. And just, of course, there are other dimensions you can condition on. You can worry about seasonality. Are you just looking at the warm season or are you looking at the full year? And so, in terms of developing some sort of theory of conditionality, it's hugely multi-dimensional. It depends on the definition of the event, the nature of the event. Definition of the event, the nature of the conditioning, and the attribution metric you're actually using. Okay, so some empirical examples then. We've actually gone out and used all the data we can get or generate to look at this in an empirical sort of way. And so on these plots, just as a general rule of thumb, as you go from left to right, you're going to increasing degrees of conditioning. So on the left-hand side, we have Conditioning. So, on the left-hand side, we have the Earth system models that are free-running. In the middle, just the atmospheric models that are conditioned on the ocean state, and on the right-hand side, forecasts. At the top, we're looking at the risk ratio, so one would mean no change. And at the bottom, we're looking at the magnitude shift. And so this is a case for the Buller River catchment in which It was 700 millimeters fell in the catchment in places over two days. And Westport, which is the port downstream on the river, more or less completely flooded on account of it. So we can look at this event in the different models, and we can actually come up with uncertainty bounds through sampling, looking at the sampling error from the various types of climate models. Can't really do Models can't really do that with the forecasts, and I'll get into that in a moment. In this case, there seems to be enough, first of all, looked at these models, they're fit for purpose, kind of generally, according to our test of just having rain at the right time with the right kind of weather system. And we can kind of see here, there seems to be that the full running climate models seem to have higher attributable. Attributable effects in this particular case than the other cases. So, as you increase the degree of conditioning, the more actually there's no attributable effect, which is a bit. Okay. Which actually is probably not what we would have expected. But you can look at other cases. This is Canterbury on the east coast, just a little north of the region I was showing on the maps earlier. And in this case, so we're on the east coast. In this case, so we're on the east coast. None of the global earth system models are fit for purpose. A lot of the atmospheric models aren't. So we have a much more restricted case that we can look at here. And therefore, it's hard to see any sort of systematic difference across them. The main point in this plot actually is why we actually need to do this study so that we can understand whether these few points that we have for a place like Canterbury can be interpreted. Can be interpreted in a much more general state. Finally, there's this case. So in April 2017, a ex-tropical cyclone hit North Island, and it was an extreme weather event across the entire island. So an area of about 100,000 square kilometers. And in this case, while we had models kind of fit for purpose. Kind of fit for purpose in the sense of generating it. Maybe some of them aren't so good, they don't generate tropical cyclones as such. So maybe they're not good, but we still looked at them. And in this case, the forecasts are estimating a much higher attributable effect. And the reason for this is actually because the perturbation has this tropical cyclone hit the North Island slightly differently and slightly a little more to the west. And so a lot of it kind of misses. To the west, and so a lot of it kind of misses in this naturalized setting. That's that's that was a bit of a surprise for me because I thought it was a big storm system hitting a big target, but it ends up it makes something of a difference. So we have to wonder about how robust that result is in the situation. For the forecasts, there, the The forecasts there, so we actually have 22 different forecasts, I think, for each scenario. There's a deterministic forecast, so the real forecast as such, and then there are these perturbed ones that they do. And so there's a parallel kind of match between the natural and all the factual and counterfactual ensembles in these perturbations. And so just looking at how these different At how these different spread of these matches across them for the next wettest events in there. The problem is that we can't interpret these in a probabilistic sort of way because some of these forecasts actually don't have an extreme weather event happening. And so, you know, when you then perturb and suddenly this situation is having an extreme and this one isn't, it's it you're becoming. You're coming into a bit of a selection effect. So, we've really just had to stick with the forecast and then look at a robustness kind of measure. It would be nice to do this in a more statistical sort of way, so that would be something to think about. Finally, sampling uncertainties are large enough across experiments that it's hard to identify systematic differences. You saw the uncertainty bounds there. Bounds there. It's that the sampling uncertainties are really, in many ways, for these sorts of events, anyway, the largest source of uncertainty, I think, for our limit on our understanding of what's going on still. The weather forecast experiment method is still at an early stage of development, but it is coming. I think there are a lot of things that we're having that are difficult in terms of using it, but this is early days for using that sort of tool. Sort of tool. And you can just look back and into the global climate models, you had the same sort of situation early on where they were kind of doing all sorts of things. We kind of eventually learned how to use them properly. So learning how to use those, including in the statistical sense, would be rather important going towards the future. Generally, actually, for rainfall events, the experiments appear to be rather. Experiments appear to be rather transferable within the New Zealand setting. There are some qualifications that's within this large uncertainty that you get from sampling. It's a bit different when you come to temperature because the forecasts are really restricting what you're doing. And so the risk ratios then become enormous for temperature. I think we're still at an early stage of understanding our event attribution tools. Our event attribution tools. And so, this is this is part of the process, part of the purpose of this talk and kind of moving forward. That's something we need to worry about. And I think I'm on time.
