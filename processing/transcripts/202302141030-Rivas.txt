Well, good morning everyone. Of course I want to thank Mario Coloniser for the invitation to speak here today. It's the first time in Canada and this public place. Okay, my target is going to be a tutorial reviewing some ideas of Markovianity by using quantum Markovianity by using. Using quantum market by using divisibility conditions, you know, physical motivations and comparison with other approaches. So maybe most of you are familiar with what I am going to explain, but I don't know. This is not working. Okay, yes, now it's working. Well, this is the outline, okay, roughly, so to say. So we will speak about the problem of the problem of normal community in the state dynamics. Then we comment on classical and quantum divisibility conditions, the difference between one-time and multi-time measurement approaches in quantum mechanics. And also similarities and differences between another approach, which is known as informational backflow approach. And finally, some conclusions. I have tried to present this, I think, no results, but kind of different perspectives, so that could be interesting for a lot of the outside. But I want to say here a little But I want to say clearly that most of the material is material snow, I think. Many of this. Okay. And sponsors and collaborators during many years, Susanna Aguela, Martin Plenio, Andrei Kosakowski, Darius Kuszynski, and Evin Astronomer. So, what is the problem? The problem I want to address today is. The problem I want to address today is this. Well, dynamical equations tell us the current state of physical systems, conditional, onto the states they took in the past. This is essentially what we call initial conditions, right? Now, the question is, how old is this time dependence? Time dependence. Is the current state of a system evolution determined by its immediate past state? Its immediate pass state, or does it depend in a non-trivial way on its remote passes too? Is all the physical information about the present state contained immediately in the immediately passed state, or is there some non-trivial information contained in past states? How can this be determined? This is the kind those are the kind of questions that I'm going to to address today. To address today. Okay? So let's start with the classical problem. Adys. Okay? Adys can be viewed to have six states, six pure states, one, two, three, four, five, and six usual dice. And we may consider a sequence of time instance, okay? An ordered sequence of time instantaneous. Sequence of time instance. And then Andrei Markov in 1906 look at this kind of problems, the dependency of the current state with the state of the past, by using probabilities. You know, he introduced, well, there were previous works by Vanrugi and others, but he systematized the problem. Systematized the problem by using these joint probabilities, okay, multi-time joint probabilities, such that we define the conditional probability by usual definition. And then he introduced what now is known as Markov condition, which is this equation here that was presented yesterday. It was presented yesterday in several attacks, which essentially says this, which is written here, which is a paraphrasing of some sentences in the Markov work. The state at time di is independent of the states at time ti minus 2, ti minus 3, in the case that the state at time ti minus 1 is known. Okay? So, this means to say that all physical information about Physical information about the present state is contained in the immediately past state. There is no information contained in past states which is not present already in the current state. Sometimes when we speak about Markovianity memory efforts and so on, we say that, well, Markovianity means essentially that the state of the system is independent of the previous Independent of the previous initial states, or better say that we have a nomarkovian evolution if the state of the system depends on the initial state that I took. And this is not correct, because of course we have some initial conditions. We change the initial conditions, we change the final state. But the point is that if we know the immediate impassive state, we do not care about. State, we do not care about the initial, the previous conditions. This is the proper, so to say, IV Markov condition. Okay, the Markov condition can be rewritten in terms of joint probabilities. I'm using this chain rule for probabilities. This is just the definition of conditional probability, and I apply here. probability and I apply here the definition of conditional probability and I obtain this but then using the Markov condition this probability here this can be just written as this okay and this is satisfied to any order okay so this you may see this as a probability as a property of the visibility of probabilities okay probabilities the joint The joint probability can be divided, if you want, in the concatenation of conditional probabilities to each intermediate, to each immediately passed state. Okay, so i to i minus 1, i minus 1 to i minus 2, and so on. Okay, so this is just an inspiration to get this keyword. Uh get this keyword invisibility in the button case and we're going to to comment it align. Well this is another way to to write this equation by moving this drawing. So the quantum problem I'm going to address today is a similar one, but now instead of a dice, a classical system, a coin, we have At point, we have that the pure states of quantum systems are unit trace projections on the Hilbert space. We have here a sequence of, I don't know, spin perhaps, okay, on an time sequence. Ah, by the way, I have forgotten to comment here that this kind of That this kind of conditions we are going to apply, we usually consider this kind of conditions when this T actually represents time. But it could represent whatever thing. It could represent space, could represent any order, any other it takes values on any order, any other. Yeah, order itself. Okay. Now. Now, let's assume for a minute that we focus on closed, so informationally solid systems. The point is that in these quantum systems, the dynamical evolution is not arbitrary, but it's given by the Schrodinger or form-Reimban equation. Okay? So the dynamical evolution of this system is given in terms of a Given in terms of a two-parameter family of unitary operators to satisfy the Schrodinger equation, taking h bar units, I mean h bar equal to one units, I'm using that unit, and I will use that unit throughout the talk. And then, because of these properties of these unitary families, these two parameter unitary families, then we can write the, let's say, pure state at time. Let's say, pure state at time ti as a concatenation of unitaries applying on some particular initial state. Now, this, what we have here, is actually the state at time t i minus 1. So, again, rephrasing Markov, the state at time ti is independent of the state at time. is independent of the state at time t i minus 2 t i minus 3 in case that we know this particular state because this state is just the application of this unitary evolution natural evolution in informationally isolated systems or closed systems to this particularized so one would expect that this evolution uh quantum evolution to be Markovian okay because of this fact and this can be This can be formalized, so we can make an attempt to construct a probability definition, trying to reproduce the Markov condition which appears in the classical set. For that, we are going to use the following notation. So, I'm going to introduce this P of psi as this projector. Psi as this projector, so psi will be a label here, and this calligraphic u as this, for instance, the typical evolution of density matrix. So u, x, u dagger. Now, the probability to find the system at the state psi, to say pure state psi, at the time t, conditional it was at the state phi at time t. At the state phi, at time s is just given by this. And this is just the point rule. This is the initial, this is the state at time s. This is the evolution, unitary evolution in this case from the state from s to t, and this is the projector on this particular state. So we can write this as a conditional probability. And this is just a small rule of quantum mechanics. One rule of quantum mechanics, nothing like that. Then we can also construct multi-time probabilities by applying a sequence of measurement operators on a system at a particular time state, for instance, time instance. For instance, here we have some initial citimatics. We have We apply, we make a measurement on these basis, on the basis that I call size zero, and I apply the unitary and so on and so on. And this calligraphic P is this with two sides projectors. Now, working a little bit with this expression, we immediately obtain these expressions, which is completely analogous to the Markov condition. To the Markov condition. So, this action here is given by this. And these ones are these conditional probabilities that I have defined in the previous slide. Of course, so well, it seems that this Markovian this unitary evolution indeed satisfies the Markovian conditions also by Conditions. Also, by formulating it, we use using probabilities. Of course, there is a catch here that this is a violation of a common law of consistency conditions. I think this was recommended yesterday several times. Making a measurement here is not the same as taking marginals in the complete. I mean, not making measurements, not making a measurement. Measurements, not making a measurement is not the same as making sticky margins. Here, again, psi is a label of a possible, that labels are particular vexes. The vexes that you want at every time is there. It's completely there. Okay. What about open quantity systems? Well, let's assume first the whole First of all, that T0 is the initial time instance for the system-environment interaction. In that case, the initial condition is factorized, and we can describe the evolution by substituting unitary operators by dynamical maps, general dynamical maps, which are stress-preserving and completely positive dynamical maps. Under these conditions, this is possible. And then we might wonder: what is And then we might wonder, when is the previous construction using these probabilities valid in this case? For that to be valid, we need to be able to decompose this dynamical map in a sequence of maps, in such a way if we introduce these conditional probabilities, again invoking the Bohr rule. The bond rule. These guys are indeed conditional probabilities, are indeed probabilities. And for that, we need that every map here in the decomposition is positive and transpositive. When a dynamical map satisfies this condition, this dynamical map is known to be uh P D V C P D V C. Basically, basically. Uh here you assume that this is valid for any choice of the time, or you fix the time. Well, the thing is that you have a continuous time. We may assume that time is a continuous line, right? And then we pick some particular We pick some particular subset of times. And I assume that this decomposition is valid for any partition that you pick. And it doesn't matter of the number of partitions, when you pick the time. What does the P mean and P divisibility? Positive divisibility. Positive. The visibility. Positive. Positive. Yeah. So this map has to be positive, okay, in order to this object here to be understood as a probability because this basis is completely arbitrary. So we need that the action of this map on this projector is a positive operator, such that this, well, otherwise, this trace is not, it could be negative. So in order to So, in order to understand this object here as a conditional probability, as a probability, we impose that these maps are positive-serving and trace-preserving. And this condition is known as VT-BCB. So, then we can introduce A multi-time or let's say a joint probability by considering this expression. In fully analogy to the case of the unitary dynamics, just substituting the unitary evolution by the dynamical map. And then, again, working a little bit with this, we obtain this, which is a Markov condition. We obtain this, which is a Markov condition. Sorry, beginning back. Yeah, doesn't complete positivity imply positivity? Yes. So I mean I got to comment complete positivity just in a minute. Okay, but you're assuming that your E is a CP, right? I mean it's no. Yeah, okay. Thank you for that question. This is CP for this, okay? But just for this p in this condition. Here we fixed the initial state. Here we fix the initial state, has to be completely positive, and now in the interval. Okay, maybe it's not in the interval. Here, this is completely positive, but these guys could be just positive in this definition. What is the problem of PD visibility? The problem of PD visibility, to assume that P divisibility, one of the problems, because there are several ones. There are several ones. But one of the problems is that this definition of Mark Homianity for dynamical maps is not stable under TESOL products. So we have this dynamical map and we say, okay, it's P divisible and then the evolution is Macopian. But it may happen that the same dynamical map in the presence of another system which makes nothing Which makes nothing, okay, which is just a static system and does not interact with the system, such that the dynamical map of that system is this, this may be not P divisible, despite that this can be despite that this is pd visible, this can be made be non-divisible. And the same if we have two copies of this. We have two copies of this. And this is quite strange, right? Because surely it doesn't happen in the classical case. And if we assume that this p-divisibility is a good definition of quantum Markovianity, we are never sure that the pollution is really Markovian because we are never sure if there is an. Never sure if there is another system in our laboratory, if you want, which does not interact with our system, the system we are studying, such that the real, I mean the total evolution is this. And the way to make stable this definition is to use the CPD visibility condition, which is the same condition as the previous. Condition as the previous slide, but now the intermediate evolutions are not only positive but completely positive. Completely positive and trace per second. And this is the idea of the quantum Markovianity defined by CPD visibility. Okay, so dynamical mass, which are Markovian, according to According to this criterion, they are form a two-parameter family of completely positive and first-person points for any time TS and R or T S larger than the initial time T Actually this condition can be graduated if you want by considering this k positive positive divisibility. And in this divisibility in this divisibility condition, the intermediate dynamical maps are K-positive map. Okay. Okay, if this is if this is, are you familiar with K-positive maps? No? So a map whatever a map is positive Map is positive, you know, it it it connects positive operators with positive operators. It is one positive, or let's say k positive, if this map is also positive. This is an identity in the space of dimension k. And if this is true for every k, the map is completely positive. Okay? So this is a way to make So this is a way to make the degree of normal community, if you want, by looking into the possible gate positive divisibility on intermediate mass. Okay, and this is actually due to that issue, which is probably he will mention in his lecture results of what. Is there a physical difference between K divisibility and Complete positivity. I think it's a way to, okay, if you have K divisibility but not CPD visibility, you again enter in these kind of instabilities. And then how in how large are this effect is away I mean this K divisibility is is some is uh it's um a way to to measure how important is this instability if you want because okay now in all of this business of course there is a catch and the catch is uh something that i think appeared yesterday as well is that the um These probabilities here, in principle, are just formal probabilities. What I mean by formal probabilities is that in general, we cannot observe these probabilities directly in a multi-time measurement setting. This is because when we introduce measurement here to check if our system is in the state If our system is in the state side, then we change the post-electoral evolution. So, this is what we have in this setting, and we include some measurement here, which change the posterior revolution in general. Then, a way to avoid this effect is by imposing as a criterion of normal cognitively the quantum regression thing. The quantum regression theorem that was explained yesterday, it actually warranties is that these interventions here do not modify the post-energy dynamics. About that, if we have the fulfilment of the quantum regulation theorem, which is this this quality, this equality here, it's the quantum regulation theorem, we obtain again this uh Markov uh condition. Markov condition, but now these probabilities are observable in a multi-time set. I want to emphasize that in any case these probabilities are observable. Because it can be determined, even if the quantum regression theorem does not apply, simply because we can reconstruct this, it's not this but we can reconstruct these intermediate maps and this. Maps and this is just a matter of compute the action of this intermediate map by applying to some some projectors. But we may be interested. But if you want to see these probabilities, a conditional probabilities of a real experiment, because of this invasive property of the multi-time measurements, we need to impose the quantum relations here. Okay? And for unitary dynamics, For unitary dynamics, the quantum regression theorem is typically satisfied, so there is no difference that we have made here. And this leads to the definition of quantum Markov unity via CPD visibility plus quantum electrons. To see the difference also in this this divisibility plus quantum relation theorem and just CP divisibility. ingestive CP divisibility. We can consider this scenario, the scenario of Markovian dilations. If we have a CP divisible dynamics, then what happens is that there exists a unitary dynamics and a state of the environment such that every intermediate, if you want, dynamical map can be written as this. Can be written as this. Okay? So the environment in this, so the evolution that this CP the visible dynamics describe is memory-less interaction with the environment. So any time that we split the dynamics, the environment can be thought as to be a reset, to be in a potential column, so non-correlations. So no correlations. And this scheme, essentially. So by taking unitary evolution and partial trace, we obtain this state. This is a dynamical map. Again, interacting with this system state with the environmental state and applying this unitary plus taking testing all the environmental degrees of freedom, we get this state and so on. So we can assume the same state in each direction. State in which dilation. We can assume the same state here. We can move all the dependency to the existence of this unitary. So, this is what I have written here. CPD visibility dynamics can be understood as a result of a collision, and if you want, because you can think of this as collisions, okay, with the system and the environment, a memoryless effective model. However, However, if we assume the quantum regression theorem, then what happens is that this unitary that we have here, we have a similar condition as before, but the unitary that we have here is not actually so well, but it's actually the true unitary evolution that appears in the quantum relational theory here. Okay, the act of time evolution. Okay. Such that, oh sorry, this is a mistake here. Tilde should be missing. It's the real day, the proper time recognition. Okay, sorry. The previous slide was I have forgotten to remove the previous slide. Okay, this is the correct slide. Okay, so you so you see, we have the initial state. The initial state. So at any point, we have that dynamical map can be computed in this way if the quantum regression theorem plus CPD visibility is satisfied. So it's a stronger condition in that sense. Actually, it's a very strong condition, which is only satisfied solely within procedures, so limiting situations. We copy limit, also copy limit and Limit or single copy limit and other things. But it's not true that this imposed that at any time step system and environment has to be uncorrelated. Because what is really needed is this equality here. So the action of the unitary dynamics on the part of the system environmental state which is not this must vanish. Must vanish. If that vanish, this is a weaker condition that imposing that all time and time steps, the dynamics is uncorrelated. So when you have introduced now the time dependence of state of ancillar. Yeah. The environment. Yes. What do you mean? Environment. Well, it is in general because of this. That's the actual environment, and not something. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Is that somebody that can get a lot of start something, let's say, common. And what this equality says is that the trace of unitary T S S C S S A of this C S equals to zero. And only unitary of this part survives. So in general, well since this dynamics is fixed, because it is fixed by the model, by the microscopic model, then I cannot in general remove the General remove the dependency, time dependency of the environment of the state. Okay, so this is a strong condition. Excuse me, coming back to this question about the environment. Do you assume that it has its own evolution, which is irrespective of the fact that it's coupled to the small system? Say that? No, no, no, no, no. I mean, the environment, the system under T2, takes into account the coupling of the small system. Takes into account the coupling of the small system before from T1 state to T2. No, what I say is that forget this tensor product. In general, you can understand this evolution as the result of tracing out this state. Okay? But now what I'm only just assuming is that the tracing out of this particular part of the evolution, which is not that, is zero, if the quantum direction theorem is satisfied. Is satisfied. I'm just assuming that. I'm just curious about the line describing the environment state. Yeah. The rho E of T1, rho E of T2, and so on. Yeah. So the actual state of the environment. Yes, yes, yes, yes. So all this condition is saying is that from the perspective of the system, everything looks like it's a product. Everything looks like at the product state, or the environment feeding back into the system. That's it. That is correct. Yeah, sorry, in the line of the previous section. Could you, if you draw this arrow on the environment, which connects row E of T1 to row E of T, have exactly also the the pattern vibration because you don't have to environment side, you mean like changing system environment? Oh, I don't know. I don't know. I think yes. No, no, no, no, no, I haven't. No. I think in general this is not true. Because for that, you have to change this trace on the environment trace of the system. And that I don't think that this implies that also the trace on the system part is satisfied. Yeah, I don't think so. Not so much. Yeah, I don't think so. I don't know, but I don't think so. Because if you are assuming that the whole trace of the USB or OS is zero, you are destroying any correlation. They are assuming this, I'm not assuming. Sorry, yeah, thank you. Okay. There is also a difference between the two definitions in the classical limit. With the CP divisibility, without the quantum relation theorem, we have that is the if the dynamics is commutative, so the system, the density matrix of the system is commutes at different time steps, then we might understand the evolution as a classical Markovian process on the orthogonal set of common eigenstates. So we have a system in eigenstates, which are the same at every time instant, and we are. Distant, and we are just looking at a Markov chain if you want at different quantum states. But everything is classic in that sense. However, for the classical limit of CPT visibility based regression theorem, we need some extra conditions that Andrea Smigen commented yesterday in the chat. That you need, for instance, zero system environment quantum discord, etc. Discord, etc. So it's to get classical stochastic process using this definition of quantum Markovianity, you have to be careful because it's more complicated than having just computative dynamics. Okay, so which definition is better? Well, I think it depends. From my point of view, Um from my point of view, if we are addressing the Markovianity of open system state dynamics, and you are describing that with dynamical maps, then probably CPD visibility is enough. But if you want to see the conditional probabilities that you construct in this model as conditional probabilities that you find in the lab, I mean, you are interested in multi-time measurement statistics. Multi-time measurement statistics, then probably you need to include also the quantifiation theory to avoid any other memory effects. And in classical stochastic process, this difference is not present because there is no invasive character of the measurements. But you know that there is something subtle here because Here because the classical limit of both definitions is not the same. So if we say this is not true, it's not present in classical star. In the sense that you said you can construct these dynamical maps at intermediate times. You can do the same classically by just writing down a master equation for one time probability. And those things might be different from really doing the measurements. Really doing the measurements. Okay. Now, yes and no. This cannot be. Yes and no. Okay. If you have a completely general classical dynamics, then I agree. But the point is that in quantum dynamics, the evolution is not completely general. So we have some evolution which are dictated by the, I don't know, For normal equation, for instance, you might think this is a master equation. So we have that from the very beginning. So, in that sense, if you consider the system given in terms of dynamical equations in the classical case, that you do not see in principle this difference. You need to have stochastic processes more complicated, so to say, in a classical case. So this is what the mutation claim is the difference between the CPT visibility only the CPT visibility and the second one. I mean according to the way how you would construct CPT visibility for this intermediate time steps. Then this doesn't need to conclude, do you agree? Sorry, say again? So the way you introduced CPD visibility, you had to speak about dynamical maps at times which were not Had times which were not conditioned on the initial time. Yeah. Like from S, like down there, where you have the T S with S greater than T 0. You can play the same game classically and then these two things will also not coincide classically. Okay, I understand what you mean to say, but all what I am trying to comment is that you don't have Is that you don't have operator by the capital? Yeah, I think this construction, if you are able to construct this in the classical case, then you agree you agree that the evolution is Markovian, that the classical process is Markovian. But go back where you had this kind of formal probabilities like kind of formal probability size. But you know, this is the point. This is the point. In the classical setting, formal probabilities and probabilities are not, there is no such a difference because the states of a classical stochastic process are real states. So we do not have, okay, you may consider generalization and you may have some invasive actions on the system, fine. But it should be discussions maybe later, but there's nothing okay and also you can actually enlarge this condition by using Condition by using this, okay. On the system we can make measurements, but we can do any other things on many interventions. So you can construct quantum Markovianity or more general quantum Markovianity conditions by assuming that we not only have multi-time measurements, statistics, but also intervention, not just measurement, but just any intervention. Not just measurement, but just an intervention. But one has to be careful here because this intervention-based quantum measurement, the memory efforts that we are studying in this case are different, have a different meaning. So it's a memory effect in a sequence of interventions. And this is the difference from the memory effort from the from dynamics of states. This is something different. This is something different. Of course, there are memory efforts and Markovian, but the problem is, I think, is different, and this is one of the points that perhaps confuses quite a lot on this business. Okay, there is another definition which has also a very practical importance, which is the definition of information backflow. In this In this definition, you can see this definition in the following game. We have that, for instance, Alice is preparing the system in either this state, row one or the state row two, with the same probabilities. And then Bob is trying to guess which is the state which is prepared by Alice by performing a POVN measurement. Then the probability of success is given by Of success is given by this formula, which is the trace distance between the two design matrices. Then there is a definition of Markovianity that says that in a Markovian evolution, the information about the system state, about the system state decreases with time. Okay? But then that implies that the time derivative of this must be negative. Okay? Be negative. And this in turn implies that the evolution must be contractive in the sense of the trace distance. If the dynamical map is p divisible, this is satisfied, or this is satisfied. And this is given in this paper. Seminal paper. We can also. We can also consider bias in general discrimination problem, which is the same problem as before, but we now have a probability instead of having one half or one half prior probabilities, we might consider a lambda probability and one minus lambda probability. And then the probability of success is given by this trace norm of something which sometimes is called Herbstrom matrix, which is just the difference, which is proportional to the difference of the states in the To the difference of the states in the case that we are in the on bias problem. And then again, if the evolution is Markovian, we may expect that this Helstrom matrix, the norm, the trace norm of the Helson matrix is decreasing with time, monotonically decreasing. And this is true again if the evolution is pd visible. So this is a So, this is a plot of what's going on here. This is the idea. For a Markovian evolution, we have something like this. For a non-Markovian evolution, we may have something as this. Okay? Non-monatonic. Now, the question is, is this condition, this condition also implies this? The other way around? To answer that question, we might introduce. To answer that question, we might introduce first the concept of invertible dynamics. On invertible dynamics, by invertible dynamics, I mean a dynamical math, which is final time. That means that there exists a mathematical inverse, such as, well, as the property of mathematical inverse, but this mathematical inverse is not in general a dynamical map, it's not in general a C P map, okay? Unless the evolution is unitable. Evolution is unitary. CP divisible invertible dynamics are nice because we can construct this intermediate dynamics by applying the inverse to this equation. And this is uniquely defined by this equation. And the generators of this CP divisible invertible dynamics can also obtain by inversion by multiplying here by the identity, which is this, and then all of this is just the generator of the dynamics. Of this is just the generality of the dynamics. Moreover, if the dynamics is CP divisible, then it happens that this generator has this form, this Koriniko-Salkovsky, Limplas, Sudazan, GKL, GKLS, time-independent form. Which is something like this, where these decay rates are uniquely determined and are non-negotiable. Time-dependent, perhaps time-dependent. Okay, time dependent, perhaps time dependent, but not okay. So, for invertible dynamical maps, then it can be proven that the evolution, if evolution is invertible, then it is p-divisible if and only if it is contractive in this sense. So, this implication follows as well. For every pair of states, of quantum states in Gilbert space, that we are Space that we are sitting, and probabilities. And it is CP divisible if and only if this also holds for an extension with identity here and for all pairs of states in this enlarged Hilbert space. In addition, it can be proven that if the evolution is invertible, then it is k-divisible if and only if a similar condition is. A similar condition calls. So, for invertible time evolutions, Markovianity by divisibility is equivalent to Markovianity by the absence of information flow. What's the role in these theorems that you take convex combinations of density matrices? Why don't you just say? No, it's not a convex combination because of this minus sign here. Oh, in the previous theorem too? Yes, yes, in everything. Is this uh this this uh Hairstorm matrix uh Heston matrix and the other way around. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's essentially contractive for any operator, any admission operator. It's equivalent to that. Okay, what about non-invertible dynamical maps? If we have non-invertible dynamical maps, then This implication doesn't follow because of course this is not uniquely defined. This is not well defined. So this intermediate map is not uniquely defined. And then the generators of this kind of dynamics can always be treated like this. I mean, if the dynamics is CPD possible, the generator The generator can be written as this, but not every decay rate and operator, and perhaps San Antonio here, is uniquely determined, but every decay rate can be chosen to be non-negative. We can ensure that the decay rate can be chosen to be non-negative, but it's possible that since this is not unique, this generator is not unique. Generator is not unique, we might have another generator with negative decay rates which generates the same dynamics and it's 10 Cps. Now, what about this implication in this case? Well, one can prove the following. If a dynamical map satisfies this contractive condition, then the dynamical map is not a map. The dynamical map is divisible. That means that we can split the dynamics automatically as this. And it is K and this interval dynamics is a K positive and risk-preserving map, but just on the image of this map. With maybe not the whole spectrum. Space of emission operators in Hebrew space because the dynamics could be non-invertible. So the question of this application is whether this map here can be extended to a K-positive and risk-preserving map on the whole space of a mission operator. So the image should be E from S from T naught to S, right? Uh ah yes, sorry. Oh yes, sorry. Yes, yes. Um there is an important class of dynamical maps where the implication follows, which is this, is the maps which are we call image non-increasing dynamical maps. For this kind of dynamical maps, we have that you know the image is included in the previous image. Is included in the previous image, essentially. So suppose that we have this is the image of the dynamical map at T0 and the image of the dynamical map as a posterior time is inside it. Image zero. If that is true, If that is true, then the dynamical map is k-divisible if and only if this is satisfied. And the sketch of the proof, the idea, is based on the fact that this limit in this dynamical map, because of continuity, is a k-positive projection operator and threshold-preserving onto the image of this. So the desired This. So, the desired extension, the positive extension, is just the composition of this map that is positive and dispersing on the image and this particular parameter, which is also positive and dispersed. Okay, examples of this kind of dynamical image non-increase of dynamical map. Dynamical map which are commutative, it's a particular example, and dynamical maps which are diagonalizable for any. map which are diagonalizable for any finite diagonalizable I mean not a mission but just diagonalizable okay general what about more general maps where if the dimension of the Hilbert we know that if the dimension of the Hilbert space is larger than three then there are k non-divisible dynamical maps okay which are nevertheless contractive so in general Contractive. So, in general, we have this implication. Dynamical maps is something like this. Okay, the set of dynamical maps is, well, the dynamical maps is something like this. And inside of it, we have the K-contractive dynamical maps, the K-divisible dynamical maps. It's a strictly smaller set. But this could collapse in the same set for invertible dynamical maps or for image non-increasing dynamical maps. The example that proves this theorem that we can construct this kind of dynamical laws is a little bit involved. We have to make a snapshot of the paper here, but you know we have to, at the moment it's just an academic example, we have to construct it by using several intervals. And then, well, it's a bit little bit involved, but it can be proven that. little bit involved but it can be proven that this dynamical map this dynamical map here here the dynamical map is denoted by lambda of t is contractive but is not p divisive for qubits there is a nevertheless a result which says that the dynamical map is CPD possible if and only if this condition holds. Okay, but this is only valid for qubits. For qubits. CPTP civil extension for larger dimensional systems is not known at the moment. We know that K-divisible extensions are not possible, but CP divisible extensions with a number. Okay, so with this, I want to finish, give you some conclusions. So, quantity visibility. So quantity visibility conditions represent a natural way to translate the classical Markovian idea to the quantum realm. There are several concepts related with divisibility, so p-divisibility, k-divisibility, C-P-divisibility, quantum regression theory. And depending on what particular feature one wants to emphasise, okay, the problem that uh we are you are interested in. You are interested in study. And there are strong connections between the divisibility condition and deformational buff flow conditions, but still some open problems. And I think at the bottom line of this talk is when talking about quantum market community, one has to be careful about what one is really referring to. If we are in a multi-time set, multi-time measurement. Set a multi-time measurement setting, just one measurement setting, or we are dealing with general measurement of general interventions. We are interested in the dynamical effective memory effects on the system dynamics, on the system state dynamics, open system state dynamics, or more general, more general. General constructions as integration and so on. Okay? And that's it. With that, I just thank you for your attention. Revontas for four. Nice. Questions? May I ask a question? Yes, please. Ah, yes, uh, yeah. Yes, Anton Truvschkil. Thank you, Antio, for a very interesting talk. In the first part of it, you mentioned two kinds of definitions, C P divisibility and C P divisibility plus quantum regression theorem. I thought that quantum regression theorem is a stronger condition, so quantum regression theorem implies C P divisibility or not. Um um I I I think so, yeah. I think so. Otherwise, it was a way to emphasize that uh that you know, um quantum divisibility, you know, quantum regression theorem is a stronger condition than that CPD visibility, but I think you are right. I think that quantum regression theorem implies uh uh implies CPD visibility, yeah. Okay, thank you. Hi. Um I got a little confused when you had a time-dependent loop laddering at some point that generated CPE dynamics, which was non-invertible. Would you have like maybe an example of how you can do that in finite time? Like, let's say a small time of expense. And you mean this case here. Uh um An example I'm going to give you a very simple example. Suppose that you have a dynamical map which is something like this. Then suppose that this decay rate becomes There is some point, let's say S start, such that, okay, limit S going to S start goes to infinity. So would you agree that in general you would either need to act for any given time? Need to act for any time, or you need an effort to strong dissipation. Yeah, well, yeah, you need the, I mean, not really, it's a little bit more complicated, but these non-invertible dynamical maps are typical from situations where you only have environments with you have environments with only a finite number of degrees of freedom. So you have point gar fin finite point carrier references and then these references This regular causes this kind of you define decay rates at some point. Yes, you have two definitions, one with the uh someone distance in one are they equivalent, or one is more general. I mean, this is for the Hercules matrix and this is for the generally biased problem. So Alice can prepare either row 1 or either row 2, but with prior probability lambda and prior probability 1 minus lambda. Okay? And in that case, to get the implication in the other way around, The implication in the other way around, you need to play with these probabilities. This one does not allow you to go from here to here if you only have one half or one half. So this is a weaker criterion. No, no, even for the variable map, this is not equivalent. Variable map, this is not equivalent to this. What is equivalent is this. In general, with a test of matrix, and you can play. So you ask this to hold for any lambda. Sorry? You ask this inequality to hold for any lambda. For any lambda, yeah, for any lambda. At one point you mentioned some results that were true for diagonalizable dynamical maps. Anyway, there was a distinction. And so I'm just wondering, sort of, in physically derived systems, dynamical maps, does it often happen that these things are not diagonalized? It does? It does? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. What is it to? Some degeneracies or? Yes, I mean because these dynamical maps are, I mean, okay, they are for instance, okay, I have to think on an example, but it happened in general. In general, if you need to typically lambda generators of this kind of evolutions, when you try to compute exponentially, you have no one by one Jordan block. You have several ones. Okay, I have to think about it. I don't know if quite often, but it happened content with time. More questions? More questions? Okay, thank you.
