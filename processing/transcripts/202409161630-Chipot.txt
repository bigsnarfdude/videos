So, I'm interested in some years to problems set in some domain where some directions are going to infinity. And my interest was for the P Laplace operator, but unfortunately, I cannot complete what I want for the P Laplace operator. I want for the P Laplace operator. So I consider something a little bit easier, which is called the pseudo P Laplace operator. So let me explain the problem. So first of all, I denote by W1R the subof space construct on LR. I take on I take on this space the usual norm defined here. I define W1R0 as a closure of the C-infinity function with compact support in W1R. And then everybody knows that on this Banach space, one can define an equivalent. One can define an equivalent norm considering this norm of the gradient in LR. And the dual of this space is W minus 1R prime, which is the set of distribution equal to some function F naught in L R prime, the dual of L R minus the sum of derivative of function derivative of function in L R prime, the duality bracket being defined like that. All right, so I'm going to consider a very simple problem. So my domain omega L will be a rectangle of size 2 here, minus 1, 1 and minus L L and this domain. L and this domain I'm interested in knowing what happens when L goes to plus infinity. Okay, so I'm not considering the P Laplacian, but I'm considering this kind of operator, which is if P and Q are bigger than one in two dimensions, I will explain later what can happen in a higher dimension. higher dimension. The operator I consider is minus dx1 on dx1 ul p minus 2 dx1 ul minus dx2 dx2 of ul to the q minus 2 dx2 of ul equal to f in omega l and u l equal to zero in d omega l if p equal to q this is not the p Laplacian okay because the p Laplacian the The P Laplacian, the difference, it would be, it was explained with a frog later. So, this is a more ugly frog because the P Laplacian is divergence of gradu to the p minus two gradu. Okay, but here, my operator, if p equal to q, this is d. This is d over dxi. And here, instead of having the whole gradient, I have only the derivative in xi, p minus 2 d x i. So this some time calls the pseudo P Laplace operator. But here, what happened to me? I saw my picture. Okay. But here, But here I want to consider the case where you have two different exponents here. So the weak formulation of this problem is the following. Okay, so first of all, I would like to show that when L goes to plus infinity, this part here somehow disappears, and the limit problem is limit problem is what's left when you cancel this term. So what is the weak formulation of the problem when you don't have this term here? This is the following. This is minus d over x2 dx2 u infinity q minus 2 dx2 u infinity equal to f in the section. Omega is the section. Omega is a section of my domain. Okay, so we have this domain here, and at the limit, the solution UL converges towards something depending only on the section and independent of X1. This is what I want to establish and possibly have a possibly have a rate of convergence. So the limit problem is the solution of the here. In fact, it turns out that this is a P Laplacian in one dimension, the P Laplacian in one dimension on the section with u infinity equal to zero at the point minus one and one. All right, my f would be a function depending only on the section. only on the section. So I will consider f in w minus one q prime of omega here. Okay, the pointer is weak a little bit and given by f naught of x2 minus dx2 f1 of x2 where f naught and f1 are in L cube pri. So how to form So, how to formulate the weak equation of this problem? This is as usual. So, I denote the weak formulation is we have to find is given by u infinity in w1q0 of omega satisfying that for any v in w1q0 of omega. Now, my Now, my initial problem on the wool rectangle, I remind you that this is this problem here. Okay, so when you integrate by parts, you get the following weak formulation. I'm looking for, first of all, I have to introduce anisotropic subsidies. isotropic sublf spaces W1PQ of omega L, which is a set of V in L P and L Q, such of derivative in X1 is in L P, the derivative in X2 is in LQ. You norm it with a natural norm given by that, and then you denote by W1 TQ0 of omega L the closure of Closure of dωl in this space. Then the weak formulation of the problem I introduce first is we are looking for ul in w1pq0 of omega l such that ul satisfy this integral is equal to fv for any v in w 1 pq 0 of omega l well these operators Well, these operators are strictly monotone, hemicontinuous, and coercive, and the existence of a solution is very classical. So, the first interesting result is an estimate of UL. That is to say, I want to show that UL, the integral in omega L. In omega L is the dx1 of UL in LP, dx2 of UL in LQ is bounded by Cl. How you do that? So you take in the weak formulation, sorry, in the weak formulation here you take V equal to U L. Okay, this is a load. So you're going to get here the L P norm of DX1 of. L P norm of DX1 of UL, here the LQ norm of DX1 or DX2 of fuel, and here you get F0UL, F1, DX2 of fuel. This is what I wrote here. Now, using the fact that F naught is in L Q prime, F1 is in L Q prime, if you apply. q prime if you apply uh older uh the older inequality you get that you get this estimate here now if you apply poisar on this term poisaré inequality on the section first and after that integrating then you get the following estimate here where you have here You have here the derivative in x2 of fuel. So here you have the derivative of x2 of fuel at the power q. So this is what you have here, which is bounded if you look at the term of the fi. The fi's are depending only on x2. So when you integrate on omega l, you get the On omega L, you get the integral of omega and the integral from minus L to L. So this is clearly equal to 2L to the 1 over Q prime, the norm of Fi in L Q prime of omega, right? So this estimate here, if you forget about this term, you get exactly that. That the norm of dx2 of UL in LQQ is bounded by that. All right, so if you take, if you divide by that, okay, you get that the LQ norm of the derivative in X2 is bounded by that. And then you go back to the estimate here. Since this is bounded by... bounded by L to the one over Q, by L to the one over Q prime, the whole thing is bounded by C L. So this is the first estimate that you have. All right, this is so. Now in fact, one can in all this business always forget about the F. Why? Because I claim because I claim that if ul is solution of my initial problem, u infinity is a solution of what I call the limit problem, then you have this equality. So in other words, you recognize here the operator of the beginning and here the operator limit. Why? Because if you take a V in W1 V in W1PQ of omega L from the weak formulation, which is over there. So if you take a V here, this is what you have. Okay, so I go back to my equation here. Okay, this is exactly what I wrote. I just express the F. The f. Now, if v is in this space when you fix the variable x1, then the vx1 dot is in w1q of omega. Then you can use it as a test function in the limit problem and you get that. All right. When you integrate that in x1, then you get then the integral of omega l. Then the integral of the omega L of this is equal to Fv. Now you subtract this equation from the one above, from this one, and you get exactly that. So the F disappear because you have F V here and F V here. So the F plays no role in the in the In the business. So I'm going to play now, I'm going to use this equation to show that UL goes to U infinity in some science. All right. So I recall that you have for the this is valid for the P Laplacian, you have some inequality like that. Like that. In fact, I'm not sure I'm going to use them in what follows because I will not develop the rule theory here. So the first thing is the UL is monotone in F. So in other words, if you have F tilde less than F, less than f in the distributional sense, then u f tilde is z is less than u l f. And if f is non-negative, ulf is less than u infinity of f. u infinity of f is the solution of my limit problem corresponding to f. Well, this is an easy An easy to prove. You just using the usual test function, you know, taking the positive part of a function and so on to get the result. I don't want to do it. You can trust me on that. And then I claim the following: if UL is solution of my initial problem, you Initial problem, u infinity is the solution of my limit problem. Then for any phi depending on x1 only, vanishing at the endpoint minus l and l, then you have this inequality here. So the inequality will be clear as soon as I explain what I do. I take a test function ul minus u infinity time phi. Time phi. So phi is vanishing at the end of the rectangle. u l minus u infinity is vanishing on the lateral boundary of the rectangle. So this is a test function, if smooth, for in w 1 pq 0 of omega l. So I plug it in in the equation, satisfy by. Equation satisfied by UL, not exactly. I plug it in this equation here. I'm sorry. I plug it in here. Here I take v equal to u l minus u infinity times phi. So when you take the derivative u l minus u infinity Px1. Okay, so the second term, when you take the derivative in x2, you will have only dx2 of that time phi. But the first term, you will have dx1 of this phi plus ul minus u infinity dx1 of phi. Of fee. So when you do that here, then you get exactly that. So you see you have the term where this term here, since u infinity is independent of x1, this is just dx1 of u infinity. dx one of ul times phi plus u l minus u infinity dx one of phi. So then you have for this guy here you will have dx1 of u l p times P times phi to the p times phi and with this term here you will have this term. Now with this part here you will have this exactly. Okay, then you take you bound that using the absolute value and then you have exactly what You have exactly what I wanted. When you bound using the absolute value, this is exactly that. So, this allows you to have something if you now take a function rho, which is equal to one on minus one half, one half, and which vanish out of minus one, one, smooth function. smooth function and if you take phi equal to rho alpha then the second part of you have you plug this phi here and you use you use now uh you use now here you bound this by the derivative of your rho alpha in x1 so what you get is the following you The following, you get that this is bounded by that here because when you take the derivative of O alpha, you have a one over L coming. All right. So you have a one over L and you have times this guy here. Now, the rho alpha minus one, if you using the fact that one over p prime plus one over p is equal to one. plus one over p is equal to one. If you're using Elder inequality, then you're getting that this is bounded by alpha C over L, this guy to the power one over P prime, because the conjugate, okay, is P over P minus one. So when you take the power P prime over Z, you get exactly the X1 of UL to the P. And of course, To the p and of course, this guy here gives you u l minus u infinity p rho alpha minus p and to the power one over p. Now, here you have this term here, okay, but you have an extra term, so you can bound this integral here by the wool integral here, okay? So, in other words, you have the wool integral bounded by the wool. integral bounded by the wool integral to the one over p prime okay then this is the wool integral one over p bounded by alpha cl this guy so this is what i do and this is what i do i get this and this is exactly what we have here if you take alpha bigger than p so rho is less than one rho is less than one, so you get that. Now, the ULF and U infinity are ULF is bounded by something independent of X1. And so this is what I wrote here. And then this guy here is bounded by something independent of X1. X1. So you get just an extra L above. So the wool integral here is bounded by C L to the P minus 1. What does it give you? Okay, so if you look at this, in fact, I use a little bit this inequality that I had before. But you can conclude if you use this inequality. This inequality here, then you can conclude that since p is bigger than one, you can conclude that dx1 of ul goes to zero in L P and D x two of U L goes to dx2 of U infinity in LQ. Okay, here I have a little bit of work to do, but it's okay. So, in other words, It's okay. So, in other words, I have, in some sense, convergence of fuel towards U infinity. But you can get an estimate, and I will finish my talk here. You can get the following. So, I examine somehow the different case. When P is less than Q, then you have the following estimate for this norm in omega L over 2. L over 2. When p is bigger or equal to q and q less than 2, then you have the following estimate. And this is a little bit more surprising, when p and q are bigger than 2, f in L1, then you have an exponential rate of convergence. This is something I don't know how to do for the P Laplacian. This is why I Laplacian. This is why I study that. Now, you can show you something on a rectangle. You can take a domain going to plus infinity in several directions. I have some results also on that, but in 25 minutes, I could not speak about that. And you can see that on the paper, which is published in Published in asymptotic analysis recently.
