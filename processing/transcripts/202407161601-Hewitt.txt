Okay, I'm very grateful to be here to the organisers. Thank you for inviting me. I wasn't sure what I was going to talk about when I was asked for a title for this, so I wrote a slightly generic thing. And then I decided that I don't want to talk about that when I actually wrote a talk a few days ago. So this is probably more accurate, but I'm going to talk about clogging and blocking in slots and channels. And basically, there's going to be two parts of this talk. The first part is stuff that I did really quite a long time ago, now, nine or ten years ago. Quite a long time ago now, nine or ten years ago. And the second part is stuff that is still ongoing with current PhD students. And I hope that they will tie on and make a very interesting story. There are various people that have been involved in this work. Neil, Mark, and Masood did some of the experiments that I'll talk about. And the more recent work is with Phil Pierce and UCL. And the person who's doing all the work is Anushka, who's the student. Okay, so the first part of this talk is really going to be focused on Higgy Shore flows of physical plastic materials, really the simplest model you could think of for a yield stress fluid in a slot, and then I'll be looking at what it looks like and theoretically what it looks like and what it looks like with an obstacle, and then some experiments. And then I'm going to move on to some problems related but somewhat different to do with clogging. These are both pictures of clogged pipes. This is very slightly less pleasant. This is blood, and that's actually been. That's pleasant. This is blood. And that's actually the motivation for this second part that I'll get on to. Okay, so this first part, at least to begin with, is going to be very simple and it really covers stuff that we've already kind of seen over the last two days. So I apologise, and I'll try and go fairly quickly through it. I apologise if it's boring. We've kind of seen some of these concepts already, so they're hopefully familiar. But I thought it's probably helpful to start at the most simple. So if you think about a slot, flow down a slot, the first thing you write down. The first thing you write down is just a steady balance between driving pressure gradients down the slot, this turn, and shear stresses, gradients, shear stresses across the slot. And basically in a Healy-Shaw cells, that's just a cell between two plates, that is basically the balance that controls everything. And of course, if your fluid doesn't yield stress, then straight away, this immediately tells you, if you integrate it, that you expect the shear stress to look a bit like this, i.e., to go through zero in the center of the channel. And if the shear stress goes to zero, And if the shear stress goes to zero in the center of the channel, then if your material in the fluid hasn't yield stress, then it must be plugged up around that central region. So you generically expect profiles of flow from yield stress to develop like that, as we've seen already many times over the last two days. But in a heli-shore cell, this is exactly what you have. So a helioshaw cell is something like this, and for a yield structure, you expect this central perfectly plug-like region. The 22nd history of the helioshaw cell. 22nd history of the Healy Shaw cell. Henry Healy Shaw, there he is, enjoying himself, 100 years ago, more than 100 years ago, was an engineer of some renown, and he developed this cell. It's not a complicated experiment, but it's just too plain to get a gap between. And for a Newtonian fluid, the balance that I just outlined, the shear stress balance and pressure gradients, boils down to be potential flow solutions. So if you're just mathematically solutions, which thing, which are completely controlled by viscous drag. Of this thing, which are completely controlled by viscous drag on the walls, it gives you the mathematical problem you're end of solving is del squared of something that's zero. And so this was used as a way to visualize inviscid potential flows of kind of air-foil theory and not inviscid problems. So it's kind of an interesting history that this thing, which is completely controlled by this gossiping, is has this, was actually not developed to look at viscous flows at all. Nowadays, it's much more commonly used. Flows at all. Nowadays, it's much more commonly used as a model for porous media flows, sort of simple to model porous media flows. So there are these sort of all of this is anyone who's done fluid mechanics will surely have come across Van Dyck's book, beautiful pictures of fluid flows, and these are potential flow solutions for flow around a disk and flow around a plate. They're taken from an experiment in McHige Shaw. Interestingly, Mr. Higgy Shaw was the, I discovered this when I did some research on Wikipedia the other day where I got this picture. He spent a lot of his later He'd spent a lot of his later life in Liverpool, and he was the first incumbent of a named chair, which is now held by Rob. It's quite simple, nice and factual. Okay, so okay, we now put a Bingham fluid in this thing, or that's the simplest possible disco cluster fluid. And everyone knows what Bingham fluid is fun. You can do some maths, which I'm not going to dwell on the details, but basically, you can derive this kind of flow profile, and it's straightforward to just integrate yourself to get a relation. Forward, we've just integrated this up to get a relationship between the flux down the vertically integrated flow down the channel, I'm going to call that Q, and the pressure gradient, which I'm going to call S, the magnitude of the pressure gradient. And if you just do this mathematically, you get some horrible expression, but it's a relationship between the flux and the pressure gradient. For a Newtonian fluid, as well, this is a linear relationship. This is the basis of Darcy's law, and you like it from a simplified 2D world. So this is So, this is something we've seen already various times when people have been talking about Yield stress fluids and porous media. Boron was just talking about this not very long ago. You end up with something that looks like this. This is now for a slot, not a porous medium, but it's the same idea. You end up with a plot of the pressure drop against the flux, and the Newtonian flow has a linear relationship that goes through the origin. Any kind of yield stress for the key phenomenological feature will be an offset here, just like you would get the original rheology. Like you would get in the original rheology that you need a certain pressure valve to drive in flux, and you can just drive all flux. Of course, and this is just the same as people find from actual forest media, but the shape of this curve is of course different in a slot, in a simple TV slot to what it would be in a portion. Okay, this is one point which will be familiar to many of you, but if we start looking at variations in a cell, this is what I'm about to do. So, what I'm about to do is actually put an object in the middle of the cell blocking it, and look at what the flow pattern looks like around it. What the flow pattern looks like around it, then you start to have to worry about the fact that this central plug-like region that you're talking about, if S varies, so suppose you have an obstacle here blocking the flow, then the pressure gradient as you approach that point will vary, but it'll be adapted to change by the topography or by the obstacle. Which means that the flux will change, which means that the size of this central point will change through something involving this relationship. And so, what you then find is that you're predicting that this. And then find is that you're predicting that this central plug-like region of purple, which if you sort of travel along the cell towards, say, the obstacle, that may be growing or getting narrower, and indeed slowing down or speeding up Q and S must be changing. So you're actually weirdly predicting that you've got a plug moving that is actually getting faster or getting slower as you travel along it, which means it can't be a widget often. But this is an interesting and well understood phenomenon, and typically this is now described as a pseudo- Typically, this is how I described as a pseudo-plug. The fact that they're a weak, this is all to do with the, you're making some approximations when you do this. This is hidden up there by this near statement, usual things, lot of asymptotics, that you're neglecting certain terms in the stress terms. And they are basically coming in to allow this thing that is almost plugged to weakly deform and vary. So that's an important point in what I'm about to talk about. I don't think we need to dwell on the details. You can scale this problem. The key thing here is that there's a parameter which Problems: the key thing here is that there's a parameter which comes out, which is a big number. You scale this in this usual way, and mathematically, at the end of the day, you boil down to solving some sort of elliptic equation for either the pressure or spring function. The details are not too important, but the key thing is, if this was Newtonian, you would get back potential flow because Q in this dimensionless world is just S. But because it's not, there's this horrible relationship, which is in non-dimensional form, same thing as I had on the last slide, which is very non-linear. So, you've got a slightly weird non-linear elliptical problem. A neural problem if you're trying to solve this sort of thing. And for those of you that are mathematically minded, and I won't say anything more about this, there is actually some very nice analysis you can do. It's very satisfying, it doesn't actually tell you very much, but it's mathematically interesting. You can convert this rather nasty non-linear equation into a linear one by this kind of slightly weird mapping, which is called a monograph transform, which is sort of helpful in some ways. I won't say any more about that. Say any more about that. Okay, so here's flow past the disk. So now suppose there is just an obstacle in the middle of the channel and you're still flowing down. So if I look at the top view here, I'm showing colour maps of here the flux view. For a Newtonian fluid, this is, you can just derive this by separating the variables, you don't even need to do any numerics at all. You get something that looks like this. There's a streamline hitting a stagnation point at the front of the obstacle. Everything is front-back symmetric, so I'm not showing the back part of the same. The flow is deflected. Same. The flow is deflected around the obstacle, it gets faster. That's the bright widths at the top and bottom, and it slows down to the function. But then you can solve the same thing with a yield stress fluid. Here's a small bingham number, big bingham number. And again, it's front-back symmetric, so I'm not showing you the other slide. And you see some interesting features, which are not that surprising given what we just saw in the Newtonian case. The region around the stagnation point develops a flood, because at that point, the flow is slowing down. The flow is slowing down. And so here, this grey region means the grey region means that it's not, it's a full plug that has filled up the channel completely. So if you remember that this picture, everywhere in the flow for a yield stress fluid, there is this central plug or pseudo-plug. But in the grey region, that's where the purple region is reached walls, and therefore it's not moving at all. So the grey region is entirely clogged up. Everywhere out here, it seems to be flowing rapidly. It's worth remembering when you're interpreting these that. It's worth remembering when you're interpreting these that you're looking at a vertically integrated view, and I'll show you this from the top. So everywhere there is this central plug or pseudo-plug in the flow. It's just that here it's grown to fill the whole slot and that's a stop. The other thing that's maybe kind of nice, I think, when you're looking at the flow, this is all kind of plausible, this for a Guild Stress flow around an obstacle. It's worth remembering that this is really being controlled in this heat-sure limit by viscous dragon that. He'd be sure they provide viscous drag on the top and bottom plate. And if you consider viscous flow around a free obstacle, this is like 2D Stokes flow instead of 2D Deep Shore flow. This is now no plates, it's just a 2D flow across an obstacle. You get something that really looks completely different. So here's the comparable plot to this. This is 2D flow past an unconfined obstacle. You get plugs at the front and back, which are helpful to come up with black here, not grey, which is not blank. But the flow is kind of deflected in quite a different manner. But the flow is kind of deflected in quite a different manner, and you get this much more elaborate pattern of strain rate, which is much, much richer dynamics. But the point there, I guess, is to say E D shore flows are really very different from 2D Stokes flows because of the way in which the stress is being controlled by the walls in the EV shore flow. And you can measure some things, the plug rows with the minimum number, and you can do some analysis to get some limits. The points you might just want to note, because I'm going to show some experiments in a minute, if you're used to interpreting Hidden Shaw. If you're used to interpreting Healy Shore flows, I will probably be drawn to this already. There are a few things here that you might be worried about. One is this cusp at the front, which is a very sharp feature. And the other is this layer around the edge of the disc. I haven't given you the colour bars yet because you can't see it, but this is actually, as the Bingham number gets bigger, this is getting very, very, very fast flow that's been deflected around the top and bottom. And the key thing, again, is this hugely short limit, is you don't have the freedom to impose the no-slip condition on something that's an obstacle. Condition on something that's an obstacle in the slot, because you're doing this evidence vertically integrated over the slot. So, this doesn't have to satisfy no slip on the obstacle, because it's being controlled by no slip on the top and bottom plate. And the whole theory hinges on the fact that that distance, the distance between the top and bottom plate, is smaller than any other distance in town. And clearly, that's not true. If you get close enough to an obstacle, you can always go arbitrarily close to an obstacle to be closer than the distance. So, the hope is that then there's just some small layer that's wrong there. But then there's just some small layer that's wrong there, but otherwise it's basically right. And you'd expect the same thing here: this kind of cusp. So, well, locally, to the cusp, I'd get the scale of that thing is smaller than the scale of the gap between things. Imagine in reality, that would be some come back to that. This I just wanted to throw in. I'm not really going to say anything about this, but it's the same kind of mathematics can do, you can also study flow down a pipe in this kind of something pretty, very similar to solve. I thought we'd just show it into. Solve. I thought I'd just show you some solutions just to illustrate that you can see the same sorts of things. So, this is really just to make the point that the same kind of mathematical tools can be used to study flow along conduits of any kind of orientation. Here's a square conduit, it could be any shape. And you get things like this when you flow down a pipe, you're going to get a central plug being carried by lubricated regions. This is a colour map of the gradient of the velocity. So, black means it's a plug, colour means not. And there's again some. Colour that it's not. And there's again some analysis you can do. It's the same nice holograph thing that I mentioned. You can actually predict those little corners that are plugged off in the pipe. And if you go to higher Binger numbers, you get a much more chromatic centrally moving plug thing here with these very thin layers, which again you can predict. I think I've got some predictions for with some boundary layer analysis you can do to predict the locations of those and their width. That's really just a That's really just to illustrate that the same kind of things hold for flow that responds. And the last thing, I actually just threw this slide in. I'm not going to talk about this in any detail, but I thought it was maybe interesting to just show the picture, if nothing else. There's been some nice talks about flowing porous media and seeing these beautiful channels, and trying to work out things like what's the critical pressure drop, where you first mobilize a single channel, and how do the channels move around. You get the same kind of thing in a slot, particularly if you consider a slot. Particularly if you consider a slot where the width of the height of the slot, this is this distance that's meant to be small, is actually perturbed by some roughness function. So imagine you take this slot and now you say that actually it's sort of wavy wall, but in a kind of random, quasi-random manner. Then you can make it some random function with some small magnitude. And then I can just show you some solutions. If you do that, this is flow from the left to the right. From the left to the right, it's a periodic cell again looking from the top, and you see the same sort of thing as we've seen already. So, this is really what I'm going to say, it's just a qualitative point. But you can generate something that looks a bit like a porous medium again by saying you've got this rough slot with a height and a height of which varies as you go around, and this corner here will be the sort of almost Newtonian case. Small Bingen number, small roughness. So, this is the roughness increasing as you go down here. So, the topography is sort of doing more. And then as you go this way, And then, as you go this way, the yield stress is increasing, or equivalently, you're lowering the pressure dot towards this critical threshold, circulation threshold. And you get the same sort of thing that we've seen already: you get reduction in the number of channels until there's only one channel left. And if you went to a higher ovum number, that would be like approaching even more closely. You would always just get one channel, just a threshold channel. There's a load of analysis you can do on this, which I haven't put in this talk, but if you're interested in that, please talk to me. Okay, so I said about choosing experimental results of the same problem. So this was Masoud's work, he's the first author of that. I won't dwell on the details here, but basically we took some carbon col and put it into a heli shaw cell and looked at what happened when it went past obstacles of different geometries. And you see, this, we did some confovamicroscopy, you can see you get the same sort of phenomena, so this is just showing the creation of. So, this is just showing the creation of a plug. This is basically just opening the camera lens and letting it run. You see that stuff all goes past here and it can leave the stagnant region at the front of an obstacle. That's what you think we actually saw. And you get this sort of picture for different obstacles. These regions are the plugs. Certain things look kind of qualitatively similar to what we saw in the theory. You get a plug in front of it. Sure. The two things that are, well, actually, the one thing I guess I want to draw your attention to. Well actually the one thing I guess I want to draw your attention to is that immediately you can see that the front and back are not the same in the experiments, which is not clearly. So this, for example, this plug is clearly a different size than this one. This one here this plug is massive and this one's not. And that's reproducibly always the case. And this is a more direct comparison of an experiment with what the model predicts that matches parameters. And I think it would be fair to say that there is some agreement, there's quite a lot of discussion. Agreement, and there's quite a lot of disagreement here. It's probably the main conclusion. These are just slices shown by each of these lines. Comparison between the two. You can see they both have a plug at the front. This one's asymmetric, this one is not. That point I made earlier about the fast region in the model is closest, the fluid is deflected around the obstacle. It's just not there in the experiment, really. So that's a massive qualitative disagreement here as you go past the obstacle. And that's to do with this heli shock. And that's to do with this Healy-Shaw approximation breaking down. The front-back asymmetry is really not to do with the Healy-Shaw approximation, it's to do with reality. And it's a slightly unsatisfactory tale, because that is sort of the end of the comparison. Leave it there. There has been some nice work by actually some people in this room more recently from this, looking at not this problem, but related problems where you make the theoretical material. The theoretical material elastic is copustic, so it is visco plastic. And typically, that is what you require to kind of explain this kind of thing. It's a slightly subtle point, actually. So we did some experiments with a viscoelastic fluid, which had a sort of matched elastic modulus to what we thought the elastic modulus of this carbon bottle was, and it didn't have any front-like symmetry. So that was kind of interesting. So then we thought, naively, it's not the elasticity that's explaining this. That's explaining this. I think in the end, I mean, it would be interesting to do this kind of model with this kind of theory with something like a Sariso model, an elastic viscoplastic model. No one's done that as far as I'm aware. But I think the answer lies in the plug. So these things can be quite sensitive to elasticity below the yield stress or close to the yield stress. And remember that ED shore flow, although it looks like the plugs are only here and here, everywhere there is this central plug or plug-like region. So the whole flow is kind of. The whole fluid flow always has some material in it, but it's being affected by the rheology of the plug or close to the plug. And I think that's probably what's explaining this talk. It's a bit of an open question. Right. I promised you sort of two halves to this talk, so I'll spend the last eight minutes or so on the second half, which is much more recent work, and it's only tangentially related to that, but it's looking at the motivation. Looking at the motivation for this work, this is a PhD student, Anushka, in UCL in London, which is where I used to work. I'm a supervisor, motivated by sickle cell disease, so modelling what happens in sickle cell disease. This video at the bottom is from Dave Woods Lab in Minnesota, who's a long-time collaborator with Philip Pierce, who's collaborating with this. And I don't know if you can see this. This is diseased blood cells on the channel flowing from that side to this side. Flowing from that side to this side. And you can see there are regions, in principle, it's well mixed and it's uniform solid function. And there are kind of regions that are much, much more dark, and regions that are much more open. And this just keeps running, and you'll see these running through. And this is basically what happens when you have sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease, in very brief, what it means is that when your blood becomes deoxygenated, the blood cells become very stiff in a way they're not supposed to. And so blood cells which are incredibly flexible. So, blood cells which are incredibly flexible normally and can push their way through obstructions easily. If they become too stiff, that becomes more difficult, and you get jammed, you get clogs, and your veins. That's a very short summary of certain philosophies. So, the question, and then that motivates a much wider question, which is can we develop models, and particularly continuum models, of suspensions that might capture some of some phenomena associated with clothing. This work is really in its infancy, and what I'm going to show you doesn't at all resemble the video at the bottom. Going to show you doesn't at all resemble this video at the bottom for various reasons that I'm maybe able to tell you. But at least it's trying to get towards this question of can you have something that's flowing along and creates some sort of clock. So what you need to, from a continuum point of view, to model such a material is something a bit more advanced than say a Bingham fluid, although this is clearly not a Bingham fluid. It's two phases to it. It's got a host fluid and a solid particle. So the way we've gone here is you need So the the way we've gone here is you need some sort of rheology for what you think the mixture, the suspension is. You need to be able to allow solid fraction to evolve if you're going to get a build-up solid. You need some ability for that. And you need to allow the fluid to be able to flow differentially through the solid. So you need to allow the fact that sometimes fluid might flow faster than the solid in some way, but the particles are loop. So that's really planted by these so we can figure it out. The top one here is incomplete but widely developed. Incomplete but widely developed and used models for actually mu of I is the model for dry granular modeling sand. These mu of J models essentially a lubricated suspension of frictional compacts model for suspensions. Which I can give you the very bare bones of, and I'm not going to dwell too much on the details here, but I'm going to try and draw this back to something that looks a bit like a Bingham fluid, which is what I started with. So the continuum rheology, typically for suspension, Continuum rheology, typically for suspensions or granular light suspensions, including soft suspensions, you would typically write down something like this at the top, which says that the shear stress is proportional to the confining pressure. This is like a Coulomb friction, that's like a friction or more. And the great insight of various authors, Elizabeth Guzeli, etc., was to realize that this friction coefficient could depend on some non-dimensional parameter of the system in such a way as to make this a much more interesting relationship than it could. Is to make this a much more interesting relationship than it looks like. And indeed, you can also have a solid fraction that evolves as a function of this. Here, the non-dimensional parameter, which is this J parameter, which is really a comparison of sort of shear forces to pressure forces, if you like. This can all be reposed by just unpacking it into something that looks like this, which is a bit more familiar to anyone who's done fluorescence, where you have something that looks like a generalised Newtonian uh rheology with this slightly curious relationship for the for the for the pressure of the particles. For the pressure of the particles, which depends also on gamma dot. And then there's these functions eta s and eta n of phi, which I've just specified. And that's kind of what I'm showing here: this is measurements from a load of different things of how this shear viscosity blows up as the solid fracture approaches some maximum value. Reasonable. That's clogging. That's the yield stress. So that's kind of hard-wired into this. And again, what I haven't written down here is a third way of repacking exactly the same thing, which kind of Exactly the same thing, which kind of makes almost more sense if you're comparing to dealing with yield stress fluids. This you can repose exactly as something that looks like exactly like a Herschel-Poltic fluid, except that the yield stress is a function of the pressure. And indeed, the viscosity is also a function of the pressure. So you can rewrite this whole thing, something that looks just like a Bingham fluid or a Herschel-Polk fluid, but the yield stress depends on the pressure. It's not a constant. And the subsequent flow is a thing to do. That's sort of the phenomenology of. That's sort of the phenomenology of suspension and granularity that makes it different from simple viscoplastic fluids. Okay, beyond that, we have some other details which I won't dwell on, but essentially you need to consider mass, which is keeping track of where the solid fraction goes. There's some statement for the total flux of material. There's Darcy's law, which tells you how a fluid can flow differentially driven by pressure variance, and then the whole thing is to satisfy some sort of force. And if you play around with that, And if you play around with that and you look at, for example, flow down a pipe, you end up with an equation that looks quite simple. It's basically an advection equation for the total amount of solid. All of the complicated reality and everything is hidden in this nasty function up here, which is how you can follow that. And phenomenologically, the flow in the pipe looks very similar to what we saw before. As you increase the pressure, the particle pressure in the pipe, you get this central club-like region, shear layers on either side, just the same way as we did before. Just the same way as we did before. And what we're going to do is consider a channel that looks like this with some sort of obstruction and see what does that do with this sort of model. Well, this sort of model is actually almost exactly what you'd get if you do traffic flow modelling. This is a hyperbolic equation, and the kind of f's, the functions for the solid flux you get here, look exactly the same as what you do if you naively write down things for how does traffic flow on the road and when does it jam up. Follow the road, and when does it jam up? Because if I try to find steady solutions to this equation, then I'm simply solving f equals constant, which seems quite straightforward. And if I plot what f equals constant looks like for different radius of the pipe, you get these curves here. As a function of the average phi value, you get these curves. And the nice thing here, I'm conscious of the time, so I'm not going to spend too long, but the nice thing here is that straight away you can say, okay, so you start here. You can see, okay, so you start here as being your solution, and you vary the radius. You can just read off what the new solution is, and you map out for a pipe with a radius that varies like this. This is what you expect the solid fraction to look like as a bulk around the decrease. But you notice there's a second solution for this equation, which these things all come down again. So there's another branch of plausible solutions which all have much higher values of phi. So I could have gone for them instead, and picked these as my solutions, and then I have something where the phi is much, much higher. Where the phi is much, much higher as another plausible solution. And this is essentially in traffic flow or in blood flow of bytes, it's the same thing. You get you get this ability to transition from this steady state, which is flowing happily, to this one, which is almost a very high solid approach. I think, in the interest of time, well, this is probably helpful for interpreting that. So, this is just showing the pressure drop associated with a fixed flux in each of those two cases. And basically, what this is showing is that. What this is showing is that this is the degree to which the channel is compressed. So as this gets smaller, you're compressing the channel more. And basically, this is showing that the pressure drops here are sort of not that big, and the pressure drops on the high-fly barge are four or five orders of magnitude higher. In other words, that's kind of like saying, in this scenario, I'm fixing the flow rate and asking what the pressure drop would be. But if I was fixing the pressure drop, I would find this was basically clogged. This was not. Surprising. And that black region of no solution is kind of interesting because that's. Of no solution is kind of interesting because that's precisely where you lose all solutions. This thing, the solution goes below, you're revel up. And then you find this kind of interesting transient evolution to a backed up clog. So you find that, I won't go on the details, but basically what happens is that your initial fire starts up down here, builds up backwards and you get this backup of clog backwards. And I have a very bad movie showing this dynamic the alternate, which has about five frames and needs about 100. So the first one in particular is a massive. So, the first one in particular is a massive jump, but you'll trust me. I've been trying to get my PhD student to send a better one. She didn't manage to influence. But you see what happens, you start with a uniform phi, and you start flowing. This is the radius variance, and it basically backs up. In fact, what happens mathematically is a shock. You can see that's a shock back at the property. It's clocking upstream. Right, I'll stop there. I'm over time. I won't say anything else. Thank you. So, uh how do you take the transient growth of the blood?
