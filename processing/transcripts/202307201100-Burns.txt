Your here is a fairly formal picture of Todd. I think it was taken four or five years ago. And yeah, I was like, think here, is it anything else to do? I move to the next picture. Maybe I stop sharing the screen. On the screen. What were you presenting on? The PowerPoint, little slides. No, no, these were just pictures and photos. Oh, ah. That works. Now I have to share the screen again. Sorry, I'm not entirely experienced with doing this. Really, but so that's a more informal picture of all. More informal picture of Todd. That's very much how I think how I remember him. And I think many of us have seen him looking kind of like that. That was taken, I think, in 2012. That's my own picture. For those who are interested, the city in the background is Montevideo. I remember he and I were there at the same time. I remember we took a long I remember we took a long walk around the city and, among other things, walked around the football stadium. Todd had a serious interest in football of, I think, more than one kind. But anyway, so Todd was born July 131 year of right 1963. So, unfortunately, the reason why I have to give the talk is that he died just over, just less than a year ago. Yeah, it's unfortunately about 22. So, yeah, so yeah, he was diagnosed with liver cancer. With liver cancer at the beginning of July last year, and it progressed quickly. So, regrettably, I have to talk about the work of Todd. Yeah, so he was born in 1973. He grew up in Ann Arbor of Michigan, which explains some things about him, an undying dislike of certain football. Dislike of certain football teams, Notre Dame, and of course, Ohio State. Of course, he could be friends with colleagues from Ohio State, but not, I think, with their football team. Yeah, I think we don't usually talk about religion at math conferences, but the But he belonged to the, he was a Mormon, so officially the Church of Latter-day Saints. And that was a very big part of his life. So I think it is appropriate to bring it up here. His father was an anatomy professor at the University of Michigan, and his mother was a trade union organizer. I think there must be very few Mormons. Mormons who have mothers who are trade union organizers. So he had a rather unusual combination of quite socially liberal politics and the Mormon religion. Yeah, so he grew up in Ann Arbor. Yeah, he was a swimmer and water polo player when he was in high school. Polo player when he was in high school. You have plenty of stories about what order polo is like. It's a tough game. Yeah, so he, I'm not quite sure what order he did things in, but he, part of the Mormon religion is that you have to do a mission somewhere in the world trying to convert people. He did his mission in Belgium and much later. Much later, well, I knew him. He went back to Belgium and got into some of the places where he actually was doing his mission. And he's told me stories about what was involved. It was a pretty tough life. I mean, they had a very low budget. They sort of used bicycles and cheap train tickets and things like that to move around. I never dared to ask him if he converted anyone. But at the funeral last year, But at the funeral last year, there was somebody there who was a convert that he had made. He did tell me that back in the day when he did it, they were given almost no advice or preparation for what they had to do. Now, these young people went out thinking they would convert, make converts left right and center. And it's a really tough couple of years. You spend day after day dealing with rejection when you do it. My understanding is that the church now does provide some guidance to people who do that. And so then he did his undergraduate work at BYU, Wrigham Young University. And then he came to Northwestern as a graduate student. And that would be when I first met him. Of course, Him. Of course, it was a while ago. No, I don't exactly remember. It was probably around 2000. He finished his PhD in 2004. Once a while he was at Northwestern. He worked with Amy Wilkinson. She was his advisor. I also talked to him quite a bit about some of the things he was working on. So I knew him quite well, even then. After Northwestern, he went to the University of Maryland for three years as a postdoc. And then he moved to a, well, initially 10-year track, and then after that, 10-year position at Brigham Young University. So while he was there, he became one of the pillars of the department. And he might have, I can't remember now, I think he might have had some more or less formal position. Some more or less formal position, something like deputy chair of the department. But he was certain, you know, many math departments have somebody in the department. He's the person who, in many ways, makes things work. He was that person at Brigham Young. He did a lot of the difficult stuff for them. He was also undoubtedly in line to be chair of the department at some point. To be chair of the department at some time. So, Yama, he did everything with teaching, working on the hiring committees, keeping the place sane. He was a pillar of common sense there. So, yeah, they greatly miss him. So, I think that's a rough summary of his professional career. Career. We heard something about the balance between sort of work and life at the career development event earlier this week. Todd certainly had that balance. His family was a huge part of his life. So he met his wife Mary, I think, while they were both undergraduates of BYU. And she was in Evanston with him while they were graduate students. She was a nurse and worked with. She was a nurse and worked at Evanston Hospital. And I lived near a chocolate shop in Evanston, an excellent chocolate shop, which is still in business. And so every time I go out there, I take a box of chocolates. In principle, I give it to Todd. My understanding is that it's Mary who actually eats the chocolates. Right. And then they had four children. Children. Since I can remember the names of three of them and blanking on the fourth name, I'll just leave it at four children. They range in age now, I think, from about 12 to 19. Right, so that's a rough summary of Told's life. I mean, obviously, only just a sketch. And I think the job now is to talk about his mathematics. Mathematics. Maybe I'll start with one fence instead. I've got pictures of it. After that, I can put the screen up and see if I can persuade the listening to work. So one of Todd's bigger projects in terms of our, in fact, probably more than half of Todd's published work is in this book with Boris Hasselblad. They have the idea of writing a, I think. idea of writing a monograph about sort of hyperbolic flows. They were going to put in it sort of the results, the flow versions of all of the things that we know for diffeomorphisms. And where we're saying, yeah, the flow case is basically the same, except when it isn't. And this expanded to a book of about 600 pages. And there are things that they were not able to fit into it. We're not able to fit into it. So I own this book. I use it. You should own it. It's an excellent book. I think I even have a couple more pictures of it. There is a. Yeah, it's a serious block. So maybe I can leave off the pictures of that point. Should I have a. I will say a few words after Dan at the end, and I'll need a picture of that. Need a picture of that, but I so I think I can turn the screen off the portrait off for the time being the screen now. Okay. So, I think it's hard to know the medics basically. I think. I think pretty much it really is type of diamonds. Thanks. And so hyperbolic diagnoses, in particular, hyperbolic invariant sets and also a good deal of work on partially hyperbolic. Usually hyperbolic if you have more resistance. So, quite a lot of good things. We're in the city. I think some of the others think he had rather short shrimps. I'm going to make. Yeah, he wrote, well, I went through Matt's sign yet. It's been too intrusively, yeah. And I think there are several things that he wrote that haven't made it into Matt's sign yet. That I met. I found 24 co-authors. And so I'm not, I can't possibly cover all things here. So let me just talk about some of the ones where I, with some of them, it's because I can say something, which is not concise here. A couple of other things, it's because I actually know something about them. And so I will apologise in advance, but not really. In advance, but not really doing justice to past work. And I'll see what I can do. As I should mention Jerome Musey, who we had hoped would be able to come to this conference, but he couldn't. He has six joint papers with Todd. And I think in terms of page on pages with Todd, Pages were taught about Hesselblack as the writing the book can do for you. But Jerome was a major eye. And I think you're going to talk about some of that work. So a lot of this work and I think the majority of his work in the last 10 years was to do with things like intra-p. Like entriply equilibrium states. And Dan's going to attempt to survey what Todd did there. So I will, I'm going to vaguely go backwards through Todd's career in this first part and actually end with the beginning of it. So, yeah, so Dan's going to talk about. Yeah, so Dan's going to talk about that. I think the next topic I will talk about is what are called symbolic extensions. So, the idea is you have some genuine map. Tenure it's map from maybe a metric space to itself. Maybe it's compact. I'll talk a few of us if this is Kubex's compact. And then the idea is that you have a you know, you have some covering of this by a map, which I'll call sigma from y to y. And sigma from y to y is a To Y is a shift map. So the shift that you're talking about here is on a finite number of symbols. You're not necessarily using the whole shift. You just want some closed such shift, not necessarily a finite type. Because I think they do like to have a finite alphabet. And the moral for this, I think, is what you do when you've got a Macle. What do you do when we've got a mark of partition? You the alphabet is the indexes, the sets of the partition. You get the shift on the rectangles and it projects to, you know, oh, I forgot to put in the projection. High is it also continuous surjection? And so the idea is that you've got symbolic dynamics up here, which you might be able to understand. To understand, and then you can project that understanding downstairs. There's the notion of a principal symbolic extension. And in that case, if you have an invariant measure down here, it lifts to an invariant measure up here. You can only have more entropy up here. And if you've got a principal extension, you have the same entropy. So same entropy. Same intriguing for lists of all invariant images. So symbologic extensions are very nice when you have problem. You don't always have them. And whether or not you have them seems to be a rather subtle question, and it seems to depend a lot on the smoothness of the map. lot on the smoothness of the map. So I think there's a theorem we all while Todd was at Maryland his mentor was Mike Boyle. So I think that's where this part that was where he got interested in this stuff. And this says that if is is asymptot i think i can agree that asymptotically uh asymptotically h expansive uh so in particular that is the case if f is c infinity so the c infinity diffeomorphism of a manifold if that's the case then if has a principle If has a principle symbolic extinction extinction on the other hand, there are examples of C1 devium mortisms which do not have symbolic extensions at all. So, yeah. Yeah, smoothness seems to matter, which I guess isn't. I think the motivation for doing this has got a lot to do with studying entropy. And entropy is known to behave differently depending on the smoothness. You can tell this is not an area that I work in. So, yeah, so the setting in which Todd thought about this was actually hyperbolic to be in your presence. And there's, I hope I'm not getting this wrong. My understanding is that there is a conjecture about what ought to happen. So let's have F from M to M, the C1. I will write PHD. That was Michelle Brun's abbreviation for partially hyperbolic dichiomorphism. So we then have a split. So we then have a splitting. So this is the three-bundle version of partial hyperbolicity. And then the conjectures, well, there are two possibilities. This case, one, that EC splits as a sum of invariant one-dimension subject. One dimension subroutines. Case two, which is case one didn't happen. So it didn't split in spherical thing originally on sub-bundles. So if you decompose this as much as you can, you get at least one sub-bundle that's at least a two-dimensional. And then, depending on which case you're in, they Case you're in, they expect very different behaviors. The conjecture is that case one should imply symbolic extension. Well, in fact, case one should be equivalent to having a symbolic extension. So, in case two, the belief is that you don't. Is the induct, and so there are some results of uh, I will abbreviate Disha to EF. So, with Lorenzo Diaz, who could give this part a great deal better than I could, they showed that generically, oh, uh, what is saying extension. I'll just say extension things assured in case two. So this part of the conjecture is basically right. Then there's a paper with the same two authors plus, say, say, Simply Co. and Jorge Viotez. And this says that you get That you get, in fact, a principal symbolic extension case one. And I hope I read it correctly. My understanding was that you always get that in case one. So this conjecture is very much true. And then, oops, yeah, and then there's another result in this direction with Todd and With Todd and Boogwe. And this time we have C2. This makes a difference. So, and we have the dimension of EC equals 2, and we assume it doesn't stay too. So this was C1. This was C1. We now have C2, and you do get a symbolic extension under older say conditions. I won't take the time to spell out the details of what they are, but they involve certain bunching of the constants that separate. Constants that separate the behavior of these three bundles. So that's some work in that direction. I think the next area involves thinking about centralizers of diffeomorphisms. So there's a conjecture of SMA. There's a conjecture, it's maybe, or maybe it was a question, it's become one of his problems for this century. And the idea is that most diff let me write it this way most difficult to find the same thing. The powers of themselves. So there's a lot of evidence for this conjecture. Part of the evidence is the industry of studying the actions of higher rank groups. So Z2 actions, ZK actions. It's pretty clear that the maps you're looking at there. Pretty clear that the maps you're looking at there are not typical. This is an area that Amy Wilkinson has been very much interested in, I think I can say for the whole of this century. And so I think he was steered in this direction by her influence. So there are recent results of Bonetty, Crevicier, and Wilkinson, which say I think roughly that's my Roughly, that Smales conjecture is true in the C1 topology. But so, Todd did some early work in the direction of trying to verify Smale's conjecture. So, he has a couple of papers along with titles, which I think explain themselves. He says, trivial centralizers. Papers, one of them is for XCMA, different amorphisms. And the other is for codimension one practice. So he did some of the early work there. Work in that area. And you also have another graduate student who worked on things like that. So I think that now gets me back to the beginning of Todd's career. I may go just a little over my half hour because I want to say something about his thesis work. This is what wendy sort of got him launched. There was a question. There was a question which appears in the top and castle textbook. In that book, they attributed the question to Alexeo. I hope I've got to remember the right name. There's a paper by Anosos from not so long ago in which Anossos says that he thought of the Christian. He, in other words, possibly others, thought of this Christian in the. Thought of this question in the 1960s. So let's have all equal lambda is going to be a compact hyperbolic in viral state. Now, put up listing so that I know what I need to say. Yep. So this set is called either locally maximum. The book we languish for that as basic. If there is an open set U that contains lambda and lambda is equal to all the x's in u such that f to the n of the x is in u for all the positive n gives the integers. So that's the idea of a one-wheel maxim. The idea of a one-way maximum suit. And the question is: Lambda is, I'll just say, and U contains lambda, you being open must be a locally next. locally maxible lambda prime with lambda inside of lambda prime inside mu. So this question was this question was presented as open in the textbook answer and effectively sound we know whether And in fact, you know, when the first counter example was found by Fatim, who didn't publish it and didn't publicise it very much. The same example seems to have been rediscovered by Provisia. So there's a fairly well-known map of, I forget whether it's T3 or T4 with certain properties. I think it's really busted. Properties, I think it's very custom transity of something you assume inside of there is a counterexample to this to the yes answer to this question. So they found that or produced a simple two-dimensional examples. And so I'd like to show you a couple of there. I think this is actually understandable. Oh, and I'm going to need to go back to the screen. Oh, okay. So the first of these examples is being summarized very much like this. Very much like this. So, in the case of surfaces, if you think about lambda, there was a question, there are some theorems which Todd actually proves in his paper. But if you have lambda for a surface demomorphism, the only way I can have the interior is the demorphism is in a more solid map of the torques. And there are hypotheses. There are hypotheses, there has to be some hypothesis in the theorem, like that the lambda has to be transitive or it has to be locally maximal. Either of those work. Now, here's actually Jeff Sharp was into, Todd proved these theorems in his paper. It seemed to have been sort of now, but never really down. I think Jeff Sharp was into the theorem in this. Because he took the theorem in his graduate course and left out the extra hypothesis. The graduate students, it's good to know, couldn't have proved the theorem. And Todd came up with a counterexample to the theorem without the extra hypothesis. The idea is you just have a little set here. Somewhere over here, you have an attractor. You want to think of a one-dimensional attractor. And over here. And over here, you have a one-dimensional repeller. And you iterate this thing and it goes over to the attractor. And when it goes near the attractor, it stretches out in one direction and kind of converges into the attractor. If you go over to the repeller, it does the same kind of thing if you deray it backwards. And there's one direction which I'll draw in black that stretches out that way. That stretches out that way along the repeller. And as you iterate backwards, there's a direction that also is the attractor. But when you go backwards, the complementary direction starts looking like the one-dimensional repel. And so you can get a compatible hyperbolic structure here that fits in with what you've got there and there, and you build your example. So it does that. So he does that in the paper. And then he has another example and he has a picture of it, which I now need to put up. I need to share the screen and I need to get to and I don't need to share that, I have to share something else. And uh the system. So make it work I can share screen. Looking but it's not in screen sharing, but why are we not seeing it? Seemed try it again. I'll do that. You're impatient. It does come up, we'll see. Come out, you'll see it. Did it appear last time, did it? I think it would be a reasons why I didn't want to draw this picture. Well, maybe I will try to draw a symbolic. What is this picture of? What's that? What is it meant to be a picture of? What's up? What is it meant to be a picture of? Involves the pleat in a tractor plus some other sky hunter. And my efforts are drawing the pleat in a tractor or not attracting. So we will go, we'll try to go conceptual. You have no graphic in. Maybe I'll try. Maybe I'll try. You'll see if it looks better. You've got your weekend attractor. It's got a fixed point in it, which I might as well look at the picture since I can see it. Yeah, this is a much better picture than the one I was about. Better picture than the one I was about. Um, so you can die, you can even see the cursor. So we have this, so the so yeah, this is this where it's got three holes in it. And then this thing maps into itself. What's bounded by the dark outline is the first image of the original. The first image of the original thing. So I think this end here goes up to there, and the image of this hole contains the other hole. And the two bumps here, you can see growing out of this part here. So there's the beacon attractor. It has a fixed point in it, and then there's this point. And then there's this point Z, which is the intersection of P. The point P over at the left is a sample, and the attractor that he builds is the union of P, the orbit of Z, and the bleak attractor. And then it's arranged that the, I guess it's the stable manifold. Stable manifold for Z does a tangential intersection.
