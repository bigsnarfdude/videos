It's important for trying to understand like for okay, I don't in the context of like quantum gravity, if we expect that some sort of quantum state is describing all of reality at all times, sort of simultaneously in the same quantum state. Simultaneously in the same quantum state, then I think we should expect that the theorem I described actually applies and makes it hard to have clear assignment of probabilities that relate different times if we have some kind of wave function of the universe that is also a timeless state. And so I think. And so I think that, well, yeah, thinking about the measurement problem ultimately is relevant for quantum gravity. Okay, and then Tim, go ahead, and then we have a question in the queue. Well, I guess I raised the things that we were kind of interested in pursuing, but I guess the thing that I find very thing that I find very intriguing is this metric description and you know what what will happen what happens if we thought about considering photons propagating on a curved background how does the actual curvature interact with this sort of bohmium curvature so I find that So I find that an intriguing question. And also, you know, when you go away from this quantum optics approximation, you're going to get things like particle production and stuff like that. And I think there may be some really interesting insights that come from looking at it through this model. Okay, and Thomas has a question. Thomas has a question. Yeah, my question, I guess, was directed towards Jeep. So, yeah, to me, quantum theory seems to be a theory which, you know, as a like kind of classical observer with like huge amounts of degrees of freedom and a large mass, how I describe, you know, an electron or something like that. It's not at all clear to me that I'm allowed to model myself as a quantum state and then make inferences based on quantum theory. I think this extends possibly to a theory of quantum gravity. Extends possibly to a theory of quantum gravity. Like, if I'm going to describe the universe as a whole, it's not clear to me why I should be allowed to use quantum theory, which is developed, you know, like in a lab where there's multiple, you know, this probabilistic theories, you know, multiple repetitions of events. And yes, I guess that was my like, if I had to reject one assumption from your theorem, it would be the kind of pre-assumption that the friend is allowed to model themselves a quantum system and make inferences about measurements on them. On them. Yeah. Well, I agree with your point about the megaton the quantum gravity, and I think maybe this is kind of also where I have a similar worry. Any response, Philippe? Yeah, I well, I think somehow I agree, but maybe not for the same reasons. I'm somewhat skeptical of the idea of a universal theory. Universal theory. So I think if that's what you're sort of getting at, then maybe it's just always there are paradoxes of trying to apply the theory to describe ourselves and it will sort of show itself in different ways, but there's always going to be trouble with this. Then I think that's fine, but there's no Fine, but there's not really anything better. We also have to sort of assume that it's universal to try to make progress. So I don't have some kind of definite answer to this. Yeah. Hey, Alex, you want to make a question? I have a question or maybe? Yeah, it was kind of more of a follow-up along this, along the same lines. There was this argument in one of DeWitt's papers from the 50s that really made me feel uncomfortable. Made me feel uncomfortable. He basically says that probability is a phenomenological thing, and he argues that the whole Hilbert space structure is to like conserve probabilities and time. And so I guess it's sort of sympathetic to what Thomas was saying about it's not even clear that when you don't have a notion of time a priori, that the notion of probability is good. And I actually told this to Esteban, and Esteban said to me, He's like, Well, what are we going to do if we don't have probabilities? Like, well, what are we going to do if we don't have probabilities? And I agreed with him, and so I don't know what to do. So, I was kind of wondering if-I don't know if you had a thought on that, or if maybe you have to take probabilities as fundamental, or I don't know. I just wanted to say what I thought it was relevant to what you guys were discussing. Do you well, Timothy, do you want to answer this? Oh, was that directed at me? Well, it was either of you, but I assume Tim had a different question. Okay, okay. I want to just make a comment or ask a question to Philippe, but I'm not sure how to answer Alex's question. There's more just food for thought, and if someone has a good reply, I would appreciate it. But anyway, we can talk. It but anyway, we can talk later. Yeah, I mean, there's kind of a school of thought about probability that kind of sees it as just extension of rationality. So that like Bayesian sort of view on probability theory is just an upgrade of logic somehow. Then, if you take this view, it's kind of hard to imagine that you could. Imagine that you could get rid of it. Well, I don't have better to say. Okay, Tim, why don't you go ahead? Okay, so something that I wonder about, so in your thought experiment, the kind of jarring thing, I guess, is that the frame. I guess, is that the friend, you know, seems to measures one thing and then they think they measured something else, if you want to believe quantum mechanics. And that seems like a jarring thing that, you know, if you think about collapse theories where somehow the brain is collapsing the wave function, this seems to not work with it. But I kind of think that there's a collapse. Think that there's a classical version of this, which maybe doesn't seem quite so weird. If you, I mean, it, because Wigner obviously has huge powers in this situation. So, I mean, you could imagine that in a classical world, if you had enormous powers, that you might be able to unwind someone's brain, as in a Brain, as in erase what they thought had happened and record something new that they decided happened. I mean, if you had control over the, you know, all systems within the lab or whatever. So, is that any stranger than what you have to assume if you believe unitarity of quantum mechanics here? I think. I think, yes, because in the classical case, I mean, it's weird and it's clearly kind of, it cannot be the default setting. No, it has to be kind of an exceptional case. We have to assume most of the time memory is reliable and so on. But in the classical case, if we're looking at that the initial state. That the initial state is some kind of classical GPT, so well, you know, a bit, a random bit probability distribution over two outcomes. Then there would not be really any problem in satisfying the assumption P1 and P3, so that you would have you would be able to assign a probability distribution to the memory at the two times, and maybe it's not a perfect channel. Maybe it's not a perfect channel, so maybe there is some disturbance. And also, it would be linear in the initial state of the sort of classical bit. But you wouldn't, there was no natural sort of assumption P2 of unitary quantum mechanics of kind of non-disturbance single-time prediction and linear multiple time prediction. This is the tenth. Multiple time prediction. This is the tension. But if you don't have the non-disturbance aspect, then there is no, the theorem does not hold. Well, the assumptions can be satisfied if you drop P2, which would be the case in classical mechanics. So I think there is some kind of distinctively quantum thing going on here. Thanks. Okay, any other final comments or questions? We're pretty much out of time here, I think. I'm not seeing any comments or questions in the queue. So let's thank the speakers and everybody else once again. Again, uh, and thank you all for attending this hybrid meeting in two time zones and with two time directions. Since the evening sessions come from the morning and the morning sessions go to the evening, which is perhaps appropriate for the theme. And hopefully, someday we can have a meeting where we can get both, all you know, all three segments of the globe in one spot. And I also would like to single out Flaminia and thank her heartily for all her effort. She had to take care of all the video work for recording and managing. And literally, Lucy Ann and I were blockaded from doing this. So she deserves a round of applause. Thanks a lot. Thank you all. And we'll be in touch in some kind of
