That in case you're already tired of math or something, at 1 p.m. you can go on the guided tour of BAF Center, rescheduled from yesterday. It leaves at 1 p.m. from the Professional Development Center. Okay, so our last talk of the morning will be Xin Ting Wang, Twist Separated Poisson Algebras and Related Properties. Thank you, Dan, for the introduction. And I also want to thank the organizer, Chelsea and Jason, for the invitation. I'm very happy to be here. I'm very happy to be here. So, this is a joint work with Tang Xing and Jiang Zhang, and the paper is already in the archive with the numbers there. So, this is a talk about twisting graded parsley algebras. So, let me spend some time first introduce the basic concept, then we're going some properties related to the twistings. So, I always like to start with the settings. So, first setting is probably all known. Is probably oh no, start with K, base field, and out of safety, I'm going to let K to be algebraic closed. And even more safer, characteristic zero. Now, most of the results in my earlier talk, they do not need this assumption, but later, when I talk about specific examples in three-dimensional, Specific examples in three-dimensional Parcel algebras, we do need to throw this in. And A is a K algebra. Now it's time to introduce the main character of my talk. So in 1809, when the physics are not that fast enough, a French mathematician, Simon Brousson, one day wrote on a blackboard. Wrote on a blackboard, I'm sure not nice as this one. A bracket between two smooth functions on a classical remaining manifold of dimension 2F. In terms of the bracket, he is successfully to rewrite the homeotonic mechanics in terms of the bracket. And since then, he was referred to as the craziest French mathematician by the Philippines. So, actually. So actually Tangxing has already mentioned the definition of Parson algebra in the first day talk, but please pardon me five minutes. I'm going to rewrite the definition just to ensure you that 200 years ago, it's not very hard to be called crazy. So what is the possible So what is a partial algebra? We start with a K algebra and A is called a partial algebra. If the following two conditions hold, first, A is a commutative KR, remember? So everything is nice in the commutative world. But you have something which I shall put a quanta in front. I shall put a quantum in front that reflects the quantum property, which is a lead bracket. So we do have a bilinear form, right? Bilinear form from A cross A to A that is both a by derivation and the Libra suppose A by derivation. Derivation and lead fraction. Okay, so this has been called crazy 200 years ago. Hopefully it's not standard. So let us go back, go to the right side of the board. So on this board, I'm going to give you a running through examples showing you how these concepts will reflect in this concrete partial algebra. So it is defined. Algebra. So it is defined actually in one of the Takosha Cesarea's paper. Actually, the purpose of the paper is to quantize these graded Poisson algebra. So these families of Poisson algebras are depending on two parameters. One is the integer n starting from 1. The other is the number aligned the base field. So let me just start with the index from 0 because it's more like projective things. And you run through to n. So after you have n plus. Through to n. So after you have n plus 1 variables, which can be considered a project space pn. And being a parcel algebra means I have to define a bracket, right? Both by derivation and a lead bracket. Since by derivation, so the only thing I need to define on the generators. Then you extend on all the monomials by the lead through both sides. So it's good to just define xi xj, and that's the form. Okay, the integers. Okay, the integers a, the parameter a appear in the coefficient of these two terms. And I would like to do some easy examples when the number n is not too big. So when n is 1, I'm going to get a polynomial ring. And the bracket between these two is like a Jordan dot, right? So it's actually, it can be considered as a semi-classical limit of the Jordan plane. And when n is 2, you have three variables. You have three variables, so in order to describe the bracket, you have to write down three brackets on the generators between them. So that's the formula I get. And it's a lot kind of all extension of the Jordan planes, if you want to consider the non-commutative version. And when n is 3, that special one, when n equals that special fractional, negative 5 or 4, and that is appear earlier in Penn's work. It is called the exceptional Poisson algebra. Exceptional Poisson algebra E3, where Ping is trying to use Poisson algebra to get S regular algebra in dimension 4. So I will continue this example when I go through the talks. So that will always stay there until the very end. So now I'm going to try to do some gradings. So now let me remind you of what happens when we do in the associative graded algebra case. Graded algebra case. So consider A is a graded associative algebra, and for the sake of easiness, I just grade by the integers. You can grade by any model, but it's fine. Integer will be enough for today's talk. I suppose it's great. Jabir. And it's also mentioned in Pamini and others' talk that we can have a twist. Talk that we can have a twisting system which twists the greater product in A. Right? So that would be a definition of twisting systems. And we grieve it as jump twist. And for every twisting jump system, we can have a jump twist array, which keeps the grader module category Morita equivalent. Morita equivalent. So, what we do for this talk is to add a Poisson here, which I'm going to use the red one. I'm trying to get in the semi-classical limit case what really means to having a twisting system for a greater Parcel algebra. First, when you say a greater Parcel algebra, it means the two maps, which mention the definition of always greater than max. Always grade the max. So not only the product, the lead bracket is also grade the lead out. So now the definition comes like this: a collection down to n. Now I always assume it's a Z grading, so you have a Z component of graded K derivations of A and each of them at degrees. And each of them at degree zero is called, let me use abbreviation, a parson to string system. If the following three conditions hold, one, two, three. First one, they are commuting derivations. Second is when you take the product of two We take the product of two elements in A, take the corresponding component. By the way, I'm going to also explain the notation here. I mean the degree of A. And when I write elements in the talk, it's always homogeneous. So you're going to have two parts. And the last one is a little bit complicated. So I'm going to explain the last identity. Identity is if you take three homogeneous elements, you're going to have identity over top. So let me try to remember it. Right? You have one piece and you're cycling through ABC. So basically you have three dimensions. You're cycling through ABC and that's it. Okay, so once you have a system like this, you check three properties, then if it holds, then it's called a Poisson twisting system of a greater Poisson algebra. So now comes two questions. I'm trying to answer. Two questions I'm trying to answer in the following, I think, 30 minutes. Is first, if we have a Python twisting system, what we can do with it, right? Second, is how can we going to construct Poisson twisting systems which are easy for us to do examples or do other things? So I'm going to answer the first question, what we can do with the Python system. And the answer probably is obvious, right? You can twist, get a twisted Poisson system. You can twist, get a twisted puzzle out. So the next thing is I'm going to give you a twisted version, a puzzle version of what's really going on for a twisted jaw twist of a socially braided algebra. So the definition goes like this. You start with a partial twisting system of A then Then the twisted power algebra. Let's just use the exactly same notation, right? Exactly the same as in the associative operated case find to be right? He still remembers for You still remember for Poisson algebra you do have two structures. The multiplication as a commutative gradient algebra are the same as a Li bracket. So that's a choice of twisting, right? One twist one of them, one twist both, and I mean if you twist both to have compatibility conditions. So the choice for here is we do not want to change the algebra structure. So and the gradient algebra they are exactly the same. But I'm going to twist the Poisson bracket. So the new Poisson bracket, let me use a lower delta to mean the new one. I'm going to write elements, so easy to figure out. Easy older one, add some extra terms. And extra terms coming from using the twisting systems. Okay, and since I want to convince you the right definition, so I will add actually one more thing to make sure it's actually a definition level. So at the same time, you verify this wealth. As well in mind. Right. Okay? So I'm not done with the what we can do part and I'm going to finish one more theorem regarding the puzzle twisting then move to the what can we find part so I'm going to make things easier. So I'm going to end up set up setup three okay so Okay, so I'm going to make it easy. So A now is just a polynomial rings. I want to grade it. Grade it. Now the things I want to emphasize that in this case we do not need this puzzle algebra to be connected. So actually x, y, x, n can be arbitrary degrees. So mixing a little bit of Degrees. So makes it a little bit flexible for the later use. But I do need this number, which you add in all the degrees. And this number will appear later. So actually it should not be zero in the base field. But you'll see why it doesn't matter for the number. Okay, and I also need a very special one called E. So E is so-called order derivation. So what order derivation do is if you have a home. Just map to the degree of that element scale. Okay? So it's all the derivation, but I want to add something more than that. It's not only all the derivation, it's actually a Poisson derivation. So I don't think I will give a definition of what Poisson derivation is, but it's pretty easy to explain. So Poisson derivation is a derivation as It's a derivation as algebra at the same time a lead derivation. So it's both commutative algebra derivation plus lead derivation. So that's called constant derivation. Okay, so under this assumption, I'm going to give you something more. Basically, I'm going to give you a power-shown version of what Nakayaka automorphism is. I'm going to define the modular derivation. So a modular derivation of A is defined as, so let's use the letter MA. Okay? So it's actually a derivation. So how are you going to act some elements, right? So it's given by the following formula. So you take some, you use every To use every element bracket with A, use a Poisson bracket, and take partial derivative distance polynomial ring. The calculus tells we can do that. And sum the map. Okay? And that is called the modular derivation. And it represents actually many properties that the Nakayama motor play roles as in the skill Kalaviya case. If you look at the information or dilation and the vice visa. Or division and vice visa. Same classical limit. And inspect showcase A code unimodular. If this case, this is zero, exactly representing what Nakey Automotive equal to identity, that will be called a Kalabi or CY case. Now I'm going to give you, now let me just break this. Okay. Let me just continue this. So for this example, we have defined this greater than the Parcel algebra. And this case, everything is generally in degree one. So it's a projected space. And I have some numbers keep here which will remind you what the market. So, I'm going to first take a very special derivation called the downward derivation, which just shifts a variable one step ahead. Okay, so it's a derivation, and you can check it's not. Derivation, and you can check it's not only a derivation, it's actually a Poisson derivation. So it's also a Lie derivation. If you just plug in there, it's easy to check. And we can apply this formula. Okay? Because MA is a derivation, so you only need to check on the generators. So we can figure out the formula. The modular derivation of that one, A M A, that will be the parameters, is the formula is n plus 1. n plus 1 n plus 1 times delta. And that explains why the strange numbers appear because when you plug in 3, that number is exactly making this unimodular. So it explains why this is actually in Ping's example, it's a unimodular classroom algebra. And more than that, you can see for every n, that only unique A making this unit module. Okay? Okay, so let's do something more than that. So I'm going to actually construct, in this example, a twisting system using this Poisson derivation. I'm going to twist it and to let you see what's happening after the resulting twist the Poisson afterwards. Okay, so I start with this Poisson derivation. Maybe I should write Derivation. Maybe I should write here, maybe for us to see. I consider the following collections, right? For example, each homogeneous piece N, and I will suggest not linking N, so let's use P. Right? And we can check it's actually satisfied the twisted system definition. So I have views of notation, I'm d using data, which is degree one. And it doesn't matter. And it doesn't matter if you time the scalar B. So I'm actually using this as a parcel twisting system effect. Okay, so you can check just by plugging the three conditions over there. Then I can twist A, right? So you can think about what's the result of this. Right? So that twisted puzzle algebra is actually isomorphic to NA minus. To n A minus B. So when B varies, one consequence of this is all the families, when you fix N, the parameter A, are all Poisson twisted of each other, or Poisson twist each other. Okay, so let me continue over here. So now let me give you one more consequence of having a piece partial algebra. Twist-Partial algebra. So maybe I'll start with the lemma. And remember, it set up 3a, the polynomial ring, so everything should be easier. I will not repeat that in all the lemma statement here. So basically what you have, if you take delta as a Poisson derivation of A, A is a polynomial, just like in the setup. Nomary, just like in the setup. Then, exactly the same, we can check if you take n delta, that will be a Poisson twisting system. So, and you do the exactly same checking, that n is a Poisson twisting system of A, right? So, also abuse of notation, I'm just using that for the first degree piece. You know this Poisson twisting system? Twisting system. And also, I want to relate the modular derivations of the original Poisson algebra and the twisted Poisson algebra. So denote M N as the module derivation of A and the twisted part of algebra, which we already reserved the notation F delta. Reserve the notation, then we have a formula, just like the formula for Nakayama Otomoten, which then James and Mane has done in the homological editing thing. So very similar, but it's easier, for sure, easy. Okay? So the twisted modular derivation is one plus. Now the number D comes into play. Okay? So if you don't, maybe I can remind you D the degrees of all the D the degrees of all the generators. D the twisting delta, the Poisson derivation, minus, okay, then you have the divergence of delta times the order derivation. Let me quickly explain the divergence. Actually, I did a lot in calculus class. So it's acting on every variable, taking the rate. Okay, so one consequence of this lemma, which is the main result I'm going to state out here, is every parcel, greater parcel structure coming from a twisting of a unimodule. Basically, when you can solve this data to making sure the new modular derivation is zero, you do need the fact which I didn't write is that divergence of the modular derivation is always there, similar like the Is always there, similar like the homological determinant of macro bottom is one. So very similar over there, but I don't want to record the details. I'm just write down the name result. Okay, so when you have theorem, people always remind you you have to write the whole conditions out. And the whole condition is out. So bear me fulfillment. So if the d, which is the sum of all the degrees xi as the element in the base field non-zero, then I can construct twisting system using the modular derivation because it's also a fact. The modular derivation is not only a derivation, but it's a possible derivation. Okay, so I can twist. I can twist A with constructing a puzzle twisted system, but I have scaled it by the inverse of D. That's why D cannot be 0. Okay, where this minus MA, you just abuse the notation by just taking this system T. System T. I'm not not allowed to use N, so I'm using T population still. Okay? Just always remind you how these PTS so as a consequence of that we have the following so-called decomposition theory. Is every graded puzzle structure Every gradient Poisson structure, as long as this D is non-zero, always can be decomposed as two parts. One part is the bracket here, which is unimodular bracket. So let me just use unimodular. And the twisted part, which coming from this. So I'm going to use actually use a weight product between two derivations. Consider as the Poisson bracket is a bider. So here I'm using the weight product E. So here I'm using the weight product E, weight M. So if you want to write in elements, maybe that's easier, but let's just use that. It works a little bit simply, right? But if you want to look at elements, maybe that's more concrete. So original A is some mean modular Poisson bracket. Plus the extra part use E x of A and A X of E subtracting, that's how you define the wedge product, E and this E, just a quick reminder, is all the derivative. Remind is all the derivations. So we just keep degrees scalar by A. Okay? So this is something I like to also associate to the non-commutative world because in non-commutative algebra, for skilled collaboration, we don't know. For S skilled collaborator, S regular algebra, we don't know if it always twisted, john twist of a collabial ones. But in Poisson world, it's always this case. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now uh comes to the how can we find part, right? I've done with what we can do part. Now let's go back to see consider how can we find journal-wide TSA, right? TSA. So one constructing is already there is you can use Poisson derivation, right? For every Poisson derivation, you just construct in this process an NPC NP multiplied the original Poisson derivation is always a Poisson twisting system. But there's something more delicate than that. So actually you can do something more. Just like using automorphisms to construct a twisting system is not the only way to construct a twisting system. The same thing. So it's a little bit delicate there. So let me explain. Something which is flexible, I should rule in the conditioning puzzle error is a little bit. Confusing puzzle errors a little bit. So, let's do that. So, A derivation. Let's say delta of A is called semi, semi, right? Semi or semi, I'm not sure. Semi my of A, okay? If we have something which is uh weaker than a lead derivation. Weaker than a leader is weaker than so what's that same thing very similar like the third condition the TSA so for three homogeneous one you have the following cyclic identities so degree of A times A longer parenthesis bigger longer delta D C minus delta D C minus D minus P delta C and equal permutation. That is written equal to 0. Now from this definition, it's very easy to see Parcel derivation is actually a semi-parcel derivation because this identity is a lid derivation. Very quick remark. And the fact which I'll write in a second is actually you can use semi-Python derivations to construct a twisting system. So that's the result. I think I'm done with the main result. One of the main results about it. So lemma is suppose that delta be a graded k derivation of A one degree zero. Then the same process by multiply delta with up 3 n is a Python pristine system if and only if delta is Z mark derivation. So now the goal becomes find all the sign my Poisson derivations which suggesting why not you I Suggestion might not be as easy as ourselves. Right? But we have ways to overcome that, which I'm going to explain a little bit. But before that, maybe I already alleged myself to have the following definition as a measurement of how much you can actually twist a greater possible algebra. So space G S P E A going to be the collection, actually a finite link algebra connection. Final ID algebra connection of orders summarized. Let's say graded of degree zero. Well, the G actually is great. Degree zero. So this is a vector space which measures at least those twisting. At least those twisting systems coming from the semi-ones. We may have one which is not coming from semi-ones, but that is exactly you can do it. And I want a numerical number. Numbers are always better than vector space. So better than category. Probably that's what I believe. Oh, vice visa. Sorry, vice visa. The university, I guess. So, so So we can define the number which we call it RGT which basically measures the size. I can do some tricks. So it will actually tell you how large it is. By going negative, going negative. I have to subtract one from that. Now first time it looks very weird because why not just take this Because why not just take the dimension of that? The reason is: first, I want to make it negative to mean to have more freedoms. So, zero, and realize that our favorite Poisson derivation E is always lies here. E is always there. Greater than zero, degree zero, Poisson derivation. So, the dimensions start at one. So, that's why we have one subtract that to make sure that I'm most zero. At most zero. So that makes the following definition reasonable. A is equal to rigid if the RGA is 0. And I want something which is a little bit not rigid, but still very close to rigid or connecting rigid. If the RGT number A is In G number A is negative one. So zero means except all of them know a semi-Poisson derivation of degree zero. In negative one, you have extra one. Right? Besides the E, you have extra one. And hopefully we still don't forget about this example. So actually we can show for this family of For this family of Poisson algebras, the G S P D of A N A is always spanned by two elements. One is everybody knows, the famous Euler derivation. And the other one, we left no choice except this delta. So actually, that's all. The fact is, that's all the partial sign derivations. And we don't have sign line. And it and we don't have some elements. Everything is possible. So that immediately gave us the number. This is the number. Okay? So I'm going to also give you some ideas actually. We don't need to treat the semi-ones actually. Those semi-ones are. Those summer ones, as suggested by definition, is a little bit complicated, but we don't need to treat them. The reason is the following demo. Make the calculation a lot more easier. We have three facts about the space, GSPD. First is, if you twist the GSPD, twist A, the GSPD space always stay the same dimension. Dimension K. Never change the direction for any partial twisting system of any. Okay? Second is that if A is a unimodular, the modular deriving means zero in this is that implies that implies that actually only need to care about only need to care about the Poisson variation. So the seminal ones naturally becomes the Poisson comes. Now we do have examples which they are not the same strictly bigger there, but once you're in the unimodular case, that's all the same. So computing this, I think will be a little bit easier than computing this, in a modular ones. And the trick for doing that is actually seeing for each pair, there's one unique family in a module, and everything is twisting a bit. In the module, and everything is twisting of each other. So that's actually how you get this result by applying this and this, okay? To get that next one kind of results. The other one is if you only focus on the Poisson derivations, it's always a finite standard for E algebra because we are in a polynomial case, so we cannot have infinite. Cannot have anything basis for the puzzle derivations. Okay, so I have probably ten more minutes. Ten more minutes. Okay, so I'm going to do a big example. The great partner algebra is dimension 3. Okay, and that will be all. So now I'm focusing to the dimension 3 case. By the way, if you look at the associative case, the interesting thing is coming from dimension 3. Well, two dimensions are at each other regular, they're only two, each other plane and quantum plane. And the interesting thing is coming starting with dimension 3. The same thing for parcel brackets, right? Two-dimensional one, same, we already have them. One is a jordan. We already have them. One is Jordan plane. The other is hypothetical PA manufacturers. QIJ, next up, here, next one. These are pointed type. But in dimension 3, there are more choices. So the interesting part of brackets come in dimension 3, starting with dimension 3. So last setup. And after that, we are done. I'm going to go down. Last setup. So here, I'm going to focus on the three-dimensional. I'm going to focus on the three-dimensional case. And for three-dimensional, bear with me, I'm going to break my rules. I'm going to use xyc. Well, that's me that people call three-dimensional. And also, bear with me, I'm going to just connect the gradient because that's how you classify. I know that classification is a way the case, but maybe this one also will satisfy most of you, like me. And I want to focus on the unimodule words because this suggests us if you really want to know how much freedom you have to twist, you only need to focus on the unimodule ones. When you twist at the space, imagine done Java. So I'm going to focus on the unimodular ones. Structure. I'll be buried myself. Structure. Now, for the module one, you three dimension, I think it's also mentioned in Milan's talk, it's always given by a potential. Potential with a Jacobian bracket. So given by a cubic. How is omega? Omega say. Omega, say in degree 3, so it's a cubic. Really easy. Connect the grade, generate degree 1. And the bracket, you can use XY generators or you can write a compact form, just like Proisson did 200 years ago. The determinant of the Jacobian matrix of F omega. Okay, it's just a quicker way to write it. And we want to know in this case what are these numbers will matter. Okay? And usually it will depending on the structure of omega, right? Or the geometry of the cubic curve in P2. So let me write the final result. There will be a lot of equivalent conditions depending on time. I may write 5 to 10. Write 5 to 10. So that's the final result. Okay? So always remind myself for theory I have to write the whole book. So that was DXR and read the module. Read module break password generate. Okay, now here I really needed the k to be algebraic close and characteristic zero. So this zero definitely needed the safety of the field to guarantee it words. Positive characteristic, I do not dare to say anything yet. Dare to say anything yet. So the following are equivalent. The following equivalent. First means we have the rigidity condition. Right? Yes, the rigid means that it cannot be twisted. Right? It cannot be twisted. The only thing you can twist is all over one, but you can even check the all over and get nothing new. Second is every twisting. Is every twisting where I sum up 2A for every twisting. Okay. Third one is omega, you have a geometrical explanation, omega is irreducible. We only allow omega to be irreducible cubics. Be irreducible cubics. Smooth ones, elliptical, now smooth one. There are only two out to project. Equivalence, I'm going to might be able to write down explicit depending on how many I have left here. Fourth one, fifth one, that's a new conditions. I'm going to give the exact statement. I try to name them. Name them. Okay, first is every possible derivation. That match on the Poisson center. So what is the Poisson center? It's also a Poisson analog of the centers of associative algebra, right? The Poisson center is exactly the L set, B set. And it's easy to see that it's a sub-algebra of A, because by derivation property of the Poisson center. So let's say in the center is V. In the center is V. So if the Poisson derivation vanishing on the Poisson center, then it must be inner. Inner means is Tony derivation. Then is Tony. Samuel Tony means that it's a derivation given by the Poisson bracket by fixing one component. Okay, that's the equivalent condition and then the last one is we have have a homological characterization of what rigidity means. We go to the first Poisson cohomology. So I always define what the Poisson cohomology is. Just like the Hartshouse cohomology, degree one, degree zero, you can just explain it, right? Without meaning the Hartshouse components. Well, the first one is basically all the pass-home derivations, PDA pass-home derivations, D-derivation plus community derivations, only female ones, which are actually a model of degree zero Poisson cohomology. Exactly mimics what happened in the Hartzo cohomology. Every Hartzo common groups are modules of the centers. So the zero one is actually Poisson center. So it's a module of Poisson center. It's a module of partners is secret and the generator is in degree zero, which is our favorable one E. Okay, so we get if they are generally in degree one, they are all equivalent. And I'm going to give names. Also, thank you for Jason, Gallus, for explaining this definition. So I'm actually can write it. We call H4. So for partial algebra, we do not dare to. Algebra, we do not dare to stay in the air, but I think it's definitely about the ears. So, although we call H alone property, and it reminds me the property is in non-associated algebra, every derivation value, every derivation value in the center is actually in the derivation, the other minor properties. So, but it's called H ozone. And the next one we have another name. Well, we have another name, H G word animal. Because that has to be inside this one, because Z is definitely cannot be in a co-boundary. And so it's at least this, right? At least this. That's why it's called pH one minimum. And the last theorem said all these three files are equivalent. I think I'm done with my talk, but let me answer myself question. Myself question before I answer yours. So you are wondering that this is great for generating degree one, right? But you may be wondering what happens when we take a weighted case, right? Weighted project lines. And my answer is always this. Please come to the talk after the lunch. Okay, that's all. Thank you. Jason? I have a question. So is there a grand unification with this project in this group and twists of Poisson Hop valve? Yes, they are all twistings. That is my idea. I'll specifically. Maybe a more serious question. So, how does this play? Serious question. So, how does this play with developing algebra with some algebra? Yeah, that's a good question. Actually, we so in the three-dimensional ones, I don't think they are coming from the enveloping because when you look at enveloping, you have to start with a graded layout. Otherwise, the semi-class wouldn't give a graded one, right? So, in that case, I'm not sure about exactly answers. So, what we are focusing on is the three dimensions. So what about focusing on is the three dimensional one? If you have one more one, uh I I don't think you will have a the output case. So for the Gourd Sierra family, they have the AS regular family version, right? And they showed that when you fix N, That when you fix n, then for different a's that these alphabets are trying to twist up each other. So, in your case, for the Poisson case, you showed that you could get them using the Poisson twisting system that you the definition of the Poisson twisting system that you talked about. Is that correct? Did I get that right? It's more like a Poisson and a park. What's happening? On analog. So, what's happening in the quantum deformation world? Yes. And the number is exactly the same. If you look at the number, where the vanishing is exactly when the lower ones in the modular, the quantizations are exactly the same password version, what's happening in the information quantum. Frank. So I was just wondering, so you said this E derivation is always in this GPD set, right? So if you have two elements of the GPD set that differ by a multiple of E, for example, can you say anything about those derivations? Like, I mean, in some sense, this case, this theorem is about whenever every pair of derivations is, you know, a multiple of it. But can you say something? But can you say something? I mean, I guess what I'm wondering is: is there a reason why you don't just quoti out by the span of E to get something that is like kind of indicating the study is like the idea. So basically E is not something interesting. So it's like a trivial to say. So actually it it is taken care of in the definition, you have one minus that. But in this case, the E cannot be ignored because it's exactly the basis of the common. Exactly the basis of the core. When you consider twisting, the E should be definitely ignored. That's why the dimension is always one minor. The one pays respect to the other. Questions? All right, anything else? Otherwise, let's just think chinking again.
