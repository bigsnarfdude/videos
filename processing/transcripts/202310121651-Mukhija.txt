Thank you, and also thank you to the organizers. I want to talk about excellent wheel extension and I'll really try to keep it short. So, this is joint work with MLTP. This is some work that I did during my PhD. So, excellent wheel extensions were actually first came up in the paper of Elmer, Lam and Wordsworth, 1976, titled M and ML Fields. Title MNML fields and fish generators. So, what are excellent? Let me just recall for you quickly what excellent field extensions are. So, these are those field extensions for which, even after extending scalars for any F quadratic form, the Nisotropic part still stays defined within the base. Some fields extensions are privilegedly excellent. For example, the ones that preserve the Nisotropy transcendental and odd degree extensions, they are trivially excellent. That very, very excellent. But quadratic extensions, we very well understand how isotropy over them looks like. So we know that they are excellent for them as well. But there are many field extensions that are not excellent as well. So for to tackle with them first, let me talk about N excellency. Same as excellency, just it's only talking about those quadratic forms that are excellent up to a dimension n. And for obvious reasons, all the quadratic For obvious reasons, all the quadratic forms of dimension 3 are excellent as well. But one of the examples of non-excellency comes up when in characteristic NOT2 is of pi-quadratic extension with two quadratic units. And this example is due to Elmin, Lamb, Leynal and Fatzworth. So they gave an example of dimension 4. So these fields in particular are generally not 4x0. Up to 3, yeah, they are. But I don't want to talk about characteristic rather. But I don't want to talk about characteristic now during this talk. I'm going to talk about characteristic 2. And for characteristic 2, let me recall for you how first a form looks like. It looks something like blocks of dimension 2 and a diagonal pipe. They are almost diagonalizable. They are not completely diagonalizable, almost identicalizable. And instead of the dimension, we can actually talk about the type pipe of a quadratic form. And we call such a quadratic form to be of type RS. And then our definition that we can give is. Definition that we can give is that of RS excellence. So, we can call a quadratic field extension to be RS excellent if it is excellent for all the quadratic forms, particularly of type Rs. Not up to Rs, but only for all the quadratic forms of type Rs. So, characteristic 2, what are the field extensions that we know are excellent? Quadratic extensions, since we are in characteristic 2, we got to separate between separate 2, we got to separate between separable and inseparable, but we know that these extensions are excellent for both of them. Multi-quadratic, purely inseparable extensions. These are also excellent. And since we are talking about connectives to two fields, we've got to also differentiate whether these are excellent for quadratic forms or bilingual forms. So from now on, whenever I'm going to say that this field extension is excellent, I'll specify whether it's excellent for quadratic forms or for bilingual forms. Because we do have examples of fields which are Of fields which are excellent for quadratic forms but not for bilinear forms or organized forms. So, multi-quadratic, purely inseparable extensions are excellent for both bilinear as well as quadratic forms, and this is due to half-market. Separable field extensions. So, these are particularly excellent for bilinear forms for the very privilege reason that bilinear forms say n-ison optic over such field extensions. So, they are excellent. So, the next immediate case that we can come up after 2 and 3. Case that we can come up of with 2 and 3 is that of 4, and which is what is going to be the top of interest of this talk, which is inseparable quadric field extensions. So, we have 4 types of inseparable quartic field extensions. Simple purely inseparable, next bi-quadratic, simple but not purely inseparable, and bi-quadratic, purely inseparable. So, the bicodratic purely inseparable is a sub-case of the Hoffmann's result on mind-multiplication. Case of the Hoffman's resident on mind multi-quadric. So we don't need to discuss that. And we are only left to talk about the results. Actually, I want to start with a question which is that I am going to talk about excellency of these field extensions but for quadratic forms. And one can also ask whether these field extensions are excellent or not for bilinear forms. And we do know that the first one, second one, and fourth one are excellent for bilinear forms. Bilinear forms for the reason that we understand isotropy over them. But I still don't know what happens for the third case, and that's a question after if it's excellent or not for the simple but not purely inseparable extensions. So let's start with the first one, the simple purely inseparable extension. So we found out actually these extensions are non-existent. And the example we found out was this one. It's a quadratic form of type 20. Quadratic form of type 20 has two blocks. And how it will come up under this example is: so if it's a block of type 20 and when we are going to pass from L to K, this quadratic extension, provided it's isopropic, it will be left of type 10. So to even make it vanish completely, we have to pass to an extension that looks like fourth root of y and a separable unit. A separated unit as well. Since we have this kind of field extension and we understand the bit kernel of this in the setting of this kind of field, say L L by L. Since we understand the bit kernel in case of Karto Cohenic group, understanding that bit kernel gave us an idea of which kind of form would probably give us an example which is not the same. So, using this kernel. So, using this kernel, we actually tried to study the isotropy of two dimension 4. We found out this block which was the reason for the counter example. So, we go ahead like this. So, we studied the wet kernel. This wet kernel is known. We tried to study the isotropy of two dimension 4. And to verify that actually its n isotropic part would not be defined over F, we took help of Scharlaus transfer. And not just any Scharlaus transfer, even we could have various options because now we are going from. Have various options because now we are going from k to f. It would have four types of possibilities. The one we actually considered and actually wrote was 1 going to 0, 4 to a prime. This particular one was the one that actually helped us say that actually this NS of the part would not be defined over F and it is a counter example. So, since our example is of type 2, 0, this x. This extension in particular is generally not 20 excellent. The next one, third one was a mixed bioquadratic extensions. And to talk about mixed biquadritic extensions, we again tried to study the isotope. Why? For the very reason that here in this case, going from L to further, we have a unit and two separable units, and even these. Separable units, and even these kinds of wet kernels are known in the case of cathocomology group. And both of these results are due to error, lithium and Oriang. We know these in the curve case of cathocomology group. We can transfer them to the language of quadratic forms, in characteristic group, not otherwise, which actually help us study the isotropy again up to dimension 4. And after studying the isotropy, we try to use a After studying the isotopy, we tried to use an induction argument on the dimension, which told us that these quadratic extensions are also, these bi-quadratic extensions are also excellent. So, the third, we found out that the mixed bi-quadratic extensions are excellent. By Hoffman's result, you know, multi-quadratic Paulian separable extensions are excellent. So, we can combine the two and ask what about the multi-quadratic extensions up to separability degree 2. Are they excellent? Are they extended? For the moment, I don't know the answer if they are or not executive. You can still ask that. Third one we have is a simple but not purely inseparable extensions. These are extensions that look something like, which have a basically intermediate separable extension. So in this one, if we have, since it's a quartet, it's given by a polynomial of the form. Of the farm. So basically, they are working. So this is the one given by the root of the polynomial x squared plus px plus t and then the other one. So these are those extensions which have a intermediate separable extension. And if we try to use the same approach that we did the first two times, wouldn't work because. Wouldn't work because, although we do know the width panel for this, but we do not know after we couldn't study temporal dimension 4 because we do not know the width panel of K with another separable element. So, the previous, the approach that we used the previous two times didn't work with this one. So, to come up with this example, there are two interesting things happening. So, one is if we know that 1 B D is anisotropic by our choice. Our choice. So the easiest example we could take, which we know for a fact is anisotropic, is the one adding the two indeterminates. So we know for a fact it is N-isotropic. And because we have chosen it with 1, D, and D being dominated by this form, we know for a fact that it will become isotropic over given the extension. So the first two parts, these two parts are okay. It's going to be anisotropic. By our choice, it is becoming isotropic, and we are only left to verify. And we are only left to verify whether or not its nI sub part is defined over, to be sure is not defined over the DC. So, this time before I tell you how we did that, we actually first constructed a generalized transfer map for not just this particular quartic extension, but for any simple but not purely encephalitic extension. And what we did was go from K to another n. From K to another intermediate field extension of F. This is in this particular case, this field extension is the one determined by the square root of the coefficients of any of the fallen aroma. So, from this to this, we actually give a generalized transfer map from K is to I am missing some small details here to make my job easy of explaining things, but anyone interested, I can share more details. So, we actually first made this generalized transformer, which made us go from here to here. Now, coming back to our example, this particular form of type 2,1, when it becomes isotropic over our extension E alpha, is going to be left of type 11. A form of type 11 is actually a fischer neighbor. Actually, a fisture neighbor of a two-fold fisture form. This is defined about the base field F. Then the two-fold fisture form is also supposed to be defined about the base field F. And this one, you can use again the Carthos homomorphism and transfer to the language of H. So, suppose that this is actually defined over the base E L, then this is also supposed to be defined. Then, this is also supposed to be defined over the base B F. And then we can apply this transfer map until every reach here. Then, using a theoretic valuation, we can come back to our base B and we actually got something like this can only happen if 1B D is isotropic, which was what we didn't, which is a contradiction to our trial. So, as per rule, we won't have this particular form defined over the BC. So, here is a counterexample, but particularly. example but particularly of a form of like 21 for which it's not exact. So now that you have an example for forms fields that are not 20 excellent not 2 and excellent one can ask maybe they are excellent or for type 3 0 or type 3 4. But not actually but what we can do is we can add suitable number of variables such that it's not excellent for any bigger dimensional form. Any bigger dimensional form once we have it. It uses a simple argument on residual forms. So once we have a form that's not R s excel, we can add suitable indeterminates to n work over the iterated Lorentz series to make it r plus m or s plus m not not these excellent. So the first one we had the simple quartic case that one was not eccelic for 2, 0. So we can extend it but it's generally not R is excellent whenever R is favorite. Whenever r is greater than 2 or s is greater than 0, and simple but not purely inseparable extensions are generally not excellent whenever we have r greater than 2 s greater. In the beginning I did mention that up till 3 they are excellent for all of them. So, in this second case, simple but not purely inseparable, we are still left with the quadratic forms of time 2, 0. Up till 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, they are always excellent. So we can still ask this question. So we can still ask this question that these particular extensions are very excellent for like PG. And actually I should also mention whenever the phone looks like phone is of type 0 as that work, then it is always excellent for all possible QB extensions. To begin with, I mentioned that the external quadratic forms first appear in the paper of Elvin Lambsworth, and their paper was actually followed by an appendix. Actually, followed by an appendix of Arason, which talked about function fields of conex, and he mentioned that actually function fields of conics are excellent for quadratic forms in characteristic 2. We can also talk about function field of conics in characteristic 2. But in characteristic 2, we actually have two types of conics, a non-singular and a singular. That's of type 1, 1, and 0, 3. Type 1, 1 is the one Adam talked about in his talk on Monday, and actually, these kind of conics. And actually, these kinds of conics are excellent for both quadratic as well as bilinear forms. For quadratic forms, it's due to Hoffman Logree V, and for bilinear forms, it's due to the simple reason again that bilinear forms stay an isoshropic overseparable. So we are left with singular conics of type 0, 3. They are actually not excellent for quadratic forms. And this example was told to me by the PB. But these kind of field extensors are actually excellent. kind of field extensions are actually excellent for bilinear forms. So we'll actually have that function fields of conics are excellent for both bilinear and both the type of conics are actually excellent for bilinear forms. And for the proof, the act result of RS1 was also later on done by Rost. And we have tried to adapt his proof in characteristic. From characteristic not to 2, we have to change a couple of things, changing trace or something like adding changes that require Like adding changes that require for the bilinear forms rather than competitive forms. But in the end, we found that this is also excellent for bilinear forms. That's all. Thank you. I get my promise. That's good. Questions? So if the characteristic is not two, is it complete? For characteristic not two, it changes because some for example we had so many cases just in the inseparable case that this doesn't happen for characteristic two case. And we also have we are yet to actually tackle separable case which we haven't yet touched. It's possible the first many separable cases we do not have it. So basically, not just we have to differentiate between quadratic and pilinear forms, keep them and all the types, and also the same techniques do not work. Like cross-proof product 12 and we adapted it needed to change another number. Have conjectures for the case of extensions of debris A's, or is it? And I guess some numbers do imply something, right? If you know some stuff for degree 4, then some cases of degree 8 are degree 4. The first thing would be to classify all the degree 8 extensions. First step. I mean, just for degree 4, we have like 4 inseparable extensions and I think 3 separable ones. But first thing would be to classify all of them. I haven't done that. And then we can probably write all the extensions.
