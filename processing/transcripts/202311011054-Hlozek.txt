Thanks so much, folks. I will share screen. And if you thought Jess had went fast, then just strapped yourselves in because this is going to be equally exciting. But hopefully it will get you excited about transients both in the sky and the brain. So for folks who care about astronomy, we use bright stars whose brightness we can intrinsically, we can calibrate. We measure the difference between those brightnesses and we can come up with a distance. And we can come up with a distance modulus, right? This is a story we tell people in public talks and allows us to really map out distances as a function of how far away these objects are to us and changes in distances throughout the cosmos. And that tells us something about the acceleration of the universe and cosmological components. Great. Of course, we typically show images like this, which is gorgeous. This is taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. But that's really not what images look like that we measure with many telescopes as we get further and further. With many telescopes as we get further and further and look further and further away. So, I'm predominantly involved in doing this science with the upcoming Rubin Observatory, and Rubin is going to find not a few, but tens of thousands of new objects every night. There are, in fact, three poster surveys right now that are doing something similar. And I know Ashish is in the room, so you should definitely be chatting a lot about ZTF continuously, of course, through the week. So, Ruben does this, of course, because it can look at a lot of Rubin does this, of course, because it can look at a lot of the sky at the same time. And so it's what we call a fast telescope that gives us a lot of these different kinds of objects, and we need to classify them. So we record the images, or we will record the images with this giant camera, which is the size of a small car, and will give us just a wealth of data that we need to sift through if we're going to understand which objects are telling us something about the expansion of the universe, which ones are telling us about the death of stars, etc. And so we the And so, the primary mechanism that we use to do this is we take images of the same patch of the sky in different nights, and we compute a difference image as a function of filter bands or wavelengths from the telescope. And we use these different images. And in particular, we use how the light is changing as a function of time in the different bands as the primary mode of classifying these objects. Of course, there's a ton of other information you can use, including information about the galaxy in which they sit, or how close they are to other objects, or where they are positioned. Close they are to other objects or where they are positioning on the sky, etc. And so, you know, in astronomy, we use classification as one of the tools to do this sifting out. And we use these difference images as a way to do that. This is something I've been involved in for a long time, and this is very challenging and exciting work. But recently, through a lovely interdisciplinary meeting, much like the one that you're at right now, I realized that there's a lot of parallel between what we do in astronomy and what is done in biology. Done in biology. So, I particularly met up with colleagues who do high-resolution microscopy of the brain. And they are interested also in finding and classifying different kinds of activity in the brain and also in finding out, you know, which parts of the region or segmenting different parts of neurons that are doing the activity. And so, super brief redux. So, we're interested in finding the transients that come. The transients that come from the sort of bursts of calcium that is released when there is synaptic activity in the brain. And the functional form and the frequency of these transient events tells us something about the state of the brain and particularly if there's any neurogeneration. What is really done is you inject a culture of hippocampal cells with a dye that is sensitive to calcium, because calcium in this case is what's mediating the electrical activity. What's mediating the electrical activity, the synaptic activity in the brain. The first time we saw these images, we realized: oh, okay, so the images down here, if I'm looking for a small difference, a small flash in one of these pixels, then simple difference imaging is going to do exactly the same thing in the brain as it does in the sky. And so our colleagues in the University of Laval, with whom we're collaborating, already have a pretty robust pipeline of taking images and putting them through machine learning algorithms to train them. Machine learning algorithms to train them to do this work. One of the reasons why it's so costly is because each image that they have has about sort of 6,000 frames in terms of time. That's one neuron and has between 100 and 5,000 of these calcium slashes, these calcium transient events. And this is a tiny, tiny size. And initially, for the training of any machine learning algorithm, our colleagues and typically graduate students were taking about 45 minutes to an hour. 45 minutes to an hour of manual time to actually inspect the images and find where the transients are, and then use those to train machine learning algorithms. The approaches that we used to find these flashes, these transients, were just kind of baseline thresholding. So just take the brightness of the image, find different transients, and then change that brightness to find new ones. And so when we looked at this problem, we realized this was a case in which rather than getting fancy and new. Which, rather than getting fancy and new machine learning algorithm approaches, the first thing to do was actually look at the feature selection, look at the filtering, and look at the processing to see if we could do better knowing some of what we know about how to process astronomical images. And so we started by taking all the tools at our disposal, including one method that's used a lot within astronomy, which is the rolling hat transform. Basically, can you find filamentary or stick-like figures in an image? And this is particularly interesting if you care about H1 distributions or clouds that have these filamentary. Distributions or clouds that have these filamentary structures. So, applying this approach allowed us to better make a map of what the dendrite itself was looking like. And so, if you have a good mask, we then use the astronomer's favorite toolkit, just inverse variance weighting, because of course the image itself is fluorescing in the way that the sky doesn't really as frequently, but it's fluorescing because of the calcium in the images. And so, if we did a good inverse variance weighting, we came up with much more robust difference images. Robust difference images. And then we could apply the simple clustering algorithms like DVSCAN to try and see which of these points are associated with individual transients, which of these are fluorescing along a dendrite because the calcium is released and fluoresces along that dendrite, and how we can understand the difference between them. What we found pretty early on is that we were finding a lot of transients that were missed in these standard thresholding analyses. And in fact, so this is work, I should say this is work led by my student Volinsa. Led by my student Bolin Son, and we called it Astro Beats because why not come up with an acronym if you can? And one of the things that we found pretty early on is that we're actually outperforming the hand annotated machine learning trained model without doing any machine learning. So obviously the next step is to apply machine learning to our annotations themselves. But more interestingly, we also found different transients that were detected by attributes that were missed by other transients. So we're actually By other transients. So we're actually good at finding low brightness and large volume transients. And we're now investigating, you know, which of the transients, if we use the ground truth as the human annotation, we actually identified a subset of the population that we thought were real transients. And in fact, we realized that we could retrain the humans by asking them to take another look because, in some cases, due to just differences of opinion, folks in Differences of opinion. Folks initially were deciding that things were not transients, but upon second look, they were. So, this work shows a lot of promise, I think, for the ability to translate to a different field by actually just taking tools and techniques that we know pretty well and applying them to a different context. You know, this is not transfer learning in exactly the same way, this is just sort of human adaptation. But what we're now doing is opening our toolkit even further and saying, what are the ways in which Even further and saying what are the ways in which we can also do this further. For example, in astronomy, we have to do a lot of simulations because building telescopes is so costly. In the biological context, typically simulations are either very complicated and they're not used as much, or people just treat every data set as unique rather than making some simple simulations to try and test efficiencies. So that's one of the things that we're doing. We're doing sort of a synthetic source injection into background images to see how well we're doing, and then taking some. How well we're doing, and then taking some summary statistics that are well used in astronomy, like power spectra and other analyses, to look at if there are another additional ways we can use to classify some of these objects. Similarly, we're using de-blending techniques that are well used in astronomy to separate galaxies and stars from one another, but we're using it to try and separate out multi-filter dyes injected in these materials to try and understand the structural information about. Information about proteins in the brain. So I'll stop here and take questions, but I hope this has got you excited about ways in which you can apply your techniques across fields, because I know that this audience is definitely pro that kind of analysis. Thanks so much.
