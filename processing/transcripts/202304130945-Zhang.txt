Okay, so thank you very much for the invitation and the opportunity to speak here. Okay, so the talk of mine today is this new house phenomenon in the complex Senna family. So first I will give some introduction on the background of the theorem that we want to prove. Want to prove so? First, we start with axiom A and the hyperbolic maps. So, axiom A diffromorphism are known to be diffromorphism that has a wandering domain which is hyperbolic and compact. And also, the set of period points is dense in the wandering domain. And also, we can we have a notion of XMA maps on the interval. It means that f has uh it means that f has has finitely many hybolic periodic retractors uh whose basin uh i mean uh i mean outside of the basin you have a hyperbolic basic set and also hyperbolic polynomial maps means that every critical orbit converges to an attracting cycle and and also uh it is known that axiomatomorphisms That XMA diffeomorphisms and the XMA maps are structurally stable on the non-white on the wandering non-wandering set. So, in the world of one-dimensional dynamics, X-Ma maps are expected to be dense. So, we have this Fatus conjecture. So, it says that hyperbolic maps form an open and dense subset in the quadratic family, but this is still widely unknown. But there are many. Known, but there are many important progress in the past few decades. So, there's also this question of smell. He says that he asks that whether in one-dimensional dynamics, hypotics maps are generic. In the real quadratic family, this is proved by Grotchik and Grotchik, Swatik, and Lewbridge independently. And the general case for real interval maps is solved by Klovsky, Shen, and Van Shrin. This is what, I mean, this is just a glance of what is known in the one-dimensional world. So, this is the picture of the mandible sets. The mandible sets. So the boundary of these represents, I mean, conjecturally at least, represents the non-hyperbolic quadratic maps. Now we talk about the higher dimension phenomenon. So in higher dimension, XMA maps are known to not be dense. So I mean, the first example is constructed by Newhouse in the 70s. So Newhouse has constructed maps with infinitely many Maps with infinitely many periodic things. And in fact, there are C omega surface diviomorphisms, for instance, certain real Henan maps with stable homoclinic tangencies. And this is the real Henan family. So for every A, a real parameter A and every B bigger than zero, we have a polynomial to morphism. zero we have a polynomial automorphism of r2 preserving the orientation given by the following formula this fab a consequence of i mean i mean it's not clear what what i mean by consequence but anyway uh what is known in the uh in for surface different webinars uh is that any non-degenerate unfolding of a quadratic Degeneric unfolding of a quadratic home clinic tangency of a real service map produces a parameter with a stable home clinic tangency. Maybe I start with an explanation about this stable home clinic tangency. I mean, before that, we talk about tangency. So, this is the picture from Morela and Yoko's paper from 2010. So, this So this point P is say a periodic hypolic periodic point, I mean shadow periodic points. And the blue curves represent unstable manifold and the red curve represents stable manifold. And we can imagine that piece in the horseshoe. So there are laminations of these red curves, I mean the stable curves and these blue curves. The blue curves, they are the lamination of unstable curves. And you can imagine that you can have a situation where this blue curve and this red curve, they're tangent at one point. But also you can imagine if these two laminations, they are sufficiently thick. So when you move up this blue part, this blue lamination, you move upwards, it will intersect with this. It will intersect with this stable lamination stably. Of course, when you move up, this immediate tangency will disappear, but because you have other leaves nearby, so you can find tangency between another red curve and another blue curve. So this is what is called by stable home clean tangency. In French, it's called tangence home cleaning. Is called the Tangon's home clean stubble. Okay, so the main thing we're going to talk about is this complex Green family. So for every complex parameter A and every non-zero B, we have a polynomial automorphism of C2 given by this formula. Basically, you just complexify the parameters in the real Hanneman family. Okay. Okay. And in a work in progress, we have obtained the following results. So there exists a B0 bigger than zero, such that for every B, a non-zero B with modulus smaller than B0, there exists the A such that this complex Hanon fam map FAB has a stable home clinic tangency. A not so immediate corollary is that any Corollary is that any analytic unfolding of a quadratic home clinic tangency of a dissipative saddle period point of a map in situ possess a parameter with a stable home clinic tangency. So we need to assume that the saddle period point is dissipative and but we can do with any analytic unfolding. It's like you don't need to move at the linear speed. It can be The linear speed can be moved much slower, but analyticity gives you some order of this unfold. Okay, so let us first talk about some previous results related to this problem. So the emergence of stable homotany from unfolding a dissipative saddle period points and its various consequences are established in a series of work. A series of works start with some works of Nuna and also their works by Mora Viana and Palis Vienna and etc. And for conservative maps, the above, many of the results, including this, for instance, this stable homogeneous is established by Is that established by DRAT. And in fact, also, I forgot to mention is that DRAF also has done a lot of very important work related to home clean tangency for conservative maps. Also, this stable home clinic tangency is related to stable intersection between dynamical counter sets. So dynamical counter sets. It's a control set generated by two contractions. I mean, several contractions, finite main contractions. So it said that if you under some generic condition on the contractions, assuming that the host of dimension of the control sets, they have some, you have two control sets, right? So if you assume So, if you assume they have some bigger than one, the condoset on the rail line, then you have a stable intersection between them. So, this was a conjecture of Palis and it was by Varela and Yokos. That's some results for real maps. For complex maps, so first of all, Buzat has proved the homocontingency can exist. The homoconangency can exist for some polynomial automorphism of C2 with a very high degree. But the degree is very high in this case. But Biblier Sebastian, he has proved that the existence of degree two polynomial automorphisms, but you need to have a C3 to have a stable homeclinic tangency. And the more recent work, there's a work by Work. There's a work by Arojo Morela and Zamudio. They have proved that basically they have recovered this result by Morela and Yokos on the dynamical control set, but not for stable tangency. They have shown that open dense subset of pairs of dynamically defined conformal controls. Define the conformal counter set with sum of host of dimension bigger than two because now you are in complex plane. So you must have you must you need this sum of the host of dimension being bigger than two. In this case, there are some that has no empty interior. Notice that to define this conformal control set, you have this complex holomorphic contractions. Uh, holomorphic contractions, but in your application, uh, you don't really have these complex, I mean, holomorphic maps. What you will have is it will be a holomorphic map composed with C1 plus alpha map given by the holonomy. Okay, so let's speak. Let's begin with our proof. I mean, I will be very sketchy at some point, but there is some argument by pictures. So first of all, we will find a post-critically finite parameter, say A0. It means that there exists P0 and P. Okay, so first let me say that this FA will mean A will mean the quadratic family. So F A 0, it means that Z squared plus A 0. Okay, so we first start with post-critical finite A zero. We have a repelling co-cycle, and the critical point is mapped to this repelling co-cycle. And we'll also choose a repelling fixed point Z0 of this F A zero. And notice that, okay, so up to now, let me see some picture here. So this will be this F A zero and this X zero will be a fixed point of F A zero and And you will take high it rate so that a small neighborhood x0 is mapped to a bigger disk containing this smaller neighborhood. And here you have this repelling cycle start with this F A0P00 here. And so we can have another inverse branch. Inverse branch of F A0 so that you have another open set inside of this disk disjoint from this neighborhood of X0 so that under a high it rate it will go to it will map to the it will map the small disk to the this bigger disk so now taking these inverse branches these two inverse branches you can if you iterate and with any order you want so in the limit you get So in the limit, you will get a control set. So on this counter set, clearly you know that some iterate of this map on this control set give you a hyperbolic invariant hyperbolic set for F A0. And here we have this repellent cycle, which is clearly also a hyperbolic set for F A0. Okay, so now what I want Now, what I want to explain is that for every hyperbolic set of some F A, you can lift this hyperbolic set to a horseshoe for small b. So for some b close to zero, you can lift this k to kab. So this is a horseshoe on which FAB gives you an invertible dynamic. Okay, for instance, if you take this K to be the repelling cycle we have, then you can leave it like what we have here. So this is part of the repelling cycle you will leave to this repelling cycle. I mean, I mean, you will leave it to three points, a predicted point for this HENA map, FAB. And because we are considering And because we are considering very small B, so you have a very strong contraction, then you have a long stable manifold through this lifted periodic point. Then you are going to pull back this stable manifold. So when you pull back by the dynamic, you can find the inverse branch. So let's go from the beginning. Let's go from the beginning. So, remember, we have a repelling cycle. Now, you imagine you have a stable leaf through this repelling cycle. And then we find the inverse branch to pull back this stable manifold. And we will pull back so that it will go through somewhere near the critical point. I mean, it's not near the, I mean, how should I put it? How should I put it? It will be folded once, but after that, it will not be folded again. Then under many maps, it will look like this. What do I call it? It will be like a parabola. Then remember, if we take, we have a repelling horseshoe generated by these two. Horseshoe generated by these two inverse branches, we can also lift this hyperbolic horseshoe to a hyperbolic set for FA, for FA0 to a hyperbolic, I mean hyperbolic basis set, basic set for this FAB. So this FU is this Is this hyperbolic size generated by two branches denoted by Ku and then this Ku will lift you to this denoted by KUAB. This will be a horseshoe for FAB and K will lead to KAB and these points. These points, z0, the fixed points, will lift to to SAB like this. This x0 will lift to SAB here, and this point in the repellent cycle will lift to QAB here. Okay, and then this thing happens for all AB close to A0, 0. And this object depends holomorphically on AB. And also, when you move this. and also when you move this uh when you let b to be fixed and you move a this tangency so this blue curve and the red curve you will see an unfolding between some tangency there will be a analytic curve a b b through this a zero zero so that for every b close to zero B close to zero, this unstable curve. So will be this blue curve. You'll be tangent to this stable curve through QAB. I mean, this red curve. When A equals to AB, I mean, when you are choosing AB along this analytic. Be along this analytic curve. Siuan? It's Junguk. Could you say why that is? I don't really see why this is true. So this is just by computation. This is just by computation. The tip will move, and this is just by computation. No, no, not the unfolding, but why there should be a tangency. I mean, it will be. I mean, it will be a moment that they form a tangency. And that is how you define this A. But okay, well, why is it true for B equal to zero? No, for B equal to zero, this is not defined. I mean, when B equals zero, this is like a degenerated map. Is there some way we can? Is there some way we can see it as a degeneration of this picture that we have in 2D for 1D? Degeneration of this picture. I have no way to draw this thing, but in the limits, this blue curve will be just a parabola given by the image of this, I mean, the quadratic map. The quadratic map. And this red curve will be just the curve through the T. I see. And but why was it important to choose a Misrevich 1D map? It is to define this. So it is to define this stable curves through this repelling cycle. I see. Okay, thank you. I see. Okay, thank you. Okay. Now, where was I? So, yes. So, as A moves in the neighborhood of this AB, remember now, B is fixed with some, which is close to zero, but fixed. As A moves, so this tendency will unfold. So, it will be moved like this. So, remember that when you do small But when you do small folding, the picture here, they essentially remain unchanged. So in particular, when you look at this unstable foliation through this lifted horseshoe, KUAB, you can think about it, they depend continuously on this A. So you can think about So, you can think about the quality of this lamination remain somewhat unchanged. But on the other hand, by doing unfolding and plus homoclinic renormalization, when you do this unfolding, you can choose a small ball. And then when you iterate many times, when you come back by a change of coordinate, you are going to obtain another map that is very close to the HINAN map. That is very close to the Henne map. So, this is summarized in the following theorem. And also, let me mention that on this map, because it's a very degenerated Green map, you can, for small choice of A, you can have this stable lamination, I mean, on a set in some sense as large as you want. So, the goal is to, we were going to let this blue curve to let this blue curve to in to be tangent to one of this uh uh dilated uh so one of these uh uh red curve in this dilated picture okay so let me explain about this uh homoclinic normalization uh so for all sufficiently large integer m uh there's a holomorphic change of coordinates uh like this you can you can write This, you can write this A as this. And there's another change of coordinates. So this will be a map. Remember that B is now fixed. This is a map that goes from a scale one to a very small box, maybe somewhere here. So both of them are strong contraction. So, both of them are strong contraction, this map and this map. Okay, then you do this change of coordinates, cosine AB, Possibly AB, and then so restricted to unit size region, this will give you somewhere somewhere here. And then you can iterate by this. Iterate by this Henna map many times. So after taking many large time iteration and you look at it at the original this unit size coordinates, this map will be very close to this map. So what is this? So remember that this is a quadratic polynomial at parameter A tilde and this tilde is here and also And also, plus a term that is very small. So, this term goes to zeros and growth in the uniform norm. So, everything is holomorphic. So, basically, if you consider any finite derivative, it will go to zero. And remember, this will be a strong contraction. So, this if you just want to move a little bit, you can. A little bit, you can let this A tilde to move a lot. So, this is the things we want. So, in some sense, by this unfolding complete normalization, you can have a lot of freedom in choosing this renormalized map. You can make it to look like any degenerated inner map. Uh in a map as much as you want okay so now by per now this is what I to summarize what I just explained. So by perturbing this A near A0, in fact, it should be perturbing A near AB. We obtain a horseshoe and some u A B, what is this? A B, what is this? Uh, this needs to say that you have this tangency at some TAB is unfold. Okay, so okay, so this is to summarize what I said before. Okay, so this is to summarize what just said. So by choosing this A TOTA, you can let this You can let this FA tilde to have a very thick hyperbolic set, meaning that the red lamination or this is the stable lamination is very, very thick, as thick as you want in some sense. And then the goal is to, by unfolding, to let two lamination to overlap at some point. I mean, overlap at some point, you want them to form tangency, and hopefully, this tangency is stable. Okay, remember, because we have this very degenerated picture, or in fact, for every, because we're choosing this B small in every places, so we can let this stable lamination to be. Elimination to be as smooth as you want. For instance, C4 is suffice for our purpose. And also, this unstable foliation, unstable lamination will always be C1 plus kappa smooth. Okay, so now we're going to reduce the problem. How much time do I have? I know much. Now we're going to reduce the problem to intersection between control sets. So this is the picture we have seen. Let us continue with this lamination. Then it will look like this. And then this blue lamination will look like this. There exists the C1 plus kappa disk here so that this disk will intersect both this blue line. They'll intersect both this blue lamination and the red lamination. When you intersect this blue lamination, you have a counter disc. And in the same way, you form this red counter disc, I mean counter set, and you want this counter set to intersect. And both sets are defined by the dynamic. And you can think about it as formed by Formed by what is known as a conformal iterated function system. Okay, so what are this iterated function system? It is simply some open set, some disk, along with several contractions on this disk from its interior. We will just ask R to be C1 plus kappa. And then it is conformal in the following sense. So there were forms sense so they will form in the limit uh control set and we will need them to know we'll know that in fact we will know uh these maps also they are only c1 plus kappa but they are conformal at the control control set uh okay again i forgot to change this this is actually the control set this is not u but the control set uh formed by this ifs By this IFS. The reason for that is because these are the map to generate this counter set, they are like compositions of these holomorphic maps along with these holonomies. But holonomies, you can think about it as like infinite products of holomorphic maps. So at the point where you have definition. At the point where you have definition, you have a complex derivative. Okay, so we will ask this. So remember, we have these two different countersets. So this unstable, this stable, let's talk about unstable foliation first. So this unstable lamination will intersect this U, we intersect this D. D with some control, at some control sets which is denoted by a lambda s, or in other words, a stable control set. Okay, so we'll ask this counterset to satisfy some property called a Fourier decay. In fact, we'll need a little bit more than that. So we say IFS is ready function system to have C D decay. system to have C D decay if there's a measure probability measure supported on the contour set so that after taking Fourier transform you have decay like log cosi to the power minus D okay but this is just for one control set and in fact we will have a family of control set once you have a C1 plus carbon conform IFS we will We will ask them to satisfy this so-called dispersive property. Basically, in short, it means that first of all, you know that the counter set is has fully decay, but also when you apply some C1 plus carbon diffimorphism with a bounded norm, then the image also has some decay with a different. With a different constant, possibly. So there's an example, a natural example is provided in the, like, not directly, but implicitly in the paper of O and Winter. And I think very recently, there's a paper by Lecluck, a student of Frederic Not. He has basically proved explicitly that you have free decay. In fact, he have Fourier decay. In fact, he proved the Pulisand will have a positive Fourier dimension. We are not going to need Fourier dimension, but we'll have this full of decay. Okay, so what is the result? The result is that let F be a hybrid rational map of degree at least two, and let this be the hybolics that generate. be the hybolic set generated by this conform IFS with strong separation property formed by some inverse branches of F. So if this set is not contained in the C1 curve, then this set has a C D decay. I forgot to write C D decay. So we're going to show that this lambda s is C D dispersive for some large integer D and for some integer D and for some constants. So this gives the description of the intersection between this orange disk and the blue lamination. Now we're going to describe what is the candle set formed by orange disk with red lamination. The condition is provided by this so-called lattice. By this so-called lattice-conformal control set. So the lattice-conformal control sets is that we have this, we have a map from the disk to itself. Let me pick up the important thing about this definition. So first of all, we have a C2 different morphism from a disk to its interior so that Is interior so that this is not far from the middle. And also, if you consider the derivative, it will be between n inverse rho and also basically n inverse rho inverse. No, I mean, sorry, sorry, let me restart it. The derivative will be between an inverse rho and and inverse rho and the derivative of the inverse will be between uh will be bounded by n times rho inverse so if rho if the derivative is a complex number then it is between n inverse rho d zero and n inverse rho d zero inverse okay then you have a Uh, other disks that are disjoint from the image of this row of very of this phi. So you have this Q00 is the image of phi, and then you translate it by this I over n and j over n. And you want this to be mutually disjoint. And also, And also, we want to know that, in fact, you can define for this IFS, you can define so-called limit charts. So for dynamic control set on circle, this construction is given by Sullivan. But all you need is conformality to define this limit charts. So we want this limit chart to be bounded. This limit shot to be bounded by something. But this is just the quantitative aspect of stating the largest conformal counter set. Okay, the important thing is that this IFS is formed by translations of this branch. So let me draw a picture here. Let me see directly picture, directly picture here. So this, you consider this. So this you consider this as the disk and then there will be a branch that maps this disk to let's say this disk, this small disk. And what are the other branches? So the other branches are just translation. Like you first map here and then you take all the translations. You will take about two n translations in the horizontal direction and two n translation in the vertical directions. So I have this memory that in the Shishikova construction, the size of the blobs was smaller than one of the planets. Yes, yes. Yes, yes. So in Shishikura's construction, the size of the box is going to be n inverse times log n and the hold into like, how do you call it? Log n inverse. What? So how do you deal with this extra logic? Sorry, I couldn't hear. Could you speak up a little bit? How do you deal with the extra lock term? Oh, yes, yes. That is come from the Fourier decay for the other. So I will explain this in a moment. Like I was just about to explain this. But this is a very important question. So the thing is like this. So there will be basically the domain of Shishikura's count. Okay, so first of all, let me stay. First of all, let me say this. We'll pick this A tilde in the so-called elephant's valley. This is a parameter very close to one quarter. Okay, then we're going to take Shishikura's candle set. It's like a C is here. You take it to be very close to one quarter. And then the Julia set will look like this. You have this spiral, and you have also. And you have also translated basically, you have two translations if you put it in the right coordinate. And the coordinate you realize that is independent of this denominator and you take, I mean, not independent completely, but it's uniform bounded. Okay, so the image will be like say n inverse and the log n. So in Chicago, counter side will be like minus two, but the last take even smaller. But the last type is even smaller, so a minus 10, I'd say. Okay, so once you have this, the main lemma in all this business is the following. So we're going to make two condosets overlap. Remember, one of the condosets is what we call the dispersive condoset. You can basically think about it as a conformal counter set with this Fourier decay property. Fourier decay property. And the other candle set is the things I just described, this lattice candle set. So in practice, it will be shi-cross candle set. Okay, so we just take one candle set, we put it above the other, but not very far from the middle. So it's like within this zero, but the one over 10 distance. And then we can also allow to, well, also allow to shrink it a little bit, but like not too much. But like not too much. And we are also allowed to translate it a little bit, but not too much. Okay, so given this situation, we're going to find the statement is that take this NM with this not too large so that this control set is going to intersect with one of the branch. One of the branches. Remember, when n equals to 0, 0, then this is the like the branch you take. All the other branches are formed by translating this branch. So if NAM are within this range, then this is really the image of one branch, not some fictitious branch. Okay. So how to prove this? So the proof is very short. Basically, we'll first take a probability measure. Will first take a probability measure supported on these control sets, and by definition, I mean, yes, by definition, you will have Fourier decay. The product coefficient will decay like log psi to power minus n. And we take a smooth function, we just take any bump function supported on this b00. You don't take it to be very strange so that you say the You say the integral is bounded from below. That's just an integral equal to one. And also, if you take, consider the L1 norm of the Fourier coefficient, then it will be bounded by log n to some c prime. This c prime is related only to the 10 we take. Remember that this. uh remember that this is a function on t2 so the foul coefficient they are modeled by this z2 okay so then we consider the following quantity so we're going to pretend that this measure uh is a measure okay so first of all this is a measure on the complex plane right so we first dilate this measure by n so we will have this and we will make it bigger We will make it bigger, dilated by n, and then we project down to the torus. So we consider this quantity. So this is the bound function, and we integrate over this z ranging from the control set, and we have this S Z plus W1. So how to compute it? So if we take a Fourier transform, it will look like this. like this okay and then so let's see what is this term so this this term is actually uh the Fourier transform of this measure so there are two things one is that this is the Fourier transform of the function and this uh is the you can think of this as a Fourier transform of the measure okay so basically what we are seeing is a convolution is a convolution. So we are single out this k equals to zero. So when they are equal to zero, you can compute directly it is bounded by this. When kr and are not zero, you are like this. And then so this part is the Fourier transform this part is a Fourier transform of this function of this measure at NSK NSL. So remember that KL So remember that K are now not 0, 0. So this will be very big. Then if you take the sup norm here, it will be bounded by this by definition. And then the rest is the L1 norm of the Fourier transform of this function. But the L1 norm of the Fourier transform of the function is bounded by this and by our choice of the bound function. So this choice is possible. Then by the Then, by the Fourier decay of this measure, this thing is bounded by log ns to some power minus d. So if you let d to be very big to beat this c prime, then you will have positive, then this will be non-zero. I mean, I decide. So when they are non-zero, it means that you are going to have some non-n in that tube. Some don't in that too. For the moment, you don't know how large they are, but you can translate the non-vanishing of this i pass i into saying that these two things they must overlap. But you are putting this lambda not very far from the center. We have a minus two minutes, so if you go lambda. Minutes, so if you go rough, okay, okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, I will be very quick. So, uh, basically, now uh, I will explain this by picture. It's like when you have this uh colour candle set, you just put this blue candle set with the Fourier decay, you just put it anywhere you want here, not very far from the center. Then you are going to find a small copy of the this Fourier control set with this lattice counter set, and then you can dilate this. And then you can dilate this largest kind of type. This small ball will be somewhat larger. And then this small copy will also lie in the middle of that. And then you can iterate this construction. You can find another thing somewhere and dilate again. And the limit you find the intersection. Thank you. Okay. So two minutes maybe have another one minute. I'm sorry, but we're going over time. Like, yes, sorry, 15 minutes maybe. Sorry, 15 minutes. I say that the Fourier decay is somewhat studied by many people. And in our case, we have to use some trick. But in the end, we can find a way to use all winter's results to get it done. Thank you. Thank you very much.
