Thank you very much for the introduction and the invitation for this talk. I'm a postdoc in Taiwan. Well, when I was accepting the invitation, I was in the center called National Center for. National Center for Theoretical Sciences in Taiwan, but I started a new postdoc in National South State University, which is also in Taiwan this August. And this talk is about transportation problem on a convex body with a distance square cost function, especially that doesn't have a twisted condition. This work is based on the work with joint work with June Kitago from MSU. So I believe many people already know what the point of the transportation problem is, but let me quickly review about the problem. So in the transportation problem, we first have two measures, mu and nu, which has same math. Usually we assume them to be We assume them to be probability measures, and we assume there is a cost function. And we are seeking for a function t which pushes mu to mu bar, or that mu has to be mu bar, sorry. Also, which pushes mu to mu bar and minimizes a given total cost, which we call the transportation cost. Due to not only Due to non-linearity and best situations, so the first, well, this problem is first suggested by Munch, but apparently the problem had some problems, some troubles. So for example, in some cases, that problem doesn't admit a solution. In some other cases, that problem can admit multiple solutions. And that depends on the cost function and the shape of the measure. And well, most of the problem comes from the non-linearity of the problem. So later, ControlBitch suggested a relaxed version of that problem, which we call ControlBit's problem. So instead of math that pushes mu bar, in here, mu to mu bar in here we're going to consider a problem gamma which is a coupling of mu and mu and minimizes the total cost so if this gamma is supported on the graph of a function then this is actually same as the monge problem so well first suggested problem was First, suggested problem was we're seeking for math, but here we have a measure. So, the natural question is that, can we get a map from this question? And that turns out to be related to the regularity theory. So, to get the regularity theory, we actually need a lot of assumptions on the transportation situation. For example, we need some Equation. For example, we need some measures that's bounded away from zero and infinity and cost function that satisfies these multiple conditions. And also the geometry, the support of the measure has to be good. So I describe here the conditions for the cost function. So here we have three conditions, which we call A1, A2, A3. A1 is injectivity of the river. Of the derivative of cost function. And A2 is invertibility of the mixed fashion of cost function. So A1 we call twisted condition, A2 we call non-designed energy condition. And A3, it's something called, well, some many people just call it A3 condition, but I prefer to call it MTW type condition. So here we have this. So here we have this complicated inequality, which turns out to be some tensorial inequality. And that this tensor here is first found in a paper of Maturing Wang. So it's, I prefer to call that as an MTW sensor. So I prefer to call this A3 condition as an MTW condition. A3 condition as an MTW condition. So apparently this A3 condition is a very essential condition for the regularity theory. So if we have these conditions in the cost function and nice conditions on the measures, it's already well studied. The regular theories are already well studied by many people, like Kafarelli and many people. Like many people already studied that. But however, if we miss one condition from here, then we get some trouble. Okay, so let's go to the draw problem. So in the draw problem, well, in the control of this problem, we were looking for a measure which minimizes the total cost. Total cost. In the drill problem, we are seeking for a pair of functions which maximize this quantity, which sometimes we call geocodes. And we introduce a concept of C convex function, which is Which is which turns out to be a very natural definition from the dual problem. So, why is this called dual problem? Because we have this equality, which we call controversial duality. So, minimizing the total cost which measure in this set, which satisfies marginal conditions, is actually the same as maximizing. As maximizing this your cost among these pair of functions, which satisfies this inequality. And actually, we can only consider these C convex functions instead of any functions that satisfy this inequality. So, what control virtuality can tell us? So, if we have a solution for the left and right-hand side, so let's say gamma is a solution on the left-hand side, and B and Psi are the solutions on the right-hand side. Then we just move one, the right-hand side to the left-hand side, we get this equality, and we get that equals zero, and gamma is a positive measure. Measure because it's probability measure. And due to the condition that we impose on the p and side, the integral is also positive or non-negative. So only way that to be zero is equal is that the support of gamma is in the stat. If the support of gamma is in the stat, that means that We have I shouldn't I should say something more about this so we can assume phi and psi to be a C convex functions then this equality actually means that the psi for x comma y the point x comma y is in the something called c sub differential of function phi Function P. Then we can actually have this equality equals zero. So we just move one of p to the other side. And just by taking the derivative here with respect to x. With respect to x, we get this equality because at x equals x0, we have the equality, equality, and we always have this inequality. So we have this equality. And from the twisted condition, we know that this is invertible. So we can take an inverse function. Then we get expression for this y zero in this form. In this form, and like I said in the few slides before, if a function, sorry, if gamma is supported on a graph of a function, then the controversy solution is actually, that actually gives the model solution, which is a map. And that map is actually this. So this means that gamma is supported on the graph of this function. So here we are using this twisted condition. Here we are using this twisted condition in the closure way to get a function, to get an expression of y0 in a function. So let's see what happens if we consider a surface of a convex body with a cost function still. With a cost function, still equilibrium distance squared. So, in this case, we can compute this derivative. We can just explicitly compute the derivative, and it's actually given by the projection of y minus x, where this projection is the perpendicular projection onto the tangent space or plane. Then we see there are actually two points which go to the one thing. To the one same point on the hyperplane or the tangent plane. So, this cost function does not satisfy the two-state condition. Then, the argument that we made in the previous slide doesn't work. Then one can ask, that means we don't have a function solution in this case. Well, in general case, we cannot expect a function solution or one solution. However, if we assume However, if we assume more conditions on the measure, then we can actually get a model solution even in this case. Before we go to the contents of the paper, let me introduce some papers or some results about this situation, measure on the convex surface of a convex body. Surface of a convex body. So, first of all, I would like to introduce the result of Kenbo and McCann from 2000. They were studying the situation, yeah, like this situation. We have two convex body and two measures, which are supported on the surface of a convex body. And if that bodies are circular convex or actually uniformly convex, For actually, uniformly convex one for omega. And if we have this balance for the measures, then we don't really expect the function or mod solution. However, there is some rule for the multivalue solution for the support in the of the control solution. So if we don't have a function solution or monitoring, If we don't have a function solution or one solution, then that means we could have two points in the support of the control resolution because that means this means x0 corresponds to y0 and y1 together. So this, in particular, this is not a function. Then what they prove is What they prove is that they are related, y0 and y1 are related in this way. This y0, but y1 minus y0 is parallel to n0, which is a, which is actual normal vector at the point x0. So in the picture, let's say this is an omega and For ease of notation, let me just use omega, not the lambda. So let's say x not is here. And let's say y1 is here. Then y0 has to be, we draw a normal vector. We can find y0 by just drawing a line that's parallel to this normal vector. Then y0 has to be here. Then y0 has to behave. No, this is for the distance square cosmos. And more precisely, they actually divided into three cases. So in case number zero, we only have one point corresponding to One point corresponding to x naught and the normal vector for perpendicular. And in case one, we have one point. Let me draw the picture here. Case zero is, if x naught was here, then y naught, sorry, y one is somewhere here. Is somewhere here where these two are perpendicular. In case one, we have x not here, then we have y one that's here. So the inner product of normal vectors. Is positive. And in the second case, this number two, let's say we have X naught is here. Then there are two points corresponding to X naught. And this is parallel to this normal vector. And one point has normal vector that has inner product positive. And the other point has normal vector that has this inner product negative. And Y0Y1 or Y0Y1 Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. So, in particular, because we only have the three cases, if there is any point where we have this inner product negative, then we also automatically get some counterpart that has inner product positive. So we can say that x naught corresponds to a point on the positive side hemisphere first. And then if there is more points, then we can go out other side. But still, we have to keep the positive side one. And there is another result by Kitago and Moran. So they study. So they study this case, but their domain is now on the sphere, which is a very nice geometric object. And they assume that the Monster control distance or faster than distance is small. Then the solution to this control which problem actually gives the munch problem and the solution of the munch problem. The solution of the Munch problem is actually a diffeomorphism. Oh, sorry. So we are always using the Euclidean distance square course. Yes. So let me introduce some notations and conditions for this talk. So omega will be our convex body. So it's only convex. We don't So, it's only convex. We don't need a uniformly convexity or circuit convexity. And we have to assume that the boundary of omega has to be C1. Now, we will use this n omega x to denote the normal vector at the point and small omega to be the modulus of continuity of the normal vector. And this s omega theta is a number which is like if because this is module of continuity, if this is small, then the difference between the normal vectors has to be small and it's just a number that quantifies that. And we define omega plus of x and omega minus of x to be. Minus of x to be this that. So in picture, omega plus is the omega plus is like upper hemisphere, and omega minus is the lower hemisphere. If I put the point If I put the points at the North Pole. So I'll just call it a positive hemisphere and the negative hemisphere. And we have cost function, which is distance square, Euclidean distance square divided by two. So we know because boundary omega is C1, this is differentiable. However, as we computed in the few slides before, this is not twisted. And I'm going to use this function, which is the exponential map. So, because this is not twisted, we cannot actually define the inverse function of this map. However, I'll just use this for the part or the branch, which is in the omega plus. We can define this because our domain is convex, so there is exactly two points. Exactly two points or almost two points for the candidate of this inverse. And we just choose the positive side. And we also assume, we also have some conditions on the measures, mu nu, sorry, mu bar, the half mu nu bar. So these are probable measures supported everywhere on the boundary of omega with densities bounded away from zero and infinity. And I'm going to use notation C convex, but only we're taking spring of inside this ball, which contains the whole domain omega. And we define C sub differential. If you're familiar with this, I don't really have to explain, but. I don't really have to explain, but these sub-differentials are basically the self-differentials, but using C functions or cost functions. Yes? Yeah, yeah, yeah. If U is given by that, then we call it a sigma system. Okay, so in the first line, I assumed the boundary omega to be C1. And that is actually sharp in this sense. We actually found a counter example where even if we have a very close, a very small much counter resistance, we still can have We still can have the situation where we don't have a function solution. Okay, so let me describe that on the board. So basically, we are building a convex body, which has very narrow Which has very narrow angle here. So, one way to build this is just consider two bold intersecting at very small region, like this one. And if we make this angle narrow enough, what can be happening is that for any point here, so let's say this is omega, this part is omega plus, and this part is. is omega plus and this part is omega minus if we pick any point here on omega plus well we can consider its positive hemisphere that we have defined before and the thing is if we make this angle narrow enough this is actually equal to omega plus for any point on the omega plus And the same goes in on the omega minus. So if we pick a point here, then omega minus x is sorry, and x is here, omega minus for any point x in the omega plus. Omega plus x With the set on the boundary, such that the inner product of normal vectors is positive. So in a cycle, if x was here, omega plus is always the hemisphere on the x. Always the hemisphere on the x side. If it's not a circle, then it's a little tilted. Sorry? Here? The points on here, they can actually have to different omega plus and omega minus. Sorry? Sub-differentials? That definition is promoting. Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, in this example, I only make the singularity around this equator. Okay. Okay, then what can be happening in this case? I also build two measures, which are just constant on each side, say C and delta. And another measure that has to be mu bar, sorry. that has to be mu bar sorry also the constant also constants on each side however i will however a little different from these constants so i add epsilon here and x is positive side i subtract delta and x is on this side the same The same one. I just, yeah. I just want to use mu bar instead of new. Oh, yeah, sorry, it doesn't really matter. Yeah, well, actually, let me use minus. Yes, yes. Yeah, these are densities, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So now we're just we're just going to consider the transportation problem from mu to mu bar. And the point is, if we can If we can compare the C and C minus epsilon, because this side is always a little small, some masses from the omega plus has to go to omega minus. So for some x and omega plus, we're going to have like x, y one. That's in In the support of the controversial solution, and y1 is in the omega minus. Then by the results of Gango and McCann that I showed you, because we have y1 that's in omega minus, then there's also one point y0 in the omega plus such that Such that x, y, zero is also in support. So this produces the point x, which corresponds to two different points on the boundary, which means that we don't have a function. function. And because we have to move some positive mass from omega plus to omega minus, this always happens in some positive measure set. And if we as we see in here, we can explicitly compute the well explicitly estimate the monitor control resistance between b and v bar. between B and Mu bar. And that depends on epsilon. And as we take epsilon to zero, we can have very small distance between B and Mu bar, but still we always have non-functional solution. So this is what can be happening when the boundary is not C1. So to get one solution, we at least need a C1 condition on the boundary. Sorry, please say that again. Explain again why this why the using that small conical angle helped make the example work. Oh, so so I'm actually using this part. If there is a point where Point y2 where the normal vectors are, the inner product of normal vectors are negative, then there always has to be y1, which is on the positive side. And by making this angle very narrow if we have uh why not here? Why not here? Sorry, why one? Why one here? That's in omega minus. And this is equal to omega minus x, which means that the normal vector inner product of the normal vectors is negative. Is negative. So we are in this case, and we get another point on the other side. Oh, so this is a yeah, it's a it has to be people make. Sorry. Oh, the bow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Oh, the bow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Oh, yeah, this is the type of title. Sorry. You got the very small. You mean like 45 degrees. I believe it's 45 degrees. Yeah. Absolutely certainly works, but like. Certainly works, but yeah. Just forcing it to go around the corner, and even towards the right corner now have seated the normal. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, in fact, if we have if we have a not narrow enough angle, then we might, we might have like one solution there. Yeah, but that part we don't know yet. We don't know yet. Any other questions? So this is what I just described on the board. So we need C1 condition. And with those conditions, we can actually prove that. Conditions, we can actually prove that if we have small enough Monge control resistance, then we can actually have a continuous map t, which is a modulation. And in addition, if we have a little more regularity on the boundary, then we can have t for the continuous. So basically, this is also regularity theory of the dual potential. So we follow the We follow the big picture from the other papers. However, the trouble here is that because we don't have twisted condition, we need to keep things in a good vision to make the argument work. Yeah, yeah, we need single functions. I just described all the well, maybe not all, but. Well, maybe not all, but most of the conditions in the previous slide. And then all those things are assumed in here. Yep. Ah, so that's here. So this little omega was the modulus of continuity of this null vector map. And this is something that to quantify the modules of continuity. Okay, so in the very in like third slide, I told you that there is a condition A3, which is very essential for the regularity theory. And here we also need that too. But we actually We actually don't have that on full region, boundary omega, but only on some partial region. So x naught is based on the boundary omega, and x is on the boundary omega, and x naught bar and x1 bar are on the positive side of boundary omega with x naught. So, and in this case, we can compute. In this case, we can compute something called, we can show something called quantitatively quasi-convexity, which is actually equivalent condition to the empty double condition when we have cost function C4. But yeah, because we don't have full regularity on the boundary, we cannot differentiate cost function four times. So we have to use the synthetic expression of the MTW condition. expression of the mgw condition and this is one one of them and with the help of that uh mtw type condition or quantitatively quite like convexity we can get this color array which is basically the uh local to global results so this means that the local partial solve the local partial sub the local sub differentials are in the global c sub differential in some projection and uh because we are on the boundary we have to avoid this equator part because the part is actually uh a little hard to do some analysis so for example So, for example, in Gangbo and McCann's paper, they also don't have much information on the equator part. So we want to avoid the equator part. So we do this proposition, which is basically if we have points x naught bar in the support, then we take a projection to the tangent space. tangent space at x naught then the distance is bounded by bounded above by the Monica contravice distance so if we take Monica contravice distance small enough then we can keep the X bar away from the equator with respect to X now and this is just a picture of the stay away estimate So, what we are really avoiding here is like this part where the null vectors become perpendicular. Proof of failure estimates is not very hard. Uh, is not very hard with some pictures. So let's say we have x naught here, and suppose we have x naught bar here, then what we do is we draw a line and pick a ball that's centered at this middle point, and then we construct, we draw. We draw the tangent space touching at X naught and pick a small ball which touches X naught on the boundary on this Hansen plane and then look at this region. Let me just draw up the maps part with our segments. Segment and pick a middle point. And then we get a bowl centered at this point with radius with a diameter from x0 to x0 bar. And then we look at the tangent plane. We pick a small ball in the tangent plane. Which has X naught at the boundary, and we look at this part. And we pick the ball small enough so that this part is this part is inside this ball. And then what we do is just use the monotonicity condition with the point in here and x naught and x naught bar. Then we can have a like distance. Have a like distance lower bound in terms of x naught minus x naught bar. Then we just use the Monge control which distance. So this is an integral on whole omega boundary omega. And we just bound it from below by On the this blue part and its image, let me just use times image. C d gamma. And from the mortosity, we get the distance lower bound in terms of x naught minus x naught bar. So this can be bounded below by 10 from tons. From Tom and And then we just compute here to get the to get that quantity so we get some powers on the for the projection of x naught minus x n n n n n n n n n n x naught minus x naught bar and then we just move the powers with the constants and then we get that estimate. And also we need Lipschitz nets of the dual potential. But with respect to the geodesic distance, the story omega is the geodesic distance. To get that, we need to again need to use the gamble mechanism result. So we first approximate our omega with uniformly convex, smooth bodies. And then we do the transportation problem on that uniform convex body and use a canvas mechanism. And use Kendall-Mecken's result to get this function t plus k. And then we use the state-away estimate for this t plus k and then take limit there. Then we get the we get the liftousness, but with respect to the Euclidean distance, and we just use the comparability of Euclidean. Euclidian distance with the Joseph's distance to get the result. Here, one point that I want to mention is that, so in the stable way estimate, we need this assumption. The normal vectors are, the inner product of normal vectors are positive. But because We only have convexity, but not strictly convexity or uniformly convexity. We don't have the priority. So we use the approximation with the uniformly convex sets, then use the Gangl-McKenz result to get this t plus k, which let us have the x naught bar k, which is on the positive side. which is on the positive side then we use we can use a stay stay away as me and uh the rest of the part is like uh uh the other literature in the regular theory we need a alexandro type estimate to get the regularity theory so we we just prove upper alexandro estimate And the lower Alexandro estimate. So I wouldn't present the proof because the big picture is actually kind of the same. The only part that matters is that we have to keep the things close enough so that we don't go to the bad part. And with these Alexander estimates, we can show the main theory. So we have failed. So we have failed estimate and the list estimate that gives us a estimate of the C sub differentials. And we also need a proposition about the sections. And then we use the strictly convexity proof argument. Like we cut the U with the small sections and then putting the angle like narrow and narrow down. Well, which makes a contradiction. Down well, which makes a contradiction. So, if the function is not tricky convex, and using that, we get a strict convexity of the solution, which implies that we have a function solution and the continuity of the cost function, and we have the continuity of the bunch band from there. And if boundary is a simple. If boundary is single alpha, then we can apply the results from Kitaga Gian 2017 with exactly the same argument. Then we get an extra regularity, the whole irregularity on the management. And this is all I have prepared for today. Thank you very much. I will be talking about it. Oh, thanks for the next slide. Variation. So you said that this large omega gets approximated by uniformly convex. By uniformly convex sequences? Yes. Is there a particular reason why you can get strict complexity from or an approximation of strict convexity from the sequence? From the sequence of omega. Right. So you have a sequence of unfold convexity of it. So I'm trying to understand this. Was it hard to get strict convexity of it from it? We get the unique part. Is uh the unique part so yeah, yeah, yeah, so so we in the proof we are using we're trying to use this stairway estimate. So basically you see uh this is a estimate on the projection x minus x not bar and you see this is actually the gradient of the potential if that is different so by just uh using So by just using this failway estimate, we should get the estimate on the Lipschitz constant. However, we need this condition. Yeah. So we need to check all the conditions are satisfied, but this, but only with the convexity, we don't have this condition a priori. Yeah. So to go around the part, we approximate with the uniform convex bodies, then Kenbo Meckan's result. Then Kambu Meckan's result implies that we actually have this inequality. Yeah. And then we can use this. Okay. So from understanding, so the lacking convexity from the call it xy inner product is the same as when one lacks convexity from the joint function of the xy. Would you limiting body omega is the compact, but it might not be strict. And so to use this estimate, you need the strict positivity of the normal. And you can't guarantee that will happen with just complexity. But if you have uniform complexity of the body, then the gamble and the can result guarantees that you have that strict positive. Is that you have that strict positive, and so you want to carry that. And some sort of subtle point is the constant in this day estimate is something that survives the limiting process when you approximate by unit of time. So that's why this would, because if that depended on something like curvature, then it would break and would be able to preserve the picture. Yeah, so the quantity that we have to preserve is. Quantity that we have to preserve is in the limit is only this part. Yeah, and we can just make that part uniform. So we can take a limit. Thank you. Everything is varied. Yes, yes. So I believe it depends on the expression of this part. So we have a derivative, which is very simple given by projection. And if we just use another quantity that we might not get the like simple expressions, but still, yeah, I think there might be. Yeah, I think there might be some chances at the regularity. Okay, this was a technical question. I got a little confused at this proof of the stayaway aspect. So you lower bound by the integral along the, I can't see it very well here. The blue region crossed with what? So this has to be a subset of omega times omega. So blue region. Omega, right? So, blue region is offset of omega, and I want to put the image of this blue region. Like, and then I don't understand the next lower bound. This lower bound? So, using the monotonic condition on the x-naught, x-naught bar, and a point in here, and the image of that point, we can get a lower bound, a distance lower bound for the cost conscious C. Oh, so it comes from the monotonistic condition of the output. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't write everything in here, but uh, it's it's in terms of this and the size of the boomerang, but yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's thank Sangyan again. Thanks, Sanyan, again.
