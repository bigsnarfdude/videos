Yeah, cool. So I'd like to thank the organizers for the invitation and Giovanni for helping me out. So the plan is to give a sort of a continuation of Jun Yang's talk. And I would like to talk about the same project we had with Devesh colleagues and Jun Yang Chen, but from a different perspective. Especially, I would like to make it. Especially, I'd like to make it sound like a completely different talk. So, the starting point is this work of Professor Baudi, or rather my naive interpretation of the work of Baudio. It concerns abelian varieties, or more generally, abelian themes. So, let's review the story. So, may pi be an abelian scheme A to B, A is an abelian scheme. A to B, A is an abelian scheme over B of relative dimension G. So no singular fibers, and I also assume B to be non-singular. So everything's smooth. And then because A is the group, the group scheme, so it has the multiplication by M map, by A to A. And then if you're interested in the cohomology of A, you can have. Commology of A, you can have a nice decomposition of the cohomology. So the decomposition looks like this. You take the cohomology of A, and you can decompose it into various eigenspaces with respect to the multiplication by M. So they're exactly 2G plus one eigenspaces. Sorry, yes. Um sorry, uh yes with subindex i so i goes from zero to two g and uh here the convention is that the ones with the sub-index i consists of classes that uh have eigenvalue n to the power of i with With respect to the multiplication by n. So, here I'm using a slightly different notation. Here, this i is like a homological grading as opposed to the co-homological grading often seen in the literature. So, here I is a homological grading. I think that at the composition of this form, let's call it star as already appeared in maybe the Maybe the E2 degeneration paper, the Linux famous paper delinquent. So, this is really a canonical decomposition into eigen spaces. And there are a couple of facts about this decomposition. First of all, this decomposition actually splits the perverse or other ray filtration associated to this map. So, here there's no This map. So, here there's nothing really perverse about it. It's just the Lebray filtration. And I use the same notation as Julian. So here, the perverse or actually the Lebray filtration, the k is actually the direct sum of all the eigenspaces with index smaller than or equal to k. So this is how this decomposition splits. How this decomposition splits the perverse filtration, and also there's a really strong version of multiplicativity, which says that actually this decomposition is multiplicative with respect to the cross product. If you take anything with sub-index i, cop it with anything of sub-index i prime. index i prime, you will always land into the component with sub index i plus i prime. Of course, here, if you use the multiplication by m map, it's not hard to see this because somehow the eigenvalues just multiplied. Beta, you know, is a multiplication by n. Alpha helped with multiplication by n, beta. So you can just compare the eigenvalues to get this multiplicative. That's how you deal with this multiplicative. Then the starting point here is really a work of Claudine. It says that there is a way to derive multiplicativity. Multiplicativity with minimal reliance on the multiplication by M. And the way he did it was to obtain this very decomposition using Fourier transform. So this is an alternative approach to start without or almost without multiplication by n, but you one has to use the correct. But you wanted to use the Fourier principle. So I'll just explain this procedure. So as Shun Yang mentioned, the idea is to describe what Mukai did in the derived category to say the chromology level. The chromology level, and then so the level of sheaves or the derived category, you actually have a universal line bundle over a dual cross A over B, which is a Poincaré line bundle. Of course, this was first used by Mokai, and he viewed it as in the derived category of coherence. Uh, as in the derived category of coherent keys on a dual across A over B. And then you can descend it by taking the term character of this line bundle and you form this Fourier transform and you view it as a class in the cohomology of a dual process over V two coefficients and you act on classes on cohomology. On classes, on cohomology classes A dual, so it gives you a sort of correspondence or action. It goes from the homology of A dual to the cohomology of A. And by the familiar formula that you have fast alpha, any method to first pull it back and then cup with the turn character with the pop-up and then push forward. That gives you the four. So that gives you the Fourier transform. And then the first point is that Fauville was able to show that the decomposition I just flipped is Fourier stable. And the precise statement is like this. So, on one hand, I can take the degree B cohomology of H, which Holomology of H with sub-index i and then I apply the inverse Fourier because I want to go from A to A dual. So F inverse and the other direction is F and it will land in H D plus 2G minus 2i of A to all sub in that. What's up in x 2g minus that? This is the formula. Now, you can read a lot of information from this formula. First of all, it really is a matching between one component and another component. And also, you see that this i is split into 2g minus i sort of the symmetry. And also, you can read from this formula that actually here, only one churn character contributes to this mapping. Contribute to this mapping because you fix the degree here and the degree here, you know which the degree of the turn character contributed to this. So for example, here you use the 2g minus i turn character and here you use the i. Now, the very last information you can read from this diagram is that you see here you started with degree D classes. With degree D classes, sub-index i. And when you try to apply for a Fourier inverse, somehow the sub-index i shows up in the degree. That's the game you play. So when you apply Fourier A, which what originally was the sub-index, it shows up in the degree. So that's the structure you have. Now, with this Fourier transform, here comes the second point, which is really about a way to explain multiplicativity using this Fourier transform. And the way Fourier did this was to consider the convolution product, or also called Or also cause the quantity problem. And the idea is to use so on a dual side, you have the addition map. So this is really the addition map. And then you can define a product on a different product on the A dual side, which is that you pull back the first class. The first class and the pullback and second class, the other two projections, and then you use the addition master to push it forward. So, this is the convolution or the Puncture-Jagin product. And the origin of this was again, Mukai. He considered this again at the level of the derived category. So, what Mukai did was to figure out that somehow the Fourier dual of the The Fourier dual of the tensor product is given by the structure sheet of the graph of this addition. And again, it was viewed as in the derived category of A dual, cross A dual, cross A dual over B over V. And then you descend it to the level of commolition. So once you have this convolution, This convolution, and you can justify the name of the Fourier transform because the Fourier transform maps the convolution product to the usual cop product. This is why it is called the Fourier transform. And then now I want to show you how to use this convolution product to actually prove that the decomposition is multiplicative. And the idea is that now you take two classes, alpha. From two classes, alpha, the cohomology of A, sub-index i, and beta, say sub-index I prime, and you want to know where alpha cut beta length. That's the goal. So now, write it here. So the first So, the first thing you can decide is the degree. Well, let's write the degree of here: degree D and degree D prime. So, the first thing you can decide is the degree of alpha cup beta, because you know it's degree D and D prime D prime. So, alpha cup beta it lands in H D plus D prime, right? But then you don't know what the sub index would be, or whether there's only one Sub-index for D, or whether there's only one sub-index or a number of sub-indexes. So then you translate the problem to the dual side using Fourier or Fourier inverse. So you apply Fourier inverse and Fourier back. So now you had the formula that this guy, when you apply Fourier inverse, it goes to H D. H D plus 2 D minus 2i K dual and 2 G minus I. So you know what the degree is. So you know the degree of the Fourier inverse of alpha and the degree of the Fourier inverse of beta and you also know that the cup product is translated into the convolution product. The convolution product. So, on this side, you easily solve that you have to remember the degree of F inverse alpha and F inverse beta, do the convolution, and they will give you a class of degree D plus D prime plus 2G minus 2i minus 2i prime. And that's because when you do the convolution product, you still will be able to crack the degree. This mu is the math of a certain degree. This mu is the math of a certain degree. And you can know, so if you have a degree, a class of certain degree, class of certain degree, and apply mu lower star, you know the degree. So this is the, in the end, what the degree is. Of course, there's a, there's some sub-index, but you don't care. Now you just solve this sub-index in terms of the degree here, and you know that this answer can be only. can be only can only be I plus I prime. So once you have have this the Fourier stable decomposition, you don't need anything. No, I mean I'm just saying that you can just I mean, I'm just saying that you can just solve for it. So, once you know that the decomposition is stable under Fourier, you know. So, this class is F inverse alpha, star F inverse beta. You know the degree of each class, and you know the degree of the convolution, and you know the degree here. So then you can solve for this. And this is exactly I plus I prime. There's no other choice. No other choice. That's how you prove multiplicative. And okay, there's a third point, which is like an easy consequence of the first point that the decomposition is quite stable. So now I label it as a statement of perverse equal turn. Of course, there's nothing really perverse. But it says that if you apply the I Fourier, meaning that Fourier, meaning that you're taking the ice term character to any class on the cohomology of A dual. So there's only one way to land which lands in classes of sub-index R. And then this is really easy. You can just check this first point that how this How does Fourier and Fourier inverse act on each class? And you will see that there's only a way to let f pi act on a class, which is to go from the sub-index to d minus i to sub-index i. So you see that here, somehow the sub-index i is like the perversity in a naive sense, and it corresponds to which churn character you're acting. So the i turn character gives you quite. The I strong character gives you classes perversity out. So that's the statement for a PVN scheme. Now, just a word of caution. So you might think, oh, everything is really nice. You use the Fourier and not the multiplication by n. But actually, the proof of point one uses the multiplication by in the following way. So the proof of one uses the multiplication by n map. The multiplication by N map. And as Juniang mentioned, so what we showed was essentially that when you apply the composition of Fi inverse and Fj, the other way around. So you get some vanishing for all I plus J not equal to 2j. And it's really this statement that tells you that the Fourier is the decomposition Fourier. Fourier is the decomposition Fourier did. That's really important. And the uses, the proof of the statement uses the multiplication by n. Otherwise, there's no use of multiplication by n at all. So now I was trying to make these two statements like the strong model and the perverse trend. I was giving them names deliberately. The name deliberately you can feel that it somehow corresponds to what Juniang had in the this morning. And then the obvious thing to do is to generalize or to extend these two statements to abelian vibrations involving singular fibring. That's like the obvious way to do. And now I want to switch to abelian vibrations. Vibrations. Now you can feel that the point is to be able to extend the volvial decomposition to the singular fiber. And now there are certain abelian vibrations that we're interested in, like we now mentioned, say the heat chain vibration. And we're also interested in the compact analogs of the heat chain vibrations. Also, the kitchen vibrations, the so-called Fouville-Mukai system, like it concerns the model of one dimensional sheet on K3 differences. It gives you a Lagrangian vibration, but also mentioned that we were interested in some kind of versal families of compactified Jacobians or even modelized quantum sheaves on T2. So, for the latter, you don't necessarily have any hypercaler or Any hyperscaler or symplectic structure. So you have to be able to work in a very general framework. And the common point is that for all these vibrations we're interested in, at least over a large open set, it's a vibration in compact vibration. So this will be the setup we'll be working on. So let's assume that I have a family of curves. Perfect. So I have a family of integral locally planar curves of genus G and then there's the associated compactified Jacobian vibration. So for this to be well defined. So, for this to be well defined, maybe to make life easier, I assume there is a section. And I have an associated compactified Jacobian fibration. So the fibers are moduli of rank one, degree zero, torsion 3G on the curves. And I make the assumption that both J bar and Both J bar and B smooth. But of course, this map is only proper with possible singular fibers. Now, here I want to talk about how one can expand the picture for abelian themes to abelian vibration. Of course, I will only give you an oversimplified version of it. I'll comment on the technical points only later. Now, the first step. Yeah, so it is right. I'll comment on this later, but here you can probably assume that the Can comfortably assume that over and open there's an abidian scheme with, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. But later I'll explain how one can do without the thing. So now I'll just tell you the main ingredients. So first of all, Main ingredients. So, first of all, you see that the reason I was trying to tell you that the multiplication by n is a bad thing and probability is a good person, that it's because this multiplication by n cannot be extended to the boundary. There's no way to extend it. And of course, you can take the Zurski closure of this, but then you completely. But then you completely lose track of what happens on the boundary. It's the wrong thing to do. And the correct thing to do is to extend the Fourier transform to the boundary. And luckily in the setup, we have a nice extension of the Fourier transform. And this is due to Orinkin. So Orinkin was able to construct over J bar cross J bar over B a point for a no longer line bound of the No longer a line bound, but a Poincaré sheet, like the Coleman-Macaulay extension of the Poincaré line bound over the smooth locus. So naturally, you again view it as in the derived category of J bar cross J bar over B. And then, so Irinkin provided in a whole Fourier package saying that. Fourier package saying that this conqueror sheet viewed as a Fourier Mokai transform from J bar to j bar admits an inverse. So he was able to find the conqueror inverse. Let's call it T inverse. So this T has inverse. When you compose them, you get, sorry, don't say bar over this. It will be singular, right? Coherent sheets founded the derived category of coherent sheets. Not the perfect complexity. So everything's well defined. You can check that the boundaries, the boundaries still there. Yes, because J bar is smooth, still. Yes, because J bar is smooth, still will always act. You need the smoothness of state. So then you have this anything tagged. I'll tell you some of the key inputs in his proof. It's not really the key input of the argument, but it's a key ingredient that resulted in the existence of this. It's the so-called delta neutrality. And the statement is that once you assume j bar is smooth, it will tell you, it will imply a certain inequality between the support of single fibers and the so I. So, I have a family of possibly singular curves. And of course, each curve has a geometric genus. And so the smoothness of J-bar will imply, for example, that the generic fiber must be smooth, must be a Jacobian, not compacted by Jacobian. The generic curves should be smooth. And it actually implies more. And it implies that the code dimension. It implies that the codimension of the locus of curve of geometric genus smaller than or equal to G minus delta is bigger than or equal to delta. So, this is a complicated statement, but if you rabble it, it just says that you should generic fiber is to be smooth and To be smooth, and curves of geometric genus G minus one can occupy at least at most the divisor, and curves of geometric genus G minus two can occupy at most a co-mention two, right? And goes on. So that's the condition implied by the smoothness of J-bottom. This is the delta inequality that I'm referring to. Okay, so now you have Arrangement's result that gives you. Arrangement's result that gives you a Fourier transform and its inverse. This result, I think in its original form, it's just a text algorithm one of them. Papers were today. Sorry? No, I I don't I don't know. I don't I don't know. So now let's suppose for a moment that this poker sheet does descend to a like you can take its turn character to get you a colomology class, and it will get you a colomology level Fourier transform. Now the point is that The point is that, this is the second point, and this is really caution, that it's no longer true that you have this type of vanishing, that fi inverse closed with fj is zero whenever i plus j is not d for 2g. This is no longer true. So, basically, what it tells you is that you can take, say, a class of a given degree and you. Say a class of a given degree, and you apply the inverse Fourier, and you will split into a number of classes of different degrees. So you take every one of them, maybe a class of a single degree, and you apply Fourier back. Then again, you will have different classes of different degree, and then this game never ends. Not like the ability and scheme case. So, but then it's the crucial observation that somehow Somehow, when we say i plus j not equal to 2v, there are two cases, smaller than 2v and bigger than 2p. And we realize that somehow the vanishing for i plus a smaller than 2p and bigger than 2p for different reasons. And the thing is that if you consider f i inverse composed with fj, this is a co-dimension. Of co-dimension i plus j minus g. This is a cipho of co-dimension i plus j minus g. And then you can compare it with the f inverse composed of that composed with f is the identity, of course, the diagonal, which is of co-dimension g. We see that when i plus k is smaller. see that when i plus j is smaller than 2b this vanishing is is more like a dimension estimate than some really complicated vanishing but for i plus a greater than 2d then it's really complicated so the end result is that we can still rescue half of the vanishing which will Will be useful. So we can show that there's half of the band per i plus j smaller than 2. And the other half is probably complicated. We don't know whether there's a condition for this. So the way we showed it is to try to. To try to exploit this dimension estimate nature of the vanishing and try to play around with it using our anything's argument and also some replacement of the multiplication by n that can control the dimension or co-dimension. So here the argument again uses we have to go through the entire proof of Rankin's result for some k-theoretic games. Games or structures that we can place with the atoms operation. This would be the replacement for the multiplication by m again, we only need to control the co-dimension of certain classes, and this was done this way. And here, of course, we rerun the entire arrinking argument, so you have to use the delta inequality again. So, this is the second time we. So, this is the second time we use delta inequality. And then what you can have with only half of the vanishing, this is only the half, is that you will be able to rescue not a decomposition anymore, but a filtration. So the consequence is that you can define I call TK. I call TK to be the sum of all the terms f i composed with f2g minus i inverse and with index i smaller than or equal to k. I just take the thumb here and then you will see that You see that this actually gives you. So now you can just compute dk composed with dk. And you will see that because of the vanishing, this is you're supposed to take two copies of this tongue. So the vanishing will tell you that the first copy, you can actually take it to be the relative diagonal. Be the relative diagonal because this would be the sum of all the i's at i at 2g minus i inverse. And the vanishing tells you that when the first index is too big, the second index will be too small. So it cancels. So it goes to zero when supposed with things with first index. With things with first index very small, of course, the smallest diagonal composed with pk itself. So this way you will be able to get trajectory sections. Okay, and similarly, you can also show that dk was one composed with dk is also dk. So this tells you something. So this tells you something. It tells you that now you can define qk for the cohomology k bar to be now you have like a projection and you can take the image and we define it t k should be the image of curly pk viewed as a mass and the morphism of the homology. Hormolly. And then this condition will get you that this sequence of decays actually form a filtration. So you get a filtration instead, which looks like this from P0 to P1, and it goes on until P2D. Also, an additional piece of information again that follows from the banishing is that when you apply F inverse to PK, you apply F inverse to PK, you will land in H degree greater than or equal to D plus 2Z minus 2K. 2v minus 2k. So this filtration is not compatible with the Fourier sort of on the nose, but you still will be able to get an inequality here, which is unlike the Adelian team head, you get an equality. Here is an inequality for this direction. So this is what you get from the venue. And now, of course, you may wonder what this flotation is. And the answer is: this is actually the perverse float associated to the mass. And this comes to the third ingredient, which is the NGO support theorem. So the NGO support theorem tells you that in our setting, That in our setting, the family of compactified Jacobians, so all the perverse sheets appearing in the decomposition theorem will have full support. So, all of the perverse homology groups will have full support. And remember that these objects are nice for versions, and they are in particular semi-simple. So then so this is really a very specific, a very special consequence of the more general English report theorem. Since in our case, all of the fibers are integral, then NGO immediately tells you that. immediately tells you that all of the correct speed cuts have pulled support no no Lagrangian but Delta Muly so third time yeah of course this this is a in a certain sense this Galton inequality was invented by Emma so Sorry. Right, but in our setup, so you can go support and apply, and it tells you that everything is full support. It's made life much easier to have full support. And by having full support, Having full support, you will know that if you are able to upgrade everything from global cohomology to sort of a sheath level, then if over the smooth local you're doing the right thing to get the Le Ray filtration, and then with full support, you'll be able to tell that this filtration is again the right thing, which is the perverse filtration. So you So, you so I'm just saying it vaguely, but one has to first upgrade everything to a sheet level and then use the argument that if you have two perverse sheets, fairly simple with full support, you have a morphism of the two power sheets. If it's an isomorphism over the open locus, then it's also an isomorphism over the entire locus because there can't be anything supported on a smaller locus. You need this kind of thing. So then the So then the result is that the p-filtration I defined is actually the right thing to look at is the current filtration that appeared in June. And this is confirmed by applying Edulso for them. Now, I want to talk about the final point, which is sort of Point, which is sort of the punchline, multiplicativity, where that comes from. As you can imagine, this multiplicativity problem is finally solved by considering the dual of the tensor product, which is the convolution problem. So, here the result is again due to our inking that he was able to control the convolution kernel. The convolution kernel. Now, this convolution kernel, I can write it down explicitly. It's defined to be the dual of the tensor product. So the convolution kernel, let's call it K. This is the P inverse composed with the structure she is of the small diagonal small composed with P, box tensor P things like. P things like this. This is really the definition of the dual of the cancer product. So you view it as in dv co of j bar cross k bar cross k bar over v over v. And then Erinkin tells you that this convolution kernel, of course, over the smooth locus, it's supported on the graph of the multiplication of the addition map. Addition map and arranging says that when you extend it to the boundary, the support will not explode. It will still be of the same co-dimension as over the smooth locus, so which is co-dimension T it's supported in co-dimension. And as you can imagine, this property is proved again using the delta new. Using the delta unit already. So, this is the fourth time. So, the outcome is you have to hit this delta combo four times to be able to get everything. And then in the end, you will get some estimate of the convolution kernel, which in particular tells you that if you have a class alpha, we say indeed H D of J bar and beta. And beta in H D prime for J bar, and you take the convolution of alpha and beta, it will land in not in a single degree piece, but it will land in degrees greater than or equal to c plus t prime minus 2p. So, this is a weaker statement than what for a bit. Than what for abelian schemes. But somehow the inequality goes in a consistent way as what we had for the Fourier image. So now with all four ingredients, we can save the main theorem that we had, which consists of two parts. The first part is multiplicative. So it says when you take the perverse filtration, now we know what the perverse filtration is. It's given by the projectors. And then this perverse filtration is multiplicative. Goes from k and k prime to k plus k prime. That's really one statement we really wanted to say. We really wanted to say for the P equals W conjectural or for the pastoral that we now mentioned. The second statement is the slightly weaker version of this perverse equal churn. So let's call it perverse include turn, which says that if you apply the case for E to an arbitrary class in cohomology, you will always land in not a particular key. Not a particular piece, but in the filtration decay. So when doing this extension, all of the decomposition is downgraded into filtration, but the filtration is well behaved, and also you have this estimate with respect to the filtration. So I have the 15 minutes right. So maybe. Maybe just a couple of technical remarks. Technical remarks. So to make the story less oversimplified, I have to tell you some technical points. First of all, as I said, to be able to apply and go support theorem, we want to upgrade everything to the sheet level. Everything to the sheet level, or you can directly upgrade everything to the motivic level, but you have to use the right language. To do things on the sheath or motive level, the correct language to use is the relative child motive of Port P and Panamura. So, this is the right language to help you to. Language to help you to upgrade everything to the motive level. I'll just explain, I won't let Dale tell you the definition of all that. I'll just explain how to compose correspondences in the setup, for example. So you've got X, Y, and Z. Three maps to three proper maps to B. D is my base. And I assume that all of X, Y, and Z are nothing. All of x, y, and z are not singular, I should be able to compose two correspondences, say one on the shell of x cross y over v, and the other on the cell y cross z over v. And all, I mean, both x cross y over v and y cross z over b are singular. So I have to be able to compose those. And the thing to do is to To do is to consider x cross y over b cross y cross v over b and map to y cross y. This is the absolute product y cross y and consist and consider the diagonal embedding. Now you absolutely have to use the smoothness of y so that this embedding is regular and then you can do pullback and Can do pullback, and you will get x cross y cross v over v over v the fiber diagram. And the way you compose the two correspondences, it uses Fulton's refined intersection. So that's a nice thing to do. So you want to define gamma prime composed with gamma. And what you do is, let's call this map delta, and you have to do this. And you have to do this delta upper tree, which is in the sense of pulsing. You pull back with respect to this embedding. And of course, here, gamma cross gamma prime. And then you push it forward to the first and the third factor. That's how you compose correspondence. And after that, all the language is the same. You define a motive as a map X to V and the record. X to B and the projector and so on. So that will give you a nice category and it has nice homological realizations. Now, the second technical point is that everything is singular, so you have to be able to descend things from the bounded derived category of coherent sheets to, say, the K groups and then to the child groups in a nice way. Let's just take turns. Nice way. You can't just take turn characters. So everything's singular. Now, one has to go to, oh, I mean, one has to take the pain using operational K-theory or child theory and also singular Riemann rock, which roughly corresponds to photon. Correspond to Fulton chapter 17 and 18. That's previously to get the cycles out of sheets or accomplices in the drug category. And the third point is that to really have some real world applications, you have to get rid of the section. So what if there's no section and what if you're considering not degree zero, but maybe a degree D compacted by the Jacobian? Degree D compacted by the Jacobian. So then you have no choice but to extend everything to stack. So you have to upgrade everything to germs. It's how locally you always have a thing. You upgrade the entire story to that. And then, okay, just to make Okay, just to make a short conclusion that you can see the argument is quite involved and twisted. So it goes to various steps. There are structures on the derived category, there are structures on the k-group, the structures on the cow. And finally, they're structures on the constructionable category of P and structures in all four places will contribute to the group. So, of course, everything started with Arinkin' Fourier package. This is the starting point. Is the starting point? The one has to do the right thing to do the right extension to the boundary without losing control. So, again, you don't know much about what happens on the boundary, but things happen consistently on the boundary. So, you have Fourier and Fourier inverse. It's much better than taking the Zurski closure. So, this is the first thing. You need a ranking to run this program. And then you also need an goal to tell. And then you also need angles to tell you that you're doing the right thing. This really is the perverse filtration that you consider. Of course, you also need Adam's operation to allow A-theory and also this 40-handem language to make everything happen. You need things in all four categories. And then, if you ask me, what's a one-line explanation why the One line explanation why the first filtration is multiplicative tell you that it's the dimension bound of the convolution curve, which is the end. So this, we believe, is a sort of satisfactory explanation why the perverse filtration is multiplicative, because you see that you will be able to balance the convolution. This is the reason behind it. So the last So to the last other minutes, I'll talk about it right, yeah. So you can go from here to proof of people. But this is more general. You can see that this is much more general. This is a much more general framework that potentially applies to further questions. Now, the first further question, of course, is just that more general area by Brittany. We need the arrangement. That also I mean. Yeah, that also. I mean. Yeah. Yeah, right. That's an absolute minimum. And also, we also need the full Fourier package, which is currently only known for the Possibly reduce it at the limit currently. But you can see that the hope is that there will be one day to construct the forum. Construct the Fourier Mukai kernel in worker of the runner more generally, you will definitely hit smaller support. You need the action, yeah. But I'm saying that even with the action, there might be smaller support in more general setting, so you have to deal with the smaller support, which we don't have to. So, but the framework is here. Now, the second part is. The second part is what about when your vibration has a Lagrangian step? So Lagrandian vibration and this is maybe to n-dimensional m to n-dimensional b. So there we have, we don't have any new results, but we have a new conjecture. New results, but we have a new conjecture, and we label it the relative Bogle-Wazin conjecture. It's that, so in our more general framework, we expect, I mean, we control the multiplicativity of the perverse filtration, but we believe that in the Lagrangian case, there should be a stronger statement, which is multiplicative decomposition. So, okay, So, a fancy way to say this is that when I have this Lagrangian vibration, there could exist a multiplicative decomposition splitting the multiplicative filtration. And it looks like this. So, the radiative calm. The relative child motive of M should decompose into the various perverse HIV models, which happens in the category of child motives over B. So this goes from I from zero to M. So we will have to find the decomposition that is multiplicative in a certain time. Multiplicative in a very stack. So, this is what we believe. And the third part. So, the third part is that again in this Lagrangian, the Lagrangian that help we expect. We expect the current classes of the photo space to behave nicely with respect to this convectoral decomposition. So we expect the C2I, of course, this is the Lagrangian vibration. There's only the even term classes to lie strictly in the child 2i of the perverse H. Of the perverse HI H2I. The C2I to lie strictly in H2I. And we have some evidence towards this, mostly at the homology level. We know this is true, both for the hitching vibration and for, say, for wheel-Makai system, or more generally, for hypertailers with a labor. Hypertailers with the Lagrangian vibration, we know that cosmologically this statement is true. Now, according to this general philosophy of Bobi Voza, you would expect this to hold it at the cell level. So you can see this is actually a nice exercise that why this is true at the cohomology level, for example, for history it's actually a nice little consequence of the T core W detection that this is true. So now we're asking whether the silicon So now we're asking whether the stove holds at the child level. And I'll just mention one consequence of this, which is probably related to Claire's talk, that if M is compact. So this implies that for M compact hypercaler, and you take a divisor D, divisor, relatively ample. Relatively ample. So if the Bogle model form equals zero, then you take any term monomial or total degree 2k this is a term monomial. So this expectation would imply that. Would imply that we have b to the power for n minus k plus 1 intersect with the i, term monomial. As soon as this intersect with enough powers of c, you get zero in child. Of course, people would realize that this is part of the vector class. I'm saying that, so here you have a term monomial of total degree 2k, and as soon as you go to m minus k plus 1, you win. So this is, yeah, that's a good connection. So I frame it. I sort of formulate this as a relative version of the Bolden vector. And it's in a sense stronger, both stronger and weaker than the absolute version. It's stronger in the sense that this is relative. It works in the relative child motive and it specializes to cheat theoretically. And they specialize with cheat theoretic statements. And it's weaker in the sense that if you push forward everything to a point, it does not give you a multiplicative child finance decomposition yet. You have to further decompose this relative motive to access a whole child finance decomposition. It's weaker in that sense. Right. Stop your question.
