from Spain. She's going to talk about relay synchronization in multiplex networks. Please go ahead. Okay, thank you very much. I hope you are enjoying there. Thank you for inviting me, especially to Jordi, but all the organizers. I'm going to tell you about this work, Relay Synchronization in Multiplex Network, that we have made in collaboration with some friends in Mexico. Okay, first of all, let me remind you what relay. Forward, let me remind you what relay synchronization means. The relay synchronization happens when two elements, dynamical elements, which are not linked between each other, are happen to synchronize thanks to the mediation of a different one which does not synchronize with them. This kind of synchronization has been observed in several experimental systems, as for example in As for example, in Cirque some years ago, in this beautiful experiment in LASER by Fisher, Eco and Collaborator some years ago. But mostly we are talking about this because the relay synchronization happens to be a very important way of communication in the brain. Also, in particular, there are several examples, but in particular, the thalamocortical pathways are Weights are demonstrating how the thalamus is able to help to coordinate, to synchronize very distant cortical areas. Therefore, it's acting as a relay. And in some cases, it seems to be a relay with several steps, not just directly, but with several steps in between. So, in this particular case, not only is a only is a relay synchronization example, but it's also a case in which every one of the involved areas is a network themselves and a network with different structures and different dynamics. So this is the case we are going to study this in the framework of the multilayer network. I guess that at this point we all you all we all you all know what means that term it's can be used with the net the units of the network are related using a different kind of relationship and therefore can be made into different layers that happens for example in the transportation network in which each node which in this case is a city for example can be connected to others through different kind of transportation means Transportation means happens also, of course, in the brain, in several kinds of structures and dynamics, and can happen also in social network, in which each node, which is a person, can be connected with other person through different kind of relationship and therefore can be made into different layers. Okay, all this kind of structure the the term of multi-layer can involve different different structures as network network in the interdependent network hypergraph and multiplex network etc i recommend you this article this review article in case you are interested in this in the mathematical framework of the multilayer okay this is the yes Okay, this is the. Yes, see? Yes. Sorry? Now we're seeing. So far, we only saw your first slide. We haven't seen any other slides. I'm not sure if you were going from slide to slides above you. Only the first one. Do you have seen this? No. No? No, we only saw the first slide. Maybe you're in presenter mode. Maybe try to unshare and then share again. Okay. Share again. Okay, let's see. No? Well, we see the second slide, but it still looks we see all the the s things on the sides, so it's not in the in the full screen view. So it's not in the full screen view. But if you want to stay at that, that's at least we can see the different slides now. No? Still as before, we see slide number four right now. But put the bars on the side, left and right. I don't know how to. I think if you stay like that, but if you switch from slide to slide like that? Yeah, that works. Now we see four, five. Yeah, that works for us. Okay, let's try in this. Maybe you want to go back to slide number two because I think you lost on that one. Here? Yes, that would be great. Okay, then. Okay, then, but I don't think it's needed to start from the beginning, right? Okay, no, no, not from the beginning. Yeah, okay, then that's the only important point here is that the thing that I have told you about the thalamortocortical pathways, and therefore I'm going to go ahead to this part. Okay, then since we are interested in are interested in studying the synchronization in a system which are not only not multiplex. The system that we are going to study look more or less like this in the simple case. Okay, let's try to consider the parts of the system. As you see, it's a stack of layers in which In which two of them are going to be identical. The sternal one, the names are going to be a U1, Agu minus one. And the center one is different and is the one which is going to act as a relay. Several things to take into account in this structure. This first one is the dynamics. The dynamics of each of the nodes is going to be identical in size the largest. The ladgers, external, external ladger, and the other, the mirror ladger. Okay, and in our numerical example, each ledger are going to consist of 500 Cautis Rowland oscillators. And the central one also has the same number of Ross Led oscillator, but with different parameters to met the condition that the relay has to be different. The relay has to be different from the other two. Okay, that's about the dynamic of the elements. About the topology, the intra layer topology here is represented by the Laplacian matrix, is also symmetrical, is also identical for the external layer, and eventually can be different from for the in the relay layer. Both the structure and the The structure and the intra-layer coupling, which is also eventually different. And finally, the final ingredient is the interlager coupling. Here you see that is connected as a multiplex, meaning thus each node can only be connected to the counterpart node in other layers. We cannot have crossing connection only with the Only with the corresponding node. Here you see that the nodes, the red nodes, which are here marked by this line, are not connected to each other, but through this other element, which is the counterpart element in the relay layer. The structures inside the ladder are going to be all Erdos-Rainy random network or escape-free network. Let's see. And the interlager. And the interlader is very simple and has all in all the cases has the same strength connection, which is going to be called lambda. Okay, as you see, it's a quite complicated structure, and therefore we are going to try to simplify a little bit this system with this a little bit of calculus through the master stability function. through the master stability function. We support the calculation in the fact that the elements which are going to relay are identical and therefore we expect to have a synchronization manifold, a proper synchronization manifold and therefore we can do the following thing. We can take the external elements and there we are going elements and then we are going to define another group of variables the delta u k where k is the where k is the name of the layer and we are going to calculate this and as uh is in the in the proximities of the synchronization the delta u variables are going to be very small expected to be very small we can use perturbative Very small, we can use a perturbative approach and therefore we linearize the equation around the synchronization manifold. You see that this equation is not still simple, but unless it's linear. And here also you have to take it into account that the synchronization manifold has not every layer possible, but has only the upper half, because as the Half, because as the other half is identical to this one, then we only have the relay layer and the external layer, one of them. Okay, then we have a linear equation and a less number of layers. So it's actually a simplification. And as it's a perturbative approach, we can study the master Lyapunov exponent here, and we expect. Here and we expect that the quantity system goes to synchronization, the Lyapunov spawning goes to negative. And this is the thing we are going to try. Remember that as we expect the system to have not only a step of relay, but several steps of relay, we can in general have not only three layers, but we in general can have two m plus one layer in this kind of In this kind of stack, in which we the only condition is that we are going to maintain the specular symmetry, both dynamical. So the dynamics inside the layer is going to be identical to the dynamic of the mirror layer, the k layer with the minus k layer. For example, here the green with the green and the gray with the gray, etc. And also we are going to maintain the structure. To maintain the structural symmetry for the same reason. Then, in this structure, we are going to monitorize the dynamical state using the interlager synchronization error. Remember that I am not interested in the synchronization inside the layer. In fact, the nodes are connected in such a way that they cannot synchronize. And therefore, the only thing The only thing that is important, I mean, therefore, the nodes inside the layer are going to be in a turbulent state. It's going to be a complicated state. But we hope that this state, this state, as complicated as it can be, is going to be mirrored, is going to be reproduced very far away in this other symmetrical layer. We are going to monitorize this variable. This variable, the interlayer error, which is the node-by-node difference of dynamics averaged to all the layer. Okay, this is going to be our main measurement in this case. Okay, and now let's see if our simplification is going to be useful in the simple case, the relay synchronization in a triplex, which is this thing with this. Thing with these three layers in the simple case where all of them, even the intermediate have the same topology and all of them have the same interlayer cup, the inter-lager coupling, just to have our single free parameter, that in this case is the interlager coupling. And we see the following. Here we are going to have the synchronization error between the layers minus one and one, which is minus one and one which is which are the gray one and the gray ones I remember you and we see that in fact eventually if the interlager cup the interlager coupling is high enough the error goes to zero so the layers are synchronizing but to be sure that this is actually a proper relay we need to be sure that the ladgers are not synchronizing with the relay ladder with the blue one and we larger with the blue one and we see that in fact the zero one synchronization which is the synchronization between this one the blue one and one of the grays are not going to zero so it's really a proper relay if we compare this result which is the complete synchronization manifold with the maximally upon of spawning we see that in fact the maximum In fact, the maximum Lyapunov exponent becomes negative exactly at the proper point with the system go to synchronization. So, in fact, this reduction is actually a very well approximation to the complete simulation and therefore we are going to see in to use in the following slices the critical couplings lambda starts. Lambda starts calculated through the maximum Lyapunov spawning as our main measurement. Okay, so this is the which are going to see in the next slides. The next step is still having the same topology, but now we are going to use both inter-intra-larger coupling, sigma 0 and sigma 1, as free parameters to see how the dynamics of both the how the dynamics of both the external ledger and the internal the relay ledger are affecting to the phenomena and we see that the uh we see here mainly here we have the the full parameter space here we have the these two important cuts that the critical coupling decrease very fast with the inner coupling of the external layers but barely depends on the dynamic depends on the dynamics of the relay layer. Okay, the relay layer has to be there, but we don't need it. The dynamics of this layer seems not to be very important. A step farther, we now try with still a triplet network, but now the layer has different topology. The topology, the inner structure of the relay layer is different to the other two. Relay layer is different to the other two. Here we can have a lot of different possibilities, but the most important as this tool that I'm going to show you. Here in this plot, we see the critical coupling in two cases. The blue with the full dots is the case where all the three layers have the same Erdos Rainy. And here we compare with this mixed case. with this mix case, which is represented here. We have a scale-free relay that is in between of two Erdos Raini. And you see that the scale-free improves the synchronization between the Erdos Raini. Okay, it's lowering the critical coupling. However, if we see the opposite case here, if we see the opposite case, We will see the opposite case happens that if we have an erosion layer in between of two scale-free, the relay here is difficult in the synchronization between the scale-free layer in we compare it to the case in which the three of them are the same scale-free. So the dynamic of the relay layer happens that seems that it's not very important, but the structure, the topology of the relay is very. The topology of the relay is very, very important in the goal of the system to synchronize in the better way. If we go to a higher order system here to see what happened, as we have said that in the case of the thalamocortical password, they have several steps. Here we try. Several steps. Here we try with a pentaplex. We have now five layers with all of them the same topology for simplification. And we see that in fact the system is able to relay in the way that is expected, meaning that the mirror layers are able to synchronize here the green with the green, the gray with the gray here, and happens. And happens that all of them synchronize at the same interlayer coupling. Once the system is synchronized, all of them is synchronized in a cave of synchronization, of mutual synchronization. Not in all the before the synchronization happens, the layer has a different, very, very different dynamics, but one. Dynamics, but one they are able to synchronize all of them synchronize, but only the mirror ladders. Any other pair of ladders, for example, here we have the synchronization error between the zero and the one and the synchronization error between the one and the two. The error is always much, much than zero. So they are not able to synchronize in any other way that. way that with its proper counterpart, a mirror counterpart. Okay, and now we are trying to consider how robust is this result? Because having a system with the complete multiplexing is a very, very strong condition. In this case, we are going to consider the consider the robustness under the multiplexing. Now we are going to do the following. We are going to remove one by one the layers, the interlayer couplings, and we are going to check in every case, sorry, in every case if the system is still synchronized, is still able to synchronize to see how robust is the system. Okay? The system. Okay, here, the important thing is in which order are you removing the links? Because everything depends on that. We are going to consider three different ways of removing the links. One of them is by random. The other two are considering the ranking on the degree of the sternal layer. By the ascending ranking or by descending. ranking or by descending degree ranking. And we see the following. Here we consider how many in the X axis, how many multiplexed nodes they still are. Remember that as we have 500 nodes in each layer, having 500 means that all of them are still multiplexed. Okay. And we see that for the two And we see that for the two first criteria, the degree one, which is a random and the red one, which is the ascending degree, as soon as we remove the first elements, the system lose the synchronization. Just when we are removing the first tenth, for example, here is the first point, we are already lose the synchronization. However, in the synchronization. However, in the last case, in the descending degree of the elements, the synchronization remains zero up to around the 10% of the removing, meaning that the system is robustness under the multiplexing and as we are using the descending degree same mean that the perhaps we are mean that the hubs we are demultiplexing are the hubs, the nodes with the most number of connection. And we can demultiplex the hubs without affecting the relay. This seems slightly counterintuitive, but in fact it's quite consistent with other studies. Okay, now we already know that the proper way to do the multiple way to do the multiplexing is using the descending degree but what happened in the different cases of structures okay because the um the the um the degrees can be varied a lot with different structure here we have we have a lot of information but please take into account the main the main result which is this one when we use a scale free network we use a scale-free network, they are very, very robust to the multiplexing. Both in the cases with all the three of them are scale-free, which is this one, or the scale-free with an erdogeny in between, all of them are very, very robust to the multiplexing. Remember that here we are demultiplexing the half, and therefore at the leaves, we are sustaining the single. We are sustaining the synchronization, which is a very interesting result. In the other case, the case in which the sternal layers are scaled, are erdos are not so robust as in the other case. And in this last case, in which in the red one, we are using the descending degree order, but not using the stellar laser. Using the stellar ledger, but using the degree ledger, and this is not robust at all. The relay, this case is equivalent as doing the thing in the random order. So, in this case, the relay is not helping anymore. This is the numerical cases, and then that we have this result, we go to the lab and do the experimental. Experimental reproduction of this system. We have made an experiment that consists in a group of three ladders of electronic circuits reproducing the Rochler-like dynamics. We have three ladgers with seven elements in each of them. And in this case, the interesting thing is the element and not perfectly. and not perfectly if perfectly identical as correspond to an experimental case. But still, that means that we are not going to see perfect synchronization due to this variation, but still we observe that the external layer have a very, very high coherent behavior if we compare with the behavior. the behavior of the relay layer. The error between the two external layers are much, much lower than the synchronization with the relay layer, meaning that even in this case that not everything is perfect, if we maintain the topological structure, we maintain. We maintain the topological symmetry, then we still are going to see a proper relay, which is the main result that you have to take into account. Okay, I conclude here. We have studied the inter-larger synchrony in this high-order relay structure and we have seen that we can have relay synchronization in this system. We have used the mass. We have used the master stability function framework to simplify the system and to prove the system and the stability of this solution. And we have observed that the system is robust as the multiplexing provide you use the higher connected nodes. Because the important thing is that the low-degree nodes are the ones that Degree notes are the ones that are maintaining the synchrony. Okay, that's all. Thank you very much. I leave you this through related publications in case you are interested. And thank you very much. All right, we have time for questions. Okay, we'll start with Javier. In the room, you have to speak up a little bit, Javier. Yes. Hi, Ima. Thank you for the time. Hi Emma, thank you for the talk. Sorry that I missed you. Hi, Jori. Maybe I missed it, but you mentioned at some point that within a layer, the nodes are not able to synchronize because of the topology. Could you elaborate a little bit on that? How was it? Yeah, let me... You are still seeing the synchronicity, right? Sorry? You can still see the slide. The slices. Okay. They are not able to synchronize not only for the topology due to the topology, but due to the way they are coupled. The Rossler elements, which each of them consist of three equations, are a class one element, class one system, meaning that they are not able. system meaning that they are not able to synchronize if they are coupled through the last variable which is the set up here okay if you connect the group of rosters elements through the last variable they are not able to synchronize in any case for any kind of layer and this is the this the the the thing we are choose to do due to the fact that we are not not want to get distracted by the Get distracted by the inner synchronization. It's not exactly by the topology. Sorry if I have made you understand that, it's due to how they are synchronized. Even if you have just two of them, if just connected them through the last variable, they are not going to synchronize. Okay, that's clear now. Yeah, thank you. There is another question in the room. Yes, speak up as long as you can. Right, thanks a lot for that pre- Right, thanks a lot for that presentation. So it seems to me interesting that there is a particular strength of interlay of Ling under C. Sorry, I'm not hearing the question. You want to come up front? Because I think the microphone is working. I think that the mic is not working. Just come up here. Sorry about that. All right. Am I okay? Yes. Can you hear me? Yeah, not that I can hear you. So my question is that the So my question is that if you replace the intra-layer topology by a regular ratisting, for instance, you use the LDC Reni random graph or Skirfie graph to realize the connection between nodes in a given layer. Then my question is what happens if you use a two-dimensional lattice or three-dimensional lattice structure to connect? This structure to connect nodes in a given layer. So, still, do you still see such a critical strength in the layer coupling? As long as you maintain the symmetry, which is important point here, because most of you probably are not interested in all the mathematics I have shown you. The important thing is the symmetry. If you maintain the symmetry and you want to have a lattice at the top, Lattice at the top, then you have to have a lattice in the bottom. If these are maintained, the system is going to synchronize. The different structures change the critical coupling. It's going to be stronger or weakest, but they're going to synchronize eventually. The thing that is the thing that is different if you have a different structure we have checked i i'm not so i'm not telling you here i have not told you here but is that we have tried to reduce the symmetry the structural symmetry the topological symmetry um by removing some of the links in one of the the layers and slide slowly not very not very fast but slowly to lose you you lose the synchrony so as You lose the synchrony. So, as long as you maintain the symmetry, the mirror symmetry, the system is going to synchronize, provided strong enough coupling. I'm not sure if I'm answering you. Right, yeah, great. Thank you very much. Okay, we have one last question online, David. Hi, thank you. Just one minor question. For your scale-free graphs, can you tell me? Graphs. Can you tell me about them? Are they Albert Barbashi graphs? Yes, they're Barabasi plain Barabasi element. You see that the layer is not very large, it's only 500 nodes. So it's Barabasi almore generated, but you see, it's scale-free as much as it can be. And do you expect to see any differences if you vary the exponent? If you vary the exponent of the degree distributions, there or you expect to see the same result more or less qualitatively are going to be the same. Quantitative is going to change the critical coupling values. Right. Of course. But the question is more, the answer is more the same. If they are symmetric, the system can be synchronized. Cool. Thank you. All right. So let's thank Emag. All right, so let's thank Emma again for this very nice talk. Thank you. Enjoy the day. Thank you.
