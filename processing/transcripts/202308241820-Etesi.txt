Yes, yes, okay. Okay, he stocks on a quantum gravity from unit from the universal phenomenal cheaper of smooth four manifolds. Go ahead. Okay, thank you. So good afternoon to everyone, or good evening. Here in Europe already, very late night, so excellent time to So, excellent time to talk about quantum gravity and phoneme algebras. I hope I can do it. So, the plan is the following. First, I would like to say at least one sentence about the original motivation for this construction, which comes from low-dimensional differential topology concerning the smooth structures in four-dimensional. Then, I would like to outline the construction of a von-Neumann algebra and then Normal algebra and then an application to gravity. Okay, so these are the references. So, this paper, what I will talk about today, is on the way to appear in a contemporary mathematics volume, but hasn't published yet. So, in this moment, available on my home, only on my home page. And also, there's another earlier version in ATMP. Okay. Okay, so what was the original problem? So, somehow there is an anomaly in four dimensions concerning the smooth structures of manifolds. There are somehow too many. It is known that due to work of Donaldson and Taubes and Friedman and others from the early 80s, that even if you are given money for topologically, typically you can accommodate Can accommodate countably or sometimes uncountably many different smooth structures on these manifolds, especially in four dimensions, which already interesting even for the physicists because this is the physical dimension of at least macroscopically of our space-time. So it would be very good to understand this phenomenon. And for this, we have to find smooth invariance of manifolds, which is Of many faults, which is a very difficult task in general. And the original motivation was to try to use the rich representation theory of von Neumann algebras, or at least the two, one type for one original algebras to find new invariants. So this theorem is the following. If you are given a four-dimensional smooth manifold and only using the smooth structure, so any additional structure, we can construct a Structure, we can construct a von Neumann algebra, which is of 2,1 type and hyperfinite and is factor. And so it is unique in the category of this type of phonograph algebra. And this algebra is moreover algebraic, geometric in the sense that it contains algebraic curvature tensors, which are true. So coming from a metric or True, so coming from a metric or just formal ones. So, first, I would like to outline the construction of this algebra. So, this is based on two very standard steps. First is a geometric part. So, we are given a four manifold with its smooth structure, and then we take the space of compactly supported. Of compactly supported two forms over this manifold. This is an infinite-dimensional real vector space. And just using the smooth structure alone, we have a R-bilinear pairing, symmetric pairing for two forms given by integration. So there is no Hodge operator or anything there. So no metric is used. And this pairing is So, the point is that among the other PQ-type tensor boundaries, there are no other ones which can carry such pairing without any additional structure. So, this pairing is fortunately non-degenerate, but however, in general, it is indefinite. So, it can be considered as a scalar product over this infinite. Scalar product over this infinite-dimensional vector space of two forms. And from this pairing, we can construct a quadratic form over these two space. And we know that if someone has a vector space and the quadratic form over it, one can always construct a Clifford algebra out of this data. And one can do the same here. Only one sublet is. Here, only one subtlety you have to worry about is that because this pairing, this quadratic form is indefinite, you cannot construct the cliff for the algebra, cannot construct a real cliff for the algebra over this infinite dimensional space because the signature is not well defined. But you have to pass to the complexification. So, if you complexify this vector, This vector space and also complex linearly extend this pairing. So, this quadratic form, then in the standard way, one can construct infinite-dimensional Clifford algebra, which complex Clifford algebra, which in the standard way looks like an askending chain of matrix algebras or equivalently. Algebras or equivalently the infinite tensor product of two by two complex matrices. Yes. And so this infinite dimensional Clifford algebra, we can check basic properties. It's already a star algebra. This Hermitian matrix transposes the star operation. And also one can introduce Also, one can introduce normalized trace on it, taking the trace of an element and normalizing it. And one can use this trace to introduce a sasquinear non-degenerate scalar product on this Crifford algebra, which is denoted by AB, this pairing. And this was the first step. So this was the geometric step. So now what we did. So, now what we did so far is that we constructed a Clifford algebra, an infinite-dimensional Clifford algebra. So, you don't need any spin structure or anything on this to do this because this is not a Clifford balance, not finite-dimensional point-wise cliff-forward algebra. This is a global infinite-dimensional object. Now, what we have to do is a standard completion procedure first using this square product. We can use the Square product, we can use the induced norm to complete this Clifford algebra, so vector space into a complex Filbert space. Then one has already a Banach algebra of panded linear operators on it. And one can take another completion of this Clifford algebra now as an algebra by using its representation, its left multiplication on itself, which is continuous. Itself, which is continuous, so we get a map from this Clifford algebra into the bonded operators. And now what we have to do is just to take the V-closure and any kind of V-closure of the image of this Clifford algebra in the bonded operators. Or equivalently, we can use the Nyman Picomutant theorem to take. Big commutant theorem to take the double commutant and close this. So, this is a very standard construction, and we check that this algebra has a trivial center unit, hyperfinite, everything. So, as a result, this is a hyperfinite 2, 1 type factor for Neumann algebra. This is the geometric form of the abstract trace on it. So, in some sense, the trace is the scalar product of the unit element with the algebra element. And the interesting point is that whatever this four manifold was, this von Neumann algebra is unique up to abstract isomorphism of von Neumann algebras. Is the one for Neumann algebras. Okay, so talking about Neumann algebra in general, yes. Sorry, this can be done then for any even dimensional. Yes, yes, yes, very good point. I forgot to say four n-dimensional. Yeah, yeah, yes, exactly. Because the 4n plus 2 are exquisite because this pairing will be a symplectic form. Symplectic form, so it doesn't work. But if the dimension is divisible by four, you are right, it works. But now, now comes signature pairing, yeah. Yeah, yes, and now comes the point where where four-dimensionality enters the story. So, in general, if you have a von-deuman algebra, basically it is a sort of empty sentence because you cannot identify its element, except it has a zero and Except it has a zero and a unit and a lot of projectors, you cannot say more. But in this case, you can realize a lot of elements of this phonomeral algebra. And if the manifold is four-dimensional, this phonetic algebra is especially rich. And now I would like to mention two interesting class of operators in it. So this is the summary, this grid of embeddings. Summary: This grid of embeddings is the summary of what happened so far. So, the original vector space is always coronically included into the Clifford algebra. These two vertical embeddings are the two sort of completions what I mentioned before. And quite interestingly, because we are in infinite dimensions, the script-ford algebra also embeds into the space of all complex linear maps of the space of two-ford interface. Of the space of 24 into itself. We can imagine this as the general infinite by infinite complex matrices, algebra of that. But anyway, so let's try to find interesting elements on it. The first is that the manifolds themselves embed into this Neumann algebra. See, if X is a point of any manifold, what we started with, then we can consider the subspace of those two. Of those two forms which vanish in that point. And because of this embedding, this way of embedding. So the closure of this subspace belongs to this Hilbert space. And we can consider the projection onto this closed subspace. In principle, this projection will belong to the will be only a banded operator over the Hilbert space, but one can see. But one can see that actually it will belong to our four-Neumann algebra by some general facts, and in this way, this correspondence gives an embedding of the manifold into R, which helps to see the picture that somehow classical spaces we have an abundance of. Spaces, we have an abundance of them embed into a unique sort of non-commutative space. And also, this embedding is interesting, remarkable from the physical viewpoint, because in general relativity, we know that events are the points of the space-time, so the classical events, meanwhile in quantum mechanics, the events are identified with projections. So this mathematical construction also, in some sense, Construction also in some sense physical because maps events to events. But so far, four-dimensionality haven't been used yet, but now comes the four-dimensionality. So a special situation with four-dimensional is that if we consider the sub-algebra of local operators, so the bundle morphisms, so these are operators which act every point over every point, so are meaningful. Over every point, so are meaningful. This is why I call them local operators. So, this contains the algebra of the space of algebraic curvature tensors. So, by this, I mean that both formal, so just have abstract tensor or coming indeed from a metric. So, how it looks like if, for example, Mg is an oriented Riemannian manifold, and Rg denotes its Riemannian curve. G denotes its Riemannian curvature tensor, then in a standard way, one can take the splitting of the two forms into savage and anti-service parts by the Hodge operator. And it is well known, decomposition of the curvature tensor into irreducible simple components gives this six by six matrix over every point of the manifold. And in this way, In this way, this curvature tensor indeed local operator. And in general, if we take a local operator, so a bundle map, then it has the extra property that it has a pointwise trace function. So we can compute the trace of this operator, every point. And one can work out that in this case, this upra. In this case, this abstract trace, what I can see here now, can be written in the form of this integral with respect to any metric which is normalized. And this also shows that this abstract Nyman algebraic trace has some geometric meaning. So it comes from the generalization of the total. A generalization of the total scalar curvature. And it turns out that if this Neumann algebraic trace of this local operator is finite, then this operator also belongs to the for Neumann algebra. So now, if we indeed start with the exclusively four-dimensional manifold, we can see that even bonded curvature tensors in this sense belong to this type. In this sense, belong to this Nyman algebra. So, not only the points of the manifold are included, but in the form of projections, but the curvature tensors. So, which is quite interesting, sort of overall unification of generalization of the manifold and the geometry on it, too. Okay, so So how to I would like to apply this to some gravitational situation. So because this algebra contains curvature tensors and talking about trace in it is meaningful. We can interpret this number, so the trace of A times B, formally as the sentence that the expectation value of an object. Expectation value of an observable A in a state B is this number. So, this can be any complex number. So, what I want to say is that we have a mathematically or syntactically correct and quite rigorous, strict setup to talk about quantum-like statements about gravity. However, the physical meaning of this However, the physical meaning of this theory is not clear yet at all. So this is to understand. And now I would like to close with two formal observations. So if we accept that this is a sort of quantum language applicable for gravitational situations, then we can start. Situations, then we can start to play a very interesting game. For example, using the previous embedding of the manifolds into this universal for Neumann algebra. For example, if we are given two pseudo-Riemannian phones, Mg and NH, then due to this embedding, we can talk about very strange funny things, for example, the common intersection of two different manifolds. Of two different manifolds within R. Or even we can compare the points as even. So if we are given an X in M and the Y in N, we can somehow compute the trace of the corresponding projections. And also, if we can, in principle, compute the curvature product, if exists. In this case, somehow we can at least syntactically compare two different geometries in this setup, whatever it means. So, by this, whatever it means, I again refer back to this missing semantics yet. So, it is the question if it is too broad or too narrow or too naive approach. But, anyway, so another situation is that, and this is my last. And this is my last step. Sorry, maybe I overuse my time. So, even the quantum Einstein equation can be reformulated interestingly in this situation. So, the vacuum-Einstein equation, which looks in the standard, lambda is the cosmological constant, using that previous decomposition of the curvature tensor, one can analyze this. Analyze this meaning and can see that actually this equation says that the curvature tensor is symmetric. The algebraic B identity says that the curvature operator and the Hodge operator, which also belong to this algebra, their product as an element has zero trace. And the Einstein condition itself says that the Hodge operator is commutes with the curvature tensor. The curvature tensor. This is a start in three minutes. Okay, okay, I finish. And also, you can recover the cosmological constant by just taking the trace. Again, it is interesting to say that somehow the quantum expectation value of the curvature is the cosmological constant in this situation. And finally, we can write down a formal reformulation of the. Reformulation of the quantum vacuum Einstein equation. It is just an operator. So we pick up another operator which square is one. And with respect to this refinement of R, which is this spare, we can say that a Q, an operator, solve the Vibensian equation if it satisfies the previous three conditions. Its trace can be called as the quantum cosmological constant. And in the spirit of quantum... And in the spirit of quantum mechanics, this quantum Einstein equation, in sharp contrast to the classical Einstein equation, which is a non-linear PD, this is a linear equation. Actually, the set of operators we satisfy form a subspace, which even allows to make a BRST type reformulation of this quantum engine equation, if one likes. And finally, and I finish. So, this formalism can be used to make some sort of estimates. Even one can compute, estimate the magnitude of primordial black holes in the Planck era. Now, it's a big jump, so I don't say that it is understandable, but this is just some sort of closing motivation. Using this formalism, one can make an estimate for the number of primal. Estimate for the number of primordial black holes after the Big Bang, whatever it means. And just interesting that this number is quite small, small, so hundreds. And this magnitude is in at least in formal agreement with the standard estimate by cosmologists in this field, which is based on the Press-Schechter mechanism. So it also says that. Mechanism. So it also says that it is a statistical physical computation. It also says that the number of primordial black holes, very early primordial black holes, is negligible in the early universe. So this is a sort of encouraging point. Okay, so thank you very much for your attention. And these are the papers again. And thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Questions from the audience? Question from Zoom? Was B2, the Betty number, second Betty number? Yeah, yes, yes, yes. So we say that if we assume that the obstacle universe is simply connected and interpret the second Betty number as the number of black holes, again, Number of black holes. Again, why? So if you check the real black hole solutions in general activity, it is a quite interesting observation that the instantaneous event horizon, so intersecting the invert event horizon with the space-like section, we obtain a two-dimensional surface. And it's very interesting that this surface is always a representative of a non-trivial element in the second homology of that space. Element in the second homology of that space-time. So, black holes are indeed somehow holes, even topologically. Moreover, in the second homology, they are visible. And if we interpret this second Betty number as the number of black holes, primordial black holes, then in this framework, which is not outlined now at all, we can make a contact between this number and the plung uh and and the cosmological constant. And the cosmological constant. And somehow this gives this estimate. So I wanted to just say that this is not terribly contradiction with the all earlier cosmologist predictions. But I mean, something, can you get something like Hawking's radiation? I mean, ah, yes, this is a future project. So. So, I am working quite alone, so I haven't made such steps yet, but hope to do that. But I wanted to mention yet, I completely had to cut this part because of time limits. This theory also makes a prediction for the cosmological constant and it gives that it must be a small positive number. I didn't explain it at all, but didn't explain it at all, but you can find it in this paper and also makes prediction on this, in some sense, this cosmological constant problem, if one likes, in terms of smooth invariance of four manifolds. So I think this is quite interesting link. Of course, still subject to some criticism. But okay. Okay, we are short on time. Are there urgent questions? Otherwise, you can contact Gabo directly. So we think thank you.
