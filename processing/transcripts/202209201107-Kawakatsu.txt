University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Biology and also affiliated with the Center for Mathematical Biology there. So thank you. Sorry about the technical difficulties. So I'm really excited to be here and really thanks to the organizers for having this workshop. So just a little bit about me. I have been drawn to the study of complex social systems. Been drawn to the study of complex social systems as a way to bring together my interests in mathematical modeling, theoretical ecology, and also social behavior. And so, over the past few years, I've been looking at things like task allocation in egg colonies to organization of human societies. So, pretty wide-ranging topics. But an overarching theme for me has been how the role of population heterogeneity. So, how does population heterogeneity influence collective dynamics then vice? Collective dynamics, and then vice versa as well in these complex social systems. Now, heterogeneity can mean lots of different things in different contexts, but I think about it in terms of both individual attributes. So, individuals can have different cultural traits, opinions, behavioral phenotypes, things like that, and also heterogeneity and population structures. So, we can be connected to different numbers of people, we can belong to different groups, and more recently, even dynamic population structures as well. So, what I want to do today. So, what I want to do today is to share two projects that address this question in two quite different contexts, actually. So, one is about political polarization. And there, we're going to explore how partisanship might modulate the coupled dynamics of cooperation and polarization in populations that have diverse political interests. And then, in the second project, I want to talk about, we explore emergent hierarchies. So, there, we're going to look at So, there we're going to look at this. It's going to be in a network setting. We're going to explore how global rankings might emerge from individual-level interactions. Now, in choosing to cover two projects, I've definitely had to leave out some of the details, so I'm definitely happy to chat about that later today or later this week. So, let me dive in, but let me also move this. Okay, so this first project is a collaboration. This first project is a collaboration with Karina Tarnita and Simon Levin, who are in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton, as well as If Lelkis, who is a political scientist at the Edinburgh School for Communication. He's at Penn. So in 2014, Pew Research Center put out this, this is from an article that they put out, and they call political political. And they call political polarization the defining feature of early 21st century American politics. And this figure that I took from their website is showing the distribution of Democrats in blue and Republicans in red. And if we move this forward, we see that since 1994, the two camps have really drifted apart toward the consistently liberal and consistently conservative ends. And this figure ends in 2014, but I think. In 2014, but I think we know that American politics hasn't really gotten better since 1990. But the design of the American political system was supposed to prevent this kind of polarization and partisanship. And there's actually a tradition of political scientists arguing that a really key to mitigating these kinds of factions is to have a diversity of political interests in the population. The earliest expression of this is from 1787, where in 1987, where in his essay Federalist No. 10, James Madison argued that if the United States wanted to prevent these harmful effects of political sectarianism, which he called mischiefs of faction here, he argued that that could be prevented if the Republic, and I quote, extended its sphere and took in a greater variety of parties and interests. I like to illustrate this with a cartoon example here. So let's say that these two. So let's say that these circles here are individuals in this tiny society, right? And the circles to which they belong are about different political issues that they care about. Gender diversity in STEM is something I added last night, so it's a new addition here. But if individuals are interested in many different issues like this, then there's no obvious majority here, right? And so if, for example, you know, the gun rights group wanted to The gun rights group wanted to push their agenda, then they would have to collaborate or negotiate across differences and form alliances. And so the idea here is that in a society with diverse interests, these kinds of cross-cutting cleavages could potentially promote cohesion overall in society. Now, interestingly, there are studies based on the Gallup poll that show that Americans actually today care about a greater diversity of issues than they did. About a greater diversity of issues than they did 75 years ago. They do this by asking, you know, what are some of the salient issues that you care about? And there's a greater diversity there. But we also see that polarization is getting worse, right? And so the project here that the question we asked is, what kind of bottom-up mechanism could potentially explain this paradox that we see? To address this question, we developed a model of group-structured population. Group structured population using evolutionary game theory. So, here we're going to consider a society with M number of issues. So, here we have abortion, diversity in STEM, and infrastructure, which was a way to try to connect the library discussion we had yesterday. And these issues are represented by the black bubbles of the schematic. Did I lose it? Sorry, Zoom is doing something on the computer. Updates. Yeah. If it's still going, I'll keep going. I do have a Mac, yeah. Okay. Let me know if it cuts off. Yeah, we just lost it. Oh, yeah. Oh?  That colour? Nice colour. Awesome. Okay. Sorry about that. Right, so I was. So, back to the model. I was explaining that we consider these populations arranged in this kind of overlapping circles, right? There are M issues that we care about. And then we assume that each individual cares about a subset K of these issues. And each individual will have an opinion, negative one, which would be, let's say, liberal, zero neutral, or one, which would be conservative. Which would be conservative. And zero here means that the individual doesn't quite care about that issue, so it's a neutral opinion. We're going to represent this using this opinion vector h. In this model, we assume that every pair will attract as many times as the number of shared interests. So what this means, for example, is that if you're online, then you might interact with people who care about the same issues as you, in Facebook group. Offline, you might go to the same protests if you care about the same issues. If you care about the same issues. And since we're thinking about game theory, each interaction will be a one-shot donation game, which is a fancy way of saying prisoner dilemma, a simplified prisoner's dilemma, where you can, if you're the donor, you can either pay some cost C to give a benefit E to the recipient, or you can defect and not pay any costs, and the recipient won't get any benefit. So that's interaction. So that's interaction. Now we can actually summarize this in one expression. So this is the payoff of some individual i. And the way we do this is by looking at interaction between some individual i and let's say individual j in some set, one of these ovals here. And the left term here represents the payoff that individual i will get when they agree on a particular issue. And then the right term will represent the payoff that they will get, or an individual I will get if the two Or an individual I will get if the two individuals disagree on the issue. I should mention that the behavior will depend on whether the individuals agree on a particular issue or not. So they're playing these conditional strategies. Sorry, and if I understand, so what's my payoff? How can I interpret it in terms of individuals agreeable? What's my payoff? So the payoff is individuals are playing these games, right? In this framework of evolutionary game theory, the idea is that you accumulate these benefits. You accumulate these benefits through these interactions, and then I'll explain in the next step how that's going to affect the ways in which individuals change their behavior. So it's fitness. But I'm just trying to understand, like, if the majority of people agree on the same issues, then my payoff is what, like, just the more people agree about the same issues as me, the higher my Yeah, that's one possible scenario. So if that's, you know, if my strategy is to cooperate with you, if we agree on a particular issue, then we would benefit both from that and attraction. Yeah, happy to chat more later if appreciation either. The second part of this model has to do with social learning. So there's interactions in the social learning. So there's interactions and social learning. This part will depend on the idea that basically if you want to be successful in this hypothetical society, then you'll try to imitate the behavior and the social positioning of someone who's more successful than you are. And the way we do this is by selecting a random, sorry, so at the end of each time step, we'll select a random individual who will be the learner, and then that learner will select a role model. And then that learner will select a role model who will be chosen proportional to fitness, the payoffs. But two things can happen during this step. So the first is this learner might actually just reject the role model if they belong to different political parties. So we add this idea that there's some probability that individuals would reject opportunities to imitate members of the other party. And we call this partisan bias. Second thing that could happen is the learner might just, you know, go and explore new Just you know, go and explore new issues on their own. So instead of copying someone else's strategy and opinions, you could maybe look up some news articles for your book, things like that. So we'll say that this is the exploration rate, which happens with population. People who think about population dynamics would be like a mutation term, essentially. Now, a quick note before I go into the results. One thing to note is that some of you might be more familiar with game theory models that are ODE-based, but Are ODE based. But here, because we allow for stochastic exploration, we basically get, so these are the simulation results that I'm showing, but you get these cycles of high cooperation, low cooperation, and so on. And so what we do instead is basically we look for the stationary distribution of the underlying Markov chain using very long stimulations. But we can actually gain some analytical intuition using a method that's based on mutation selection equilibrium. I won't go into this for now, but I'm Go into this for now, but I'm definitely happy to chat about that later. So, as you might recall, Madison's idea was that having a greater diversity of issues should mitigate the effects of factions. And we can actually test this idea using our model. So, what I have here is on the vertical axis is average opinion distance. So, this is the L1 norm, average L1 norm, between every pair of opinion measures in the model. And we use this measure. And we use this measure to measure the strength of factions, essentially, because a faction is bad if the members are really aligned in their opinions within the groups. And we find that as we increase the number of groups, the number of factions, or sorry, number of issues available in the population, so as we go from red to yellow, we see that the average opinion distance increases, meaning these factions become Become less aligned in their opinions, and so the parties are less able to act as these kinds of monolithic factions in this model. So, in this sense, Madison's theory seems to be correct. But the picture becomes a little bit more complicated when we consider the role of partisan bias. So, as a reminder, partisan bias P is the probability that I reject opportunities to imitate members of other parties. With increasing With increasing partisan bias, what we see is that average opinion distance decreases within parties, which is indicated by the solid lines here, but increases between parties. So this is indicated by the, I think I lost connection again.  Are the wired into the internet connection? So, is there a cable? No? Does it look okay over Zoom? I have to share the screen and my follow here. Yeah. I can get to the point you can probably look at the same one. Oh, really? Oh, really? Because it just looks like it's not. Oh, you're still on, right? Yeah, yeah. I have a disconnected class. Oh, wait, you're back now, actually. Yeah. If it happens again. Yeah, let's join. Everyone should use good Wi-Fi lines. Yeah, this hasn't happened in the past 36 hours, so not sure what's happening here. Okay, so let me try to wrap up this part a little bit quickly. Work with the Wi-Fi that we have. Okay, so what I was showing before here is that as we increase partisan bias, what we see is that the average opinion distance decreases within party, but increases between party. And so our interpretation of this is that strong partisan bias, what that does is it promotes opinion alignment within parties, but at the cost of global alignment. It's naturally Alignment. It's naturally heightened polarization. But I think another interesting feature here is that I think what we're seeing here is a dimensionality reduction. So, what I mean by that is, for example, in this yellow case, we have three issues in the population, right? Let's say, I don't know, climate policy, abortion, fam control. But effectively, because high partisanship gives rise to these correlations between opinions and party membership, the effective dimension is really just one. Mentioned is really just one. So, an example we can think about is like, you know, you are either pro-choice, pro-gun control, and pro-environmental policy, or you're anti-all of them. So, you can put that on a single line, even though it's a three-dimensional system. So, our revised conclusion here is that Madison's theory that having a number of issues, a large number of issues, is good, but only really when partisanship is not too strong. What was most surprising. What was most surprising, though, is that when we took partisanship to the extreme, so when we let p equal to 1, we saw that that can actually boost cooperation. So how do we see that? In the C map, the colors, darker colors, indicate greater cooperation. And there's a whole bunch of M's and K's, but what we see is that as P approaches 1, cooperation suddenly increases. And this is kind of alarming because what this means is that when P What this means is that when p is equal to 1, there's a lot of a high level of polarization between parties, but at the same time, within parties, there's a lot of cooperation going on. So this is kind of like a form of tribalism, right? But the silver lining is that when we increase this rate of exploration phi to, I think in the figure it's 0.025, so there's just a little bit of independent exploration happening here. This effect goes away. And so this is another case. So this is another case of some kind of exploration, some level of noise, can actually counteract political tribalism. I'm seeing that it's 11.26. So I think what I'm going to do is go through this part really quickly. I'll just say that the main takeaway from this project, at least a practical one, is that in our society where there is a lot of partisanship, we might want to be willing. Partisanship, we might want to be willing to learn from political opposites at least a little bit sometime and also from non-social sources. So, this kind of exploration using sources other than your social network might be really key to mitigating polarization. So, now I'm thinking that trying to cover two things is a bad idea. We can start. Yeah, I'll try to do like maybe 10 more minutes or so. The second project, which is very different. Second project, which is very different from the first one, has to do with persistent hierarchies in social systems. So, polarization is a relatively new phenomenon, but I think hierarchies are much more, much older. It's really everywhere in our social systems. And this was developed with my co-first authors, Phil Trotterow, who's now at Middlebury, and Nicole Eckmeyer, who's at Grinnell, and senior author Dan Leyramore, who I think some of you know here. So, to set the stage, I want to introduce the idea of endorsement networks. So, these are directed graphs of pairwise endorsement. So, if I endorse you, then that becomes an edge in this network. And this can represent many systems, but the one that really inspired this work is the network of faculty hiring in academia. And so, here, the nodes would be departments or universities, and an endorsement from IDJ means that a department. From I to J means that a department I recognizes someone who graduated from department J as being of good quality, and so you hire that person from department J. And we can find many other examples in human systems or we looked at bird cooperative breeding birds, stuff like that too. And these networks are really often hierarchical. And I think we all kind of know this in this room, but the study that Dan Study that Dan and others did in 2015 shows: this is a figure of 10 CS departments in the US. And what this is showing, for example, is that this arrow from MIT to Carnegie Mellon is showing individuals who got their degrees at MIT and want to become faculty at Clarney Mellon. And some shocking statistics that I read in this paper include something like about half of CS faculty. About half of CS faculty in the US come from 18 PhD institutions, and also most hires are moving downward in hierarchy. So, this higher network is just very skewed, very hierarchical. To understand these systems, though, we have to understand the relationship between networks and endorsements and rankings, right? This kind of cycle. There are many existing ways to quantify the rankings in a given network. So, the question, mathematical questionnaire, here. So the question, mathematical questionnaire here is: Given a network, how can we assign a score to each node based on some meaningful property of the network? One way to ask is to say, okay, how many times has a node been endorsed? And this would be some function based on n degree. And here we're using a square root measure, root degree. Another way to do this would be: okay, how many times has a node been endorsed? And also by whom? Has it been endorsed by someone who's popular or Been endorsed by someone who's popular, or not so much, right? And for this, we use two functions: so, PageRank, or two algorithms, I should say, PageRank, which has been used by Google to make websites, and then SpringRank, which uses principles of energy minimization, essentially. So there are many ways to do this, this direction. But what we really wanted to ask was, what if the ranks actually inform individual level decisions? So what if there's a feedback in the other direction? So what if there's a feedback in the other direction? And then can we gain some insight into the actual mechanisms that are operating in these social systems using this kind of approach? So to answer this question, we developed a fairly simple model of adaptive networks. So the way this model works is we have a state A, which describes the endorsement network. So here the nodes represent individuals, individual agents in this model, and edges represent the weighted endorsements up to that time set. Endorsements up to that time set. So, here, for example, the error from pink to yellow means that pink endorsed yellow in some reasons time set. And we assign each node a score S using some score function. So this can be any of the ones that I described. And then these scores are going to determine the endorsement center. So we compute a utility uij, which is individual i's utility of endorsement j. And this function has two parameters. So beta 1 represents So beta one represents preference for prestige. So large positive value means that you're sensitive to prestige. And then beta two represents preference for proximity. So a large negative value in this case would represent your preference for endorsing someone who is similar to you in length. And these are observed in real systems based on empirical studies. Okay, so these utilities in turn determine who's going to endorse who next. Who's going to endorse who next? So, the way we do this is we use the softmax function of the utilities. So, for example, here we say that an individual i will endorse individual j with this probability. And we're going to repeat this m times and collect all the endorsements in this delta. Here we have m equal to 1, so there's only one endorsement. And then lastly, we update the state A, the network A, with the new endorsement. Network A with the new endorsements. And this is a weighted sum. So the new network will be A plus some weighted, yeah, the new endorsements with a parameter in front. And this memory parameter, lambda, represents how long the old endorsements are going to stay in the system. So when lambda is close to one, that means that the system really remembers the old endorsement. So it's a very sticky system. So, what happens in this model over time? We ran some simulations, and I'm going to show you three different cases that we found roughly. So, when preference for prestige was relatively low, that is when beta 1 was 1, we found that the outcome was more or less egalitarian. So, rank here is similar to score for our purposes. And what we see is that most nodes have similar rank here, right? But when we increase preference for prestige, Increase preference for prestige to three, we see a hierarchy emerge where we have a minority of nodes, three nodes, collecting a majority of endorsements. Now, what happens with beta two is actually that, so we turned on beta two in the last one, and what we see is that the dynamics actually become a little bit more smooth. And I think this makes intuitive sense because preference for proximity means that you're more likely to endorse someone who's close to you in REC. And so there are fewer these junk. And so there are fewer these jumps up and down the hierarchy. So it seems like increasing preference for prestige leads to emergent hierarchies. And we can actually analytically describe this transition. So to do this, we looked at the deterministic version of the original stochastic dynamics. And what we find is that the ELACARIN regime should be linearly stable if beta 1, the preference for prestige, is below some critical threshold. And this threshold will depend. Threshold. And this threshold will depend on the score function. So to visualize this, it's a little bit complicated here, but we're plotting rank on the vertical axis and preference for prestige beta 1 on the horizontal axis. And as predicted, what we see is that up to about 2 here, the ranks are egalitarian in the long term. And then as we cross that threshold, we see a higher hemorrhage. The darker lines are. Much. The darker lines are the stable equilibria here. One thing I'm going to highlight is that depending on the score function, there's a multi-stable regime. So for example, with a different function, I was showing the spring rank before, but now with the page rank, we see that there's a region of bi-stability here, where even though preference for prestige is lower than the critical threshold, you see that you can be in a hierarchical. You see that you can be in a hierarchical state. Now, before we wrap up, just one minute of quick application to an empirical system. And I'm going to highlight Phil here, who did a lot of the heavy lifting. But what we tried to do was to look at actual real systems. So we used data from the Math Genealogy Project to look at which individuals who got PhDs from a different institution went to become faculty at a different institution. Faculty at a different institution. And we did this based on mentorship. And I actually won't go into the details of how we did this, but one key finding is that we find that the estimated value of beta 1 is greater than 0, and the estimated value of beta 2 is less than 0. So based on the structure of the utility function, what this means is that both preferences for prestige and proximity are likelier both. But another interesting thing we found is that. But another interesting thing we found is that these estimates, or at least of beta one, is actually close to the critical threshold. And I think that is good news to us, right? Because even though these systems tend to be very hierarchical, it might not be too far from where we can switch it back down to the. And I will note that we actually found this for other systems as well. So two sets of bird parakeet interaction networks and one network of fraternity brothers. Of photoniding further string. And so, our model is really simple, but model fitting can give us some clues to the individual mechanisms that are in there. So, to wrap up, we have a simple model of time-varying networks that gives us insights into the mechanisms of systems. And hopefully, we're right that real-world systems are I just ran off the reporting.
