Well you just say that the existence is okay, it's done, then let's concentrate on the properties. Now, since this is the fractal activity, I I will I will do exactly the opposite. So I will not be talking about the properties and I will concentrate on the existence part, which is also in case of irregular spaces, so to say, not so trivial. This is trivial, mostly trivial, almost trivial in Almost trivial in nice spaces like in RD. So it has to print the button over. Okay, now I'll put it. Okay, so there are three papers the stuff will be based on. Okay, one I'm calling of three of them. Three of them, and there are many other people. So, what it is. So, we start, I will start with the simple situation when we are testing RD. So, since I am tobabilist, I will be speaking about the Brandon notion of R D. For those of you who prefer an analytic approach, this would be about the map or RD or other spaces. So, we have the Branden notion. And it has its generator. So, a brownian motion on R D, it generates a semi-group, it has a semi-group related to it, and then it has a generator. If you consider this on the entire of R D, the generator half of the Laplacian is not compact. Well, if you want to do something with the spectrum, it's not too convenient to work with. But still, if it has eigenvalues, the eigenvalues can be understood. The eigenvalues can be understood as the possible energy levels for the electrons. This should be a Hamiltonian of certain systems. There will be one electron per energy level, so we should somehow count the energy levels. And what to do if the spectrum is not discrete, if the number of possible energy levels is uncomfortable. Possible energy levels is uncountable. So, also, it could be even worse if you have potential here. So, you have a potential, and this potential is supposed to be positive, well, in theory, people minus. So, it will be a confining potential. This will be a potential to prevent the process from spreading. And we have a semi-group semi-group that corresponds to That corresponds to the evolution with the potential at it. So it's the Feynman Krabs formula. In order to have this, we need to have the potential to be regular enough. So catalogs, and then generate minus one half of the Laplace and plus B. This is positive. And then Also, one more feature we can add is killing on exiting an open set. So if you kill the process when it exits a set, then in terms of the semiconductor, it will accuse your indicator of the set where the exit time of the set of the set U, is different than T. So at T we we we have not yet exited the set. Yet exceeded the set. Okay, and if it's in R E, the semi-groups are no trace class, the generators are not compact. What we do is to restrict the system to a finite volume. Lambda would be the part of R D with a finite volume. Okay, uh i i if the volume is fi i is finite, then you would have only a finite number of electrons, finite number of subs. Then we can consider the question when we add boundary values on the boundary of the cells plan. So you either put consider the institutional problem and you put zero on the boundary or outside of the set at the moment, or if you are on the level on the prostochastic processes, the process gets killed when it comes to the boundary. And now, And now, now the operators associated to these operators. Okay, I skip the B here, the D V is somehow, it's always present. They are compact, there are some five joint. And now the generator, the spectrum of the generator is nice, is discrete. You can order the order the eigenvalues, okay, and you can make a measure. Can make a measure out of the spectrum and see how it behaves when the volume increases towards something. So this is exactly what this is about. You take the counting measure on the spectrum and you normalize this by the volume of this part of the space that we have. So It's also to say this is somehow the mean, mean word, the number of possible states per volume throughout. So what would be the integrated density of states which is 0.0? Okay, this is the limit of those expressions. The limit is the weak sense is too strong, so it must be vague. So, it must be vague, some mass can vanish. So, if such a limit exists, then this is the object that we'll be talking about. And then we will be talking about the two particular types of potentials. And the potentials that we will introduce will be random, because this is the whole point. We have a random. Is the whole point. We have random potentials, and then we have the process evolving in such a random environment. Or you have the operator with some random interaction added. But also the first one. The first type of potentials is the Poisson type potentials. And let's go fast over definition. So, first of all, you have a Poisson round of points. Poisson rounded points. So, what is the first Poisson round of points? There are certain points they appear randomly at one moment, like a point of appearance. And there are some conditions that need to be fulfilled. That if you have a set, or say this one, say A. A then the number of those points inside should be the number of the points inside should have Poisson distribution with parameter proportional to the volume of the sets and then over the the over disjoint sets the those random variables should be independent and this is now we we d we define points. x1, x2, x3, and so forth. And then, so this, so these are the Poisson points, and now those points will be the base, so that they're random, so they appear on the intermedium. And these are, so to say, the centers of the potential, those may have a potential that is or positive depending on which cycle. Or or positive, depending on which side I take it, uh that you have. So at each point you attach the same shape. And this is what you do, okay? And I will show you a picture in a moment. Okay, then at each point, so those x i's are here, and then you shift the shape so that this is central to those points, okay? And it can be expressed. It can be expressed expressed this way if you introduce the counting measure of the of the Poisson. Okay, so now an example. If the shape is just the indicator of some set, then this potential Vw, okay, will be this, the sum over all platforms cloud, then it's one whenever x minus xi falls within E. For this point, you see that it falls within the spectrum of three. Sorry, it falls within the translations of E, of three points. This will be 13, 15, and 16, and then you sum up everything. And so at this point, about Up everything, and so at this point, the body is potential. Another option is to introduce curing obstacles. I don't have a picture here. So instead of taking a shape, take I have balls of certain given radius, the radius is A, and those balls are thrown away from the state space. Meaning then when the process comes When the process comes to those points, it stops. And we have another. So this is Poisson. Poisson, there are Poisson, there are random points and the shapes attached to it or close to it. Another possibility is to have a lattice. For example, Z D. For example, Z D and now you have nodes of this lattice and we connect a random variable with each of those lattices, so to say random amplification. Those are non-negative random variables, they're not degenerate meaning, they are not constant, almost everywhere. And then there is the shape. Shape is the same as. And there is the shape. Shape is the same as before. There are some assumptions concerning the shape, I will talk to you about it in a minute. Okay, but then those size, so those are those nodes. In this example, I just put Bernoulli random variables that they can be 0 or 1. So for example, here is 0, here 0, here 1, here is 0. And then in this example, One-side potential is called is a ball. It's a ball, a ball with radius one. So if you have zero, you attach nothing. There is one here. I have this one behind, below. Above. Okay, here is one. It's one above. So when you now look at this from very far away, from the project, okay, from Very far away from the project, okay, far away. You have some points where this is one, and other points where this is zero. And this is really very much like the Poissonian potential, but this is different. Now, what situations they both pertain to? So, this situation would pertain to a medium, say it's soil, and then there are impurities in the soil, which then something happens. Here it's from Happens. Here it's for more ordered systems, for example, for crystals. The nodes are the positions of the ions, and then something might have gone wrong, and then we would have this random amplification for the amplifier on how big the big target is on those points. Okay, now you have seen it before, now you have this semi-group, in L2, in L2. Group, in L2, NL2, and generator. So this is half of an optimization plus a multiplication operator. In the Killing obstacle case, it's just that. Spectrum is not displayed. And then we do what I have already explained in the case of no potential. You take the eigenvalues in a big box, you order them, you make a measure. A measure and you look at the limit. And in the classical set in RG, you can really classical results that are come almost for free here. Then in both cases, there is a lot of translation invariance in the system. So we would have the limit without proving anything, just have to invoke something. You just have to invoke some ergodic theorems, and you can even write down what the limit is, what the limit would be in terms of its Laplace transform. You can identify the Laplace transform with no problem. Okay, so now, what you would like to do? You would like to go to other sets on fractals, fractals from the moment. Okay? And also, at the same time, we would like to have something more general than. We would like to have something more general than the Brownian notion. For the Brownian notion, the existence is simpler. For other processes, the subordinate processes we have already seen, the subordinate processes. The situation becomes more difficult and more difficult. So just to set the notation, what are now our what is now our our um state space and what are we doing? State space and what are we doing? Okay, so fractal should be infinity. It should be nested fractals that we blow up, okay? Because we need to pass with the volume to infinity, so it must be. Without this, we wouldn't be able to do anything. The processes that we will deal with, there are subordinate Brownian motions. Okay, the Brownian motion is also a subordinate Brownian motion, freedom of subordination. So, okay, it also covers. And then random interaction, potentials, there are determinations. Potentials that are based either on some cloud of points, okay, there's nothing special for me, you can do something like this constraints as well, or on lattice potential, which are called alloy time in stopping this. Then you have the house of measure the transition density. Okay, then so now this part you only need to go, you all know what nest fractals are, but this is the only part you need, that you have the fractal that A fractal that is compact fractal that is the fixed point for system of simulators, the same scaling fractal. And then we also assume that the first simulator just come up without without translation. And what we do, okay, one more thing. Okay, we have we have completed the vertices of of this fractal. Our destructor. And then in the distractor, you have you have this. Thank you, yes. Okay. Yes. And uh okay, so you blow it up. Blow it up, you blow it up, so you have a sequence of bigger and bigger sets. So, this is more or less like in this in R D when you take bigger and bigger both. And then this K will be blown up fraction. And we need, so if we want to have what some type interaction, this would be it. But for the alloy type interaction, you also need very Plane interaction, you also need vertices of those blown or fractals. Okay, so here this. So we take all the vertices of the zero level, so just if you think of the synchronous triangle, for example, you take just the vertices of the triangle, you take other fractals, the vertices of the first, of the compact fractal that you have. And then the processes. The processes are the subordinate Roman motions. Subordinate Brownian motions. So, okay, you have the Brownian motion C, the Brownian motion on the factor. You subordinate with a subordinate. Then this process will have to challenge densities. But what's important for us, what's coordinators, what are the possible choices? So we could have stable subordinators, which would be so. Which would lead to stable processes or to fractional, not fractional, on fractal, on measurement metrics, spaces in measuring the mixtures of these, you can add drifts. You can have relativistic stuff in nature. These are by I think that these are the most important examples, because these are uh those processes are those that really appear in quantum mechanics, right? Appear in quantum mechanics. And here I have something else. But these are just, I think these are more of theoretical value. But this one is very important for quantum design. And we have some assumptions that we need, okay? So this assumption is this assumption that is here, it corresponds to having on diagonal bounds uh of the transition density and the other one is of technical part. One is a technical concept, but we still need all the examples I've shown those assumptions are the same. Well, now we can do random Poissonian potentials. Now we do exactly the same. Okay, so this is written in this other way. So you take Way. So you take the counting measure of the Poisson cloud and then you attach some potential. Now, since this is a fractal and this is not translation invariant, you cannot just use W as a function of one variable, you need to have two. Okay, so this so this this profile, I can no longer call you. I can no longer call it single site potential because it's not single site. But now this profile has to depend on two points. So it could be negative too. This one is positive, but then we take minus. Wow, yeah, okay. This one might be positive. Okay, we always assume that we first alter the state space and then we do everything else and that this W needs to satisfy. It needs to satisfy certain conditions. And then this fractal type potential. This alloy type potential, sort of here. Okay, if you get a lattice, so now instead of having it, I could use lattice because it doesn't look like a interm like intermediate. Intermingled, then the nodes will be dispersed. And in each of the nodes, you have something smaller or bigger, or no. Depends on the behavior of those random parameters. So this is a very, very close cousin of the RD. of the articles. And now we have assumptions on the profile. First of all, important assumption. That this W, when y is or the other variable is fixed, that this should satisfy certain integral conditions, which saying that this belongs to the catalyst of the process. And there's another thing that it must be dominated somehow by a Dominated somehow by a function from L1. But when the distance of X and Y is large, the other one is just need to have some series conversion. So this I believe... Cato class depends on Y or not? No. This is Karto class depending on y. mean that the function, cado class function, is uniform about the one. Carter class function all depends on one? No, no, this this function is just a one, right? So L1 does not need to be cuto class but this this is a bound that would permit us to sum our standards. So what do you mean a full standards? This? This? Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There should be. So, part one is the cataclass, and part two is that there isn't exists. So, this cataclass function can depend on what. Not a universal catalog function. You mean this H? W. Well, the W. No, the W is the function L. Okay, so we have the function DW, here's DW that is of two arguments. That is of two arguments, yes? And then you fix the argument here. Why? Yes, you fix the argument. So for each fixed one, it's cut a class, yes, but it can depend on why. Oh, it's a decadal class, that depends. So to say, you have this condition, the defining declar class, then in this condition, why appear? Yes, so in this context, forming it. We have to cut law. If you have to have law, it should be uniformly about it. Why or not? No, we should not have points. No, no. Just point, why? Just for any should be for anyone, it should be low. Yes, and this is a good question. Because this kind of class issue is one of the issues that will be that are that they need to be satisfied and if you go into generalizations that they can be very okay. That they can't determine. Okay. And now we have this condition, which I so this one is the most important here. This one is the most important here, and I will watch this page to show what it means. It means, I haven't said what are those pi m's, there is certain monotonicity built in within those doubts. And before I explain, I go to some other slides. Some other slides. And then, okay, what is the spy m? The spi m is something that goes from the entire infinite fractal to its part blown up just by the factor, just by the factor L to Tm, so n time. So this is the finite uh finite uh finite f finite part of it. And then uh you'll okay, then you will use this projection. Then you will use this projection. And this is only Sierpinski gasket. Sikinski gasket, so this one here is the unique one, very close to. So all the vertices of the triangles can be labeled with three labels, A, B, C. And look, when you take any other small triangle of the very same size, it also has two. Same size, it also has two, uh, has three labels A, B, C, and well, here there are in this around three, so it doesn't make sense to say they are in the same order, also A, B, C. And this projection would be that this is put here, and the labels would coincide. So it's not just that you shift it, but then you can rotate preference shift and then rotate. And okay, and this this such a labeling system, uh the existence of such a labeling system is really essential for us and we have the front of which we can do for this. A the first. So this is not here the pseudox pseudo set, but about eight the hex. The hexagonal slot break without the center of the only one would have this sixth, this seventh hexagon here. This would not be positive. So we have a fractal, okay, and once we have this, so this is the unit fractal, then it can be extended towards the infinite one. And okay, and then we have the projection, as I told you. Projection: As I told you, we have the labels on the big fractal, and then every cell of the big fractal is projected onto this first fractal, this zero level fractal. Okay, and then let's go back to the condition. Okay, now you have Now you have uh in now you have x and for all points x and for all points y, okay, y is here. Then, what you do with x, you project it onto this fractal, so this would not be here. Here, here you have m, so m fabula. And then what you take with y1, you take the inverse of the projection, so we go further, you just call it up. You just draw it out. And here, suppose you do the same with y, but with x's, you project it onto a bigger function, so bigger one. And there should be monotonic. And we have examples, all the natural examples fulfill this function, otherwise it would be optimal or it couldn't be possible. Often the one to work with. Okay, then the process that you obtain by projecting the Brownian motion with this pi M, we call it the reflecting Brownian motion AM, which has the difference, the difference with the process that would be killed, the active vertices, is that it has the infinite large part. And now how do you go including the And now how do you go excluding the existence? Okay? So we added here this, so lambda 1 m omega were what we were before. So this is the semi-group, semi-group with random potential of the process with random potential. But then we add here D to say D to say that you have the original boundary computation. That you have the original boundary conversions, that you have to measures. M is now the heart of the measure of the factor. And we want to establish the vague convergence of those measures. So instead of working with the measures, we take the Laplace transforms. And the Laplace transforms have very nice features that they can be expressed analytically as the trace of a symmetric. Yes, and then there's the system. But this is not the factor that matters. It needs to be here, but we will not have problems. And now we have this very nice expression for the trace, for Feynman cuts for Lola, and we can go from there. So, what is it involved? The goal is to establish the convergence of this to something. But first of all, But first of all, we need to somehow guess what the limit would be. And in all those ergodic settings in Rd, the limit has been the expected value of those expressions with respect to the random media. So now we expect the same, and we first of all need to show this convergence. And then, so we have run a variable converging torn. So we have random variables converging towards random variables whose expectances converge towards some number. And then you establish that this series of variances is convergent. Then this would be enough to show that those L and D's converge almost surely to this limit. Then, so for any given T, then you take the set of Ts, say rationales and These same rationales and then use for Candeli and so on and so on, and we get the limit. And okay, so we have two things. One of them is the convergence of the expected value and the other one is the convergence of the variance. And now you have two situations. One is the private motion, and the other one is the case of subordinate. Is the case on subordinate processes and those subordinate processes, especially those of jump type, like stable processes that can jump far away. And for the Brownian motion, this existence is maybe not nothing, but it's easy. Because I just had to draw it for the ASCII. Okay. And then... And then, okay, so say that this is the fractal of size m plus 1, you want, and this is of size km. And now you consider the process that evolves over this figure 1, and it's killed when it comes here. Here, and you don't do anything with the potential. The potential. Okay, you do nothing with the potential. Okay, do nothing with the potential, just kill it here. The potential stays the same. Okay, so what you do? So you so this one is only Km plus one. Then if you want to go to Km, you would add killing at those blue points. And now when you start the process from here, there, and there, and then run it until it hits. It hits either blue or red or red point. And then you do this thing, then the process started from here or a point from here. And if you look at the distributions, they will be indistinguishable. This will be the same process. Well, of course, national translation. And then you can, if you make such an expression with every such an expression m plus one you can you can split the integration into three parts and then if you add those those three points that the that they will that they will the expected values of this will behave monotonically they will be increasing and then this limits just by using such an argument you will get the existence You will get the existence of this medium. But when we have subordinate processes, processes that can jump somewhere far away, that's no longer the case because we have no distrustlation invariance. It seems not to be true, at least, well, we couldn't prove it, we couldn't falsify it. But there must be, well. Well this small, how this set is located within the entire fractal, it really can make a difference potentially. So we have to do something else. We have to do something else. Now, what to do, how to recapture some of the monotonicity of those things. Those of those things. Okay. This we couldn't. Okay, we just don't know whether it's true or not. Then we do something. Three minutes. Okay. Now, so first thing you do, what you do is you replace the original process and the process with healing on exiting the. queuing on exiting the set with the process uh with the process with the reflective process which we don't you don't do it it just have infinite lifetime okay and then let's do everything that that that we've done before for such a process no queuing just reflection on the power on the power we call it we call it reflection there are maybe not so natural to everyone but this is how we think of it okay then we do exactly the same you get the measures and what what we can prove we What we can prove? We can prove that such an expected value series squares converges. Then we will see if you can establish the existence of the limit of this, we can establish the existence of the limit of that, what we want. So we want to establish the existence of the limit here. Still, again, we are not able to prove that this is what we need, this composure. Project. We do something. We need to go one step further. We need to do something to the potential, so to say, we periodize the potential. So this periodization means that you only take, so this is Km, you only take the Poisson points that fell here, you forget about the rest, and then you repeat it. You repeat those points in every triangle. This is, and then you attach the profile. So this is the cubiopisis. And with this potential, so this potential, we can finally prove what we wanted. So we can prove that these do converge. Yes, that these do converge, and then we can. Converge and then we can work a little more to show that all those expressions, so the ones that have the original process and killing and the one that has the reflective process and the peripheralized potential that they all yield the same the very same unit. But the one for which we can establish it, this is that possible. Is that thing? And okay. And now this is this, and now we get the this integrated density of state. And now, one last thing I would like to say is this is the crucial point. The crucial point is that if you take only this potential part of the function, that's e to minus the interval from 0 to Tv of excess, ds, then and you take the value of respective medium, and those those stars. And those those those stars mean that we have the periodized potential, then they are decreasing. They are decreasing, they are decreasing toward the limits. And this would be the same limit as for those durations, which we don't know how it behaves, whether it's increasing, whether it's more irregular. So here, here, and this is another so and here this this monotonicity property of the pot o of the potential, of the of the profile is really is needed. Is really needed. Here. So you have two points where this is needed. One is for showing the capital class and the other point is here. Okay. Okay. How to generalize, I think this will be for the for tomorrow, I guess, for for the next question. So thank you. Any questions? Any questions? I have a quick question about your reflective process. So you say you define the refractive process by this projection. So can you explain, for example, in the real line case for brown motion, how do you get refracted brown motion under unit intervals? Yes, this is a good point. This is why we call it reflected. Reflected, okay. In the line, that's in the interval. Yes, in the interval, you will ask. And then you have the Bravian motion inside. Then we can think of it as follows. You even have two labels, A and B, put on the unit interval, and then you put the You put labels on the lattice. So here you put A. You just wrap it, right? Yes, and you just fold it. Okay, you just fold it. That label identity. I think. Yes? So this is what we do here. So so in uh in other words that another way you can think about it of affected the process you just restrict the damage form. Yes, you restrict it to the periodic functions. Yes, yes, exactly. Any other questions? So if you try to extend this kind of result to circlistic copies, but say just the standard circuit copies. Yes. What would be your construction for doing so? I think that for the circuit, I think that for the Sierpinski carpets it should work. For the car for the regular carpet it should work because you also you can put the labels then we there is I we haven't checked but there's this other part there is this other part which I didn't which I wasn't telling you anything about it was Here, the convergence of the series of variances. This is a pretty involved argument, but I didn't present it because this argument has very much produced the argument in, say, RB. So, this is not so yes, it's so it's yeah, this is so, so it should be also it could be done on on the on the other part. Any other questions? Victor, let's start ourselves. So, this concludes today's uh talks. One is small not at least I have heard in case you need. Uh high eight today is an issue, so I've heard at least from a group. So I heard at this coming group has planning to meet at what? 1 p.m. Yes, 1 p.m. in front of the elevators on the third floor. I heard Jana and Dan also plan to go the pan time. So I don't know if this is your planned time, but I figured one o'clock. I think at one o'clock fish. Yeah, and then from there we can use the exit. Yeah, great. And the more we are, the the less likely it is that we get eaten up by back. It is that we get eaten up by bats. Yes. Okay? We will have lunch first, so we won't be that hungry. What? We will have lunch before, so we won't be that hungry. Understandably, we will not be hungry. Okay, so 1 p.m. we can throw it in the third four.  I used to start small bits, which I was a while ago now laughed at. So you start with. Maybe I just understood. Well, let's see.  So it will be hard to change your this this continuous mathematical pattern of your seeds. Yes, yes, that might be this point was not clear to me. When I pass from here to here, I basically if we assume that it's like one dimensional, if we assume it's one dimensional, then I am modifying a set between a set of zero H1 measure. Zero H1 measure, but I don't a priori know that it's capacity zero. So, what do you mean by continuous representing? Yeah, that's actually. So, basically things are based on RX. No way in our X and we assume that its boundary is accurate. Then this is well defined h n minus 1. No, it's defined. This is defined up. But if you put the rock representing the 0, But if you put the rock representative of the capacity zero, it might not be capable of the same thing. But so here I get it. Then So in no more tutorial is what you have to say. And they are the problem. But you need to have them precisely defined to talk about the current solutions. I mean, then you have to have point-wise values. So these two are. So these two are give the same protocols. And they are you need the equality to the level. So whether that one is equal to this thing being zero would give this zero. I mean, yeah, but we have no. So this being zero will imply that I guess anyway that so please treat it with this being zero implies that right but if this is zero it wouldn't mean it by that and then if we don't say something Yes. So maybe we cannot say that this is a Newtonian representative. It's a solar function than what I've called classical case. Well, in this case, we mean the classical case, but we don't know that it's a Newtonian representative, even though for nice degrees, I guess. Right. So
