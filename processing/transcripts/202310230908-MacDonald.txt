I have the wonderful feeling of going to a workshop and not having to give a talk. And yeah, so anyway, so I pulled something together, please forgive me. And it's about three different questions about Laureate materials. These are not necessarily the most important questions or the most interesting questions. They're three questions in my mind. And if I leave with feeling like I understand these questions better, I'll feel like the workshop was good for me. The workshop was good for me. I was inspired actually by the first talk tomorrow morning, which will be given by Simon Becker, I think, who formulated his title as a talk about what we know about mathematical properties of chiral models, you know, mathematical models inspired by models of Moire materials. So, okay, so Mohrays, our platform is two-dimensional materials, two-dimensional crystals. Materials, two-dimensional crystals. It's easier to make square lattices on PowerPoint. So the actual ones are triangular lattices. And if you overlay two right on top of each other, you can't see them in this picture. But if you twist them, you can see that the way in which the two layers are stacked on top of each other is very slowly in space. And that isn't a property that can be, as our experiment. As our experimental colleagues have demonstrated to us, can be achieved very well using two-dimensional material platform. And so this kind of pattern, spatially periodic stacking pattern between two-dimensional crystals, for example, is not enough to make a Moray material. What we want is matter, physics. Physics, matter that is described accurately by a model that is periodic in space, that has the periodicity of the Maury pattern, because these patterns are not, strictly speaking, periodic if you look at the atomic energy level. And for that, what you need is you need the starting materials to be semiconductors or sending metals. And we really have two. And we really have two classes of materials that where tremendous progress has been made and lots of interesting physics has been seen. So, what's special about semiconductors or semi-metals, as indicated by the green circle here, is that if the physical properties you're interested in come from a certain energy range, then all of the matter waves that are available in the material That are available in the material. This is the band structure, energy versus momentum, just for a graphene sheet. And you can see that all of the low energy states are close together in momentum space, and that means that they're not able to resolve the atomic scale periodic structure. And this is a semi-metal. There's no gap between these blue bands, which are, as most of you know, the pi bands of graphene sheets. Graphene sheets. And similarly, if you have any two-dimensional semiconductor, usually the states in an energy range of interested are close together in momentum space. And the system, even though it's not strictly periodic, is accurately described by a periodic model. And what is that model? Conceptually, the model is just that we have the Hamiltonians of the isolated Hamiltonians of the isolated layers. We know, for example, a band structure, wave functions, and energies of states as a function of momentum in a crystal, of course, because of Bragg scattering, momentum is only defined modular reciprocal lattice vector, and therefore it's defined confined to a small region of space. And what the Maur√© pattern does is make it What the Mara pattern does is make a correction that's dependent on the local stacking, and depending on the nature of the starting bands, the correction to this Hamiltonian naturally has different forms. So these are Moray materials. And so here are my three questions. I could have come up with, I could have brought up other things that I don't understand as well as I'd like. I'd like. But let me start with the first one. And maybe this is a physics kind of question. What's the phase diagram of twisted bilayer graph V? And, you know, when... Oh, okay. Okay. So let me okay, so I'll make a few preliminary remarks. So this is twisted bilayer graphene, one of our Moray systems. One of our Moray systems. As I was saying before, each graphene layer, T for the top one and B for the bottom one, in twisted graphene, a bilayer graphene, has two sub-lattices. The relevant degrees of freedom are carbon pi orbitals on those two sublattices, two layers. And namely, the way the layers, in this case, the way the layers see each other, since each atom is a layer. Other, since each atom is electrically neutral, the stacking influences how the electrons pop between the layers. And this is just showing something that's very well understood. Two layers of graphene stacked in a certain way. And if I look at the point where these four bands would cross, if I had two isolated graphene layers, they're split in a certain way. And that splitting, we understand. And that splitting we understand to be a consequence of pi orbitals tunneling between the layers. And so here's, you know, so we know graphite has been studied forever. There's lots of phenomenology about how pi orbitals hop from layer to layer, which actually controls the electronic structure of graphite. This is just a physical picture of one hopping parameter from a particular pair of Parameter from a particular pair of sub-lattices. And this is based on an approximation scheme that I will refer to. And that is, this assumes that the tunneling between layers is spatially smooth. So the tunneling, because the Moray pattern repeats, the tunneling is periodic at space and Space, and so you can expand it if you like in terms of reciprocal lattice vectors. And so, smooth means only the lowest shell matters. And so you add a little bit of symmetry, and it turns out that this Hamiltonian only depends on one number in this approximation. This is the Hamiltonian of two twisted bilayers. For any twist angle, everything depends. Angle, everything depends on just one number. And so if you calculate the spectrum of this periodic Hamiltonian with that spatially periodic interlayer tunneling pattern that depends on just one number that has a value of 100 milli electron volts or so, then you get that you find. Then you get that, you find that at a non-zero angle, the velocity of the states near the band crossing points goes to zero. So that's what these energy versus momentum states here in the middle are representing. There's actually two states for each momentum. States for each momentum, as you can see more clearly if you go to a larger twist angle where they have more dispersion. A conduction band and a valence band, and actually there are four copies of each of these that are degenerate because there are actually two momenta where the bands cross, so-called valleys, and the electrons have a spin degree of freedom, and spin orbit coupling is weak. So there are eight bands for each momentum. For each momentum. And so the so that makes, so you know so that this type of model of a MORA system is sort of 95% right, okay? And it correctly predicts that. Predicts that at a certain twist angle, the velocities become very, very small. If Tim Caxaris were here, we can read the abstract of his talk, I think. And the talk would say this model, this type of model doesn't get everything. Basically, because Basically, because the velocities have become so small, the bands have become so narrow, what's left out of this approximation is possibly pertinent. It's certainly pertinent for the band structure. So this is a physics sort of phase diagram. One of the parameters, and this is really a big part of the charm from a physics point of view of these Moray materials. Point of view of these more materials is you can change what's on the x-axis here, which is the number of electrons per period of the Hamiltonian. That's basically number of electrons per artificial atom. It's basically moving through periodic table. So because the lattice constants are so big, we can actually change the number of electrons per effective atom by a large number. By large numbers. And here, one thing we know from band theory, and when you learn electronic properties of a crystal, the first thing you learn is the electronic states separate into bands. And the important thing is each band contains one state per atom. But because we have these eight states, these flat bands contain Flat bands contain eight states per atom. And so the number of states, the interesting regime as you fill up these bands, turns out that the middle of these flat bands is when the bilayer is electrically neutral. So let's call that band filling factor zero, and the interesting range is minus four to four. And so, you know, the first question you might hope to be able to answer from a physics point of view is what Point of view is what states of matter occur in this system as a function of the ante factor and something else. Okay, I've done temperature here, can be perpendicular magnetic field, in-plane magnetic field, whatever you like. And so here's a guess about what the phase diagram of this system is. So this is a Is. So, this is a question, so we don't 100% know the answer, and this is something that I hope to go away at the end of this week feeling like I'm more confident about. And so you can see that in this phase diagram, there's a red region, which I've called ferrule, by meaning ferromagnetic. Meaning ferromagnetic. And the blue region I'll come back to a little bit later. That's superconductivity. And so yeah. So what do I mean when I call it feral? So it's like there's almost symmetry in the filling factor. Is that? Yeah, so this is, you know, these systems are approximately particle hole symmetric. Yeah. So that means negative filling factors. So that means negative filling factors are similar to positive filling factors and not exactly the same. And that property is inherited from just a single graphene sheet, which is approximately particle hole symmetric. Okay? So I've, you know, so here's a guess of the phase diagram for just, and I've called it feral. What do I mean when I call it feral? So what I mean. So what I mean first of all is ordinary ferromagnetism is for electrons in crystals that of course electrons have a spin so there are two spin states for every every electron state in a metal let's say and Let's say and so ferromagnets are really systems that break time reversal symmetry with their spin degrees of freedom, but don't break translational symmetry. That could be a definition of what we mean by ferromagnetic. And so if I don't break translational symmetry, everything is, you know, what I'm talking about is determined by this density. About is determined by this density matrix, which is integrated over all space. And for spin, it's a 2x2 matrix. And so this density matrix, the way we usually think about it, has a 2x2 matrix. One of the four independent parameters is just the total charge density. So the really three parameters we're interested in. Parameters we're interested in. And really, what's you know, when we talk about magnetism, especially metals, what we're really most interested in is the difference between the two eigenvalues of this two by two matrix, which we call the majority spin density and the minority spin density. And you can, and the other two problems. And the other two parameters are really what is the direction of this majority spin you're talking about. And in regular ferromagnets, there's typically several order, or very often several orders of magnitude difference between the energy scale that controls that the system wants to spin polarize and the energy scale that controls which direction exactly it points in. So in Moire materials, when I'm talking about Materials, when I'm talking about ferromagnetism, I'm thinking of the same thing: spin and Dally. There's a spin-dalling degeneracy in the Hamiltonian, and you could add another one, but I won't discuss that here in principle if you wanted to take account of the fact that you have two bands, conduction and valence band. Then this, you know. You know, if the system didn't break any symmetries, the density matrix integrated over all space would have four identical, would be proportional to unit matrix. It would have four, in principle, four identical, in particular, four identical eigenvalues. And so that's mainly what I That's mainly what I mean by ferromagnetic: that the eigenvalues of this density matrix are not all equal. And you can think of that as something like, for example, valley polarization and spin polarization in each valley, but it needn't be exactly that. And there are the eigenvectors that are attached to these non-zero eigenvalues are determined by. Are determined by physics that's sort of one order of magnitude, in this case, smaller and maybe less important. But when I say ferromagnetic state, I just mean that the eigenvalues are unequal. And in my straw man phase diagram, I said I marked the regions near neutrality. Near neutrality as fairly liquid. Not everybody agrees with that. And we'll see whether, you know, it'd be interesting to talk about what experiments can you do or what theory can you do to really settle this. But, you know, so one of the very common measurements that suggests that there are no broken symmetries. Are no broken symmetries in a region near neutrality, and no broken spin-valley symmetries are Hall effect measurements. So you may remember from even the mathematicians from taking an elementary physics class, and they said that the Hall effect measures the density of electrons. More precisely, it measures the dividing line in momentum space between occupied and unoccupied. Between occupied and unoccupied states. In the simplest approximation, it measures the areas contained inside those surfaces, and it measures by its sign whether the occupied states are inside or outside that surface. So, you know, what is measured? This is density here expressed in per unit cell. So, filling factor inferred from the hollow. Filling factor inferred from the Hall effect is on the y-axis, and this is the normal filling factor on the x-axis. And what you see when you measure the Hall effect is that the carrier density, the Hall density, density inferred from the Hall effect, just goes down linearly as you take out electrons. And so, as this cartoon inset suggests, this observation is consistent with the idea that we have our four spin valley flavors and their degeneracy is not broken. And they're all being emptied at the same rate as we decrease the filling. As we decrease the filling factor. And then there's a jump in Hall effect. And let me just, since I think I'm taking too much time, I'm not going to talk about the figure on the bottom. But the Hall, you know, the jump in the Hall effect says that the Fermi surface has changed. And in fact, that's what we expect in a metal when we introduce magnetism and we have a And we have a now we have a different density of majority and minority spins that we have to have two different Fermi surfaces that are closed different areas. And so, yeah, and let me also say that you know around you. Around u equal to minus 2. So the fitting is, I mean, half, I don't know. That doesn't mean it's being polarized or that diagram. Yeah. Just to be, you know, let's say within that small box. Yeah, exactly, that small box. So does it mean stream far right? Before you fall right? It doesn't really measures mainly that the eigenvalues have changed. It looks like now, you know, now there are only two Fermi surfaces and I start emptying them again. Doesn't tell much about whether it's spin or valley or whatever. It doesn't say what the eigenvectors are of the unequal eigenvalues. Earlier you said they're they're like this uh There is well parameters characterizing Hayden vectors. Yeah, this doesn't quite and doesn't probe that at all. The common assumption is that this corresponds to a scale characterization. No, I don't think so. I think that the most common assumption based on STM measurements is that it's some sort of You know, mixed bin and valid state. Which has got to do with those 15-dimensional or 12-dimensional parameters based on. But simplest state would be just spin polarized. And I've completely emptied one spin, and now I have only the valence bands of the remaining spins to empty. So among all simple quantum means, that is a reasonable simple. Yeah, and I think that all these states. Yeah, yeah, and I think that all these states are close together in energy. And it's a smaller energy scale that determines which one you actually get. Okay, so yeah, I'm not going to go through this. Let me just say that there was a jump there that occurred in, looks like a first-order phase transition, if you believe you can interpret the Hall effect in this simple way. And it's rare that we can actually tune through, if that's what we're doing, magnetic phase transitions. When we have regular materials, we don't have this freedom of changing the number of electrons per atom by a large amount. And we only rarely accidentally find a material that's just on the edge of being magnetic and non-magnetic and having some parameter, typically pressure. Typically, pressure that can control that. But there are a few systems that are just on the border, and you can tune them with pressure through magnetic phase transitions. And people have studied this for decades. And, you know, the takeaway message that is in this Reviews of Modern Physics article here is that these transitions in a metal, in a magnetic metal. Metal, in a magnetic metal, the transition to a magnetic state is always first order, and first order actually because these metals are Fermiliquids. If they're Fermiliquids, it turns out that their correlation energy is very sensitive to the particle-hole continuum of the Fermi liquid. Fermi liquid, the particle hole continuum is very sensitive, obviously, to the Fermi surfaces. And it turns out, you know, that there's a these fluctuations, you know, correlation energy likes to have more Fermi surfaces and then it starts to lose that advantage of having a whole bunch of Fermi surfaces that are basically nested with each other from forest and valley flavors. Valley flavors, then it loses that non-analytic way. Okay, so let me, so that's about magnetism. And I know not everyone has that exactly interpretation of what we know. Let me talk a little bit about the hardest thing by the history of condensed matter physics is to understand quantitatively superconductivity. Super productivity. I'm going to skip that. So, as I mentioned at the beginning, here we have, you know, here's what's going on in this system. We have two regions of momentum space, two valleys related by time reversal that contain low energy electrons. And it's very clear experimentally that in that blue region of the phase diagram, Region of the phase diagram, they superconduct. Superconductivity, you all know, happens when there are attractive interactions between electrons that cause it to tear. And superconductivity is also, generally speaking, likes to pair time-reversed single-particle states. That's what's behind the Meissner effect, for example. And the so probably for that reason, the superconductor, most models agree or assume that the pairs are formed from one electron from one valley, let's say at momentum k, and another time-reverse partner state, which is guaranteed to have the same energy in the other valley at momentum minus. Valley at momentum minus k. And so interactions scatter these pairs from one pair multiple k and minus k to another one, k prime and minus k prime. And how can that effective interaction be attractive when you know Coulomb interactions are repulsive? Are repulsive. And so exactly how that happens here is, I think, not settled. We'll hear more about it, I think, later in the week. But one possibility is that, you know, that scattering of electrons, which I haven't really indicated here from K to the other valley, this scattering, for example, can occur from For example, can occur from phonons, can occur from electron-electron interactions as well. And that intervalley scattering can easily be attractive in different models. And so maybe what's going on with superconductivity is that combined with very strong streaming of the repulsive interactions for scattering within the same valley. And yeah. Let me, how much time do I have left? Oh, let's say 10 minutes. Okay. So let me just say, you know, if you want to do a microscopic theory of superconductivity, for example, we think we might know how to do that if the mechanism is electron-phonon scattering. Phonon scattering, then you need to know what the Fermi surface is. And we don't have any idea what the Fermi surface is because of strong band renormalization effects that maybe we can discuss privately. Okay, so let me talk now about About quasi-periodic Hamiltonians. So, I think we're going to hear some talks about this later in the week. So, I want to propose that we can make designer quasi-periodic Hamiltonians that are pretty simple and in transition metal dichelcogenide heterobilayers. Layers. And so when you have two different transition metal dichelcogenide, the holes always want to live in one layer or the other. So it turns out the effective model of these systems is just a bunch of holes sitting in the tungsten layer that see really an electric potential due to the charges on the pattern of charges. Of charges on in the, these are somewhat ionic compounds in the other layer that's not electrically active. So, very, very simple periodic Hamiltonians that produce bands if you just have one of them. And so, I think this has not been, you know, as far as I'm aware, explored too much experimentally yet. But you can have two of them. But you can have two of them. For example, let's say I put tungsten with two different materials that have different lattice constants. Lattice constants are mostly controlled by the chalcogen in these systems. So molybdenum disulenide, molybdenum disulfide have different lattice constants. So the potential in this system, tungsten disulenide, will be the sum of two periodic potentials whose relative periodicity. Whose relative periodicity you have some control over by a twist angle. And also, you can make systems in which I have two degrees of freedom. You know, I have a layer degree of freedom that's active. I can have electrons in one layer or another layer, each of which experiences a periodic potential and there's tunneling between them. So I think we'll hear, you know. Between them. So I think we'll hear about at least the 1D version mathematically of this type of model later. And yeah, so here I just want to say that we know that the Hofstadter, when I have electrons in a periodic potential in a magnetic field, the magnetic field gives you an extra periodicity, the area that... Of periodicity, the area that contains one flux quantum. And it turns out that there are basically two quantum numbers that specify this spectrum. You know, basically the number of filled bands, if you like, the rate of change of the number of electrons per number of periods of the atom, and the rate of chemicals, Of the atom and the rate of change of the number of occupied electrons in some gap, you know, a number of states below a gap with the period of the Moray pattern. And so, yeah, so, and when you basically, when you look at the, you know, this kind of diagram, which is Let's see. I think energy along this, maybe energy along this axis, magnetic field along this axis. Really, all you're seeing, the main thing you see is the gas. I know a mathematical question that's been of interest is the properties of the spectrum at irrational magnetic fields, but I think there are some interesting mathematical questions just having to do. Questions just having to do with these gaps. So I'm going to have to skip over this a little bit, but the so when you have the magnetic field problem, and I'm really thinking of the two-period of quasi-periodic Hamiltonian as nearly the same as the magnetic field problem. Then you can calculate, you know, you can understand what are the values of these quantum numbers and what controls the values of these quantum numbers using perturbation theory and get it more or less all right. This is, for example, you know, starting off including only one term, the Landau level, so I have Landau bands, and then Bands, and then if I add the other term, which is the periodic potential in that case, then gaps open up within the Landel levels. And everything is controlled by how gaps are open when they're weak. And that you can calculate using perturbation theory. And I think you can do that with two periods, too. And I think it's interesting. It's uh uh it's interesting. For example, this type of uh argument gives you a very simple expla uh explanation for the very different topology of triangular and square lattice electrons on magnetic field. And also let me mention that you know it turns out that it doesn't want me to go backwards. Okay, now it's stuck. Stuck. So, what I was going to say is that in the quantum Hall case, it's truly stuck. So, in the quantum Hall case, we can actually measure these quantum numbers because we can measure the Hall conductivity. And it's interesting to think about whether when I have two periodic potentials, can I measure these quantum numbers? These quantum numbers that characterize the big gaps in the system. And yeah, so I have zero time, right, Mitch? That bell has not run. That's true. I told her to turn it off. I told her to give a 10 minute delay. Oh, okay. Yeah, so yeah. Okay. We can kick off in a few minutes. Yeah. Let me just mention one more thing then. So on Wednesday, so there was a So there was a really, for me, a big deal in this more material field this year when the lab of Xiaodongzhu measured for the first time a fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in a Moray material. And what do I mean by fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect? I mean a quantum Hall effect. I mean a quantum Hall effect in the absence of a magnetic field. That's what we mean by the word anomalous, you know, a history of magnetism. I think maybe the word anomalous was coined by Mr. Hall in the 19th century. But this is not a Hall effect without a magnetic field, it's a quantum Hall effect, and a quantum Hall effect. A quantum Hall effect at a turns out this is you know measuring this is showing the density depends on magnetic field and this really tells you that you have a gap at a fractional filling factor and also what follows from these observations is the fact that the gap depends on magnetic field in a certain way. Magnetic field in a certain way. It turns out, from all the lore of quantum Hall effect studies over in physics over the years, we know that that means that the system forms a gap state at filling factor 2 thirds, and that if we add an extra electron to this gap state, it won't stay an electron. It will split into two electrons, or split into some number. Are split into some number of electrons, each of which have a fractional charge. So this actually shows that they have a fractional charge of a third in this system. And these fractionalized electrons are sort of a holy grail of quantum Hall physics, and people have been looking for them in other kinds of systems as well. And what's unique about this experimental system is that. Experimental system is that it doesn't require a magnetic field. In principle, it's just a sheet, you know, a couple of sheets of material sitting on some substrate, normally on the line HBN, and potentially exposed, surface exposed. So you can go around and search for these fractionally charged particles with some scanning probe, and you could try to. And you could try to move them around with some scanning probe. And what we really want, what would really make this super interesting, is if we could realize those quantum Hall states that are thought to have non-abelian fractionalized quasi-particles, because non-abelian fractionalized quasi-particles, first of all, Quasi-particles, first of all, are bizarre, and bizarre is good. And secondly, they may be useful, people hope, as resource for quantum computing. So this is a real goal. So we have fractionally charged quasi-particles. It's not clear that the conditions that allow this to occur will also allow, you know, You know, these non-abelian fractionalized quasi-particles to occur. And I think that's one of the very interesting questions to pursue going forward. So I've said some things and not said other things, but one thing I can say for sure is, you know, this subject has truly been marvelously. Marvelously kind from a physics point of view. This is just a way of making artificial periodicities on a convenient LED scale. Turns out that it's the best way, the only way we have of doing it on the right lead scale that actually works so far. You think you could do it by lithography, but we're not quite there technologically yet. Maybe we'll get there. So this is a highly limited way of making artificial tubules. Way of making artificial 2D materials, but still a tremendous amount of physics has been realized. And within that space, you know, we have an opportunity to engineer properties, many electron properties, in ways we like them, in ways we couldn't have imagined. So anyway, let me stop there. Thank you. Okay, uh, we can have uh a few questions while Dave maybe starts sets up for. And you know, I forgot to press the record button. Oh, so we are recording. Oh, you did, you did. I did. Okay. There you go. Now I just
