Talk about a construction of home topic spheres using slice knots and zero search home remote system. So let's say we have a slice notch, K prime not slice. And the zero surgeries of 10 K prime homeopathic. Then we get an exotic S4. And so, because toxin we have a very good thing. And so, I think this talk is going to be broken up into roughly three pieces. First, I'm going to explain this construction. And then, second part of the talk is about implementation of this where it's standard for the four-sphere. I'm going to finish off and talk about where we're trying to make this work instead of for the four-sphere, a more familiar form manifold, elliptic surface. You can get exotic elliptic surfaces using this construction. Using this construction or implementation of this construction. Okay? So let's think I have a disc, D and D boundary D and Z. Like picture it like this box, like so. And I'll let exterior of D be B4 minus tuplet neighborhood of K. So take our disk, carbohydrate tuple neighborhood like so. And the boundary E of D will be the zero surgery on K. On K. That's the one that we'll be the K should be a D. Third line. Third line? Oh, D, yes. Thank you. And now I want to take this, fill in that curved disc back in, and tap off. Four ball. I have a four ball here, four ball here. So this whole thing is S4. We're going to have to look at this four ball on top and this thickened disc here. That's a copy of the zero tracing cab. Down here, we have the exterior of our disc. So the sticky key is a decomposition. This gives a decomposition of S4. And the zero trace of K is just E4 two handle attached to K. And the trace embedding lemma says upgrade this one if it only. Upgrade this from if and only if. Upgrades this to an if and only if. So k is slice if and only if minus zero trace of k embeds s4. Okay? So the idea is if we have K is slice, we have some bedding of the term. K is slice, so you have to do some betting of the trace. Then use a zero-series homeomorphism, k, I'll make this armor much clearer, k prime. Cut that out and glue in the zero chase of k prime using phi to get the z, which is the home dotted. Z, which is a home copy scare. Okay. And this is just using one plus two. No, three, my bad. Now, suppose we have this embedding of the trace of K prime here. Know that a k prime is flights in z minus four ball. This is an analog of tracing backing lemma for Trace and back in lemma for home dot force behaviors and four manifolds in general. Now, if we add in this condition two back in, K prime is not slice, well then that means this homotopy sphere can't be standard. The homotopy ball actually, and particularly the homotopy sphere is not standard. Okay, and it's an exotic S4. And it's an exotic S4. And that's the main constructions. Any questions on that? Any questions about that? Okay. So, in this talk. So in this talk, our P as irritated homomorphisms are annulus choices. BK, some not meeting Anna's presentation. Hey, Zera. Actually, I don't have to call these J in my heads. J, my nuts JK. So these look like this as an example, I guess. This is our J0 and the point of this is I see an analyst here. The point of this is I see an analyst here, and then our knot is formed by banding that analyst together, or the bounds of that analyst together. And if we take that band, where's the angle? What's the end? Is there something? Just point with your fingers again. So maybe a color diagram is. Yeah. So if we do an endless twist, So now it's taking this band and spinning it around this angulus, like so. You get a knot. This will be J1. Get a zero-search homomorphism between the two parts. I'm not going to explain why that is here. That is here. Just take that as given that if you have this sort of diagram, you get these sort of homomorphisms. K is an integer here. Yeah, K is an integer. If you do spin around K times, you also get a homomorphism. Zero stage is homomorphism. So this knot here Is a ribbon. And let the ribbon move this right. Right here. Okay. So we have zero social homomorphism and we have a knot that slice. Have a knot that slice. So we can apply one and three like we did earlier to get some homotopy spheres. We still have drawing diagrams. Oh, yeah, these homotopy spheres come from Paper Man, Lascu and Piccorillo. The first thing we're going to do is draw the exterior of this repo description using the standard algorithm. Using the standard algorithm in Gautama's dipsets. So this is right here, I have this exterior. I've attached a zero frame meridian to the knot and And cap off with the four handle. This additional zero handle, well no, this additional two handle, four handle is embedding in my trace. And now if I want to twist my pK and glue in the zero trace, this should be J0. Apply the A-list first homomorphism and see where this zero-frame rating goes. We'll get spun around the corner. Around this angle I'm s well it comes back here, okay with and the frame we should change I don't want to bought calculate off the top of my head right now, it's also not too relevant so So this is a diagram of a home atomic philosophy of ZK. And we're taking our disk exterior and gluing in the zero trace of the JK. Okay? Okay. The zero trace of JK here is represented by these red two handles. Now, we want to show that this is standard. Z0 is obviously standard. Z1, Kyle Hayden showed, was standard. And so the recipes are standard. I want to draw a new diagram of this homepot speed. Because I don't actually like this diagram. It's quite geometrically complicated, right? With all this red tutano that's getting spun around adding a lot of intersections to my diagram. And something else I don't like about it is the fact that these home copy spheres are constructed by these trace embeddings. And I really don't see the trace embedding here very clearly. So what I'm going to do is turn this upside down. is turn this upside down, this diagram upside down. Okay? So when it turns upside down, we get minus zk. And we'll clearly see the zero trace of jk in that diagram. And I'm not going to use the standard algorithm actually. A standard algorithm, actually. Like, if you use the algorithm presented in like Gautama's dictionators, like I think it's section 5.5, you get a diagram that's an absolute mess. Then, going back to this picture We're going to start off with J0 and since I can draw our S4 minus C0 X 0 J0. X0J0 embedded in it by first attaching to handle that runs over the ribbon move like so zero framing J0 zero framing and Two three handles and a four handle. Now in this picture, I can very clearly see the trace of J0 embedded. Now I'm going to twist by my Anglus twist homeomorphism minus Zk, get minus Zk. By looking at my new two handles and seeing what happens to them when I apply this analysis twist homeomorphism. So this, this zero frame unknot here is left in place. The band gets spun around like so. Like so. Fun around the anglus like so comes all. Well, it comes all the way to the inside and goes back down underneath here. Okay? And now this is a diagram of my minus Zk. And now I'm happy. I very clearly see my trace embedded in this diagram now. Okay? And so using Using this, we can. One way to immediately see that this homotopy 3 is standard is by using property 2R for a knot, which says that you have a two-component link, and I'm going to just connect some of two S1 cross S2s, then that two-component link is handle slide equivalent to a two-component link. So you could do these slides and then immediately cancel all the two handles to get S4. However, I'm going to explain how you can do that. I'm going to explain how you can do that without invoking this big result and see how to do it directly from this handle diagram. First, we're going to take this band here and we're going to slide it over this vehicle frame unknot. We'll bring it behind everything like so. Now add a full twist. We'll add a full twist into this band. Now, our band here is behind the diagram. We can pull it over here. Now it's in this position. And now we can see, can spin this around aimless to undo the twisting. All this twisting now get this picture here. Okay? Well, we've got the same diagram for all Zk, no matter what. So that tells us that all ZK are diffimorphic to each other. And in particular, diffimoric to ZK. If you work at the Z0, which we know is standard because it was finally Warsphere, so MAZN is standard. So these don't give exotic less force. Questions? Do you want to move on to the next part? And like meanwhile, you also showed the obvious topic. Yes, yeah. There's a slice in Zn, and then Zn is standard. That tells you that. So can you like show us the, can you like keep track of the original slice ribbon that you showed in J and like pull that all the way through this curvy calculus in order to see? Oh, you can. If you look at this curvy calculus carefully, you can see a way to get a ribbon diagram of JK. Other questions? Alright. So, what I'm going to do now is, so this construction didn't work. Because construction didn't work was here. Alright, Kai, one more question. Yeah. Can you distinguish explicitly their traces? Yeah, the trah. Are their traces actually non-homeorphic? I think they're not even homeomorphic. I mean, these homeomorphic the analysis was seen once. That's the extent of homeomorphism. And I think they showed right that was no other homeomorphism, right, Lisa? Homomorphisms, right, Lisa? If I can only show, yeah, but at least, yeah, some of them are distinguished. Okay. So now I want so So we're constructing Exotica. We all know the four sphere is hard, right? Like it's a long open problem. Don't have too many potential counter examples, potential homodopsphies that look promising. Spheres that look promising. But we've had a lot more experience constructing exotic elliptic surfaces, but this is relatively easy. There's a lot of homology to work with, to do various constructions. There's a lot of invariants that play nicely with these constructions. So, what I want to do now is talk about how we can try and make this implement this strategy, try to make it work for elliptic surfaces, okay, and get exotic structures on elliptic surfaces. And to do that, we need an appropriate notion of sliceness in other format holes. Another format of holes. So definition: K is H slice in X K equals bounded D D by X minus four ball. Bet an x minus four ball and bracket D equals zero. Moleg D is zero and second modul G. Okay, and now this construction here that I talked about with slice list earlier, do the same thing with H slice this. Slice this and Xuman X is simply connected. Okay. Okay, so I can do the same thing now with Hsliciness instead. And so. And so, we'll try and do the same thing. Almost do, but not quite. I'll explain the difference between what this would fully look like if you do it, and what I managed to achieve. What I'm going to do is work backwards. Work backwards. Let X remote surface. Is there a question? What I'm going to do is work backwards start with an exotic X. Call it X. X prime, maybe and so that X prime is a biscuit, okay and our X here are going to be ventral stern knots. Here are going to be vital stern knots of trees. So let kappa K be the K-tross knot can XK be the elliptic surface that we start off with. Offward minus an open neighborhood of our fabricatoris glute in S1 cross exterior of capus of K. Half twists here. Yeah, full twists. C. Yeah, and this is official. This is official solster knot surgery and node 2 X of K are diffeomorphic. And we're going to show that these x sub k arise from doing this cutting gluing operation of our traces. Sort of like Gom's construction of Ignor Pork, where he starts with off of the same exotic lipid surfaces and finds a quark that realizes finds a quark inside X that realizes these visual sternot surgeries. Questions? Questions? So describe kappa sub k as kappa zero is unknown and And minus one on the K surgery on this knot C. And now this describes E of capsule K as minus one over K surgery. My S1 over case surgery on E at kappa 0 on C E kappa 0. And same thing with S1 cross exterior. S1 cross minus 1 over the situation C and And S1 cross E kappa zero. Okay. So Then I relate xk as S1 cross minus 1 over k0 G C on X 0 if you do all contained inside these S1 cross not exterior factors. So that implies that XK is a log transfer. Log transform on S1 cross C in X0. Notice that this C is null homologous in that not exerciser. So this S1 cross C is null homologous as well. And we call this S1 cross C S. And so X K is S cross D two union X 0 minus the neighborhood of S. Okay. And which was towards tau K coming from S1 across the gluing map of the stained surgery. S cross D2, which is a zero handle, union two one handles, union two handles. So I want to be cutting and gluing by traces. So what I want to do is find something that cancels these one handles in a nice way. So Starting off with x0, the s minus d2. I don't want to go into details about how to find these two handles right now. I find canceling two handles, union, uh, whatever is left over. You can cancel these to get canceled to cancel the one handles to get an embedded zero trace. And the trace embedding lemma gives a disk D such that this complement of that zero trace is that disk. That zero trace is that disk exterior. Okay? Oh, yeah, and this trace is null molecules embedded because S is normal, it's embedded. And this D will also be null molecules. So now I apply this twist tau sub k that I use with log math transform to get xk, which is s cross d2 with a twist. These two handles are still canceling. You need the rest. And then since these, well, actually the rest here is just at this exterior. And if you cancel these two handles, and by appropriately choosing these two handles, you can put a zero trace of the aimless twist of K0. Okay. And this shows that you can make the strategy work with exotic, sort of make the strategy work with exotic surfaces. This is the red. This is the right construction, cutting out a trace and gluing it in by a zero-strategy homomorphism. But this doesn't get all three of these conditions. Can anybody tell me what's missing here? Still get an exotic S, but X, but we don't actually have all three of these conditions. Yeah? And you don't have two. Yeah, you don't have two. So normally, what you do is you use two to detect exoticness. But here, the exoteness is actually detected by the side wooden bands of xk. And it turns out, well, there's actually no hope of using H slices of these k sub k to detect exoteness, because these k are all conformant to each other. Okay? Okay? So let's still leave it open whether or not, like, we still whether or not we can actually do this yet, i.e. question K is a slice is X and has the same serial surgery as K prime then must K prime Also, the H splice X. I think this is actually a really interesting question because doing this with some form handful decks, it seems relatively practical right now. We have some interesting H-slice obstructions. It's not the notoriously high force here. Might be more. We might need more stronger structures. I think this is actually feasible relatively soon. Showing that this is false. Standard H slice instructions? Sorry? You say technology for H slice instructions may be a bit weak right now. It might be a bit weak right now, honestly. Might be a bit weak right now, honestly. But what are the basic points? So there's an original paper of Van Lescu, Marigon, and Piccarilla, which using barrel fruit invariants showed that one of the trefoils is not H slice and gates to be blown up once, but is and some CB2s and CB2 bars. Use that to distinguish them. Had to distinguish them. And then there's some more recent using power for root invariance. Shows that, yeah, it has the synthetic condition, then you're not H-slice anymore. It's plug-in four-manifold with B plus equal to three mod four, I think. Yeah. I think the original paper was Anthony's paper when he took harder. Yeah, but I just thought. Yeah, but I just can say the names. Any other questions? Charles, can you draw an ox K that you actually get a bit complicated. I could try what they look like is something like Something like they look something like this. This is it. Actually, I think it's technically mirror these knots. I'm not sure that's completely right. It's off the top of my head. Sorry, Jason, can you say what are these knots? Oh, so these are knots that I can cut the traces from a lifted surface and glue them in to get some things on it. Let's see, I think I'll leave it there, okay? Do you say these are like known to be H slice or it's not known if they're actually not? Oh these K? Yeah, they're all H sliced in Liptic surface. Which is annoying because that means that you can't distinguish these ultric surfaces by the H slices of these lots. Are they just sliced? What if you like the What if you put the two parallel bands that are going vertically through the picture? If you do ribbon moves that band them into each other. Yeah, if you do that, you get the 5-2 knot. Oh, okay. Yeah. Great. Good. Other questions? Let's thank Kai again. Let's start the next talk at 20 pounds. No, it's not. No, let's have the break. What if people are going to be able to do it? We don't need to get into conference. You know, what about all the people who play about something next topic? I don't know if you use it. So do you want to require it? You have a standard curve on the bottom distance here. And I was thinking about it. Yeah, I don't know how to do it. I'm only doing all the topic size. That's what I was just saying. Yeah, so the stuff like that. It's like you still have CPT. I also I was thinking a little bit about like
