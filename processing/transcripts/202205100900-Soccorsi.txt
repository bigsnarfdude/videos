Thanks again for the invitation. And so, as you mentioned, I'm going to talk on several, actually two inverse coefficient problems for time fractional diffusion equations. And it turns out that both of these problems have been mentioned by Banky in the previous talk. And okay, the reason why I And okay, the reason why I I've decided to talk uh about these problems is that okay in both cases these are um uh uniqueness results so identification uniqueness result and this results rely on say classical uh inverse theory in the sense that for the first problem we will use uh an inverse spectral result so typically a Borg-Levinson theorem. A Burg-Levinson theorem to solve the problem, and in the second case, we use the classical theory of Cadillan problems. So, this is more or less what I want to explain in this talk. So, to make things a bit clearer, I will start with the first problem. So, I consider a bounded domain of Rd. So, D is the dimension. It is in all this talk, it is greater than all to two. And in the Two and in the first problem, I consider a time fraction diffusion equation with a fixed or constant order. So alpha is the order, and here it can be chosen either between 0 and 1, so which correspond to the sub-diffusive case, or in between 1 and 2. So in this case, it is the super diffusive case. And capital T is always a positive and finite. A positive and finite number, real number here. And so we look at this system where you see you have a time fractional diffusion equation with the density. So the density is rho here and conductivity, A, potential, Q. And these three parameters are potentially unknown functions. So they are all functions of the. So they are all functions of the space variable here. And so we probe this system with a Dirac Lay data F that I will specify later. And we equip the system with two homogeneous initial conditions. So in this system, the fractional derivative is taken in the Caputo sense, but since the initial data are zero, But since the initial data are zero here, we could take a Riemann Euro definition as well. It wouldn't change anything. But say to fix the IDs, we consider here the Capuchin derivative. And so we consider two sub-boundaries of the boundary of the domain. So the first one is gamma input, second one is gamma output. And we assume essential. And we make we assume essentially that the overlap of these two boundaries is non-empty and that their union recovers the entire boundary. And from that, we will define the partial directly to normal map at one fixed time. So the time is fixed, I denoted by T0 in the following. So we just measure actually the risk. We just measure actually the response of the system. So, u is the solution to the previous equation here. So, the normal derivative of this solution computed at T naught and measured on gamma output when we probe the system with Dirichlet data which is supported in gamma input. And so, the question we ask is to know whether knowledge of this partial Euclidean map. Of this partial euclid map, which, and this is the important thing here, it is computed only at one fixed time, and the time is arbitrary. So it is to know whether this knowledge uniquely determines the three parameters, rho, a and q. And okay, before I give the result to this question, we can already see that clearly the result is negative. Really, the result is negative. And to see this, it is enough to consider the UI transform. That is to say, that we consider the solution, I mean, sorry, the function v, which is obtained by multiplying the solution u to the previous system by the square root of a. And it is not hard to check that this function v is a solution to the same type of system as before. As before, where now the density is just multiplied by or divided by A, sorry, where the conductivity is one now, so that we have just a Laplace operator here. And the potential Q, so the electric potential, is changed into this expression and And from that, we can actually relate the directly to neuron maps associated to these both problems. So, the directly to main map to the second problem, which is associated to this density rho divided by A, to this conductivity A, which is one, and to this potential QA. So, it is related to the conductivity of the previous problem. So, through this. Previous problem, so through this relation. And from that, we can actually see that if we choose A more or less to fix the boundary, in the sense that A is one on the boundary, and on the top of that, we ask that the normal derivative of A is zero on the boundary. Then these two directly treatment maps coincide. Despite the fact that, of course, these coefficients might not. These coefficients might not, at least this set of coefficients might not coincide. So, this shows that clearly the question we asked is to know whether this map here is injective. So, the answers to this question is negative. So, this means that the best we can hope is to recover two of the three unknown coefficients out of these three coefficients. This is the best we can expect. Three coefficients. This is the best we can expect. And so the result we have actually is that we can actually do that. So the assumption for that is that we need some regularity, of course, of the coefficient. And what we also ask that the density and the conductivity are lower by. Activity are lower bounded by some positive constant, which is denoted by C here. And that the potential here is assumed to be non-negative. And so this result claims essentially that if one if either of the three coefficients is known, then the two other coefficients. Known, then the two other coefficients are known. And this is true provided one of these several assumptions on the other coefficients are satisfied. I will not really comment on these technical assumptions. Actually, I will explain where they come from. So they come from the directly, sorry, they come from this index paper results that we are going to use. And that requires that this type of Requires that this type of condition be satisfied. So, under this condition, we get actually that knowledge of this direct latinum map uniquely determines two out of the three coefficients rho, A or Q. So, this is the first problem that I will investigate. And the second problem is a problem that the bank Is a problem that Bengti referred to, where actually we look at this more or less the same type of problem, but where the order of the fractional derivative depends on the space variable. So it's a variable order. And in this case, the order has to be taken in between 0 and 1. So this is only a sub-diffusive case. And actually, the assumption is that it's stronger than that. It has to be taken. Stronger than that, it has to be strictly between zero and one in the sense that it has to be lower bounded by some positive values, alpha, alpha zero, and upper bounded by some upper bound alpha m, which is strictly smaller than one. And so we define the fractional derivative in the in caputo sense as before, and As before, and we probe the system by a Diracly condition whose form you see is prescribed. So the time-dependent part is just a polynomial. So it's t to the power k, where k is greater than or equal to 2. And there is a space-dependent part, which I will say, I will explain later. I will explain later, it is just sufficiently smooth. And so essentially, what we take here is that we assume that J is in H3 over 2 of the boundary, and in addition to that, it has to be supported in a sub-boundary of the whole boundary. So it is denoted by gamma input as before. And we measure. And we measure the response to the system as before on another sub-part of the boundary, which is gamma output. And so we asked the same question as before. But the only difference here is that the data was that we will consider is not one geo-catuman map computed at an arbitrary time. At an arbitrary time, but here we consider a sequence of such partial derivatives maps computed at a sequence of times. And this sequence has to have an accumulation point in zero t. And so the question to ask is to know whether the knowledge of this sequence of partial reclinal maps uniquely determines maps uniquely determines the unknown coefficient. So now alpha is an unknown function. So alpha, rho, and q. And so the answer is positive provided that essentially gamma in and gamma out satisfied a suitable geometry. A suitable geometric condition. So what is required essentially is that gamma in contains S plus and S plus here is just the shadowed zone when when the domain omega is viewed from an exterior point X zero. Exterior point x0, which is located outside the convex Hull of the closure of the domain. And the second condition is that gamma out contains the unlighted zone when omega is viewed from the same point. So, this is essentially the two geometric conditions that we have, and these conditions actually are imposed by the The calorant problems, inverse problem theory that we are going to use to solve this problem. And so, under this assumption, essentially what we get is that knowledge of all this of this sequence of directly partial equator domain map uniquely determines the three coefficients, so the order, the density. The density and the potential. Okay, I think it's not, I think it's a result. I mean, the result was not published in 2020, but in 2018. So it's a mistake. So this is the case for the three-dimensional case. And since we solve this inverse problem by using Cadillac problems analysis. And you know that the analysis different depending on whether the dimension is two or greater than two. We have the same type of claim, where the dimension is two, but the conditions are a little bit different. So, okay, I won't elaborate on these conditions, but essentially we have the same type of cane in this case, but Claim in this case, but the main difference here is that we can just choose gamma input and gamma output to be arbitrary non-empty open subsets of the boundary. So, this is the main difference with the three-dimensional case. So, just a remark on these problems. So, before I start on the results. On the results. First, just a remark on the models. So, why do we consider these two different models? That is to say, the constant order model and the variable order model. So, according to physicists, the constant order model is used to model anonymous diffusion when the medium of propagation is homogeneous. Is homogeneous. But when this median becomes strongly inhomogeneous, it turns out that variable order models are more relevant. So this is essentially what I learned from this article here. And okay, so this is the reason why physicists actually introduced this different type of model. For the first problem, let me mention that the inverse problem. The inverse problem was that we consider here was solved so in the parallelic case by Canuto and Cavion. So, in the case alpha equal to one. And it was solved for alpha equal to two, so in the hyperbolic case, under the assumption that A and rho are known and equal to one, and by using boundary observations, that is, by assuming. Observations that is by assuming knowledge of the Giriklitz-Neuen map for all times. So it was solved in this case by Bella Sweb, the Shudi, and Yamamoto. And so here I will just talk about the sub-diffusive and super diffusive cases which have been published in this paper here. And for the second problem, it is related. So the result is related to this paper here. Yeah, so let me just explain what how I will actually discuss this problem. So for the first problem, I will just start by introducing the inverse spectral problem or inverse spectral results that we are relying on to solve this problem. And so once I have done that, I will just explain essentially how the data that we have. The data that we have here. So the Dirichlet Man map can be linked to the spectral data that are used to solve this inverse spectral problem that I will present in the first part of my presentation. And time permitting, I will just give an extension of these results, I mean of this. I mean, of this identification result to the case of Riemannian manifolds. And for the second result, essentially, I will just try to explain how we can relate this inverse problem or how we can say recast this inverse problem into a family of Calient problems, and how these Calieron problems actually determine. These Caloron problems actually determine the unknown coefficients here, which are alpha, rho, and Q. So, let's start with the first inverse problem. So, for the inverse spectral results that I want to introduce, essentially this is a Borg Evinsel inverse spectral result. So, I just want to define the self-agent operator that is. So, the elliptic part of the equation. So, we so the space of reference is L2 endowed with the weight function rho here. So, in this weighted space, we just define as usual the operator which is generated by the quadratic form associated to A and Q. To A and Q by this expression with domain, which is since you have a directly boundary condition, so the domain is H10 here. And so we consider this operator, which is, of course, self-adjoint in this weighted space L to O and which acts on its domain exactly as the elliptic part of the The diffusion equation. And so the domain, of course, in this case, as usual, is H10 and the intersection of H10 and H2. And since H10 is compactly embedded into L2O, we know that the spectrum is purely discrete, so we denote by lambda n a non-decreant sequence of the eigenvalues. Sequence of the eigenvalues. And we consider family, so we denote by phi n family of eigenfunct of this operator, which form an orthonormal basis. So in L2 rho. And so that is to say that these functions satisfy this elliptic equation. Of course, they vanish on the boundary and they are nominal in. And they are nominal in L to. And so we define the boundary spectral data as the eigenpairs formed by the eigenvalues lambda n and the normal derivative of these eigenfunctions. And so the results, the result that was proved by Canuto and Cavion claims that knowledge of this boundary spectral data. Knowledge of this boundary spectral data uniquely determines the three coefficients ρ, A, and Q, provided one of the three assumptions of our identification result is satisfied. That is to say that these assumptions essentially claim that one of the that either Uh, that either one of the three coefficients has to be known to determine the two other coefficients, and so this is essentially what we use here. And so, this means that the only thing that we have to do here is to prove that knowledge of the Dirichlet in ON map uniquely determines the boundary spectral data. And to do that, essentially, we will proceed by Uh we will proceed by by uh building uh um by building a representation formula for the solution of the system. And um so this is done essentially by by applying the the the techniques that The technique that was developed in Sakamoto and Yamamoto's paper. So we know from the result essentially that the solution to this problem is continuous in time and L2. And so it is continuous up to zero in this case when it is L2, but we have better results than that. So it is actually in H2. In H2 gamma in space, provided that the time variable does not reach zero. So, and this is true for any gamma in zero, one. And so, if we take gamma to be three or four, for example, here, so you see that this space is h3 over two. So, we can actually perfectly define this. So we can actually perfectly define in this case the directly the partial, sorry, the normal derivative, the solution, that is to say that we can define actually the Diracletum map. And so this is exactly what we can do here. So we get, according to this result, that the Diracletum map can be defined as an operator from As an operator from h in. So, h in is just so the functions that are sufficiently continuous in time with values in h3 over 2 and which are supported here. We assume that they are supported in gamma in times 0 t 0 here. And so this data can be measured in L2 gamma out. And And so once this is done, one can just use spectral theory and then essentially develop the solution on the eigenbasis of in L2 omega. And then, so bearing in mind that u is the solution to the system, we just multiply u by phi n, we integrate over omega. Phi n, we integrate over omega, we integrate by part, and then we see that each Fourier coefficient u n of t here, which is only the scalar product of u of t with phi n, is solution to this ordinary fractional differential equation that we can solve explicitly. So, this is exactly what what is made, exactly what is made. Is made exactly what is made in Yamamoto and Sakamoto's paper. And so we have the expression of this solution, which is given in terms of the metaglefler function. And so this expression is given here. And since it is in H3 over 2 of omega, so by continuity of the trace operator, we can Operator, we can derive from that that the normal derivative of this solution can be expressed in this way, where gamma n, so as I said before, you see, contains the information given by the eigenfunctions, eigenvalues, sorry, here, and the eigenfunctions here. So by just plugging this expression. By just plugging this expression of gamma n into this guy here, so we just get the representation formula of the data, that is to say, of the direct return map. So if we do that, what we get actually is that this direct return map, when f is taken, is h e it can be expressed in. In this way, where this function theta n is just the collection, actually, of the just the collection of these guys here, where here you see we just regroup the expression, these expressions, so these products for each actually eigenvalue because the multiplicity. Because the multiplicity of the eigenvalue is not necessarily equal to one. So this notation now, psi np, this is only the normal derivative of this function phi np, where phi np is just a family of eigenfunctions of the kernel of h associated to the eigenvalue lambda n. And so this is from this formula that actually we can identify Identify so the boundary spectral data, so the lambda n here, and this function psi n here. So to do that, we essentially use a continuation principle for analytic function. So the assumption is that the G-requilton map coincide, so they are equal. Coincide so they are equal, so we know that they are equal so for any x in gamma output and for any function in hd. So, based on the previous expression of this Girl-Gertzmann map, this means that this guy here is equal to zero. And this is equal to zero for all function f which is in h in. And so we can actually express this condition when f is taken. Condition when f is taken in the following form. So the f is obtained as a product of a time-dependent part psi, which is a test function on 0 to 0 here. We take h to be just a function of h3 over 2 of the boundary, and which is supported, of course, of in gamma in order to ensure that. In order to ensure that this function is edging. And by doing that and using that, this is a test function, we just see that, so say the interior, or at least the integrand here, is zero, which means that this guy is equal to this one. So this is the integral here for any s. For any s zero to zero and for any x in gamma out and um just so now but by you by using uh by using uh um the fact that this function f is analytic, say in s, we can actually extend this result to any uh to any function to any uh time t in zero plus infinity, which Infinity, which in turn allows us to take the Fourier transform of this function. And from that, actually, we can actually prove that the eigenfunctions coincide and that this function theta one n is equal to the theta one two. To the theta one two and now by using the assumption of gamma in and gamma out, essentially that the intersection is non-empty and that the union is the world boundary. We can with what we get from that actually is that the boundary spectral data coincide. So, this is how we actually relate. So this is how we actually relate the directly to the man map information to the boundary spectral data information. And the conclusion now follows from the inverse spectral results that I have introduced before. So this is essentially the sketch of a proof for the first result. So So let's jump briefly to the case of Riemannian manifolds. So we can consider the same type of equation, but for a Riemannian manifold. But now in this case, so the electric part of the equation is a weighted Laplace Beltrami operator. Laplace Beltrami operator with so there is a weight, the weight now is denoted by mu here. So G here is the metric and there is potential here, Q. And so same equation as before and we defined we define the And we define the partial Diricleton map in the same way as before by selecting Dirichlet data, which are sufficiently regular in space and in time and supported in gamma in time 0 to 0 as before. So we define the directly to main map for this problem in the same way as before. And we ask the same type of question. And we ask the same type of question that is to know whether knowledge of this partial equipment map uniquely determines the geometry, that is the manifold and the metric and the weight and the potential. And well, in this case, we know. Well, in this case, we know that there is not only one, but two obstructions to uniqueness in this problem. So, the first uniqueness is uniqueness for the weight and the potential. So, we say that two pairs of weight and potential, we know that they are gauge equivalent. If there is a positive function, kappa, which is smooth, which is equal to Which is equal to one on the boundary, and whose normal derivative of the boundary is zero, such that these two pairs of coefficients are related by these identities. And in this case, we know that the Reclaim-Neumann maps are invariant for the two sets of coefficients. For the two sets of coefficients. So, the second type of obstruction that we have is when we apply actually a diffromorphism which fixes the boundary, then we know that in this case, the direct Platon map is invariant as well. So, we need to consider this inverse problem. We need to consider this inverse problem up to these two obstructions to uniqueness. And in this case, we do that. The result that we obtain is similar to the one that we have previously. That is to say that essentially, under suitable assumptions on gamma in and gamma out, what we get essentially is that we can actually recover the The say the geometry in the sense that the two geometries are say isometric, and we can actually recover the weight and the potential up to the Gaussian equivalence that was described before. So the proof for this result is quite similar to the one To the one in, say, the flat case. The only difference here is that instead of using inverse spectral results, say in the flat case here, we use an inverse spectral result that is really similar to the one of Canuto and Cavion, but so in and And which was proved by Kachelev, Kuilev, and Lassas. So, this is essentially the same idea, but just by using a different tool. So, the last thing that I want to do, and I have only, I think, two slides, is just to justify briefly how one can actually obtain the identification result for the second problem. So the first thing to do is to remember the assumptions. The assumption that we have here is that we have two different sets of coefficients. So now I remind you that the known coefficients are the order alpha. So the density and the potential. And so we know that the direct return map associated to these two sets of coefficients. map associated to these two sets of coefficients, they coincide for a sequence of times Tn which translates into this identity here. So this identity holds for on gamma out and essentially what we use here to what we use here to What we use here to extend this identity to all times is the results that I have written here in blue that claim actually that the solution to this problem when G, I remind you that G is just the space moving time of the Dirichlet condition here. So if G is sufficiently smooth, actually what we have, so basically What we have so basically H3 over 2 of the boundary here, the solution to this problem is analytic in time and with values in H2. And so from that and from the assumption that Tn, so the sequence of times Tn as an accumulation point in 0, 2, we get easily that actually This identity on the T-Weldermann maps extend for all positive times. So this is the first thing. And second thing, once you have done that, is to just recast the problem into a Calderon problem or actually a family of Calderon problems. And to do that, we apply the Laplace transform. Laplace transform to the solution on the solution. And so the identity of this Diracleton map, when we apply the Laplace transform, just tells us that now we have identity of, say, here, the normal derivative of the Laplace transform with respect to the time variable of the solution, which is denoted by capital. Solution, which is denoted by capital U J here. So this identity holds here for all parameter, all real and positive parameters S. And from that, actually, and from the fact that this function UGA multiply. This function uj multiplied by this term here, we can easily check that it satisfies this elliptic system with a directly boundary condition, which is actually this condition where G is the space-dependent part of the Dirichlet condition of the initial system and where the potential here. And where the potential here, the potential actually contains the information on the unknown coefficients. So the potential B and this J here is defined as follows. And so from this identity, double star identity here, we just obtained that using classical Calderan results. Calderon results. So again, this result depends on the dimension, as I said in the introduction of the result. So in the case t equal to 2 or t equal to 3, we have to assume different assumptions. But this is the reason why you have different assumptions and two different actually statements for this result. But provided that we We use the right assumptions. So, the Caleron inverse theory tells us that these two potentials coincide for all coefficients or positive coefficients S. So the end of the proof now is easy. You have only to choose S suitably in order to identify all coefficients. So, typically, if we send S. Typically, if we send s to zero in this expression, we get that the electric potentials coincide, and from that, using s equal to one, we get that the density coefficient coincide, and so on. So, this is essentially how we solve this problem. So, these results, so the two results that I've presented here are only a step uniqueness result and Result and there is no stability result, actually, as far as I know, no stability result for at least by using this approach. And moreover, if you look at the approach that we have used in the first problem, which works in the fractional case and which And which works in the parabolic case as well, it turns out that we are not able to extend it to the hyperbolic case. So there are strong limitations to this method, but the strongest one is, I think, the stability. For now, there is only a uniqueness result and no stability results. So I think I have, yeah, I am right on. I am right on time, I guess. So I thank you for your attention.
