So we are considering an uh institutional investor, so for example a pension fund that wants to buy a large position and one way to do that, and that's what we can do in practice, is that the pension funds calls the dealer and they are free on a block trade after the market closes. So let's assume, just to make things concrete. Assume, just to make things concrete, that the pension fund would like to buy one million shares of Microsoft. So, what they are doing is they make an arrangement or agreement with the dealer, and the dealer will deliver the block trade at the end of the trading day. Now, the period here is just to make things concrete. Of course, it could also be over several days or another period, but the point being is. But the point being that the dealer probably doesn't have the 1 million shares right away, so that's why they will acquire these shares on the market. And again, in this example, this will be during the trading day. And then at the end of the day, they will deliver these shares to the pension fund. Now, the question that the most interested question that we're most interested in is how should they agree on the price of the block trade. So the agreement happens at the beginning of the day and the actual block trade occurs at the end of the day. So the question is how should they decide at the beginning of the day on the price at the end of the day? And what we are seeing in practice are some arrangements, common arrangements are market closure price, which means you Market close price, which means just taking the price when the market closes, or time-weighted average price, which means taking the average over the trading day in that case. Now, the question that we are interested in is, are these common arrangements optimal? And if they are not optimal, how could they be improved? Now, Now, to phrase this in a contracting setting, we consider the client, so that is the attention zone from before, and assume that they are risk neutral and they choose a contract, which we denote by tau. Now, here, and as opposed to probably most parts in this workshop, we are considering a discrete tau model, so we are assuming that. Time model. So we're assuming that there are T training periods and the prices are 1, T, T, T, and that contract can be a function of the prices that occur in these trade periods. And then we also have a risk averse dealer. And the dealer selects the trades that occur in this period here. So here is the trading happening. Here, so here is the trading happening, and these were the trades that they are selecting. Now, the payoffs is what you probably expect. So, the client will pay the dealer the amount, which is the negative of that tau, and the dealer will get the payment from the client. And on the other hand, they will need to They will need to acquire the shares on the market. So we have here the product of this strategy and the prices, which gives the total price that the deal pays on the market. And they are risk reversive, assuming that they have a utility function. And that is then their payoff. Now, the hidden action, which leads you to a moral hazard issue, is that the client cannot directly observe. Client cannot directly observe the X, and that is quite common because the client doesn't see directly what the dealer is trading, but what they can see is the prices on the market, and the prices on the market will depend on the dealer strategy, because we assume that the order is quite large, so it will have a price impact. Now, the question that you're looking at. Now the question that you're looking at is what optimal contract should be used in such a framework. Okay, now this is sort of in the relation of sort of financial markets and contracting, and there is a large literature, sort of a related literature, in particular contracting in financial settings, although the focus. Settings, although the focus has been mostly on portfolio management, and you see there are some references as well as asset management, so the management of a risky investment. Now, it also leads to the classical literature on contracting, because we're looking at the contracting framework, and what we will do later is taking the continuous time limit. The continuous time limit is, of course, also well studied. And then it has essentially execution problems, so it leads to question related to optimal execution. Now a little bit a different area is dual trading, and I will get back to that later. And that means that the dealer could also trade sort of on their own book, and we would actually like to exclude this, and I will get back to that point later. That point later. Now, let me explain in more detail the model that we're looking at, and then afterwards we'll come to the result of the question. Now, in the contracting terms, we have the client, and that is the principal. And what we're doing just to make s things uh simple is we assume it's just one share, of course. Assume it's just one share, of course, just the multiplier thing. She wants to buy one share and she's always neutral. I mean, then we have the dealer, and that is in the contract language the agent. Now we assume that they have an exponential neutral function. And what the relationship is from before, so we had this off-market block trade after the trade. Market block trade after the trading happened, and that's between the client and the dealer, as well as the trading on the market, and that is done by the dealer. So we can see that this is a framework with the dealer intermediates between the client and the market. Now we need a model for price dynamics, and what you're assuming here is sort of a very economical model. Very canonical model that has been used a lot at the beginning of the sort of optimal execution framework. So we're assuming that this fita model where we have initial price P0, then we have a temporary price impact. So that is the gamma-scale of that, and we see the XT, which is then the Divos period T volume, as well. T volume as well as the permanent price impact, that's here the theta coefficients. And then we have some price shocks and we keep that again both very classical and simple, which means we assume that they are just IID normal and will have mean zero and that will have some importance later. So if we don't have So if we don't have any market impact, then that will be sort of behave like a market deal, but that's what will play a role later. Now the trading strategies are again probably what you would expect, except that with an additional condition, so the well the strategy XT will Xt will be predictable in the sense that they will just depend on the history up to that time. So this will be up to time t minus 1. Then what we can see is we can consider this as a problem where the dealer chooses this X and in a way, and that is now the important point here, is in a way such that it is equal to 1. And what are we making that? To one. And why are we making that assumption? Well, the one corresponds to the one share that the dealer needs to deliver to the client. And now we assume that they are sort of exactly buying the same amount on the market as they need to deliver. And the reason is that you really want to focus on that relationship and you want to exclude the situation where the dealer also trades for, for example. Directs a lot of for its own benefit and has other has an inventory. So we exclude that, and that's why we have just the one at the end of the day. And that is in the set of our training strategies. Now we are looking at the client's problem and we are phrasing this in the language of contract theory. So what the client does, they are minimizing They are minimizing her expected payoff, so that is the expectation of tau. And now there are some constraints, so we have equationality, and that says, well, the X, that's the strategy of the dealer, so the client cannot just choose that, but it needs to satisfy these conditions. It needs to be easily irrational, which means that on this left-hand side, This left-hand side, you see that's the payoff of the dealer under the strategy X and contract how. And what that just says is that they are at least as good as sort of without doing anything. And the other is incentive compatibility, and that says if the BODS to strategy X hat, then they Then they are not better off than on the string GX. So these are the two conditions, the classic conditions just raised in our setup. The expectation under the acne in particular, the prices depend on Depend on X because there's a market impact. So, what will happen is you need to consider here sort of a different price process if the dealer chooses a different strategy. The payment depends on the target story of the price. Yes, that's right. So, the payment is the time. The tau is a function of p, but it cannot be a function of x directly. So it can only depend on x vr, vr p. Do you assume that the x is chosen sequentially or do you assume that everything is solved at point zero? No, we assume it's sort of dynamic. It's chosen sequentially. However, we will see it doesn't matter in the object. It doesn't matter in the optimum because, in the optimal, it will be a sort of stated strategy. But you allow the x to be chosen sequentially. Now, what we do, though, is we impose a restriction on the sets of visible contracts, and that is both productability and realism. So, it is that we are looking at weighted average. Weighted averages of the market prices. So we take this vector t and assume that then the tau is sort of the weights, which is a vector, tau1 to tau t and the vector sums up to, the element sums up to 1, and that gives us then the payoff. So we assume that, and that is both for making things easy tractable, but also Is it tractable but also realistic because we want to have in the end sort of a realistic contract that we get? And the examples that I mentioned at the beginning, they fall exactly in that setup. So we have the key BOP contract, which is equal weight, or we have Markman Clause contract, which is put all the way at the end of the period. Okay, now I would like to Now, what I would like to do first is, as a starting point, is looking at the first best problem, which means we are looking at what would be the best strategy directly by solving the problem that the client faces if they could determine the strategy, and that is just the minimization of that expectation. And the point is, this is a very classical optimal execution problem. Classical optimal execution problem going back to the origin of these problems. And the solution is, again, sort of a T-WAP strategy. So you just put equal weights on each period. And why is that? Well, simply because you like to minimize the market impact, and you minimize that by just equally drilling. And that goes for both a temporary and permanent market impact. Marketing tab. Okay, but this is of course not the problem we actually want to solve. Now, what we would like to do is to look at the problem when the dealer decides this, but first we would like to look at the problem without the incentive compatibility constraint. And what you would still have is that the contract The contract and the strategy, in such assumptions, they are actually again the same at the RT bar. And why is that the case? Well, first of all, it's the efficient action, as we have to see before from the first best solution. And then the other aspect to this is that if we look at what the dealer gets, sort of the dealer's revenues from the contract, well, if they are the same as Are the same as the X, then what happens is that in each scenario the dealer actually gets zero payoff. So that means that the in real rationality constraint is binding and that means that the dealer is sort of no surplus. In other words, we're making here sort of the pie as big as possible and give everything to the client. And that must be the And that must be the optimal strategy in this case. But now that is just without the incentive content constraint. Now, if we include this, what will happen is that this is no longer optimal. And the reason for that is as follows. Well, the dealer will actually have an incentive to deviate from that strategy, and why is that the case? Well, Is that the case? Well, the dealer would like to keep his costs as small as possible, which means that they will put more weight on the early prices compared to the later prices, and that has to do with the permanent price impact. Because generally, the early prices will be lower than the later prices, just because there's a permanent price impact, and the other thing is that there is no drift from the from the stock price shocks. So it will only be the drift will only be determined by the market impact and because the early prices are sort of lower than the later in expectation, they will be putting more weight on that. So that's why they will front load the strategy. But at the same time, now what will happen is that it will take some risk because if they deviate from Deviate from the weights in the contract, they will incur some risk. However, one can show that this will be sort of a second order deviation, whereas the increase in the expected profit is first order. So, what will be the case is that under small deviation, it's beneficial for the dealer to deviate from this. This from the equal weighted strategy, and therefore that won't be anymore the optimal strategy if the IC constraint must be satisfied. So, therefore, that will not be the optimal strategy for the second best problem. Now, what we are doing is we solve that problem. And first of all, we look at the IR constraint and The IR constraint, and what we can note here is actually this becomes quite simple because for any strategy, for any contract tau, the dealer can just select in general a corresponding strategy, which is the X. And both of these have sort of the constraint that the elements need to sum up to one, sort of that is consistent. And when they are choosing, they start. And when they are choosing the strategy equal to the weights in the contract, they will just get zero payoff, so that will always be satisfied. Therefore, we can just focus on the IC constraint. And for that, well, okay, this is some doing some math, but what we can show is that for a given tau, the corresponding x Corresponding x will be something, some matrix multiplied by tau. And now the point here is that this is all explicit. Of course, it's a bit complicated writing it down, but it's all explicit. You're restricting to a linear problem. That's right. Yes, exactly. And what you can also see is that this will be the X will be sort of stated in this setup. This setup, and that gives us the relation between the strategy and the tau that the client chooses. So then, if we go one step further, we solve that problem where we minimize the expected payoff of the client, subject now to the IC constraint, which we have already Which we have rewritten in this form. And well, this will just lead us really essential to a project normalization problem. And well, we just need to do some matrix multiplication and stuff like that. And we can find it explicitly that this thing given that tau star is given here a matrix M and that matrix M of course depends on all the parameters in the model and what you didn't do What we then do is essentially solving this optimization problem, and we also need to ensure that tau star is sort of normalized because the weights need to sum up to one, and that's why here we sort of divide it by this star. So that gives us the optimal strategy in this framework, and it also gives us the weights of Of the contract. Now, what I would like to do in the remaining time is looking at several special cases because they will give us a lot about the economic intuition behind the solution. Because, in general, I mean, we have the solution, but it's difficult to give a good interpretation just because it's It's a complicated formula. So, what we will do is looking at the limiting cases, and there we see all the important underlying economic drivers. And then we will also look at some general results and at the end of the continuous time limit. Sorry, quick question. The parameters that affect the solution, is this something that you can estimate or that's publicly known? Publicly known? Or is it like more of a theoretical construct? So, well, these can be, well, there are different parameters. I mean, the parameters for market impact can be and are estimated in the literature. And well, the parameter for risk aversion, that really depends then on the preferences of the dealer. But we can also make some assumptions based on parameters in the literature. If the dealer is If the dealer is risk neutral, does it probably become trivial? Do you just say that? Well, it's not becomes not trivial, but I mean there are different optimal contracts in that case. But yeah, we'll come back to the different sort of dependent structures shortly. Okay, so first case is where I just would like to look at the permanent price impact. And now in this case, well we assume that we have permanent price impact and we assume that there's no temporary price impact, this one, and there is risk control. Travel. That is one special case. And you can see the optimal contract is then sort of equal weights on the first and last period, whereas the strategy has sort of what we call front-loaded, so half of it is in the first period and the rest is equally distributed. Now, what is the intuition behind this result? Well, it is what This is all? Well, it is what we call the front-loading motif. So that is again related to this to the dealer's profit, which is, as we've seen before, revenue minus cost. Now, just in general, for any tau, well, the dealer can always get zero profit by just choosing that's choosing the exit to tau, that's what we have seen before. But now, Seen before, but now how can they do better? Well, they can do better if they put more weights on periods with low expected prices. And because here we have the setup with a permanent price impact, for the same reason as before, it's now beneficial to put more weight on the earlier prices. So that's what the dealer does in general for any cow. Now the question is: how does Now the question is how does the client take that into consideration? Well so first of all that's her payment. Now if prices wouldn't depend on tau then what she would do is wait the wait give more weights on the peers with low expected prices. Pricers, so that would again be a weight sort of head weight at the beginning. That's one reason why we have here this one half. Now, on the other hand, we have a smoothing objective in the sense that the client also puts a half weight on the last period, so to give an incentive for the dealer to. Incentive for the dealer to smoothen his trades over the whole period, and that means then this one half because the customer front slows that will then mean that this will be smoothed out over different periods. So that is the case of federal price impact. Now if we look at the temporary price impact, The temporary price impact. And in this case, we assume that the current price impact is zero, and again, risk neutrality. What we have is a T-Walk strategy is optimal and also the contract is of T-Walk performing. Now, the reason for that is the smoothing motive of the dealer. So, in this case, what we then have to What we then have is that the payments are sort of the same form, but now what they want to do is again putting more weights on the prices that have low expected values. And in this case, what will be is just the ones that have sort of low XT or tau t that because that sort of Because that's sort of to reduce the temporary price impact. And if you look at what then the client does is, well, they are then in line with this because if they now choose the X with the TWOP strategy as a contract, then that will incentivise the dealer to exactly use this strategy and To use this strategy, and that means the client gets her first payoff in that case. Okay, and the last situation here is the risk aversion. And in this case, we just look at the limit of the point infinity. And what we will get is the same result as before, but the uh arguments are a bit different. And the difference is mainly because now we have what we call the mirroring of the Have what we call the mirroring of that because the dealer is very risk averse. What they would like to do is to reduce the risk, which means, well, to reduce the risk with this payoff, and they're choosing the x, which should just not deviate from the tau, so they're choosing that the x equal to tau, and that will be the best strategy if they are very risk averse. And well, if the healer just chooses the X equal to Tau, then the client will choose the T1 contract because that will give her the first best payoff and lead to the efficient action. So these are the limiting cases. Now I just wanted to show this. I just wanted to show this three-class illustration. So, here we see the left the contract weights and on the right the training strategy for different coefficients of temporary price impact. So, if we have no temporary price impact, then it's very much U-shaped and the trading strategy is front-loaded. As we have more and more temporary price impact, it will happen as the What will happen is the optimal context weight will become smoother and the strategy will be less front weighted. Similar story here for the risk aversion. We have for low risk aversion we have it more U-shaped. As we increase risk aversion we will get that the optimal weights will then be smoother and then And uh and then in the end for independent version there will be a constant. And what we can also note that the these weights, if you just go back to this, so we can see here it's always symmetric, and that is actually general results of these weights are always uh symmetric. And uh then what we just have done by numerical uh Just have done by numerical experiments, it's U-shaped, and we observe that it is front-loaded. And we also see that the severity of the U-shaped and the front-loading is increasing with tau, decreasing with gamma and lambda. Okay, now the last part I would like to talk about. I would like to talk about the continuous time limit. And for technical reasons, we are seeing now that the theory is strictly historic. And we take sequence of execution horizons t k that go to infinity. Now at the same time we need to choose the variance in a way that is close to zero so that Goes to zero so that the product goes to a finite number. And I mean, that's the same thing as if you consider sort of convergence of the binomial model. So you would also want then that the risk, the overall risk, remains finite. So that's what you're doing here. And then what this says is that you're looking at Q, which is sort of corresponding. Q, which is sort of corresponds to the fraction of time if you consider this over continuous time, so it's normalized from zero to one, then we have that the optimal weight in the contract and the gradient strategy, they both converge to something which is very simple. So what we have is I'll just show it on the slide. So this will have here a chunk at zero and a chump at one. At zero and let's jump at one. And in between, zero and one, this will just be linear. And the coefficient is A. So it's a linear function Q, but it has here an alpha function. And the coefficient here is A. The same thing holds for the Optimus strategy with the difference that the chunks at 0 and 1 are different. Now, what is this A here? That's a coefficient. This A here, that's a coefficient, and that coefficient depends on the model parameters, in particular on the theta, lambda, and the sigma, but it does not depend on the gamma, on the coefficient of temporal price impact that we will see shortly where that enters. So, let me illustrate this. So, this looks So this looks quite simple. So it has a jump at zero, jump at one, and will be fine in between. The slope is given by this coefficient A. These are the optimal accumulated contracts rates. Now, if you look at this very closely, it's actually a bit more complicated because what's happening is that it will have a Have a series of chunks, both zero and at the end, and the way this is given depends on the gamma, so the temperature price impact. Now, these are sort of steps. This is an infinite series, and it's actually a form of a geometric series. But what's happening is that if you take the limited continuous time, then this. Linear in continuous time, then this whole thing will sort of converge to zero because they are just discrete steps. And all this goes at a faster speed than what's happening in between. So you will have this whole thing sort of converges at zero and the other thing converges at one. So that's why then in the limit you will only have the jumps at zero and one, but the type of convergence depends here on Depends here on the gamma, and that is different from in between where it sort of smoothly converges. Now we have an initial weight and why is that the case? Well, that is because if prices were not dependent on time, Prices were not dependent on time, then the client would wait the period with the lowest expected prices. So that's why, under permanent price impact, she will put weight on the initial prices. And the sort of similar story, but in going the opposite direction, is for the terminal where the client wants to give an incentive to the dealer. To give an incentive to the dealer to smoothen his trades. So she will put weight at the end, and that will then go together with the dealer's front load emotive. And that means then it will smoothen the trade-in. And that's why we have both initial weight and a terminal weight in this setup. So let me summarize the Summarize our findings. So, we looked at this contracting framework and what we're looking in more detail is for the client, is a contracting dealer. The dealer uses hedging during the trading period to hedge the payment and the delivery of the shares after the trading period. But if you compare our Our contract to what we see in the market, for example, compared to the TWAP contracts, then well, this is similar in the sense we have weights with a constant density at least in the limit. But the difference is that we also put weights, not discrete weights, we put discrete weights at the beginning and the end of the weight. Beginning and the end of the trading period, so to improve the client's pay-off. And on the other hand, marginal closed contracts, there we can improve them by putting the weights more during the period and smoothing them as well as the initial weight at the beginning. And if you compare this, this makes actually quite a big difference in terms of Of payment that the client on expectation will need to deliver to the dealer in such a setup. So let me conclude by this photo taken yesterday. So thank you very much for your attention. Questions? Could you explain again the essential compatibility condition? I think it's a good idea. Okay, so the idea is the following. The left-hand side is what the dealer gets if the dealer uses strategy. Dealer uses strategy X and gets the contract tau from the client. Now, on the other hand, what the dealer could do is choose a different strategy, which we denote is like X hat, and then the contract here is I mean the as a function is the same that they're getting, but the the the dealer devi deviates by using X head strategy. By using X hat strategy instead of X. And what this just says is that the dealer will not get a higher expected utility when he uses X hat as opposed to using X. Another problem. You mean if you give me a contract 2 and I compute the maximum over X of this uh what is X? x of u total q minus x of u right well yeah it is you give me it's a stack of the end so if you give me tow I can compute my best in my and anticipating this you choose your best uh exactly and that is exactly how we solve the problem right that is the idea of of what we did then here right Then here, right, we are solving exactly that problem. So if if you have a contact child, then I compute what you would do, and then afterwards we solve our problem based on that information. I'm not sure I understand, but can you expand a little bit about the commitment assumption that you're making to SALT? Is there a commitment assumption or not? So the reason I ask this question is. The reason I ask this question is because if he allowed the dealer to re-optimize kind of the trading strategy at midday, for example, that would be the same one as he decided at the beginning of time if the x is constant, if the vector of x is constant. But if the vector of x is not constant, then if you allow the dealer to re-optimize, he will not choose Strategy that was. So that's why I thought that maybe you assume that there is commitment at times here. I may be wrong, but it's slower. No, but I guess what happens here is probably explain that we assume that these weights they are deterministic of the tau. So the tau has deterministic The taus is a vector, a deterministic vector. So that's why it will only be the payment, will just be a linear function of the prices. And it just appears that it's not optimal to lose in this model dynamic strategy in the end. So the. But there was one optimal strategy that was not constant. Can you give us one example where X star is not constant over time? Well, no, I mean, it is. Well, no, I mean it is it is not constant in the sense it's not always the same over each peer, but it isn't it's not uh it's not stochastic. So it's not the dealer does not choose a strategy which depends on the randomness that he observes from the stock price calculations. That's not the case. So but what is the case is that the strategy uh will not always have the same rates for the different uh periods uh and and quite generally. So in this quite generally. So this the result is not it's not that uh it's not always a key walk, it's actually uh part of the main result, but it's not it actually deviates from uh from the key walk. But it is a deterministic strategy. I've just related to this question, I think maybe to clarify a little bit. Can you actually solve the problem where the dealer has some original holdings in the asset already? Already? Suppose that he already has some supply of the asset in his book after, say, one period. Then you redo your problem. Well, I mean, we could rephrase that problem, yeah. But I mean, this is like the legalist in endowment, essentially. And yeah, we could just. Where in the first period the dealer front load divides a little bit more, right? And then afterwards, it does flats. Now, imagine he's done that first thing in the first period and I re-optimize at the end of that first period. And so now, is he going to be again flat constant for the rest? Or is he going to front load again on that first period that is really the second? Yeah, that's good questions. Because if if that's so, then it's time equals to the other. Thank you. One question, one comment. So I thought it was interesting that when you have high risk aversion, then you converge to the first best type of policy. Because in the standard principal agent problem, the more risk average the agent is, usually the more you deviate from the optimal amount of effort. While here is exactly the opposite, where I want to get the optimal as well. So I don't, I just say it's interesting, but it's probably worth thinking more about it. What about it? And then the second thing, can you show the first test again? The first test is the key wallet. That's how you... How do you pay the agent? You make him a promise, right, at time zero, so the person has is very no risk whatsoever, right? I guess what is Taufers first, not expert but that came. Well, I mean yeah in that case uh well it would be sort of the the same, right? Car index uh the same because then you just pay the uh you pay the dealer exactly that same amount so you don't have uh zero payoff from the CT. Okay, uh we can leave any remaining discussion for the break. Uh thank you again, Chris.
