Analog quantum simulation of strongly coupled field theories. So over to you, Chris. Okay, thank you very much. And I would like to thank the organizers for having me here. I'm an experimentalist working on superconducting quantum circuits. So a lot of the talks are far from my everyday life, but it's always fun to come and listen to these things and get new ideas for interesting things to do. And I'll try to present. And I'll try to present some of our work that I think most closely connects, and it's exactly this: this analog quantum simulation with the goal of getting towards strongly coupled field theories. So since it's not really a quantum computing audience, let me start by kind of defining some of my terms. So first, what do I mean by analog simulation? So it's not a fully, it doesn't, there's a classical background to it. So here's an image of a desktop computer from the Desktop computer from the 60s, which was actually an analog computer for analog simulation. So, this is the brochure. And you know, what this was is it's really a bunch of op amps, so like adders and integrators that you program with patch cords, you know, connecting them together. And you have a bunch of potentiometers over here, so you can program time constants and things like that by setting the knobs. And then, you know, and the, you know, you can see they're selling it for aerospace. See, they're selling it for aerospace, for aircraft design, for biomedical applications, for chemical engineering. So, a lot of the same things that we're talking about today for quantum computers. And what was the basic idea of analog simulation that you're doing here? And so, the basic idea is that what I'm doing is building an electrical circuit in a programmable way that has the same differential equations or equations of motion of a system of interest. And then I simulate the system by just letting the circuit. I simulate the system by just letting the circuit run and measuring the time evolution. And again, this for decades was a standard tool before digital computers became very powerful and ubiquitous. So what is analog quantum simulations? So it's the same basic idea, but now I'm going to build a quantum device and it can be many different types of things. It can be atoms or photons. Here it's going to be, for me, it's going to be a superconducting quantum circuit. Conducting quantum circuit. But we're going to build a quantum device with the same now Heisenberg equations of motion or the same Hamiltonian of a system of interest and measure its time evolution. So, I mean, people are doing quantum simulations for many things, but in my group, we've been focusing on field theories, which we can think of as being both fundamental and for technology. So, you know, quantum field theories are, as everyone here, I'm sure, knows, are used for our. Are used for our descriptions of fundamental forces, but they're also our language in condensed matter physics, right? So it's also how we can describe quantum materials and things like high temperature superconductivity. And in the fundamental side, things like quantum electrodynamics or quantum chromodynamics or gravity. And so why strongly coupled field theories in particular? Well, because these are the ones that are hardest for us to solve. The ones that are hardest for us to solve, other ways, right? So we have, you know, perturbation theory doesn't work when it's strongly coupled. And then also, there are powerful numerical techniques for these things. So for instance, lattice QCD for quantum chromodynamics, but it doesn't work. Some of these numerical techniques don't work for important problems. And some of these, you know, what are some of these intractable problems? So for instance, there's a large class of problems that fail due to something called the sign problem. Something called the sign problem, which just really means that the numerical methods break. And not that I need a bigger computer to make them work, they just don't work anymore. And these can be things where I'm studying, for instance, the dynamics of systems, so trying to study dynamics in QCD, but also situations where I have topological models tend to break these numerical methods. And these can be topological models in matter, but also fundamental topological models. Topological models that, for instance, explain the asymmetry between matter and antimatter. So, yeah, very important problems that we're interested in. And the question is maybe that quantum simulations can be the way forward, because for some of these problems, you're just never going to have a classical computer that's big enough. So, there are many different ways of doing quantum simulation. So, we just heard about some different ways. The way generically, or the generic Generically, or the generic kind of method that I'm going to talk about is something I call a photonic lattice. Here's just a random selection of a few papers on photonic lattices. There are many, many. And the basic idea of a photonic lattice, here's kind of a little picture is I have some system that I can make a node. So this could be an optical resonator. For me, it's going to be microwave resonators or modes in a microwave resonator. It could be many different things, but I have nodes and then I have. Different things, but I have nodes and then I have some graph of connections between these nodes that depend on the model that I'm simulating. And then the idea is that I can, you know, put excitations in here and I watch how they move around. And that's my quantum simulation. And, you know, connected to field theories, the idea is that I can imagine taking a continuous field theory like quantum chromodynamics and then discretizing it onto a lattice. And so then I can do a lattice simulation of a field theory. Now, I'll make a point. Now, I'll make a point. I mean, there are many, many physical implementations of photonic lattices. And one interesting class of ones is when I have a method for adding, making these hopping terms, so the interactions that connect my nodes, complex or adding a phase to my hopping terms. And so, for instance, proposed in this paper, if I can make the right pattern of phases for my hopping terms, when my When my photon or excitation moves through the system, it picks up a path-dependent phase. And if I make this pattern of phases in the right way, I could imagine that that phase comes from the line integral of a fictitious gauge field. And so in that way, then I can add, you know, I can think of my photon moving around as interacting with the gauge field. And so I can do, for instance, now simulate, I'm all using. Now simulate, I'm all using photons, but I can simulate matter interacting with some kind of gauge field. So these phases give us a path towards simulating gauge field, but they also give us a path towards topological and chiral dynamics, which are also interesting in these models, as I've pointed out. So now to go in, that's kind of a general setup, but now to go into a little bit more detail of specifically what I work on, I'm going to talk about our platform, which I call a programmable. Platform which I call a programmable photonic lattice, and then we're using it, implementing it with a superconducting parametric cavity. So, I won't go into any great detail, but what is a parametric cavity? I mean, so this is our cartoon. So, it's a superconducting microwave cavity. So, our photons are actually microwave photons, and we're operating at very ultra-low temperatures, like 20 millikelvin. So, it's just a bit of a superconducting transmission line. And on one end, we cut it. And on one end, we cut it to make an open circuit boundary condition, but we also have a weak kind of coupling here, so we can take signals in and out. And then on the other end, we terminate it with a superconducting device called a SQUID, which is two Josephson junctions in parallel. And I'll talk about this in a little bit more detail, but basically it gives us another boundary condition on our cavity that we can tune. So we can tune essentially like the inductance of this squid by putting a magnetic field through this loop. And we can do that with another. And we can do that with another microwave transmission line. And importantly, we can modulate this boundary condition at very high frequency, so, up to say like 20 gigahertz or something like that. So, this gives us the ability to do very fast modulation of the frequency of this microwave cavity. Now, for these simulations, a slightly kind of different thing that we do is that we make this cavity very long, which means that its fundamental frequency is very low. And then the density of modes here is relatively high. Is relatively high. And by that, I mean a few hundred megahertz, let's say we've done in some devices. And what that means is that now we get several resonant modes, so several modes of this cavity that show up in our measurement band. And what I'll kind of explain in more detail as I go along, the idea now is that these cavity modes are going to become the nodes of our photonic lattice. And when we lay out our lattice, it's not going to be laid out in, we can call it a synthetic. Be laid out in, we can call it a synthetic dimension. So I'm not making a lattice laid out, you know, physically, you know, on a chip in space. I have these nodes and I'm going to connect them. And then it's just the graph of these connections will define the shape of my lattice. And the parametric part comes, as I'll explain in more detail, from by choosing certain pump frequencies here, we can connect different terms. So this is what one of these devices looks like. What one of these devices looks like in practice, just to show you. So, this is a micrograph of one of these things. This is the long cavity which goes off and meanders around. We have a webbed ground plane for our transmission line that just traps stray flux. This is where the squid is at the end of our line, so we can zoom in. This is the squid loop. You can barely make out the Josephson junctions here, and this is the fast line that brings in the modulation. And we can see this is just measuring the tuning of some of these modes. So, we get several modes. Of these modes, so we get several modes and we can tune them with an external flux and also the fast tuning. So, how does the fast tuning work? Excuse me. So, here I write down the full Hamiltonian for our squid. So, it's kind of a highly nonlinear device. So, we have some energy scale, the Josephson energy, and then I have a cosine of the pump flux. So, this is where I'm saying I'm putting in some magnetic. I'm putting in some coupling in a flux to tune the squid with my pump. So that goes here. And then this side, I also have the cosine of, I call it the cavity flux. So we do this funny thing in superconducting quantum circuits that we work with the charge and then the flux, which is actually the integral of the voltage. So this is just integral of voltage, but that has units of flux, if I put the right constants. So I have the pump flux and I have the cavity flux. The cavity flux, which is also the sum of all the different modes. And I can just expand this to kind of lowest non-trivial order, right? And then I also make a parametric approximation for the pump. So the pump is no longer a quantum. It's just a coherent state, a classical field. But then I have now the create, I can kind of expand, I take the second order expansion here, and I rewrite my fluxes now as creation annihilation operators. So you can say I get all of the sum of all these creation. You can say I get all of the sum of all these creation annihilation operators for my different modes. Here, I assume three squared. And you can see when I do the square, I get all kinds of different interactions, right? So I get all the modes interacting in different ways. But in some interact, in an interaction picture, all of those different terms will have a particular time dependence. And because of that, by then matching the pump frequency here to the time dependence of a particular term, by Term, by then making a rotating wave approximation, I can pick out particular interaction terms. So I can pick out which interactions I want to turn on by picking my pump frequency. And this gives me my programmability ultimately. So for instance, if I pick a pump frequency, which is the sum of two modes, I pick out a Hamiltonian that looks like this, where you can see I kind of create or destroy pairs of photons in a mode. And it can be You know, in a mode. And it can be the same mode or two different modes. And if you know that, you could recognize this as a parametric down conversion Hamiltonian. Or if I pump at the difference frequency of two modes, you know, instead I pick out terms that look like this, where I swap photons between modes. So we call this a beam splitter coupling or a coherent coupling. And basically, I can realize any quadratic or symplectic transformation between modes by picking out just these second-order terms. These second-order terms. In the language of quantum simulation, if I kind of stare at these things, I see that these terms. Hello, Kevin. Hello? Okay. So if I take these terms here that I call my bean splitter terms, these now are really my hopping term, right? You see, we could think of that in a quantum simulation. This is going to move excitations between my lattice nodes. Excitations between my lattice nodes. And I could see these down conversion terms now. In the language of quantum simulation, these look like some kind of a pairing potential, right? So similar to what you get with superconductivity, for instance. And I'll make a note here, also important for the simulation, the G's here, the couplings that I'm putting here, are really the product of the bare G, which is a circuit parameter, and then the pump strength here. So I can change the amplitude of these couples. Can change the amplitude of these couplings by changing the pump amplitudes, which essentially means I can turn them on and off. And I also, importantly, inherit the phase of the pump. So I really get complex hopping terms here, and I can control these phases, as I'll demonstrate. So putting this together, you know, with a, I have my multi-mode cavity, and now I have the ability to turn on couplings between different nodes. And this is what gives me now what I call my programmable lattice. So, and it's programmable. Is. So, and it's programmable because I can choose the graph of couplings on the fly. So, I can cool down one device. I have a bunch of these nodes, but now just by choosing pump frequencies at room temperature, I can choose what graph I have. So I can do triangular or square, or I can do 1D, for instance. So, I think it's a very flexible and powerful platform. So, we've done simulations of many different models, or there are several different models so far, at least a few. Different models so far, at least a few. One that I won't talk about in any detail except for this slide, for instance, is a bosonic Katayev Majorana chain. So, this is a bosonic version of the model that Katayev proposed to model Majorana fermions. So, now we're going to a bosonic version, but it's still, it turns out this still maintains a lot of the interesting properties, such as the topology and chiral transport. But the two features that you need. But then, and the two features that you need for this are hopping, which we have, and then also Katayev imagined a superconducting system or pairing. So, you need a pairing potential, which we get from the down conversion. But we get all of those terms from, we get those parts from our, yeah, we have those parts. And we've simulated this model, but I won't talk about it. The model that I will talk about, another one, is called the bosonic quit sladder. So the quits ladder is a different. Is a different. Well, it's a quasi-1D model. So it's a bipartite 1D model with a cross-linked ladder. So in the so-called strong coupling limit, the more interesting limit, I have links along the top, links along the bottom, and then I have cross-links between the top and bottom. So I don't go directly up and down. And then this model also has a magnetic field. So this was an early toy model for chiral fermions and quantum field theory. So it's a simple model. And quantum field theory. So it's a simple model, but it has complex features. And in particular, it has some, I mean, what we now would call topological states or topological features. So in particular, at the special magnetic field of phi equal to pi, you get two types of things. So I get localized states that Kreutz called solitons in the bulk. And they exhibit a phenomenon called Aronoff-Bohm caging. Called Aronoff Bohm gauging, which we'll talk about. And this leads to so-called flat bands, which is another key word for topological physics. And then you also get localized edge modes here, which is the other kind of topological feature. So we're going to look at, we're going to simulate two sites or two bipartite sites of our quite slider. So it's a toy model so far. But let me talk about how we're going to study this or measure this. Study this or measure this. So, the first thing that we can do is we can just measure the energies of the modes in our system. So, if we, with our lattice not turned on, say, we can probe the system. So, we put in microwaves and we look at what scatters back. We look at reflection. So, we can probe the system, say, around one of the mode frequencies. And, you know, this is what we see. We see some resonance curve. And now we turn on the lattice, right? So now we turn on four pumps that connect these nodes in this square. That connects these nodes in this square lattice. And what we see now is that if I probe around omega d here, I now see four peaks. So I see that now I've, and I would see similar things around each of these frequencies, but what do I say? What I see essentially now is that I've hybridized the modes. So I've created a set of four coupled modes. And what I can think of is essentially around the uncoupled mode frequencies, these are the Frequencies, these are the eigen energies or the eigenspectrum or the spectrum of my system in the rotating frame, right? So with this reflection, I measure the spectrum of the system. And I can measure the spectrum as a function of my magnetic field, right? So a synthetic magnetic field, which in this case is what I'm doing here for this simple loop, the, yeah, the The only thing that matters for the magnetic field is the total loop phase. So the magnetic field I interpret as just essentially the phase that an excitation gets going around the loop. And in this case, since it's a loop, I only have to, I can, since it's only the loop phase that matters, I can just change the phase on one link. So what I do here is I change the phase of one of these pumps. I can also think of this as a gauge transformation that makes it only this field, only this. That makes it only this field, only this phase that changes. But, anyways, so I tune my effective magnetic field and then I make those scattering measurements like I just showed you, and we stack them up. And you see that, you know, we see interesting behavior, right? So we see that the spectrum changes. So here, you know, at some flux here, I have the four peaks that I showed you before, but we also see at other fluxes, you know, modes become degenerate, or I also get modes at zero frequency here in the rotation. Zero frequency here in the rotating frame. So I get kind of zero modes and flux-dependent degeneracy. So we see interesting things happening. So I see these interesting things in the spectrum, but we can also start to reconstruct or get information about the actual full eigenstates, right? So how the eigenstates are spread over the different modes or what's their spatial structure in the synthetic dimensions. And I can get those from doing transport measurements. So in this case, what I showed you. In this case, what I showed you was a reflection measurement. I probe at omega B and say, here, measure at omega B, and that's how I get my energy spectrum. But I can also look at putting in a signal at omega B and then see what comes out at a different, around a different mode frequency, omega A. So this is a frequency conversion measurement. I'm measuring at a, I'm detecting at a different frequency than what I'm putting in. But in this case, say, if I just measure, if I look at the propagation from B to A, it's kind of weak. You can see it's kind of just above the noise. The axis here says three. Noise. The axis here says three. But if I look at the propagation from B to C, it's much stronger. You can see it's less noisy. I'm getting up to 15 on the axis. And I also get strong propagation to D. And again, I can do this as a function of the magnetic, my fictitious field, and I get kind of structure like this. And in fact, I can measure the full scattering matrix. Hi, Chris. So 20 minutes. Okay, thank you. So in fact, I can measure the full scattered matrix. So, in fact, I can measure the full scattering matrix. So, here on the left is the experiment, and on the right is a theory, theoretical fit to the model. And so, what I'm measuring here on the diagonal, it's all of my spectra around the four modes. So it's just the direct reflection. And then I'm, for instance, measuring seeing transport when I inject something at mode B and then detect it at mode D, right? So that's how I read. Mode D, right? So that's how I read the scattering matrix. And then all of this is as a function of the magnetic field. And you can see there's quite a lot of structure. And despite all of the structure, I think you might agree that the agreement with the theory, I think, is quite good. So this is just a fit to a simple four-mode scattering matrix. Well, for a parametric coupled mode, so just the model that we put in. And importantly, from a simulation. From a simulation point of view, by doing this fitting, we can really fully reconstruct what is the Hamiltonian that we've measured, the experimental Hamiltonian that we've implemented. And I'll just point out, I mean, I'll go in thing, there's lots of interesting things going on here. So I won't talk about it in much detail, but you can see, for instance, that the transports is non-reciprocal. So if I look at this kind of these transposed These transposed matrix scattering matrix elements, so this is like SBC and this is S C B. You can see they're basically the complement of each other. So, where there's red here, there's blue here. So, it's not reciprocal at all. And so this chiral, and we can associate this chiral transport with kind of the breaking of time reversal symmetry from our fictitious magnetic field. So, there are interesting things there. But what I'll talk about a little bit more. I'll talk about a little bit more now is reconstructing the eigenmodes and where we can already start to see emerging topology or some of these topological states in our very simple, in our toy system so far. So looking at the point of phi equal to pi, which is what we thought should be our interesting topological field from the Creutslider. So that's line cuts, that's line cuts here. That's line cuts here. What we see is that what's going on here is we have our four states, and then this is a point at this phi equal to pi that pairs of states collapse into two degenerate pairs. And if I now look at the transport here, you can see going from A to B, there's basically no transport here. The transport turns off, although there is transport at some places, but here the transport turns off, or you know, this is the line cut. Or, you know, this is the line cut, so we don't go to B, but we do go to C and D, right? So we have a state that's basically living on this corner, and we can show that we have basically four of these corner states. So how do we connect this to kind of what we hope to see from the Kreutzladder? Well, we can kind of associate this, again, toy model, and we're stretching things a little bit, but the basic idea is that we're seeing the Aranoch bohm caging, which is an important feature of the Kreutzladder. Of the Kreutzladder. So, what's going on, you know, if I put, we can kind of associate this with this kind of trapezoidal plaque of the Kreutzladder with this cross-linking. And the idea is that, you know, if I put an excitation at A, it can hop to D or it can hop to C, but it can't hop to B because the two paths that it can take, you know, going the top branch or the bottom branch, because of the phase imposed by the magnetic field, these two paths. By the magnetic field, these two paths interfere destructively. So it can't propagate to be, and in the full ladder, it can't propagate anywhere. And that's why I get these localized states due to this Aronoff-Bohm caging, this interference of the transport. We also see at zero flux, we have these, you know, these modes at zero frequency. So even though we have strong coupling, you know, we see these well-de-spaced out modes, we see what looks like, we see things exist. We see what looks like we see things existing at the uncoupled mode frequency here, or zero modes. And if we look at the transport here, we see that, well, this transports now, A transports to B, but not to C or D very well. So now I get some modes, some kind of funny modes that are living across my plaquettes. And we also have another one of these. There's actually two zero modes. And there's another one at C and D. So this is about a bit funny. They're kind of delocalized. Bit funny, they're kind of delocalized, but again, trying to think about the quits ladder. So, we thought there should be interesting physics at phi equal to pi, but if I think about it, if I twist this plaque, which I can think of doing, you know, I can define my graph any way I want to, right? So if I have this twisted or this cross-link plaque, like in the Kreitzladder, in fact, the magnetic field always cancels here, right? So I'm twisting my wires, and so in the top half, I would get half the flux, phi over 2. I would get half the flux phi over 2, and the bottom half I get minus phi over 2. So the flux always cancels in this twisted plaquette, and there's no phase going around this twisted plaque. So in fact, this is like the phi equal to pi. And we also notice when I twist my plaquette like this, these kind of non-local states now kind of look like the end states, which is the other thing that we're interested in. Okay, and I will stop there. Thank you very much. Great, thanks very much, Chris. So we have time for questions. Miles, go ahead. Oh, hi, Chris. Very interesting talk. Just a very, very basic question. So, how far can you get with scalability working with just a single long resonator versus having many? Resonator versus having many resonators and single modes in each? Yeah, I mean, I think there's different answers to that question, right? So, you know, these modes, or we can make these modes with, you know, 100 kilohertz, like a line width of 100 kilohertz or so, right? And then we have like eight gigahertz of measurement bandwidth. You know, so if I, if I count that, I could do a lot, right? Or even let's say, be conservative, let's say I want to make them 100 megahertz. Let's say I want to make them 100 megahertz apart, which we can do. Like we have devices that are, we can make them long enough, you get to kind of like 10 millimeters or, you know, or many centimeters, you know, get to centimeters long, but we can coil that up on a chip. So we can make 100 megahertz spacing. And that means then, say, we can drive them and get 10 megahertz coupling between them and still have space and not worry too much about multi-modes. But that's still give us many modes within our measurement bandwidth. Now, we haven't seen it yet. What I probably expect. We haven't seen it yet. What I probably expect will actually be the limit is at some point, you know, if I start putting in many, many tones into one squid, I'm going to start having problems. I feel like, right? Like, there's a dynamic range of the squid. So I have a feeling that eventually that will stop things, right? But then I think, you know, the idea is that this can be, you know, this would be a, you know, a hardware efficient part of a larger network. So instead of just saying I'm going to have one resonator per node where I get a completely fixed geometry now. Get a completely fixed geometry now. At least I can say, maybe for one resonator, I can have 10 nodes, right? And now I'm going to have to stitch these resonators together. So it's just a more efficient way. But we are also looking at doing just explicit, you know, explicit photonic lattices. So I think you can still use the parametric coupling, even if I do lay things out on a chip. But this is kind of a hardware efficient cheat for now. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks. Sigato, go ahead. Sigato, go ahead. Oh, hi, hi, hi, very interesting talk. So, I was just wondering that, so eventually you would want to simulate strongly interacting theories, like you would want to have some non-linear coupling between your modes or non-linearity. So, from this pump process, it is just a squared interaction, right? With the pump, there's just a extra. So, you'll always get quadratic ones in this method, right? No, well, so there's kind of several answers to that, right? Have several answers to that, right? So, just if I go, whoops, I think I totally stopped sharing. If I go back here, whoops, I hit the wrong button. Anyways, so let's see. If we, you know, so my squid actually has this cosine, right? So, we actually have many orders of nonlinearity. So, this is just the lowest nonlinearity. This is just the lowest nonlinearity. And so we have, you know, we published a paper last year. We actually, for the first time, we used the cubic nonlinearity and we saw a three-photon spontaneous parametric down conversion. And we implemented there also a variety of cubic Hamiltonians. So, and a lot of people have been doing, there's other groups doing this, these kind of higher order Hamiltonians. So the catchphrase, a popular catchphrase is reservoir engineering. So I can do things like I have a two-photon loss reservoir. Do things like I have a two-photon loss reservoir, or you know, and things like that. So, we can generalize these and go to higher order. And so, for instance, you know, there's been work showing that even for these harmonic modes, by kind of pumping these nonlinear terms, I can create, I can induce nonlinearity, so effective interaction. But another, another mode, but this is also motivation. Like I said, we are also working on doing explicit lattices. So, you know, if I make, if I think about a If I think about a superconducting qubit, like a transmon qubit is just a very nonlinear oscillator, right? So it's something where I've tuned the nonlinearity to be significant at the single photon level. So I can go all the way to that limit, but I can also stop somewhere in between, right? So I can really kind of continuously go from a harmonic oscillator to a qubit, but I can stop in between where with, you know, oscillators with a certain coupling strength and things like that. Coupling strengths and things like that. So, you know, that would involve, you know, yeah. So if we start to do explicit lattices, and I mean, I'll also make the point, which is interesting: using these cubic processes or higher order is also a way to start looking at dynamical gauge fields. So the thing I talked about before with the gauge fields where I kind of imprint these phases, this is like a particle moving in a static gauge field, right? The gauge field itself isn't dynamic, but if I can start to create many body interactions, now I can start to think about. Now I can start to think about having, you know, a photon hops, my matter photon hops, but it also flips, you know, another state, which is keeping track of my gauge field. And now I can start to implement dynamical gauge fields, you know, which is kind of the long-term goal. So I think there's lots of different things to play with here. Right, right. Okay. Thank you very much. Yeah. Cool. Cool stuff. Right. Well, I think that's the end of the session. That's the end of the session. And so thanks to Chris and all the
