How's my audio? Is it good? Good? Okay. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Thank you to the organizers for inviting me. I'm going to give a short introduction on Homo MSE using some of the topics Jessica was just telling us about. So I'll be a little bit repetitive. I'll be a little bit repetitive in going through some definitions. I'll do quite a few of these definitions by example. And then I'll talk about HomoMessi using some results of Jim Propp and Tom Roby. And then I'll talk a little bit about some of my own results that I worked on for my PhD dissertation. And then depending on how much time at the end, I'll talk about some additional topics. Additional topics. Okay, so Jessica covered this, but just to go through it quickly again: what's a toggle? If we have an order ideal of a poset, a toggle pretty much tries to either add an element to the order ideal if it's not in there, or remove it if it is in there. And we do so if the result would again be an order ideal. So if the element's not in, the toggle adds it in, if possible. The toggle adds it in if possible. If it's already in there, it removes it if possible. If neither of these are possible, nothing happens. And from these toggles, we can define actions. One of the actions Jessica mentioned was row motion, which we saw could be generated by minimal elements of our poset not in the order ideal, or we can get it by toggling our poset from top to bottom. Okay, so. Okay, so here's an example. If we toggle from top to bottom, we get another order idea. All right, Jessica also talked about promotion. Okay, so we can toggle from top to bottom, but we can also toggle in other directions, like left to right. So if I start with this order ideal, toggle left to right, we get another order ideal, and we make note that promote. And we make note that promotion doesn't give us the same thing as remote. So these are two distinct actions. If we continue to apply this action, we eventually return to where we started, giving us what we'll call an orbit. So here's an example of an orbit under promotion. Once we get to this last order ideal, we return to the one we started with. So let's introduce homomess. So let's introduce homomissy. If you start to look at these orbits, a natural question to ask is: well, Jessica addressed this in her talk, looking at order, the structure of the orbit. But another question you can ask is basically looking at the cardinality of these order ideals that are showing up in your orbit. Depending on what postet you're looking at, your orbit sizes could be different size, so it makes more sense to look. Different size, so it makes more sense to look at the average cardinality over an orbit. And so, if we look at this example, the average is three. If I look at another example, the average is also three. And if we think about the product of chains poset three by two, the average cardinality of an order ideal over all order ideals is three. So, we have this three showing up for. We have this three showing up for it looks like a lot of our orbits for the average over all order ideals. So, this is sort of the motivation of what Homo Messy is. So, we're going to say if every orb, excuse me, if every orbit average of a statistic is the same, and if that's the case, it'll be the same as the global average of that statistic, then we say we have homo missing. Have homo busy. Okay, so really we have three things. We have a set of objects, we have some sort of action, and we have a statistic that we want to look at. In this case, we're talking about order ideals of the product of chains posa A cross B under the action of promotion and looking at the cardinality statistic, right? And for this basically triple. Basically, triple. This exhibits homomessy, where the average value is e times b over 2. Okay, so prop and roby showed this. A natural question is, well, if this is true for promotion, what about row motion? Okay, so you can go about showing a similar result for row motion directly, but I want to introduce a bijection between orbits under row motion and Row motion and orbits under pro motion. So on the top here, I have an example of a partial orbit under row motion. Basically, this would keep going. Just for the sake of brevity, I cut it off here. But at some point, it would come back to this initial order ideal. And then, same thing down here. This is basically a partial orbit under pro motion. It would keep going. Eventually, we return to where we start. To see what the biological. To see what the bijection is between these two orbits, I'm going to start with this top partial orbit, and I'm going to be cutting out my order ideals. Essentially, I'm cutting them into layers, right? I'm starting with this first order ideal, and I'm sort of chopping off this layer here. And then I'm moving one step forward in my row motion orbit and moving up to the next layer, and I'm grabbing this layer. Grabbing this layer. I'm taking one step forward and doing the same thing here. And what I'm doing with these is I'm bringing them down here to construct a new order ideal. So these layers that I've grabbed, I'm using to construct this order ideal in red. And now I'm going to move one step forward in this partial orbit and do the exact same process. So I start at the bottom, move one step forward, go to the next one. step forward, go to the next one. One step forward, go to the next one. And I'm going to take these layers that I've highlighted in blue and create an order ideal down here. And the really neat thing is, if I apply pro motion to this red order ideal, I get this order ideal in blue. So this gives us a bijection between an orbit under row motion and an orbit under motion. Under row motion and in orbit under promotion, right? And this proof technique is called recombination. Einstein and Propp showed that recombination gives us a bijection between order ideals of product of change posit under row motion and promotion. And because recombination preserves the cardinality, it gives us a select proof for essentially this homo messy result on order ideals of the product of change. On order ideals of the productive chains poset under row motion, we basically have that with the cardinality statistic, we get homo missing. Good, so things are really nice for this product of two chains posit. What about the product of three chains? A pretty natural extension. So, Jessica talked briefly about basically higher-dimensional product of chains, how we can toggle these. Product of chains, how we can toggle these. I'm not going to go too into details on what this is doing, but I think this was essentially her realm too. She mentioned you can basically take a hyperplane and sort of sweep through your poset to determine a toggle order. So I'm just going to let a vector of ones and negative ones define a basically a hyperplane that sweeps through our postet and determines what order we're toggling in. Okay, so. In okay, so basically, instead of you know top to bottom and left to right, we now have more options. And just to show a quick example, here I have a product of chains boset. I'm going to toggle using the vector 111. Notice I start at the top and basically toggle down to the bottom. Notice I'm just showing the toggle order here. I'm not actually performing the toggles. All right. All right, so we started at the top, went to the bottom. Notice that means this promotion is row motion, toggled from top to bottom. Okay, so if we can show some sort of result for all these promotions, we've also shown it for row motion because it's one of these. Here's a second example. Here I'm using the vector 1, 1 minus 1, which toggles. Which toggles from back to front. And the reason I wanted to show an example of this 1, 1 minus 1 promotion is because this one turns out to be rather nice. Much like in the two-dimensional case, promotion in some sense gave us nicer results than row motion. Here, pro of 1, 1, minus 1 turns out to give us Turns out to give us some nice results. And I'm going to focus on this vector. This will be the first promotion that we investigate and show homo messy for. So if we look at order ideals of 2 by b by c under this particular promotion, and again, we're using the cardinality statistic, this exhibits homomessy with average value b times c. Okay, so I have an example down. Okay, so I have an example down here at the bottom, just using a product of chains 2 by 2 by 2. Averaging the cardinality, we get 4. Here's a second example, still get 4. This result says no matter what orbit you choose, you're always going to get 4. Okay, so how do we prove this result? We're going to use increasing tableau. And in fact, I'm going to use the bijection that Jessica talked about. The bijection that Jessica talked about for real. Here's a definition of increasing tableau. Essentially, it's a filling of a partition shape with positive integers such that rows and columns are strictly increasing. And this was the bijection that Jessica had mentioned: that there's a biasion between order ideals of A cross B cross C and increasing tableau of shape A by B. Of shape A by B with entries at most A plus B plus C minus one. Okay, the case we're looking at in particular is with A equals two. So we'll focus on this corollary where one of our chains is of length two. And the bijection turns out to be pretty nice. Okay, if I want to start at a product of chains and get to the increase. Chains and get to the increasing tableau. Essentially, we just need to, in a sense, count the number of elements in an order ideal from each of these columns. So, if I look at this element and this element, this looks sort of like a column. There are zero elements in our order ideal here. So, I'm going to record a zero. Same idea. There's one element in the order ideal. I'm going to record it. There's two in each of the rest of these. So, all of these filled with are filled with. These, so all of these filled with are filled with twos. This isn't an increasing labeling, but I can add values across the diagonal, basically add one, add two, add three, add four, and that guarantees that we get an increasing tableau. Okay, so we have this nice bijection, and even better, probe one, one, minus one on order ideals. On order ideals of a product of three chains corresponds exactly to K promotion on increasing tableau. Okay, again, we saw K promotion in Jessica's talk. I'm going to essentially just define it by example using these better Knuth involutions, which are sort of like toggles. And the idea is you switch I to I plus one and I plus one to I whenever possible. Whenever possible, just running through all the possible values. So, ones to twos, twos to ones, and then sort of so on and so forth. And once we do that, we get K promotion of our tableau. Good. So, the reason why we want to look at Tableau is that Tableau are also very well-studied objects, very well-loved objects. Loved objects. And Bloom, Pachenik, and Sericino already investigated Homo Messi on increasing tableau of shape 2 by n. And they found that it exists under K-promotion where the statistic is just summing up the entries. Now, because of our bijection that we had earlier, we can translate this back to order ideals of our This back to order ideals of our postet and get our homo messy result that we wanted. Basically, order ideals of 2 by b by c under this particular promotion with the cardinality statistic, those exhibit homomessity with average b times c. Good. So that gives me a homomessy result for one of these promotions. What about all the other ones? What about all the other ones? Back in the two-dimensional case, when we had a two-dimensional product of change, we saw that recombination could get us from promotion to row motion. Does it work here in higher dimensions? So let's look at an example. Here I have a partial orbit of pro 111, which remember is row motion. And I'm going to use the same sort of idea. I'm going to, in a sense, cut this up into layers. So here I'm taking this bottom part. Here, I'm taking this bottom part, right? I'm going to take the order ideal elements that I've colored in as red, and I'm going to essentially start constructing a new order ideal. And then I'm going to move one step forward and do the same idea, taking the next layer, making that sort of the next layer of my order ideal down here. Okay, and once we essentially Okay, and once we essentially run out of layers to take, we were done constructing our order ideal. Now let's try it again. Moving one step forward, again taking layers in sequential order ideals in this orbit. And as it turns out, if I apply probe 1, 1 minus 1 to this order ideal, I get exactly the blue one over here. So, in a sense, to answer the question, yes, recombination does work in higher dimensions. And even better, it doesn't necessarily have to be just a three-dimensional product of chains. It can be higher dimensions, and it doesn't need to be a product of chains. Right, and in fact, we can apply it more generally to ranked mosets. Okay, so. Okay, so essentially, here's what the result is. If we have two n-dimensional vectors with entries plus or minus one, and they only differ in one component, then we can perform recombination to get from one promotion to the other. Okay, so if you look at our promotions here, Pro111, Pro11-1 only differed in the third component. Also, notice that the way I was... That the way I was basically cutting this up into layers, I was using the essentially Z component to cut this up into layers. That is where they differed. That is an important part of recombination and where they differ does determine how you're cutting up your postet when you perform recombination. Okay, so we have this result that can get us from one promotion to another where they differ by one component. Where they differ by one component. If we want to get to any between any two promotion actions, we might have to perform recombination multiple times. But essentially, we can do it. We can translate our homo messy result using either a single recombination or several recombination steps to obtain all the homo messy results for all the different promotion actions on order ideals of 2 by B. On order ideals of 2 by b by c. Okay, so we have this nice homomessy result for any pro sub v on these order ideals. Good. What about generalizing this further? Turns out in a product of chains, it doesn't. Excuse me. If we have a product of three chains and we And we loosen this condition where we have one of them be of size two. Homomesy starts breaking actually pretty quickly. Three by three by four gives a counterexample of where our order ideals fail to be homomessic. If we look at larger product of chains, again, starts to fail pretty quickly, even if we restrict all of our chains to be of size two. To be of size two. Once we get to the product of five chains here, we don't have homo messy. So something kind of nice with a product of three chains where one of them is size two, we still have this homo messy result. But anything further starts to break down. Okay. So we have these nice homo messy results. What you can do if you have a homo messy result is start looking at subsets of your objects to see if you can find stronger homo messy results. So going back to these examples we had on the product of two chains, I've circled essentially two elements. I've circled them in red and labeled them as X and Y. If you look at the cardinality of just these two elements, X and Y, Just these two elements, x and y, over these orbits, and average just those cardinalities. Notice for this orbit, you'd get an average of one. And for this orbit, you'd also get an average of one. Okay, so introducing some terminology to describe these, I'm being a little bit loose with terminology here, but I'm going to call these antipodal. If you can obtain one element from another by essentially rotating 100. By essentially rotating 180 degrees above the center, we'll call those antipodal elements. I'm also going to introduce the word file if to be all elements where if you subtract their coordinates, you get a constant value. So for example, W and Z are in the same file. You might also call this a column, depending on the terminology that you use, but essentially W and Z are in the same. Essentially, W and Z are in the same file. X and Y would be examples of antipodal elements. Okay, so Prop and Roby found stronger results on this product of chains. Essentially, for both antipodal elements and elements that are in the same file, whether you look at just the cardinality of antipodal elements or if you look at the cardinality of elements in the same file. Cardinality of elements in the same file. Either way, you get refined homo messy results in both cases, basically under romotion or promotion. Okay, so again, we have some nice homo messy results on a product of two chains. Does that extend to the product of three chains? And the answer is yes. I have an antipodem result on the product of three chains. On the product of three chains. Again, under any promotion. And so, to give you an idea of why this is true, I'm going to need to go a little bit more into Tableau. So, I'm going to give a couple definitions. Essentially, if we have an increasing Tableau, I'm going to define the distribution of a box in the Tableau to be all the values that box attains. Box attains in an orbit of k-promotion. And then I'm also going to introduce the alphabet reversal distribution, okay, where if you have a distribution of a box, you perform an alphabet reversal on every value that you attain during an orbit of k promotion. And what Pachenik showed is that if you have an increase in the original, If you have an increasing tableau of shape 2 by a, if you, in a sense, have two antipodal boxes in your tableau, the distribution of one box is exactly equal to the alphabet reversal distribution of the other box. Okay, so let's look at an example. Here I have an orbit of pro 1, 1, minus 1 for the 2 by 1. 11 minus 1 for the 2x 2x2 postet. And down below, I have the corresponding k-promotion orbit for this 2x2 tableau. And I've highlighted the box B and the other box I'm looking at B star. So I'm focusing on these two boxes. And so if I look at the distribution of B, I'm just recording these values that appear throughout the orbit. Throughout the orbit. B star, same idea. I'm just recording the values. And then I'm performing an alphabet reversal of the distribution of B star. And notice these are the same. The question is, how does this connect to the cardinality of antipodal elements in the poset? Well, if I circle these two antipodal elements, if I want to focus on these. I want to focus on these across the orbit. What I'm going to do is, I'm going to highlight in red down here in my tableau anytime our order ideal, basically anytime one of these antipodal elements is showing up in the order ideal. So, for example, it is here and it is here. I've colored these red to indicate that the rest of them are still colored black. Same idea here. These are all Same idea here. These are all in the order ideal, so I'm coloring those red. Down here, these are not in the order ideal, black. And so if I look at the distribution and the corresponding alphabet reversal distribution, notice we have 3, 2 showing up red here, 1, 1, 1 showing up as black. It's exactly the complement for the alphabet reversal. 1, 1, 1 is red, 2 and 3 black. 111 is red, 2 and 3 black. Turns out that always happens for antipodal elements in the poset, which gives us a quick proof that two antipodal elements will always exhibit homomessy where your average is one. Cool. How am I doing on time? You're into the question period now. Okay, this is a good place to stop then. I will skip the part about infinite orbits. I'll just say that sort of the way I defined Homo Messi earlier implied that we had finite orbits, but you can have a more general definition. So I have sort of a short trivial example, but I'll skip over it. Okay, well, let's thank Corey for his talk. So let's check in the chat for questions. Anecdotal proof. I'm not sure what that refers to. Is that Oliver's result that you're calling anecdotal, Nathan, or something else? No, it was something that Corey said, but I thought it was fine. Okay. I have a question for you, Corey. So this infinite action, the infinite orbit, that's going to be in your slides, which are going to go up on the bird's side. Which are going to go up on the birds so we can learn about it there. Yeah, yeah, yep. Great. Other questions? Okay, well, let's thank Corey again.
