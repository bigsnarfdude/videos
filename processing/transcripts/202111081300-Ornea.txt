It's the first time I am in Banff, at least virtually, if I didn't see these mountains. But at least virtually now I am in Banff and I'm very happy thanks to the guys who sought to invite me. So welcome to Bannf. Thank you. And yes. Yes, I was told to give an account of locally conformally K-like geometry. So I prepared what I thought to be the mainstream of this rather marginal subject. And it will be a talk without proofs, just Goofs, just notions, comments, examples, and results. That's all. So I'll start with the definitions. There are many ways in which we can define the locally conformal KL structures. I I prefer to start with this say tensorial definition. Tensorial definition. So I work with complex manifolds of dimension n, not with curves. I shall denote the complex structure with I, and it will be always integrable. Also, the very definitions in the beginning when Weissmann introduced the notion in 1970. Notion in 1976 was for almost complex manifolds. The convention for the fundamental form is the one you see. So I put I on the first argument. And locally conformally Kayla means that the fundamental form satisfies this, say, integrability condition. Say integrability condition with respect to a close to one form. In fact, this equation, I apologize, I wasn't present to the first talks that I was teaching. So maybe some of what I say was already explained. So please tell me when it's when I don't have to say things. So this one form This one form is called the Lee form. It was a paper of this guy, H.C. Lee, in which he looked for integrator factors, I think they were called. When you want to multiply multiply a form such to make it to make it exact and it was exactly this equation so this this is why this form is is called Lie form of course it had nothing to do with complex or with symplectic geometry in the beginning When theta is exact, then omega is conformal with a symplectic form. So this is the case we try to avoid. We are interested generally in locally conformally KL or in locally conformally symplectic geometry on compact manifolds that do not bear symplectic or T. Do not bear symplectic or TR forms. So I shall suppose usually that theta is non-exact. As you saw already, if you neglect the complex structure, what you obtain here is exactly the definition of an LCS, locally conformally symplectic. And exactly as in the locally conformally symplectic case, Formally symplectic case, the notion is invariant. The leaf form changes at a conformal change by adding the differential of F. So all the conformal LCK metrics in a class, in a conformal class, have the same Lie class, the same. The same Lie cohomology class. I will end with the discussion about the Lie classes. An obvious fact is that complex submanifolds in L C K are L C K by the properties of the pullback. So, this is the general picture, the first definition, but But now if you want to compare, and this is one of the main objects of study, to compare LCK geometry with scalar geometry and to see what can be translated, what are the differences. Now, there exists, of course, a definition in terms of currents which Which is essentially the theorem of Harvey-Lawson. But expressed in terms of this twisted differential, it's the exterior differential modified by the Leaform. It's trivial to see that the square is zero, so it gives a complex. And this statement that Alexandra gave and proved is exactly Harvey Lawson's characterization. This exists. I didn't see until now. Until now, applications, but it exists. The first question that one can raise, and obviously because it's a conference on LCS mainly, is to find compact LCS manifolds. Compact LCS manifolds which do not admit LCK structure. It's the analog, obvious analog of finding compact symplectic manifolds without Kayler structures. But while in the Kayler case, this is settled, there are a lot of examples. In this case, this is what I mean by being settled. Strangely, we don't have examples in LCK versus LCS. There are only some examples in dimension in real dimension four, that is on compact surfaces. And here we have the classification of compact complex surfaces. So these So these are different, the two papers, one of Banden Kochik and the other one Marrero, Padron. And I think there is a third collaborator, I'm not sure. But both results use explicitly the classification. I didn't see up to now. See up to now any example in higher dimension. And it would be very nice to obtain such things. What is the big challenge here? As you will see, there are no topological obstructions for the existence of LCK metrics. Metrics on a compact complex manifold. No obstructions for the general LCK metric. We know a lot of things for particular subclasses I shall explain about, but not in general. There was in the beginning a conjecture. A conjecture of Weissmann that compact LCK manifolds should have at least one odd, odd Betty number. And for a long time, we believe that this can rule a lot of things. But finally, in 2005, I think earlier Klaus and Matei Thoma found a counterexample. I shall Found a counterexample, I shall give not details, but I shall come again to this thing. So, for the moment, I think this is a main open question in the theory. Sorry, I have a question, Levio. Please. When you say locally conformally symplectic manifold, do you mean that it tames the complex structure or something? No, no, no. Locally conformally symplectic. No, no, locally conformally symplectic. I don't see any complex structure. I mean, well, I'm asking because there is this result of Murphy Dashberg that if you have almost complex manifold with B1 different answer, then you have local conformally symplectic and there are non-complex manifolds with this property. Of course, yes, but yeah. Yeah. They are exact. All of them, they are exact in Elias Bergmurf, you know? We can also construct non-exact ones, but I think perhaps, or maybe this is my own ignorance, but I don't know how to show that something doesn't have an LCK structure or even a complex structure in high-definition. Or even a complex structure in high dimensions? Yes, that's my problem too. I don't know how to show this. I don't have a topological set of invariants which obstructs. Yeah. Liviu, I think the only obstruction we know is that the first Betty number has to be larger than one, at least one. Otherwise, Otherwise, there is no known obstruction, right? Topological obstruction. No known obstruction, yeah. Maybe pi one should be, cannot be, cannot have two generators of different index or things like this. Maybe maybe we one could ask a question from the other side. I mean uh From the other side, I mean, take a complex manifold whose H1 is non-trivial, so that it has a non-exact and look for LCK structure on it. Yes, that is. Yes, that is the problem I shall end with the set of Lie classes. Maybe this one is solvable by techniques a little like the ones we've done with Milani, and I'll explain on Friday. Okay. Okay, so maybe you're right, and this is no more an open question. No, no, no, no. No, I don't see. I have full screen. I don't see. I was talking to Amy saying that maybe she's right and it's not no more an open question. I don't know. Yeah. Okay. May I go on a bit? Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. Okay. So the second definition is the local one and the obvious, say the geometrical one. It requests to have an atlas, sorry, an atlas with scalar forms, local scalar forms which are homothetic on Homothetic on overlaps. And the LCK form is conformally equivalent with each of them, but you cannot, of course, you cannot glue them. I think in Weisman paper in 76 in Israel Journal, this was the definition. The definition, then you can show immediately that it is equivalent with the tensorial definition. But for us now and for what will follow in this talk, maybe this third definition is more important. At the level of the universal cover, you have Kayla. You have a Kayla form on which, and the group, the dec group acts by Kayler homosides. This is a very fruitful way of seeing LCK geometry because it transfers everything to the K-L cover. Kalar cover, of course, it's not necessarily the universal one. You can work with a Kalar cover with this property. And this proved to be very, very productive. Not only for Misha Verbitsky and myself, a lot of results will be ours. Ours, but also for other people who worked in this context. All these three definitions appear in different forms explicitly or not in Weisman papers 76 till 1882. Now that's a new topic in the field. Topic in the field Preda and Stanchu, they try to extend the LCK geometry to singular spaces. And the task is completely non-trivial because even the Kayla forms are not clearly defined. And it's There are a lot of technicalities. But there are at least two papers up to now, and the work started for this. It's a huge open field. Now, I come back to this definition. Once you have this action of the tran deck group by Homocetes, you can associate. You can associate a character, this morphism from the deck group to the positive reals, which associates to a deck transformation its scale factor. I call it the homostatic character, or just the character. Of course, you can consider it as a character on pi one. You can also look at the minimal cover. It's the one on which the DEC group acts by pure homostatis. There are no isometries among the deck transformations. And then you can look at the rank of the image of this character in our plus. We call it the LCK rank. And it plays an important role, you will see in all what follows. This notion has nothing to do with the Kayla rank as it is defined, for example, for hop surfaces. It's this ad hoc definition, and that's it. Okay. Okay. Connected with this definition using the character, you can of course take the local system which corresponds to the character. Then the Lie form becomes a flat connection in L and the image of the character becomes the monodromy of this. The monodromy of this local system. I shall need this notion of automorphic form or even automorphic functions. There are forms on the cover of an LCK manifold which are equivariant in this sense. A deck transform acts on them by multiple. acts on them by multiplying them with the character, with the image of the character on that deck transform. And it's useful to understand these automorphic forms as being forms on M with values in the local system. This identification permits a lot of A lot of good reasonings in LCK geometry. I was talking already about this operator, the twisted operator. It gives the Morse Novikov cohomology or the twisted cohomology or the Lishnerovich cohomology. There are people who don't like calling it Morsnovikov because it's trivial for them. We are used to calling Mosnovikov, that's it. So it corresponds to the cohomology of this local system. It is the same thing, and one can prove immediately that it is finite-dimensional. So this is So this is a second after Duram it's a second cohomology which is important on L CK on L C K manifolds. Okay. Paul calls this local system the weight bundle and of course it can be interpreted like this because it Because it's an object of conformal geometry, also. Let me give you a list, non-exhaustive list of examples and non-exhaustive list of authors. I apologize when I forget authors. So, first of all, in the smaller dimension, we have almost all known. Almost all known non-Kellar compact complex surfaces, and there are a lot of people who contributed here. They are listed here. The late Brunella, he proves that all CATO surfaces are LCK. Weissmann began the work by proving that some of the Hopf surfaces, the diagonal ones, are LCK. Are LCK. I forgot to write in this list Franco Tricieri, who proved, was the first to prove that the Nue-Bombieri surfaces are LCK. Then Belgoon classified the Weissman. I shall come back to these. There are a lot of results on LCK surfaces links with bi-Hermitian geometry and so on. Geometry, and so on. There are results about LCS versus LCK, tamed LCS and LCK on surfaces by Vestislav and Georgio. A lot of results of ontekovo Fujiki about different kinds of Inuit surfaces, not Inuit Bompieri. Is not inway Bompieri, in We Hirzebuch, and so on. So, this is in the smallest dimension. In higher dimension, you have the Hopf manifolds. I call them Hopf manifolds. In fact, these are the linear Hopf manifolds because Z is represented only by generated by Generated by an automorphism of Cn. And they can be of two types. This generator A can be semi-simple or not. We shall see. There are some early clauses Thoma manifolds which generalize in higher dimensions in newer surfaces of the first kind, type S0 or Sm. Or SM. I won't explain what they are because it takes a lot. And there is a talk by Alexandra. I believe she will explain the definition. These are good examples because you can compute almost everything algebraically. There are the Caton manifolds, which are manifolds. Which are manifolds with global spherical shells. This is, they were rather newly introduced and studied by Mistratio, Timon and Pontekov. And then more generally, they call something toric catalog manifolds. They are more general than Kato manifolds. Not all of them are LCK, but some are, and you can compute invariants, and they give nice, nice examples. For the moment, let's have these as examples. And I gathered on this slide a bit of comparison between what happens in the KLA world and in the LCK world. The LCK world. So you first look at the blow-up, say, and in the Kaler class, you preserve the class, even if you blow up long sub-manifolds, you blow up on points. In LCK geometry, you preserve the class when you blow up at points. The result was stated. The result was stated by Tricheri. The proof was a bit flowed. Viktor Vuletescu cleared cleaned the proof. But along sub-manifolds, the answer is yes, if and only if the sub-manifold has induced Keller structure. That is, the Lie form when induced to the sub-manifold is exact. Induced to the sub-manifold is exact. That's for the blow-up. As regards the stability of small deformations, no. Unfortunately, no. And this is Florin who proved that there are some InOE surfaces with no LCP. With no L CK structures, and there are complex deformations of other Inuit surfaces which accept L C K structures. Still, you can find subclasses of L C K manifolds which are stable to small deformations. I shall talk about this class, L C K with potential. There is this famous theorem. Famous theorem, I think Lishnerovich, I think it was extended to LCK manifolds by Andrei and Michaela. Not on all of them, not on HOF, not on manifolds which have hypercaler universal. Hypercaler universal cover, Calabiao. The proof is involved and it's very Riemannian. I already told you about the fact that there are examples. There are examples with a threefold that Erly Klaus and Thomas constructed with all Betty even. And as regards the Riemannian geometry, it's no use to list Riemannian properties of K-Lo manifolds. But in the LCK case, I think that this is the most I think that this is the most important result in Riemannian geometry on LCK manifolds. They cannot be Einstein. And as far as I know, there is no Einstein type condition which fits with LCK geometry, apart Einstein Weil, which comes from conformal geometry and it implies very It implies a very sharp subclass which I call Weissmann. I shall deal with it immediately. So no other, as far as I know, no other important curvature properties or other specific Riemannian geometry. I want to mention this theorem of Y. This theorem of Weissmann, which states a dichotomy between LCK and Kayler. So, on compact manifolds, Kayler and LCK metrics cannot coexist. This I think this prohibits considering It's considering Kayler as LCK manifolds. They are completely different, I think. Because in the compact case, they cannot stay together. This kind of result, on one side, it was extended to singular spaces. On the other hand, there is a lot of work now. There is a lot of work now trying to see if this kind of theorem is valid for other kinds of structures, Kayler and Kappa Gaudi Schon, Kayler and Balance and LCK and so on. This was just a detour. It's not in the main. Okay, let me define Weissbund manifolds. I already Manifolds, I already late. Weissmann manifolds are a strange subclass. They were defined by Weissmann himself as locally conformally Taylor manifolds with parallel leaf forms. Then he called them generalized HOPF because the Hopf surfaces, diagonal HOP surfaces are the main example. Then he observed that generalized Observed that generalized hop was taken by Briskorn, and it was something new known in algebraic geometry. In the end, we called them Weissmann manifolds, and it seems that the name was accepted. It's a combination of conformal geometry with Riemannian geometry. You request that the Lie form be parallel with respect to the Levi-Chibita connection. To the Levy-Chivita connection. And this is not a conformal invariant condition. So, this seems to be from another movie. The Weismann metrics are Gauduchon because the parallelism implies the codifferential is zero. And then on compact manifolds, compact manifolds if a Weismann metric exists in a conformal class it is unique up to homosity so you can speak about Weissmann type LCK structures which admit a Weissmann metric in the conformal class. There are examples, many examples. On compact surfaces they were classified by They were classified by Belgoon. In higher dimension, you have the diagonal hop. As I said, the generator of the cyclic group is diagonalizable, it's semi-simple. The compact complex submanifolds. The compact complex submanifolds inherit the structure. This is not immediate. There are the elliptic surfaces. And one can prove that some small deformations are still Weissmann. The subclass is strict. One can prove that all non-diagonal hop manifolds, that is, when this generator is not semi-simple, Arnold Weissmann, the Inoue surfaces of all types are non-surfaces. In general, the Cato many surfaces and the Cato manifolds are non-Weisman, and also their OT manifolds. The OT manifolds. Obviously, the blow-ups of LCK are not Weissmann because on the divisor, on the blown-up divisor, the CETA should be exacted. So the class is strict, but it is the best understood class. Because it has a very rich geometry. If you take this, this is what I call the Lie field. It is the metric dual of the Lie form. And this I SETA, it stands for the Rebe field when the LCK manifold comes from an S1 bundle of a contact manifold. Bundle over a contact manifold, for example. So, in the example of the Hopf manifold, diffeomorphically S1 cross S2n minus 1, this is tangent to S1, this is the rev of the odd dimension sphere. Well, in Weissmann manifolds, these are commuting, killing, and holomorphic. So, they give a Fourier So they give a foliation, which is denoted, I denote it in this talk by sigma. One can prove that it is Riemannian and totally geodesic. Now, of course, then you can look at its leaf space if it exists. If the leaf space is a manifold, you say that the foliation is regular. And then the leaf space, one can prove that the leaf space is a projective manifold. Manifold. So you could recall what is a real holomorphic vector field. Yes, the flow of the field is formed by holomorphisms. And if you add theta sharp plus I theta sharp, you obtain a complex holomorphic vector field. Okay? Okay, so the flow is formed by holomorphisms. This is real holomorphic vector field and killing the flow is made of isometries. So in general, it's difficult to obtain regular foliations. So quasi-irregular is a milder condition in this. In this talk, it's enough to assume compact leaves. And in this case, the leaf space is an orbifold, which again is a projective orbifold. This result was rather striking. It was proved late 80s or beginning of 90s, I think, 96, that on compact manifolds, this volume is canonical in the This volume is canonical in the sense that it depends only on the complex structure, and also it has at least one compact leaf. One can also prove that compact, complex sub-varieties are always tangent to the canonical foliation. You can define this. You can define this, not define, you can consider this form, which is the twisted, the complex differential of the leaf form is of this kind on Weissmann manifolds. And you see, this is the part on the leaves. And if you get rid of it, what you obtain is a positive. Positive, uh, a positive form, which with a little bit of attention can be interpreted as the curvature of the churn connection in the weight bundle. We can characterize Weissmann manifolds in terms of the existence of Of a complex flow without fixed points, and which leads to a flow on the Kayler cover, which contains also two homostates. It doesn't lift only two isometries. This can be also taken as a definition. It is a kind of It is a kind of converse, partial converse to this characterization, to these properties of the canonical foliation. So θ and I θ together, they give this C flow, this complex flow. So when you have such a flow, you can build. Flow, you can build bicep metric in the same conformal class you started with. One can characterize compact Weissmann manifolds of rank one. I don't know if you remember the LCK rank is the image of the character in R. In R plus. So it is the monodromy of the local system. The rank of the monodromy of the local system. Rank one means that the deck group is isomorphic with Z, is cyclic. This Weissmann manifolds are biholomorphic with a manifold. With a manifold obtained by this receiver. I don't know if you should know probably what contact you, of course, you know. Sasakian is a contact manifold whose symplectic cone is scalar. Take it like this. So you take a Sasakan manifold. So, you take a Sasakian manifold, you take the Keller cone. If it exists non-trivial holomorphic homosity along the generators, then the quotient is vice-ma. This structure theorem has the advantage of not involving the foliation. So, I don't care if the foliation is regular or quasi-regular or whatever. It is not so restrictive. It might seem restrictive because I impose LCK rank one, but we proved that we can always approximate a given LCK structure by Hermitian forms of rank one. So, in all our theorems, Our theorems we suppose from the beginning that we have LCK rank one as long as we are interested only in the complex geometry and not in the Riemannian properties. The topology of compact Weissmann manifolds is a little bit well known, it's well known. So B1 is all B1 is odd, and all the cohomology of the local system is zero. This was proven, in fact, by De Leon and his collaborators for locally conformally symplectic manifolds, which admit a metric not related with the symplectic form, a metric with parallel Lie form. With parallel Lie form, that's all. A metric for which the Lie form of the LCS is parallel. But the metric is not compatible with the LCS form. I'll leave you. I think it has nothing to do with LCS. It's just if you have a manifold and which admits a metric with a parallel. Uh, with a parallel form, so a parallel form is closed automatically and non-exact. Yes, so then the twisted cohomology associated to this one formula. Yes, you can prove this. Yes, so it's not it's not nothing to do with LCS or LCK, but of course it applies to us. Yes, we have another proof using the Using the arrow that a compact Weissman sends to S1. Topologically, it is a suspension over a mapping torus over S1. Anyhow. This is a result which sends LCK geometry into the framework of Of algebraic geometry. A priori, when working in LCK or in Weissmann geometry, everything is non-algebraic. It's highly non-algebraic. Still, if the foliation is quasi-irregular, that is, if it admits compact, all leaves are compact and the leaves are compact and there exists this projective orbifold as a leaf space, then you can describe the cover of a Weissmann manifold, which is quasi-irregular, as the space of non-zero vector in the total space of an ample line button. Everything is in the category of all befall, so this is an overfall bundle. Okay, there are technicalities, but this is the idea. Again, this is not such restrictive because if you start with an irregular one, you can deform the complex structure. Structure and obtain a quasi-regular still Weissmann. The deformation takes place in a Lie algebra and you use the rational lettuce. Poasi regularity is related to rationality. It is the same thing as done for CR. CR or for Sasakian for passing from irregular to quasi-regular. There are a lot of conditions which ensure that an LCK is of Weissbund type. This was proven by Paul, one of the first conditions. The existence of parallel vector fields was rather recently proven. Recently proven the fact that this tensorial condition, which can be expressed very geometrically, and it is called pluricanonical because it has a meaning. This has a story, but it's no time here. One of the latest results is by Nicola. The latest results is by Nicolina the existence of a compact torus of biholomorphic transformations, purely real in this sense. And if the LCK manifold is homogeneous, then it is automatically Weissmann. Again, this is a result with a story, not necessarily very nice. Homogeneity implies also regularity of the canonical foliation, and B1 is one for these manifolds. Sawai proved that the nil manifolds and solve manifolds with invariant LCK structures are Weissmann. Bazoni also has nice results about the LCK solve manifolds, about the topology. Also, if the leaf field is holomorphic plus another condition, we obtain a Weismann. So also toric LCK manifolds are Weismann. So if you want to do Tauric geometry on LCK, you are obliged to work on Weissmann manifolds. The other class, which is important, at least in the work of Misha and myself, is the class of L CK manifolds is potential. So recall that an L C K manifold M omega theta can be viewed as covered by a Kayler manifold on which the deck group acts by homostatis. Now suppose that Now, suppose that the Keller metric admits a positive global potential. Here it is equal, as you see. So, omega tilde is DDC of this potential, and the potential is automorphic in this sense. So, the potential can be seen as a function on M with On m with values in the weight bundle. And it is because it is automorphic. And it has to be positive and it has to be plural subharmonic with respect to omega tilde. And in this case, you have an L C K metric like this. Almost all the explicit examples were computed in this, were expressed in this. Expressed in this way. There can be a potential for some Kayler metrics on a cover of an LCK manifold, but not automorphic. The fact that the Kayler form omega tilde is automorphic does not imply the automorphicity of the potential, but only conversely. But only conversely. On the earlier claused toma examples, this is the case. You have a potential which is not homorphic. Also, this is a cohomological condition, the existence of a potential, is the Botchern class of omega tilde should be zero. But this does not. But this does not ensure the positivity. We proved, and it's not trivial, that if there exists an automorphic potential, then there exists also another one which is positive. So up to this result, the vanishing of the body. The vanishing of the Botchern cohomology is enough to, of the Botchan class of omega tilde, is enough to ensure existence of a potential. One can give equivalent definition computationally. Maybe you remember this equation was valid on Weissbund manifolds and is valid also on LCK. Valid also on LCK with potential. And also you can just consider the existence of a simile potential, say, on the manifold itself, a positive function which is it is a mistake here. It's not D D C, it's D theta D C theta. It's with respect to the twisted difference. To the twisted differential, of course. The manifold M is compact usually, so it cannot admit potentials for subharmonic functions. As examples, you have all the Weissmann manifolds where the potential is just the norm or the square norm of the Lie form with respect to the Kayler metric. There are also non-valid. There are also non-Weisman examples. So the class stays strictly between Weissmann and LCK. The non-diagonal Hof manifolds are not Weissmann and they are LCK with potential. And this can be seen by, for example, by this theorem, which was our starting point when we started working on LCKB's potential. This class is This class is stable to small deformations. Manifolds, LCK manifolds without potential, which do not admit potential, are the Inuit surfaces and the early Klaus-Toma manifolds. These are clear ones. These manifolds are very good. Are very good if you want to apply algebraic geometry methods. May I have five minutes more? Andrei? Yes, of course. Okay, no, because I think I have only two, but give me five. Okay. It's plus epsilon. Ah, yes, epsilon is small. Okay. So The potential can be a proper function. And we prove that this happens if the deck group is isomorphic with Z. That is the same thing as the L C K rank to be one. So in this case, you have a proper potential. And what is interesting is that if you look at this Z cover of Cover of a manifold with potential, you can complete it, you take the metric completion, and you can complete it with only one point. And what you obtain is a Stein variety. This point will be a singularity. So, what we have here is that the Z cover of an L CK with potential. Of an LCK with potential is very close to a cone, as in the Weissman case, but it is not a cone. It is what we call an open algebraic cone. When you add this point, it is a closed algebraic cone. The restriction about the dimension comes from a technical we use in the proof theorem by Andreotti, Hue and Rossi. I don't have time to. I don't have time to explain all this here, but so just remember that the cover, the Z cover of an LCK with potential, with proper potential is a Stein variety without a point, with a singularity which you have to add. Now, sorry, you mean filling holes, the theorem of Rossi? Yes, yes, exactly. Yes, yes, exactly. Exactly. It's the feeling. And this is related to closed algebraic cones. Maybe it's not time to enter into detail here, but so you have just an affine variety with a C-star action fixing one point, smooth outside. Point smooths outside that point. And this contraction acts on the Zariski tangent space. It's a contraction on the Zariski tangent space of the point. What we proved is that if we have an LCK manifold with potential, then we can keep the complex structure and deform the form. The form, the L C K form and the Lie form to obtain a structure with proper potential. So, from the beginning, we can assume that we work with L C K manifolds with proper potential. The main feature of these manifolds is that they can be embedded into a linear Hopf manifold. Into a linear Hopf manifold. So, this is a Kodaira type embedding in which the target space is a Hopf manifold and not projective space, obviously. And now we can characterize the Weissmann manifolds as being those LCK with potential which admit embeddings in diagonal hop. This result can be used to obtain an embedding. To obtain an embedding at the CR level for compact SACKN manifolds. Moreover, LCK with potentials can be deformed to Weissmann manifolds. The complex structure can be deformed to a complex structure which admits a Weissmann form. This is done using this embedding. Using this embedding, so you embed the LCK potential in a HOPS manifold. You take the generator of the cyclic group of the complex manifold, you use Jordan-Chuvalais decomposition in semi-simple and unitary part, and you work with the semi-simple part, and this will give you the embedding in a Weissmann manifold. We can characterize LCK metrics with potential via an S1 action. This is similar to the characterization we gave with Kamishima for Weissmann manifolds using complex flow. Now for L CK matrix with potential, it is enough to have an S1 action which leads to an action by homocetes. An action by Homocetes of the Kalar cover. In fact, our proof was just to obtain a Kayler metric on the cover having vanishing bot churn class. And this didn't assure the positivity. We didn't pay attention to this. And then Nicolina Estrati completed the proof. Strategy completed the proof by showing that our potential was indeed positive, but it's a very careful analysis that she did. So, this is a characterization, in fact. Now, let me end with this. So, this is a problem that interests also people in LCS geometry. For LCK geometry, the problem is set like this. You take a complex manifold, you know it admits LCK metrics, and you look at the set of, you look at H1, real, and you look at the Lie classes. This class is that can The this class is that can stay as cohomology class of a leaf form for an L CK metric, and you want to characterize this subset. Now, for Weissmann, Tsukada proved that it is a half space. He did this using the composition of harmonic forms, which Which was given by Weisman and before Weizmann by Kashiwada. And we proved very recently, it's not published this, and it will be, I hope, on archive in the next weeks, that the same holds for LCK with potential of dimension bigger than three because we use the embedding result. So it is a high. So, it is a half space. And in particular, all the cohomology of the local system vanishes on LCK with potential as for Weissmann manifolds, because we can prove that for each Lie class corresponding to an L CK with potential, you find one which corresponds to the formation, which is vice-manned. Anyhow, Anyhow, we use for this a kind of the composition of one of harmonic one forms, which is weaker than, of course, than the one in Weissmann geometry, but it is enough for this. The half-space is up. The half space is obtained by the multiple, the scalar factor in front of Seta, which can only be positive. You choose positive or negative, because opposite Lie classes cannot exist. This is the same, it was the same. This is the same, it was the same for Weissman. So, for the moment, we have this characterization of the set of Lie classes. We knew that it is open because we have a lot of results of deformation, but it is even a half space. And yeah, we also have work in progress. Work in progress, some results on the Kuranishi space of an LCK with potential, but it's not completely done. I cannot say much about for the moment. I think this is all. Thank you.
