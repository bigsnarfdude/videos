People in the audience who are around, it's Shi Berry Sagar. And during that conference there were two really weird talks by Liang Hu and by Sagar about like the strange particles that couldn't move. Seems really cute. And now three years later we are discussing a whole conference devoted to it. It's pretty impressive to see the amount of progress that happened in these fears. So, I'm not going to cover the introduction, we all know why we're here. But I want to maybe describe motivation. So, one characterizing property of this fractal theories is that particles can't be created on their own. They can only be created in certain geometric patterns. So, this is a good example of a pattern for scalar charge theory. And this pattern encodes what kind of motion is possible. You start applying it in different Applying it in different ways. You start, you know, pulling these configurations out of vacuum, repeating them, and you discover how particles move. Okay, so this is a different pattern for the Ha code. Then you taught me with Hai B code a few days ago, so I also draw this pattern, and etc. So the purpose of the talk is not to classify this pattern, because I'm not sure if it's possible, or at least not with the present formalism available. Formalism available, but maybe the purpose of this talk is to come up with some language that would allow us to put some structure on these patterns, or maybe to talk about these patterns. So, I would like to refer to everything I do as just games, because I will end up with certain gauge theories and with certain rules how to treat those gauge theories. I will never be interested in questioning whether these gauge theories are stable, whether they're isolated fractons, whether they can be separated, whether we cannot. Whether they can be separated, whether they cannot be separated. That's why we will use the word local games instead of areas. But the games in question are figuring out the patterns and figuring out what kind of mobility constraints any given pattern imposes. So the patterns, the examples I showed you a few moments ago, and the questions I would like to answer is: suppose I have some set of spatial symmetries, which Which buttons are consistent with it, which local trash configurations are consistent with it. Or if I came up with some local game, can I figure out whether there are particles that cannot move or whether there are some fractal structures emerging just from the rules alone? Do I really have to figure out all possible ways of applying these patterns? Or maybe I can just look at the game itself and figure out it right away. itself and figure out it right away. Of course, there is also a question which of these games that I'm going to play can originate from gap local Hamiltonians. And I will not answer any of these questions, but perhaps I will tell you a little bit about language that would allow us to talk about these questions and make progress on them. And the language I would like to use is a language that is also suitable for physics, meaning that a language of Physics, meaning that language of symmetries and conservation loss and gauging of the symmetries. So when I talk about pattern like that, I would like to imagine the color to be some sort of charge and then position, well, position is position. So one way to characterize the charge configuration is just to provide the distribution, values of charges and their locations. Maybe that's useful, but I don't know how to put any structure. I don't know how to put any structure on just space of discharge distributions. However, there is an alternative description, which is not exactly one-to-one, but it's actually its feature that it's not one-to-one. And it's a description in terms of moments, or we would call in physics multiple moments. If you have a charge distribution, you can define the symmetric tensor of rank n, where n goes from zero to infinity, that encodes the information about charge distribution, but in a slightly different way, in forms of the symmetry. But in a slightly different way, in terms of this integrals, the both moments. And in the cases that I'm interested in, the rho of x will always have finite support, so a discrete set of charges. Maybe on the lattice, maybe in continuous space. And just a few examples. If the zeroth moment is conserved, I will say that the charge is conserved. Rather, if the zeroth moment is fixed, I will say that the total charge is fixed. If the first moment is fixed, I would say the dipole moment is fixed. You can trace the scale charge theory, charge. Scale charge theory, charge, first moment and trace of the second moment happen to be fixed. Fixing various quantities is maybe interesting things to do, but in physics we prefer fixing the certain physical quantity to originate from a conservation law. And conservation law itself would usually originate from a symmetry. Okay, so if I say I fixed the 17th moment of 17th moment of charge density, I would prefer to think of some symmetry that enforces that. And here's the first weird thing: in everything that you study, maybe up to early graduate school, all charges that you have encountered, except momentum and angular momentum, are scalars. They're never vectors and definitely never tensors. In fact, there is even a theorem to this. It's called Umm-Mandua theorem that says that in Lorentz environment, quantum field theory, you cannot have the vector or tensor or whatever is charged. Vector or tensor or whatever is charges. They always have to be scalars. What this means is that the space of the algebra of internal symmetries has to completely commute with algebra of the spatial symmetries. In our case, the concert quantities are going to be vectors and tensors, which will imply that the symmetry, getting back to Michael's talk, is going to be very unusual and weird, and it's going to be a mix of spatial and internal symmetries. So I'm going to think about symmetries. To think about symmetries, symmetries will give me the games that we can play. And I'll try to classify the symmetries. So, none of this would be possible without these three works. They're ordered by the order I read them in. So, these three people I'm sure you're very much familiar with, but the main inspiration after these two papers came from this one where Peter Kharjavi and others were studying. And others were studying what they called binomial shift symmetries, which are the symmetries that have to do with conservation of dipole and quadruple and other moments. I'll have some mine references as well that are inspired by these workers. Okay, so first, to establish some common language, I would like to revisit scalar charge theory, or rather, vector charge theory, I guess, but in the language that I will use throughout the talk. The talk. So, how can I get to a scalar charge theory? Well, the strategy is going to be first to come up with a matter theory with a global symmetry. The global symmetry will be kind of weird. Then I would like to gauge global symmetry and study the results in gauge theory. That procedure reminds me, I guess, what Sagir was talking about. But I will use very different equations and I have no idea what the relation is. So imagine I have some metric field, let's say it's a real scalar that I'll call theta. Real scalar that I'll call theta. And my theta is going to be shifted by a constant. That symmetry will lead to a conservation of charge. You all encounter the symmetry in the theory of superfluids. Hajava and company studied a theory that has additional symmetry where you shift stated by a linear polynomial. It's called it polynomial shift symmetry. Okay, so imagine I demand in addition to this symmetry that one. I don't know what to call it. It's not global, it's not local. It's a polynomial linear in coordinates. It's a polynomial linear in coordinates. But lambda 1, lambda 2, lambda 3 can be virtually real numbers. They are parameters of the symmetry. It's three-dimensional symmetry. It's very easy to write Lagrangian, this invariant under the symmetry, I just hit theta with one more derivative. So Hajan and company were interested in this because they were studying non-relativistic Goldstone theories. And they wanted to have a principle that forces you to write two derivatives here instead of one. They use the symmetry principle. So if you do another theorem in those symmetry, So, if you do Nerd's theorem in those symmetries, you find the charge is conserved and the first moment of the charge density is conserved. Incidentally, you can, preserving rotational symmetry, add another polynomial symmetry. You take mod x squared, which is rotational invariant Branch II polynomial. And if you add this symmetry, you will get another charge, which is trace of the second moment of density. So, for future reference, I will use the for this charge, I will use. I will use the for this charge. I will use the letter delta. It will come up in a moment. So, this is how this global symmetry is implemented in the form of just the meta theory. And to get symmetric tensor gauge theory, you gauge it. I have to admit, I don't really understand the geometric meaning of this gauging. I can just tell you what I do like an electrical engineer. What I do is I just say that theta transforms are a function of space and time, and I introduce covariant division. And I introduce covariant derivative in such a way that there is a vector potential which transforms in such a way that this is a local symmetry. So vector potential transforms by the IgJC and if I shift theta by this, then vector potential shifts by this. This is a invariant derivative, or the covariant derivative. And I make action out of this stuff. And for time derivative, you just need uh you just need a scalar potential. You just need a scalar potential. Okay, so and then I write everything that's gauge invariant, that gives me Maxwell turn. Now I have a theory of matter coupled to generalized electromagnetism. The Gauss law is given by this. It's a theory that you very well know, that Michael discussed in great detail, and another Michael today discussed in some detail. There's something weird about the symmetry though. Not just because I don't know what to call it, but there is an operational weird property. If I take the symmetry of shift by linear polynomial, then I immediately notice that because the symmetry depends on position, it does not commute with spatial translations. Which means the charge of this symmetry cannot simultaneously be diagnosed with momentum. So if you actually calculate the permutator, you find that translation can be used with the symmetry on a constant, but uh constant is a generator of just uh charge conservation, so just U1. Charge conservation, so just U1. And because of this property, this symmetry cannot be called internal. In fact, what it does, it takes your Euclidean symmetry algebra translations and rotations, and it extends it to a bigger object, which could never appear, as far as I know, in Variants and Variant field theories. So here is this algebra for the scalar charge theory. You have two, whatever. You have two whatever number of dimensions you have, you have translations, which are called T, you have rotations, which are called R. They commute in translations like this, and you have rotations and rotations, this you can find on Wikipedia. But then you have three, now you have a bunch of more commutators. You have this symmetry, which now I call D, which is responsible for conservation of dipole moment. They commute with each other because well, because adding polynomials commutes with each other. Translations in Translations in D don't commute, they commute on generator if you want. And rotations in D commute in such a way that D is a vector, dipole is a vector, so under rotations it transforms as a vector, so that's what this formula says. You cannot decouple these parts of algebra from this. This is one object which I propose to call multiple algebra for obvious reasons. Now, we can add another generator. Remember this quadrilator shift that I mentioned before? Shift that I mentioned before, which is a scalar generator. That shift also doesn't compute with translations. But because polynomial there was quadratic, its commutator with translations is a linear polynomial. So this is the commutation relation. Delta with translation is a dipole generator. Okay? So maybe this will fall on the fears, but I just want to say it because I think it's really cool. This algebra has been studied for, I don't know, maybe 40 years. Been studied for, I don't know, maybe 40 years by now. Very well-known algebra. It's called Bartman algebra. And I just summarized the same computation relations here. So if you ever went and studied a bit more obscure quantum hole literature, you would find this object. And this object is identified from our current discussion and also in a very bizarre way. So I'll just waste 30 seconds telling you about this. If I take my dipogenery and identify it with spatial translation, Identify it with spatial translations. I take my spatial translations and identify them with Berlin and Boost. I will take the scale, this x-squared transformation, identify it with time translations, Hamiltonian. And I take this Q generator if you want and identify it with mass conservation. Then I restore the Byron algebra, which is a symmetry algebra of Galilean environment massive particles. The rotations are just rotations. Rotations are just rotations. There is nothing else that has two indices, and that is symmetric, yes. I don't know. Symmetric, yes. I don't know why this exists. This is just an observation. I find it cool that out of this kind of abstract nonsense, something will know and emerge. Okay, but now coming back to things I would like to discuss. So here you're talking about continuous rotation? Yes. Everything so far is in continuum. I will make comments about 90 degree rotation, it's like continuous. This is a generator of continuum. This is a generator of continuous rotations. I will make some comments about Lysis shortly now. Okay, so we can generalize this algebra. I want to kind of describe as many of these weird local games as possible, so I want to come up with some generalization of this algebra that will involve maybe more interesting charge configurations. So, how can I do this? Well, it's about shifting by polynomials. So, the most trivial generalization I can think of is just let's shift. Of it just let's shift by arbitrary polynomials with some coefficients. Now, what I mean by arbitrary, I specify a set of polynomials, the ones that I want on the Saturday afternoon. I am going to say x1 minus x2, x3 plus x2 plus 17, x1, something like this. I take red, you know, some bizarre polynomials. And I demand that my theta shift by those bizarre polynomials with RB3 coefficients, and that I call a symmetry. Such symmetry. I call a symmetry. Such symmetry will lead to conservation of various moments, but now it's going to be just some components. Could be x components of dipole moment, z y components of quadrupole moment, etc. So this is a bit abstract, so let me quickly use the right scalar charge theory in these notations. So theta shifts by linear polynomials and by these quadratic ones. So in my polynomial notation, I will say that I have three polynomials of power one, and three. Three polynomials of power one in three dimensions, x1, x2, and x3, and I'll have one polynomial of power 2, which is x1 squared plus 2 squared plus x3 squared. Okay? So this is how this notation works. When I don't forget, I will color the degree of the polynomial in red. Okay, so here's something important. Here's something really important. When you commute a polynomial with a translation, you have a question. With a translation, you have a question? Yes. Yes. So, at least in 1D, dipole conservation is center of mass conservation. Do you have a physical intuition for these larger, for these higher multiple symmetries? They're conservations of multiple moments. But not center of mass. Center of mass. So if I was to think of them in 1D, in a hopping model, what would be the moment? Well, in 1D, I will not have higher moments. That's the problem. Yeah. Yeah. But mm-hmm. Maybe in a couple of slides you will see what diagonal. You could have higher remote, just not off-diagonal, I guess. Yeah, but those are trivial. Those are like tensor product of dipole with itself. Right. Yeah. So in 2D, if I was to think of them, what would, like, what would. Well, you're asking me how to impose it in a microscopic model. Yeah. It's a question to microscopic model experts. I'm not sure about this. Taylor talked about an example. There's moments of a U1 charge, right? Like, it's not that difficult. Charge, right? Like, it's not that different from. It's a generalization of center of mass conservation. I know, I perfectly well understand the generalization of center of mass conservation. That's why I'm asking, like, if there's of a microscopic model. Man, Taylor was talking about yesterday, that can sort dipole. It had this complicated CCC hopping. It wasn't a strong interoxync. It didn't have a hopping part, but had coercing creation delay. Know quartic and increasing relation equations. That would be an example. All of the theories that have dipole and higher order conservations, they are all a bit agi. They are not quadratic. Yeah, okay. So, but let me quickly get back to this. So, if I commute a polynomial with a translation, its degree decreases by one, okay? And if I commute a polynomial with a rotation, its degree remains the same. So, in order for my algebra to close, each time I commute a polynomial with a translation, it has to be expressed as linear combinations of... It has to be expressed as linear combinations of the polynomials in the algebra in the same with rotations. Okay? So, this alpha and beta in these two equations are the structure constants that define this multiple algebra. We'll discuss two examples in a second, if it is a bit too abstract now. What's important is that sometimes you will find that for Tx and Ty, I can find such alphas, but for Tz I cannot. Then I will say that I have a three-dimensional system that only has x and y translational symmetry, but Tz has to be excluded. Symmetry. But Z has to be excluded. And the same with rotations. Okay. So it's maybe a bit abstract, so I would like to discuss this maybe a little bit with simpler language. What is this computation in algebra is about, why translations sometimes are in contradiction or intention with the generators. And it goes back to the fact that Taylor reviewed yesterday, which is you can take a multiple moment and translate Multiple moment and translate it. If you translate it, for example, for quadruple moment, this is transformation law under translations by vector R. And what you usually conclude, and what Taylor concluded yesterday, is that in order for nth moment to be well defined, all lower moments have to be zero. This is true to an extent, but a little bit more subtle compromises are possible. And compromises will lead to very interesting charge configurations throughout the talk. So one compromise, let me show you an example. compromise, let me show you an example of explaining the geneal structure. Imagine I have a theory where dipole moment is pointing in the z direction. So dipole moment is non-zero, so I would conclude that quadruple moment is not well defined. However, if you play with this equation, you notice that q11, q22, and q12, meaning quadrupole moments in the space perpendicular to d, are well defined. This is because d, x and dy, or d1 and d2 are both zero. So I can make arbitrary. Was zero. So I can make a bit of translation, and Q11, Q22, and Q12 are multified. So, oh my god, okay. I got shocked. Okay, so let's discuss first the fake to the example. It's fake because the results in gauge theory makes no sense, but will allow us to play a game. This will lead to fractals. So now I'm going to take theta and I'm going to shift it by a constant, and by another constant, times polynomial x one minus x two. times polynomial x1 minus x2. I will not will not include any other polynomial. That's just it. Then what's conserved is charge, and the other thing that's conserved is the dipole moment in 1 minus 1 direction. You read out this 1 minus 1 from the Caitlins of the polynomial. Okay? Strange. Okay. So now we're going to construct a theory for which this is a symmetry. The way I do it For which this is a symmetry. The way I do it, I define what I call an invariant derivative, which derivative, which is derivative that annihilates the polynomial. That is a, you know, then if derivative announce the polynomial, then this is a Lagrangian. Okay, so if it's stupid Lagrangian, it's in 2D, but it only depends on x1 minus x2. So maybe not very interesting theory. The multiple algebra is also very simple. I have to exclude rotations, because dipole in 1 minus 1 is conserved, therefore there is a preferred vector, therefore. Therefore, there is a preferred vector, therefore, rotations cannot be included. So, I only have two translations and this guy and the charge. This is only non-trivial commutation relations. Now I gauge it. I say that theta now transforms by alpha of x and t. I introduce covariant derivative like this. Vector potential transforms as d1 alpha. I introduce electric field. I get Gauss's law. And from this Gauss law, this is what I learned from Mason's paper. Law, and this is what I learned from Mason's paper, Mason Lendanium, that I can discretize with analysis and start generating charge configurations and play the games that I promised. So if I discretize this derivative, dx1 plus dx2 on the square largest, I will get this charge configuration. This charge configuration satisfies my conservation laws. And foreseeing a possible question, I want to tell you right now that Question: I want to tell you right now that if I take a different lattice, let's say this one rotated by diamond lattice, then because my theory is not rotationally invariant, I will get a different theory by discretizing it to the lattice which is rotated with respect to this lattice. Because there is no rotational symmetry. So let me just play with this one first. This is an analog of this charge configuration in radio single charge theory. So I will try to separate these two charges away from here. So, but since there are no charge configurations, I can. But since there are no other charge configurations, I can just apply multiples of this one. Well, I can destroy these charges, and I get more charges downstairs and more and more. And what I see is that if I try to separate this charge away from the rest, that Mason and Daniel also noticed in earlier one version of the Hawkmault, you get a sheet of charge where each charge is exponentially big in the separation. I'm not really sure whether it's a real phenomenon, maybe it is, maybe it's not. In three dimensions, where the gauge theory is well defined, you do encounter similar things. So, already at this level, it could be interesting to ask what is the physics of a U1 gauge theory with such property where you cannot separate charges unless you create a very large charge configuration. Okay, so now let's condense charges. So, there is a theory of how to do Higgs condensation for the symmetric tensor gauge theories. I will just present that it works and I'm going to condense the charges down to Z2. So this charge is minus 2. If my charge is condensed down to Z2, minus 2 is 0. So this is my charge configuration. And I find this by applying it, I have a one-dimensional particle that move in one minus one direction. Let's play a cooler game. Let's condense charges to Z3. If I condense charges to Z3, Z3 minus 1 becomes 1. So I have two charges. Minus 1 becomes 1, so I have two charge configurations: 111 and 222. That's what we call them yellow and green stars. Then, if I create a charge configuration like this, by yellow star 111, and I try to separate this one and that one, the best I can do is to apply operators in such pattern, and my one here hopes two to the right, and my one here hopes two up. If I want to separate them further, I can only do it on three by three and then nine by nine lasers. And then 9x9 lasers, where I apply my charge in my operators in the following pattern. The pattern generates Repinski triangle, which has colors on it. This, as far as I know, unfortunately, is not obvious. If I just told you, if I just show you these pictures, it's not obvious that you will be able to find the Sierpinski triangle. So, I don't yet know how to look at these two pictures and right away determine that there is a Sierpinski triangle that can be. Triangle that can be generated. That's one of the open questions. I can keep doing this, and I find that I can only have 10 minutes. I can only move tippery charges on 3 to the power k by 3 to the power k lights. So this I stole from Ben Yoshina because I couldn't bother to draw Sasha Big. Couldn't be bothered to draw Sashibisha. Okay, so let's talk about Hawkhod. For Harcode, these are the polynomials. These are the polynomials. There are three of them: two polynomials of degree one and one polynomial of degree two. So I'm sure you can read them. They lead to the following inseration laws. Dipole moment in one minus one, zero and one minus two direction is conserved. And the quadrupole component like this is conserved. So you have to take quadrupole tensor and contract it with this, which gives you a linear combination of components of the quadrupole tensor. That has to be conserved. quadruple tensor. That has to be conserved. Because I have a symmetry by shifting by this quadratic polynomial. Then you can compute multiple algebra by just playing with those polynomials and seeing how they are acted on by translations and rotations. And you find that translations, well, this is how translations work. So you apply translations to polynomial of degree 2, and you get linear combinations of polynomials of degree 1. So this is non-trivial set of. So, this is a non-trivial set of relations. Polynomials of degree 1 just can be used with translations on charge conservation, on generator of U1. And you also notice while staring at the polynomials, I don't know how to do it in any better way, that rotations in the 111 Miller plane actually permute the polynomials. So the resulting algebra has three translations and one rotation in the 111 plane. If you saw the picture. If you saw the picture of the charge configurations in the hard code, this already should smell like it because charge configurations in the hard code have dipole moment in 111 direction. This is how I could guess these two polynomials. I wanted to conserve dipole moment in the direction perpendicular to 1, 1, 1. So I can write a theory. The theory is defined by three invariant derivatives, which kill those polynomials. One of the derivatives is this one, it's a linear derivative, and two derivatives. This one is linear derivative, and two derivatives are quadratic. Because derivatives are of different order, these two coupling constants have dimension of lengths in them. Stiri knows something about the lattice, but they cannot say anything more intelligent, cannot answer the question that Mike was asking his talk. This matter theory, by the way, again, very, very quick aside, has a zoo of symmetries. In addition to symmetries we just discussed, that are described with multiple algebra, I have two more symmetries. Algebra, I have two Moist images. First of all, if I call this direction x and this direction y, directions of conservation of dipole moments, then there is an isotropic Rift scaling. You scale time by lambda, x and y by root lambda, and x3 again by lambda, and theta by lambda square root. This happens to be symmetry. And here, notice, it's not ordinary leaves, different space direction scales differently, which of course should not be shocking because derivatives are different together. Okay, and there is another symmetry here, which is if you use this immutation x and y and you shift theta by a function just of x plus y or just function of x minus iy, then for any f and g this is a symmetry. It's called sliding symmetry that appears in theoretical axis. So I discretize the derivatives, I get these charge configurations. That already kind of looks like hard code. To be completely fair, you get slightly more ugly charge configurations, but then you More ugly charge configurations, but then you take superpositions thereof and you get those three. If you condense charge down to Z2, you notice that this and this one become dependent. So you actually are left with just two charge configurations, which are the ones that appear from the stabilizer code that Hai is using. So I'm more or less at the end of the talk. I don't have any more interesting examples. But this is how we can talk about this game. How can we talk about these games, which maybe allow us to put some structure in it? We would like to imagine the following protocol: we take a mouth, pick a multiple algebra, we gauge it, we study the results in gauge theory, we discretize it on the lattice, the lattice is again another degree of freedom, so there is huge freedom here, there is huge freedom in changing of one choosing of the lattice, and there is also a huge freedom in breaking U1 down to a finite subgroup. So there's each one of the subgroups. Group. So there's each one of these things, I guess, is countably infinite set of choices that we can make. But perhaps some of them could be understood to some extent. So for example, thinking about multiple algebra really amounts to thinking about polynomials and how they are transformed under spatial symmetries. So you think about rings of polynomials, but then you have action on them by either continuous translations and rotation symmetries or by the crystalline symmetries. That seems like a well-defined Symmetries. That seems like a well-defined object. There's an infinite number of those, countably infinite, certainly, but I'm sure more structure can be put on it. Maybe something analogous to the classification of space groups, but perhaps infinite, I'm not sure. Discretization, again, is another degree of freedom. And when you talk about U1, there is another subtlety, which is it can be just one type of charges, but in the high B code, it seems that you have to use at least two types of charges. So in general, it could be many. So, in general, it would be many concern charges all year one. There's quite a lot of freedom in this. So, since it's my talk, I can criticize myself all I want. And this is the criticism, self-criticism, self-reflection, I don't know. So, first, I don't know how to define those symmetries on the torus. Nobody asked me this, maybe out of politeness. But if you have a polynomial, that is not a good function on the torus. In order to understand hard code and degeneracy, I want to put my system on the torus. I don't know how to define the simulation. The torus. I don't know how to define the symmetry on the torus. It's absolutely unacceptable. I cannot tell a priori whether the state is topological or not. For example, in this HAR code that I described, if I didn't know about the existence of HAR code, I would just dismiss it as another game I could play. I don't know whether it comes from stabilizer code. I cannot tell a priori if there is restricted mobility. If I look at the charge configurations, I cannot really say whether it's going to have restricted mobility or not. However, there is a hint. In the theories that do have restricted mobility, The Ducker-restricted mobility, derivatives are always of different degrees. If I have derivatives of the same degree, I cannot say anything. But if some of these derivatives are of degree, let's say one and others of degree two, then there is a very, very good chance that I'll have not enough restricted mobility. In fact, it will be not just restricted mobility, but it will always be something that doesn't move at all. Andre, what do you mean by is the state topological or not? Well, I wrote this gauge theory. Well, I wrote this gauge theory where it condensed charges. I would have to read a study to understand whether it's topological or not. What do you mean by topological? Like it's gapped. Gapped and has degenerate ground state in the absence of symmetries. Because remember, I'm not talking about theories with global symmetry. I use them as a tool to get to the gauge theory. Right? And the gauge theory after charge condensation can be topological or not. You're just worried that it could be a trivial. Yes, yes. Or it could be unstable. Yes, or it could be unstable. This fake example is just unstable. It has one electric field and no magnetic fields. It's not even a thing. But I can play with it still. So most of the theories are defined on some sort of lattice, or maybe some more general structure, which means that it's probably productive to not think about just polynomials and how they transform under continuous symmetries, but how various polynomials interact with crystalline symmetries, or maybe some subsets of crystalline symmetries. Subsets of crystalline symmetries. Remember that I was placing theories in continuous space and then polynomials would pick out a sub-group or sub-algebra of the spatial symmetries. So if I choose the lattice, I'm still allowed to look at symmetries that are just sub-algebra of the latest symmetries. Again, a lot of freedom. And I guess the final point is there's too much freedom. There's such a thing. There's some good news, I guess. First, I don't see any obstruction to writing a chiral a chiral effect theory for Effects ethereum for rotary topological phase. I wouldn't know how to understand whether this is topological phase or not, or I would have to study the gauge theory really well. But there's upgraded obstruction. You can write your silence theories with those gauge fields. Another good news is we also get a lot of Gautless Human phases. And perhaps for spin liquids, some of this would be relevant. Spin liquids are systems that define analysis. There's no reason why they all have to be ordinary electromagnetic. Reason why they all have to be ordinary electromagnetism and IR. In fact, it's surprising that they have electromagnetism and I are because, well, because why should you have an immersion Lorentz symmetry? It seems to be quite productive to think about what kind of Gauplus you want phases you can get that are anisotropic. The novelty here is anisotropic. Yeah. I think I'm done, thank you. Is it possible that this symmetry is enormous? Everything is possible. It's a new world. The way you write it though, it's sort of automatically you can gauge it, so probably it's not anomalous, right? I assumed that I can gauge it. For example, let's throw away all the polynomials. I have just spatial symmetries. If I gauge spatial symmetry, If I gauge spatial symmetries, if I have a theory with diffeomorphism anomaly, I can gauge it, but the theory that couples to it will be inconsistent. So you don't know if it's always going to be consistent? No. So I have a comment that addresses some of your self-criticism. Maybe we can cross that off the list, actually. So it's about defining a global symmetry on the Taurus. So there are two things I can think of to say. One is that if you have a One is that if you have a, if you assume your Hamiltonian is strictly local with finite range, then if you just integrate the charge density over a patch in space over some disk, which is much larger than the range of interactions, then you just require that that commutes with terms in the Hamiltonian density inside that disk. That's a way of imposing the symmetry, even if you're on any space. I guess the other thing is, you know, so there's this recent work. So, there's this recent work, which I think is not published yet, by Xuang Xiao and Nadi Cyber, where they also talk about a way of formulating this where there's actually a local condition. So you have a vector symmetry, charge, and then the current is some tensor, usually with some constraints on it. And in this case, it would be, you know, it would be the tensor would be a derivative of something. It would have some derivatives on it. And conservation of that is a completely local condition. And if you're on And if you're on infinite space, this sort of structure, you know, simplifying. Yeah, I know this logic sounds right, but I feel that operational definition of this symmetry on a torus may be the key to understanding degeneracy. But I'm just my feeling. I'm going to talk about my feelings. There were two questions in that corner. So thank you for the comments. So it's clear that we type all constraints. It's clear that with dipole conservation, I can't have a one-body term. Because can I have, with quadrupole conservation, can I have quartic theory? So, with dipole conservation, I can tell you things that they know about it. With dipole conservation, you need a quartic. With quadrupole conservation, you need six. I see. So, there's no way to write it with a with a quart. Oh, they're asking different questions, and I cannot answer this question. Because you're asking a non-existence question. I know how to write it with a six. It's clear that non-existence is clear. Why not? Well, I mean, like, I can, you know, I can write it as a like, at least in one day, but if I have a hop as hopping. If I have a hopping turn, violate center of mass. Finally. But it does. Okay, then I think it should also be clear, because then you will try to hop dipole, and that's quartz. I see. So it cannot be quartic, it should be at least six. Because for example, dipole conservation, you can get it from a you know, hopping as a limit of hopping plus a huge electric field. Electric field. Oh, okay. So I'm wondering if you can get these. I mean, it would be very hard to get a sixth-order term from sort of a hopping. Right. The theory is a strictly conserved dipole. Quadrupos almost sure has to be power six. Now, if you add a realm of, oh, it's like almost conserved, what do you what can you write? So it's only conserved in some limit, cannot say anything. Maybe you can have some combination of four and six. Can have some combination of four or six. So it's a very good question. We're not there yet. If you have two different polynomials and you want to know whether the theory is equivalent or something, what are you supposed to do? Well, it's a question of isomorphism of algebras. If the algebras are isomorphic, I would say that after that gauging them would lead to the same gauge theory. Is that is that the question? Yeah. Is he is there like an algorithm to tell whether they're isomorphic? Algorithm to tell whether they're isomorphic. How do you isomorphic? There's one paper on the multiple algebra, and that's the paper that's introduced the name. So I don't know. I mean, I would share that they're isomorphic. And I would tell you that maybe if they... I can only do it by hand. Maybe that's the question. If there is an algorithm, I'm not aware of algorithm. If you give me two algebra, so two polynomials, I will try to see by hand. If there is an algorithm, that would be kind of interesting, because that would help answer the question. Of interesting because that would help answer the question of specification. Yeah. Yes. That's a really good question. Yeah. So that's a good question. I don't know. I might have a positive answer to that question, but that would take us offline probably because it's a little bit technical. But I think we were using similar techniques for just stabilizer codes where you have, you know, it's not U1, it's like ZN to essentially figure out if you give me two stabilizer codes. Essentially, figure out it. You give me two stabilizer codes. I know elementary charge configurations I can create are all possible charges I can create in one equivalent or the other. And that there is like fairly simple operating. I see the curve based on the ideal. Yeah, right. It's like the ideal generated pedestal. It should be equivalent, but then there's a simple way to sort of test if the zeros are the same. Okay, I would love to hear from this. Good time, but like one more question for that. If not, let's thank the speaker. Thank you. But yeah, it's not really used to having a right login. Yeah, like in service time.
