I'm going to speak on this topic, and my talk is kind of based on a survey paper that I wrote last year. So, if you're interested in learning more, you can look at the survey paper. And also, I might be a bit sloppy with the references during the talk. So, if you want to, you should look for that proper reference information in the survey paper. And most of what I say will not be really my work. It's mostly a, really, is a survey of some ideas that I've developed in this area, like, say, in the past 10 years. Okay, so so freaking resolution is a map of complex algebraic varieties such that the first variety is smooth and symplectic. The second variety x is affine and usually singular but normal. And i is a resolution of singularities, so it's birational and proper. And also compatible, oh sorry, X is normal, affine, and has a Poisson structure. And pi is compatible with the two Poisson structures. Poisson structure on y coming from symplectic structure and the Poisson structure on X. We have two more things we also impose. More additional structures, let's say. So y into X is called conical. Uh conical. If we are given an action of C star on y and on x compatibly with the math on y and x compatibly with the map such that x has a unique fixed point for this action and the action contracts x to this unique fixed point. X to this unique good point. And also, I won't bother writing this, also the C-star action scales the symplectic form, usually with weight two. And it's called Hamiltonian. If we are given another force action, but this one behaves a bit differently, it's first of all Hamiltonian, so that means it preserves the symplectic for and moreover has a moment map for this action. And we also want that the fixed, there's only finely many fixed points in the upstage, just to our section. What's the role of Y in the first definition? Sorry. When you define Y working quadically, you seem to be using it in also extends on Y. Just that the CSER action does extend, that it acts on Y, but there's no it in general it won't have finding picked points or something or something. Oh, sorry, and also it's compatible. It scales. Oh, sorry, and also it's compatible. It scales this with like 2. Okay, so let's look at some examples. Oh, first of all, I should say this is kind of the idealized definition. There are some examples, including maybe some that will arise in my talk, where some things doesn't quite satisfy all the conditions involved. But they still, even those examples can still be studied in the same framework. Okay, so here's the basic example is when you take one. The basic example is where you take Y as the cotangent bundle of P1 and X to be the nil photon corner of SL2. So, well, you can either think of it as nil photon corners SL2, so those are matrices W UV minus W, where W squared is UV. Another way to think of the same variety is just as C2. The action of Z mod 2. That's the only coordinates of the one. So this acquires its symplectic structure simply as a cotangent bundle. Here's a picture of the map. So of course y and special fiber, which is this P1 sitting over 0. The C star action, conical action is the Star action, conical action is the just scaling linearly here or scaling linearly the fibers here. This Hamiltonian torus action, this just comes from the action of C star on P1. So this basic example is generalized in many ways. Any questions about the basic example? So it's comparing to the previous talk, obviously the main difference is that we're never in the complex situation. Base here is nothing. But in other ways, maybe there's some connections. Maybe some that I don't know about. Okay. The second easy kind of generalization is we can take In easy kind of generalizations, we can take the commutative bundle of a projective space. Certainly we're explained. That's as our y. And it resolves the space of matrices, n by n matrices that are nil podent and square zero and rank one. Cotangent bundle of projector space. More generally, you can take cotangent bundle of partial flag varieties. And specifically, we're probably pretty interested in the cotangent bundle of the full flag variety of SLN. So I'll fill that guy up on the board because it's going to reoccur later. So the way I think of this cotangent model of the full flag variety of SLN is a pair of a matrix and a flag. Matrix and a flag. So here B is a flag and CN and A is a nilpotent operator and CN and A preserves each piece in the file. And there's a I don't know if it's a result or just a conjecture. It's a result or just a conjecture. If you have a cotangent bundle of some x, if t star x is a symbolic resolution, I'll put this in brackets quite sure. Is this englic resolution? Then x must be a partial flag, right? So all the other examples are not cotangent points. Here's another classic example generalizing this C2 mod T mod 2 here. We can look at other Feynman singularities. C2 mod gamma, where gamma is a finite subgroup of SO2, and has a well-studied resolution, which could be constructed by a variety of methods. Can be constructed by a variety of methods. And this resolution, it has one exceptional fiber, just like in that case, there's just one singular point here and one exceptional fiber. And in that exceptional fiber is a chain of P1s, which are connected together according to a Dinkin diagram, which is associated with gamma, but nine horse points. Chain if you want. I mean, not not necessarily just the linear. Here's another set of examples. In fact, it's giving me a little bit of a machine to generate lots of examples. So suppose I have G, any reductive group. And almost, actually always, this group will be a product of copies of GLN. And V some representation. Then we can form the cotangent bundle of V, which just means V directs on V. And we can form the Hamiltonian reduction of this cotangent bundle by the action of G. And so something we write. So I take my cotangent bundle of V, and I'll find it reduced by G, 0, prime, and explain what that means. So this means this cotangent bundle of V, well, it's nothing but V plus its dual, and it comes equipped with a mode of map to G dual. G dual. Well, the math is just takes like x and alpha, the linear function on g, which eats the group, the algebra, and then pairs x on v and then compares against alpha. Not a complicated math. And so this Hamiltonian reduction is defined, you take the zero level of this moment map and then form a projective GIT quotient by the action of g at the parameter chi. So here chi is a character of g. So here chi is a character of G. As I say, typically this G is a product of G L's, and this chi would typically just be the product of three units. That thing is going to be y. And then x is the same thing, but where you use the zero GIT parameter. In other words, you're taking a affine GIT portion. Cool. Yeah? The question about the relationship between two and The relationship between 2 and 4. So in your 4, when you take the hyperKlor quotient versus the zero section or the ordinary symplectic quotient, I mean in 4, the hyperKiller quotient is very nearly the cotangent bundle of the ordinary quotient, right? Uh but it just contains it as an open dense subriding. What you're saying is when it's exactly the cotangent bundle, that's the case where it has to be the part where X has to be the part of the library. Where X has to be part of the library. Yeah, that's right. I mean, I'm not sure it's exactly true that it contains it as an open debt. Well, it contains it in some sense. You could think of this thing as a replacement for the cotangent bundle of the magic. Some kind of quotient of the default. Kind of a replacement of that. Thanks. Okay, so if you just plug in a random group and a random representation, this thing won't be a symplectic resolution, maybe for many reasons. For example, I don't think it's smooth. But there's two settings in which case it does always give you a symplectic resolution that are very well studied. And those settings are called hypercharge varieties and fluid varieties. Like for A. Hyperquiries. For some reason, I'm going to start with query varieties, even though they're slightly more complicated. But with some logic, I'm going to do quiver writes. Okay, so what is quiver variety? So you start with the directed graph and the vertices are either Are either two kinds of vertices. They're either called gauge or called framed. And then you also have a dimension for each vertex. So I'll just do this as an example. We'll be pretty clear what the general situation is. So here's a graph. Those are the three vertices. Those are the edges of the graph. Those are the edges of the graph. The circle ones are the gauged ones. Circle is gauged, and squares are framed. I think the terminology comes from physics, but Alan Knutson told me you should think that this square looks like a frame of a picture, so that's why it's called frame. But I don't know if that's true. I just picked some random numbers, 2, 3, and 4, to put as these dimensions for each vertex. For each vertex. And then what's the G you get out of it? It's just the product of the general linear groups, but just of the gauge vertices. And what's the V? For each edge, you just put the homomorphism between the vector space here and the vector space here. So let's just say when I write 2, it really means like C2. When you write 3, it's C3. 4, C4. So here, for this edge, we get huh C2 C3. C3 and for this edge, we get Han C3 C4. And then you form the this motion, Z star, which has the effect of thinking, you can think about it moving edges backwards. So when you take the dual space, it looks like I'll then your map in the reverse direction. This moment map condition has the effect that the sum The effect that the sum with signs of all the vehicles are going out and back rediverges to zero. But in any case, you take this hyper-valor quotient, if you like, or complex symplectic reduction, and you reach the equivalent variant. So this thing is called the equivalent variety introduced by Nakajima. So this is the So this is a big, big source of these uh synthetic resolutions. For example, the one on the board, this is actually an example where it actually works precisely that it's the cotangent bundle of this quotient. This guy is actually a partial flag variety of inside C four of flags of dimension two and three, and if you take this quotient you get. And if you take this quotient, you get some cotton. What's x? So x is where you didn't write it. That's why I missed it. I could write it. So x, you take the same thing, but you use 0 as your GIT parameter. Well, that means you just take the spec of the GI. That means you just take the spec of the gene variant functions on phi and verse 0. Any other question? What's the role of the gauge or framed nodes? In this example? Yeah. Sorry? Oh, the ones with the circles are the gauge. Yes, but what did you what did you do? Oh, they don't know the only the gauge ones go on the group D. So the other class of big class of examples coming from this construction are the hypersport varieties. Maybe I should say that the this for this particular quiver people like to study is what's called a framed type A quiver. Something looks like this. The direction error is not very important. So this framed type A quiver or framed affine type A quiver where it loops up. Affline type paper where it loops up. So, I guess we'll hear some talks about that later if it's related to both varieties. We'll hear more about them if you're minding stuff. Maybe Andrei Smirn will talk to you. Okay. So the other class of examples that I want to look at from here is where this group G is just a torus. So C star R times. R times. And what's, uh, then I'm supposed to give a representation of the torus. And the easiest way to formulate that representation is to just say I embed this torus, C star to the R, inside C star to the N by some map. And that C star to the N will act on Cf. And that's my weakness. So that's the equation. And there's a a quotient of this math. A quotient of this map. So, in good circumstances, this thing will also be a torus. And then this torus t will act on the resulting Hamiltonian reduction y. I didn't really say in this example, you know, there's a torus that acts on y, that torus is simply coming from the framed vertices. So, this gls of the framed vertices will act on this Hamiltonian. Vertices will act on this Hamiltonian reduction, and particularly the torus inside them will act on the Hamiltonian reduction. And in this setting, the analogous thing is that this quotient torus here will act on that. Let's look at a couple examples of this hyperturic story that relate back to where we started from. Let's take The following. So the data is: I start with this torus and I embed it inside C star to the N. So, for example, I could take just C star and embed it diagonally inside C star to the N. It's a quotient, right? And if I do this example, again, this guy acts on Cn, and I take T star of Cn, and I divide by this number. divide by this diagonal action of C star, it's going to be as, as Steve said, it's going to be the cotangent bundle of the victim. Here's another example. We start with kind of the opposite situation. Rather than diagonal C star, I start with a subtorus consisting of T1 Tn whose product Whose product is one? Like the torus of the group SLN. Density inside C squared. And their quotient, in this case, is just C squared. If we do this example, you actually get, if I take the, again, the projective GIT quotient, you actually get this resolution of you actually get this resolution of the type A binding singularity. So this resolution of C2 minus C minus A. I think my ends are right. I think so. And if you stare at this example a little bit, if you have too much time in your hands and you look at it for too long, you'll convince yourself there's something like dual going on in this example. Here I've swapped this. This example. Here I've swapped this C star here, it's like moved over to here. This torus here has kind of moved over to here. More precisely, these are kind of like dual torus, the Ocean C star, and then this sub-taurus of C stars. So based on this idea, Brayden, like Ada, Kradko, and Webster introduced duality for hyperturic arrays. The definition is extremely simple. Given hypertrophic variety defined by such an embedding in Cn with quotient T form the dual tori. Dual tori just means the torus whose character lattice is the co-character lattice of the original torus. Form dual tori, who's called the Bangladesh dual. Any kind of dual. The dual of C star N. The dual of C star then is double C star then, the dual of G and C star. So form the dual tori, and if this one leads to some Y hypertoric variety, then this one is called the dual hypertoric variety, and I'll write Y upper shoot. So in this example, we see what these guys are doing. And so maybe about almost 15 years ago, let's say, they noticed this duality for hyperturic varieties and they did some work on it. And this, it turned out, though, that, well, first of all, it turned out that this duality for hyperturic varieties could be generalized to Arbitric varieties could be generalized to a duality for any symplectic resolution. So, as we'll discuss soon, every pair is a symplectic resolution. It seems that every symplectic resolution, there is a dual symplectic resolution with some matching properties. I'll discuss those properties. But it also turned out that these dual hypertrophic writers, or more generally these dual symplectic resolutions, had previously been studied like much before in the physics literature. In the physics literature, and coming from duality for 3D supersymmetric filters. So that's why sometimes people call this symplectic duality, and sometimes people call it 3D mirror symmetry. So in the physics literature, it was originally introduced by Literature was originally introduced by Intriligator and Segwit. Okay, there is another class, very interesting class of symplectic resolutions, which I like a lot, but of course I won't have time to talk about them today, which are called a fine-gross monument slices. And maybe from this perspective of what I said, one way to say what they are is they're the duals. Say what they are is they're the duals, synthetic dual to NACA Jim appropriates. Anyway, we'll hear about some of them. Richard Reinhard's talking talks about bulb varieties. Okay, so um Great, so um okay, so those are symptomatic resolutions. Those are some examples, and I told you a little bit about examples of duality. So now I'd like to move on to some different structures that we study on some Blake resolutions. And the first thing I'm going to study is has to do with this Hamiltonian torus action. So if we take a Hamilton So if we take a Hamiltonian torrent's action, x on both y and x, and we can consider the set of all points in y which have a limit for the storage action. I'll call it y plus. Set of all y. Oh, sorry. I'm going to now pick a generic C star. So generically chosen C star inside of T. This C star should not be confused with that other C star, which is The other C star, which is conical C star. Pick a generic C star inside of this source, and I look at the set of all points in the Y, which have a limit for this action. Like if we go back to the first example of C star P1, we have in here the zero section. What's the C star action doing? Well, I remember a comma. action doing? Well remember it comes from the it comes from the C star action on the zero section. So on the zero section certainly every point has a limit. These points get pulled to here. This point is fixed to here. And then upstairs somehow I don't know the point that flows like going like this. So the only things that have a limit are on this spy. So in this case, this T star, T1 situation, this Y plus consists of two irreducible components, the zero section and one point. Of course, which one it is depends on how you choose to see stack. Yeah, and uh since since uh y is smooth and y and the fixed point is the same. Y is smooth and the fixed point set is finite. Each of these things would just be one irreducible component for each fixed point. And they're all the random pieces. And they're all the random pieces. Another feature of the symplagic resolution is that so X remember was So X, remember, was an affine Poisson variety. So it's natural to study its symplectic leaves. And by a result of collated, X always has finally many symplectic leaves. Maybe everything like so. This joint union of some pieces XJ. Union of some pieces xj. And here piece xj is locally closed. And because we have that conical C star action going along and contracting everything to a point, one of these is just a point. That's all I'll call it. Zero. So maybe maybe j runs from zero up to From zero to and xm, this closure is a unique dense syntax to clean disclosure as all of that. So for each point in Y, the set of things which are attracted to Y is isomorphic to a vector space. isomorphic to a vector space, isomorphic to the tangent space. Because y is smooth. There aren't really any keybird. And so this y plus decomposes as a union of those affine spaces. And then, well, they get closed. These components are the closures of those affine spaces. The same thing is not true on X. On X, you can, I do know the tail, but there's also If if I do not say this, but there's also X plus introduced right here, which is just exactly the same thing, but on X. On X, there's actually only one fixed point under the hypothesis that this torus action and the conical C star action agree. There's only one fixed point in X. And so this E exists is the same thing as equals zero. equals zero. And there there's like multiple components in the multiple components all sitting at the same fixed point. But in Y there's just one arch. Maybe another example, just to fix the ideas, if y is the cotangent bundle of a flag variety, then this y plus is the union of the conormals of the shape. Is the union of the conormals of the sugar itself? If that helps people in mind, the y is the cotengeman of the projective space, this y plus is the, is the, there's the co-normals of each of the sub-projective spaces. Okay, so X has finally many systems. So X has finally many syntactically used. And now we're going to study the interplay between these guys and these guys. And the key tool is the following. So we're going to be interested in H of Y plus. By definition, this is the top Borel-Moore homology. Borel-Moore homology, the top Borel-Moore homology of R plus. So just a vector space, like with complex coefficients. So just a vector space with one with basis given by those irregularities. And we can study this topology using this symplectic leaves. How? Well, we have something called the Well, we have something called the, we apply the Bailsid virginity delete decomposition theorem. And we can use it to prove that we have a following decomposition of h of y plus as a direct sum over these leaves of the top homology of the attracting set of the leaf closure. Of the leaf closure, again this top homology, to answer the top homology of a fiber over that leaf. Picture. So here's my X, which has like some leaves, and they're kind of singular. Things are getting more and more singular down here. And then there's Y sitting upstairs. And then as you go through these more singular... As you go through these more singular leaves, you get sort of bigger fibers sitting over them. The biggest point is the fiber. Here's your point. So here Fj is the pre-image of some point in some image. Fj is something another capital. And um this is the same thing. And this decomposition has like the first piece when j is 0. So when j is 0, that's when the x0 is a point. And then we just have the fiber over this very singular point. This fiber over the very singular point, so just remember back to the beginning, I have y going to x, and I have this special singular point in x, which is where everything is contracted to by that conical action. Do by that conical action. And there is this fiber over that called F0, and it's called the core of Y. So it's not hard to prove that the Y has a deformation retraction onto this core. So it captures actually all the topology of this core. Right now, we're only interested in the top tomology of this topology. Okay, so the first piece of this thing is the core. There's a home topology of the core, then there's some stuff. And then the last piece. There's some stuff. And then the last piece, the fiber is trivial. Yeah, so in this first piece, the tracking set is trivial, just a point. And in the last piece, the fiber is trivial, and the tracking set is interesting. We negative h of x bar. x bar, I guess so. x plus. x plus is the same as x kind of Okay, that looks a little like abstract. Let's look at it in our examples of C2 minus Z minus N and T star n minus one. So if we take C star mod Z mod n, there's only two leaves downstairs. This C2 mod Z mod n, well, picture of it, we can just use the, reuse our old picture of this cone, so it has one singular point and then the rest is my stuff. And if we apply this decomposition, we get, again, there's one We get, again, there's only two pieces, so I don't need all this dot dot dot. I just have this part and this part. So I get h of the f0. And the fiber over zero, that's that core. In this case, that fiber consists of a chain of n minus one p1s. So this has dimension n minus one. It's the topology of this space of n minus one, p1s. Space of n minus 1 p1. So each of the p1s contributes to topology. And on the other hand, if I look at x plus, in this case, x plus is just, well, there's C2 mod C mod n. X plus, just, X is just C2 mod C mod N. X plus, it turns out you can say it's just an affine space. And this is just one. So we get n minus one plus one, and this is equal to. 1, and this is equal to. On the other hand, if we take y to be our other favorite example, t star pn minus 1, this kind of dual example, we get a similar decomposition, but now the fiber, so the fiber is just Pn minus 1, the core of this core variety. This quote variety, like your resolution, it's just pn minus 1 because that's the, this map to x just contracts this pn minus 1, so p n minus 1, so that's just one dimension. Plus, but on the other hand, this space here is quite interesting. So this is the, this is the, let's see what it is, it was the upper triangular, this plus ends up being upper triangular, upper triangular, square zero. Square 0, rank 2. Matrices. Well, probably people have not thought about that space before. But if you do think about it carefully, you can check that it has n minus 1 here as 4. And so we see that in these cases, these two what we call dual cases from the beginning, we see that the total We see that the total sum is the same, but this n minus 1 has moved over from the fiber side to this side here. The one maybe is less convincing, let's move the other way. So, this leads to one aspect of synclectic duality. Okay, so let me call this thing the comological comological. What we think are what we do. Then there's an order of reversing bijection between the symplectic leaves. The symplectic leaves are naturally ordered by their uh containment and enclosure. Uh containment and enclosure. Um and an identification of this topology of the attracting sense, but in a way which which does this mixing such that So here was our in-oppation. There was our decomposition. And the other guy is going to have a similar decomposition, but with the roles of the The roles of the, firstly, there's a switch of the order because of this order reversed by ejection. And secondly, the roles of these guys and these guys simply reverse. So switch to h of fj is equal to page of x plus j sh. x shriek means we're now on the dual side, and j shriek means we've used this bijection. And similarly, h of x j square. So this is just a way of rewriting this thing, observation, in the general case. So what, like, this is not a theorem, it's just like when you have a pair of varieties which you suspect are simple, Varieties which you suspect are symplectic dual, you should try to prove this. That's what it's like. Or conversely, if you can prove this, then you're like justified in calling them symplectic dual. And this isomorphism between H is kind of canonical, or it's just that dimensions are equal? It's more than just that the dimensions are equal. But I mean, for example, these isomorphisms here have some varieties, but maybe these varieties might have very different dimensions. These varieties might have very different dimensions than something like this. No canonic plus. Yeah. Somehow that gets to one problem, which is how really geometrically can you connect the two sides, one side of the dual and the other side of the dual. So in that hyperturic situation, there was a recipe really for starting from the data for one variety and producing the data for the other variety. Then you could hopefully write those kinds of ways more. But in general, there's not exactly such a recipe. There is such a recipe in some cases called, which is studied by Robin Finkelberg and Akajima, but I don't have time. Let's see. Okay, what I wanted to talk about next was quantization. Maybe we just have time for that. So the idea now is to Now is to categorify this isomorphism. So here we have an isomorphism just the vector spaces. So rather we would like an equality of categories such that this isomorphism obtained above both of the groups. And the tool for categorifying this isomorphism is to study a category of modules over the quantization. So another fact about simplicity resolutions proved by Hilleyden. Proved by Kaleyden is that Y has a canonical family of quantizations. So there's some algebra A, which contains a subalgebra, unit of subalgebra, central subalgebra. The algebra functions on the H2 of functions. On the H2 requirements. And for any chi in this H2, if I specialize this algebra at chi, so I tensor over this thing, tensor A over this subalgebra with C for this character. I'll call it A chi. I'll call it A chi. If this is a quantization of y, so this is as a retreat, is a filtered algebra. So it's that associated graded related to the functions on the applied writing x. There there's also a sheep version of this where you have a quantization of the structures you apply. Of the structure sheet of one. So, what do we want to study about this? Well, this is an algebra, so maybe we just give some examples of the negative three-related crazy thing. If we take our, one of our favorite examples, the cotangent bundle of a flag variety, if I think, then this A chi is the same thing as the universal enveloping algorithm of SLN, specialized at a given central character. A given central character. This thing here can be thought of as kind of the center of the developing algebra S line. And when we do this, we're binding up by an ideal generated height by a central parameter. So pretty good. So this modulus for this thing is something very well studied. And representation theory is just modulus for SLN with given central character. So the study of these algebras generalizes a lot of the classical. A lot of uh plastic will be. Um what do we want to study about these algebras? Well, um let's recall that we have our torus action, T, this Hamiltonian torus, and we have that C star inside the torus which we used in order to define the upper triangular part, the attracting notice. So this thing acts on our Y, but it also will act on this quantization. But it also will act on this quantization k, or one particular quantization a chi. And then we have the positively graded part of a chi. So those consists of those algebra elements, which are the span of all algebra elements, which are eigenvectors for the c star with the positive eigenvalues. I mean, sorry, I mean, that's not a floor. I mean, sorry, I made that sound more confusing than it is. A chi, this C star x on A chi is the same as a z grading on A chi, and this just means the positive part of that z grading. So then we study what's called category O for A chi. So this generalizes the category O in the setting of simple Lie algebras. So category O for A chi is the category of A chi modules such that Such that this positive part acts locally normally. So the good news about this study of this category allows us to categorify this feature of y plus plain half. In this category O there is a characteristic cycle of M. So this generalizes the notion of a characteristic cycle of T modules. And this characteristic cycle lives And this characteristic cycle lives in this H of Y plus. So, by definition, you pick a filtration on M compatible with this filtration on V pi. You take the associated gradient of that filtration. That gives you a, because the filtration is a good filtration, that gives you a coherent sheet. You get to find the generated module in this algebra. And because of this local low potency, it's supported on X. And then you do a sheet of. On X plus. And then you do a sheet theoretic version to actually get it on like this. This gives a map from the growth in the group of this category 1, 4y plus to hyplus. And this map is an isomorphism in good cases. I don't quite remember. Maybe even with the hypothesis I wrote out at the beginning of the time. Maybe even with the hypothesis I wrote out at the beginning of the talk, it's hypothetical, it's always a hypothesis. And so this leads to sort of an upgrade of this symbolic duality statement here that was written here. So instead of just asking that we have an isomorphism between this h of y plus and the h of y plus for the dual, we'll Y plus with a dual, will demand, will look for an equivalence of categories. And from doing computations, this equivalence of categories takes a particular form of a causal dual. So conjecture or a statement. A theorem in some cases. Conjecture slash theorem. Into the nine into the category O what takeai and category OK I've made some mysterious but since that's a pretty Sound mysterious because it's a particular equivalence between this derived category and this derived category. So, this theorem has been proven, this was proven. I prefer. I prefer to write it by Brayden. Okay, I won't bother writing the actual people. I have my Brayden Licata Crowdford Webster. And for quicker varieties, slash where their jewels are Alfine Gross Blaine's license. And by myself and Peter Tingley and Ben Webster and Alex Weeks and Digital Co. And maybe I'll just basically out of time I had a lot more to say but I'm basically out of time maybe I'll just say one last thing which is that very recently if this categorification wasn't enough complication recently uh Ben Gambage Ben Gavage and Justin Hilbert recently, like a few days ago, put a paper on the archive when they're proposing a categorification of this categorification. So they propose, and part of the reason why I'm mentioning because it seems like kind of the book here I like. So on the left will be some kind of two-category. Which is here the two categories, two categories, not two categories, but two different categories were kind of the same category, and now they're going to be different categories on the sites. So they're going to be two different two categories. So they call this one two category of A type and two category of B type. And this one, if I understand correctly, is related to Is related to this Rosensky, it's called sometimes Rosensky Widen here Rosansky and Kovrana. I mean, what's that? And this one is uh some kind of uh two-dimensional version of the Picaya category, which I think is not not studied much. So pretty told them where I was V type is the tossing of V tables. Oh, yeah, yeah, quite so quite simple. Yes. And that's supposed to be a categorification of this equivalence. And then I don't know too much about their work, but they did study this. They, again, working in the hyperturs. Again, working in the hypertoric setting. So, usually, in this hypertoric setting, is the case where people try things out because it's the easiest to. In fact, I think the example they work as is simpler than any example that I thought. It's like a sort of degenerate version of this. It's like this T star Pn minus one versus C two mod C1N, but like when N is like when N is zero, But n equals zero. No, that makes sense. And you get that thing. It's like n equals zero or something. Did I identify what corresponds to cost view type of ideology? Are there any questions for Joe? So this current Higgs branch is what is one of them is drawing steps. Yeah, another name for this to say a few words about that since I sort of meant to say something about it and it ran out of time. Just two answers to your question? So, okay, let me take the general answer, which I don't. Okay, let me tell you the general answer, which I don't know much about. Now to make it more specific. So in general, there's this notion of 3D supersymmetric n equals coordinate supersymmetric quantum field theory. And this thing produces two outputs, one of which is called the X branch and one of which is called the Coulomb branch. So from this physics thing, you can produce two manifolds, which break varies. One called the Higgs branch and one called the Coulomb branch. And these are supposed to always be symplectic cool. And now there's a special case of this, which is quite related to what I talked about. One source of these 2D n equals 4 3D sequential. N equals four 3D sequentially field theories is what's called 3D gauge theory. So you start with the same data of a G and a V group, a vector group, and a representation. Okay, so in this case, the Higgs branch of this is nothing but what I wrote down earlier in the talk, potentially bundler of P. And the Coulomb branch The cooler branch is more complicated, and now I have an excuse for writing it down. So, this is in the work of Barbara and Fenkelberg and Negajima. They gave a mathematical definition of the Coulomb branch of such a gauge theory. They defined this variety that goes here. And it's sort of complicated, but I'll just write it down. So, you start by studying the following space, R, which is R, which is a pair of P S. So where P is a principal G bundle on a bad version of P1, very bad version of P1, you take two disks and you glue them along a punctured disk. Call it a ravioli curve. And S is a section of the associated disk. And S is a section of the associated beep. And this what's a bit what's remarkable is that this homology of this base carries the structure of a community algebra and you take spec of it. Well, maybe stack carries the structure of a community of algebra. And you take spec of it, and that's x. So, like the cool thing. So, this is the right I was alluding to, this one instance where we do know sort of how to go from here to here. Exactly. We know how to go from this data to both things. So, this duality is proved in that example? This Kuzule duality? Basically, yeah. It was proved in it's pretty closely related to this work here, but in this more general giggs Kuzlov setting, yeah, it was proved by what. Yeah, it was proven by websites. So in the categorified version, you still choose a one-parameter subgroup, but only on one side, right? What does that choice correspond to the other side? Actually, you choose it on both sides. Because you have, in this version here? Yes. Because you had a category O. Um because you had a category O on both sides, so you have to choose one on the other side. Just surprise, I could usually a choice of a chamber on one side corresponds to a choice of a stability condition on the other side. Yeah, it's true. Yeah, that's true too. Yeah, let me explain that. So in a symplectic duality, in general, there is an isomorphism, like classic resources. Only if it's very short. It's very short. So this H2 Y is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the torus acting on the dual side. So when you choose chi in here, In here, that chooses the stability condition. Well, you can see it when I'm not letting it over. Maybe what I should have said is this. When you choose the chi, two chi's in my top, which is probably bad. When I choose this chi, the one that was used to form a chi, so that was a parameter that we're. So that was a parameter that lifted here. And that corresponds on this side to an element of this, the algebra that corresponds to a map from C star into this T shriek. So the choice of the C star in T shriek corresponded to the choice of this kind of central character. Yeah? Are there any sense images in the infinite dimension? Sense in which is an infinite-dimensional version of this story. I'm just thinking about the connection with things like gauge systems, because I could take B to be an affine space, infinite-dimensional affine space that's a representation of the gauge group. And so that would be my B and G. I could, of course, form the hypertailing quotient in exactly the same way moment maps to the gauge group on the on the left side. That's the way you're constructing mod dot space that consists of is there any sense of um of the Any sense of a branch could be on the right side for that kind of data? Not that I know of. Is there ever a telemont though at some point? Something along these lines? I don't know. It's quite possible, but I never read too much sense of this business, so I don't know. I should say one other thing about this kind of construction is one other thing that's kind of interesting. Another thing that's kind of interesting, maybe people are thinking about recently, is what happens when you put a V which is not a vector space manifold or any algebraic grind. You could do the same construction. That occurs in the recent work of Benzi, Sakaridas and Venkafetch. It makes sense to talk about sections of E bundles. Questions? We should I think John Jump just
