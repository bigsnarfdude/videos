For the introduction, Mike, and thanks to all the organizers for organizing this online event and for having me talk here. It's of course nice to see all of your faces on the screen, but I hope we will have a live workshop in the not too distant future again. Okay, and I should say that everything I talk about today is joint work with John Cremona from Warwick. John Cremona from Warwick. And so, before I go any further, I will state a few definitions and conventions. So, an isogeny, if no field is stated, in this talk, will always be defined over Q bar. So, we will only look at elliptic curves over number fields and so and we will suppose that all number fields are embedded in some fixed algebraic closure of Q. Closure of Q. And an elliptic curve is called a Q curve if it is isogenous to all of its Galois conjugates. And as noted above, I'll repeat, if E is a Q curve over a number field, it is not necessarily isogenous over K to its conjugates, but it has to be isogenous over some Galois extension. As this is a workshop about Diefenteen equations, I should mention. Equations, I should mention that Q curves have been extensively used in the Diefante equations, in particular in the modulum method, to solving Fermat-type equations. And in particular, it is often crucial to understand the Galois representations of these Q curves. And here I will list a series of results which have been obtained by using Q curves to solve the generalized Fermi equation. To solve the generalized Fermi equations. So I think the first to do this was Ellenberg to apply Q curves to Diefente equations. And so I will not read out the equations as they won't be relevant for this talk, but you can see them yourself here on the slide. But I should mention that other people that contributed to this were Bennettung, Dule Fe, Freitas, Chen, Daman and Yazdani. Damon and Yasdani. And I'm sure I'm leaving someone out, so if I am, please do let me know after the talk. Okay, and even if you don't, in general, not just talking about Diefanten equations, Q-curves are interesting as Ribet proved, assuming Serres' conjecture, which was later proved, that Q-curves are exactly the elliptic curves over number fields that are modular in the sense. That are modular in the sense of being quotients of j1 of n for some value n. And then, of course, we have the natural question, what are the examples of Q-curves? And first, the theory of complex multiplication tells us that CM elliptic curves are always Q-curves. Also, more or less trivially, an elliptic curve that is defined over Q is also a Q-curve. Q curve. Then base changing a Q curve does not change. I mean the property of being a Q curve does not change upon base change. Then a twist of a Q curve remains a Q curve also. A curve that is isogenous to a Q curve is also a Q curve. Then an elliptic curve with rational J invariant is also a Q curve. I I guess you can work this out simply from some of these properties above. Some of these properties above. And then we can put these sets of elliptic curves that I already mentioned above in some kind of tower of sets, which I will mention a lot in this talk. So we have the set of all elliptic curves, which contain the set of Q curves, which then contains the set of elliptic curves that are isogenous to an elliptic curve with rational J invariant, which contains elliptic curves that have rational J invariants themselves. Invariants themselves, which then contain elliptic curves, which are base changes of elliptic curves over Q. And as I said already, elliptic curves with complex multiplications are also Q curves, but they do not fit so nicely in this tower of sets of elliptic curves. And I will mention these sets a lot, so I want to put some notation. Put some notation for these sets. So, Q curves I will denote by Q C. Curves that are isogenous to elliptic curves with rational J invariant, I will denote by IJ. Elliptic curves that have rational J invariants, I will denote by J. And base changes of elliptic curves by B. So I try to make the notation as natural as possible. And this tower of sets, the one that I used. The one that you saw in the previous slide looks like this using this notation. And the question that I want to address in my talk is which statements about Gala representations of elliptic curves in each of these sets can be proved? In particular, I will, of course, talk mostly about Q curves. And in particular, are degrees of isogenies and sizes of torsion groups bounded? It. And I should say that I will not talk about CM elliptic curves. Their Gala representations, I would say, are now well understood. There's work of Brudhon, Clark, and their collaborators, also of Lozano Robledo, building, of course, on work of many other people and a lot of classical results. So if you're interested in something about CM elliptic curves, you should look up their papers. Okay, so what do I want to do with this tower of sets? So you can also intersect this tower of sets with a certain set of elliptic curves and then you still get this kind of tower of set. This tower of sets just intersected with some set at every set at every point of the way. So for example, we will intersect with elliptic curves defined over the green D number fields. Green D number fields. And so for each of these sets S and for D, I will denote by S of D the set of all such elliptic curves. So in each of these sets, which are defined over all number fields of degree D. And by T of S, I will denote the set of all possible torsion groups of elliptic curves in each of these sets S. And so we want to prove something about. To prove something about isogeny bounds and torsion bounds for Q curves over general number fields, so for arbitrary large degree, but let's start with bounds for over Q quadratic fields because as you will see something interesting already happens there so for maybe not over Q, so for Q it's not so interesting so each of these sets contains only one field, Q itself, and Maser proved that the torsion groups Prove that the torsion groups over Q are these 15 groups that you see here. And CN will be for easier notation just be a cyclic group of order n. And over quadratic fields, something much more interesting happens. So what happens is that in each step, if we look at torsion groups over quadratic fields, we get different sets in each step of the way, apart from this set in the middle, which I guess no one yet. Set in the middle, which I guess no one yet looked at. So I won't read out the authors of the results, you can read them out also here on this slide. So torsion groups, the set of torsion groups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields contains this set of 26 groups, I think. And if you look at base changes of elliptic curves over Q, then you get four groups less. Less and if you look at elliptic curves with Rafian J invariant, then you get one group more than you did for base changes of elliptic curves over Q. And if you like a look at Q curves, then you get two more groups. And so you get basically all of these groups here, 26 of them, except for there is no 11 torsion. And since I'm also talking about Gala representations of Galard representations of Q curves, I should mention the result of Samuel Lafourn that over any imaginary quadratic field, Serres uniformity conjecture is true for curves that are Q curves, but are not isogenous to an elliptic curve with rational J invariant and do not have a Cm. And this is, as far as I know, the only example where a series uniformity conjecture is proven in full for some, well, I would say interesting set of curves. Well, I would say interesting set of curves. And I think there's another interesting question here, and this is the inverse question. So take elliptic curves with a certain property, say with a certain torsion group, and ask where in this tower of sets of elliptic curves do such elliptic curves appear. And some examples of this are elliptic curves with 13 torsion. And you can look You can look at all elliptic curves over all quadratic fields with 13 torsion, and it ends up that they all appear right here. So, none of them appear here, and all of them appear here. So, all of them have rational J invariant, but none of them are base changes. Elliptic curves with 18 torsion, all of them appear exactly here. So they're Q curves, but not isogenous to an elliptic curve with rational J invariant. And elliptic curves with 16 torsion are all base changes. So, why did we look at these three groups, 13, 16, and 18? Well, these are exactly the modular curves x1 of n, which are hyperelliptic. So, you can do the same thing for x0 of n, and then you get, well, this list of n's. And these are hyper elliptic, these are all, apart from n equals 37, these are all the hyper elliptic modular curves. Modular curves x0 of n, and it turns out that all but finitely many of them have all curves with an n-isogeny except finitely many explicit stated exceptions are exactly Q-curves. And I should also mention that Osman, Siksek, and Box also have results about elliptic curves with n isogenies over quadratic fields, but for n's where there is only finitely many isogenies. There is only finitely many isogenies. And also, in regard to this question, I saw later that Abby has a talk about sporadic points and isolated points. And well, at least as far as I know, most of the, or all the points that I know, isolated points and sporadic points end up being somewhere low in this tower. They I don't know whether I know a single example of a sporadic point w w which is really here and not here. Really, here and not here. Okay, so now on to what is basically the topic of this talk is a torsion bounce over general number fields. So torsion bounce and an isogenic bounce. So, well, very famously, Morel proved that if you look at the torsion groups of elliptic curves over degree D number fields, then there is a bound on the size of the torsion. Of the torsion and the bound depends only on the degree of the number field, not the field itself, and not the elliptic curve itself. So you can think, I mean, can you do any better? You already have bounds here, depending on D. Can one hope to do any better anywhere lower in the tower? And the answer is yes, you can do much better if you restrict these in a certain way. So, for example, if you look at base changes of elliptic curves. If you look at base changes of elliptic curves over Q, over degree D number fields, where D is not divisible by any small primes, then the size of the torsion is bounded by an absolute number, not depending on D, by 16. And if you look at elliptic curves with rational J invariance over prime degree number fields, then the size of the torsion is bounded by 28. And our result is that if you go up to here, then the size of the Then the size of the order of torsion groups of Q curves for prime degree number fields is bounded again by 16. And so we don't prove anything for the small primes, but I would be very surprised if the bound was not 28 if you include all the primes. And I should really say that these kinds of results really stop right here. They stop with the Q curves. You cannot hope to have results like this for general elliptic curves. Like this for general elliptic curves. So if you take any set of these, infinite set of these, then the size of the torsion groups of elliptic curves over these degrading number fields will always be unbounded. So really this bound is something that stops with Q curves. And okay, now onto isogeny bounds. So as you can see, we have this tower of sets. I'm repeating it so you don't have to put an Repeating it so you don't have to put an effort and remember anything. So, with I of S, I denote the set of degrees of possible degrees of cyclic isogenies of elliptic curves in a set S. And in this case, you should note that this I does not distinguish between J and B. The the and uh the property of having an anisogeny does not change upon quadratic twist. Change upon quadratic twist. And in fact, much less is known about isogenies than for torsion groups over general, well, over any kinds of number fields. So the only result that for any number field at all, that one knows all the possible degrees is over Q. And this was proven by Maser and Kenku. So Maser proved the determined the prime degree isogenies, and Kenku determined the Determine the composite ones. But if you restrict to these smaller sets, then one can again get much better results. So I proved a few years back that the largest prime, if you look at elliptic curves here, so isogenous to those with a rational J invariant, and which do not have Cm over general degree D number fields, then this is bounded by 3d minus 1. And this bound is, so I mean, this. Bound is so, I mean, this is the bound that I could unconditionally get, but it's really the best possible bound is d minus one if we assume a weaker conjecture version of Sergei uniformity conjecture. And this weaker version is that the mod P Galois representation for large enough P is always either surjective or is the full normalizer of the non-split Cartan. And this has been proved for in a very nice recent paper by Lefourne and Lemos. By Lefourne and Lemos for a large enough P. Okay, and what we prove is we prove similar kinds of results for Q curves. So I should say here that to get these kinds of bounds, you really need to exclude elliptic curves with Cm. As if you include elliptic curves CM simply the set of primes will be infinite. So let L be the set of Let L be the set of primes that the isogeny primes that appear over Q. And then we prove that the primes that divide the isogeny degrees of Q curves over odd degree number fields are exactly these, if you exclude CM elliptic curves. And if D is not divisible by any of these primes, then the largest composite or any isogeny for a Q curve. Any isogeny for a Q curve over such a degree D number field is 37. And for any odd D and for any Q curve over a degree D number field, the degree of an isogeny is bounded by something dependent just on D. Okay, so these are the results we prove. And now I want to give in the remaining what A. Give in the remaining eight minutes or so a short sketch of how the proof should go and on the way introduce some theory of some of the theory of Q curves. Okay, so as the property of being a Q curve is both twist and isogeny invariant, we see that this is a property in fact of the Q bar isogeny class. And well so we can equate elliptic curves with J invariant. Can equate elliptic curves with J invariants. So we introduce the relation on Q bar of J1 being in relation with J2 if elliptic curves E1 and E2 with these J invariants are in the same isogeny class. And this is an equivalence relation. So this gives us a partition of Q bar into isogeny classes. And we will say that an isogeny class is a Q class if elliptic curves in it are Q curves. So either all or none of them are. curves. So either all or none of them are Q curves. And we will say that the class is rational if it contains a rational J and you should note that if you were listening carefully that the rational class is automatically a Q class. And to a pair of non CM CM J one and J two in the same class we define the degree between J one and J two. Between J1 and J2 to be the degree of a cyclic isogeny between elliptic curves with those J invariants. And we call an element J of a Q class a Q number. And the degree of a Q number J is the least common multiple of the degrees between J and its Galois conjugates. And a particularly important Q numbers are so called Q central Q numbers. Are so-called central Q numbers. So, Q number is central if it has square free degree, in which case its Galois conjugacy class is called the central conjugacy class. And a priori, it's not even obvious that central classes exist in each Q class. And the existence of a central class in a Q class has first been proved by Elkis in 1994. And as you will see, these central classes play a great role in an important role in the theory of Q curves and in And the theory of Q curves, and in particular, in our work. So, what Elkie's also follows from Elki's work is that if you let Q be a non-CM Q class, then all central classes C in Q satisfy that their cardinality is a power of 2, so 2 to the rho for some row. So, and the field obtained by adjoining these J invariants in C, Q C is. J invariance in C. QC is a polyquadratic field with its Galois group Z mod 2 Z to the power rho. And the square degree n of one and hence all of these J's in this central class has R prime factors, where R is some integer larger or equal to rho. And furthermore, we have R equals zero if and only if rho is equal to zero, which is equivalent to Q being rational. And the quantities And the quantities n, r, and rho and the field qc are the same for each central class in q. So they depend only on the q class itself. And we denote them with n of q, r of q, and rho of q and l of q, respectively. And in particular, this field, we'll call it the core field, plays a particular importance. And it's an open problem. How large can these n are and the How large can these nr and rho be for uh for q curves? Are they bounded? So I think one would expect that they are, and I think Elkis also conjectures something. I'm not sure whether he conjectures exactly this or something in this direction. And if you want to state this in points on modular curves, then you're asking yourself when do quotients of x0 by groups of Atkin linear involutions have non-caspital Q points. Caspital Q points. And here is an example that I drew. So, this is what basically elliptic curves with 26 isogenies over quadratic fields look like, with finitely many exceptions. So, these elliptic curves with 26 isogenies over quadratic fields will be J1, J2, J2 sigma, and J1 sigma. And I also added these J3, J4, J5, J6. These live in a quadratic extension of our quadratic field. So, K is a quadratic field, L is a quadratic extension just to. L is a quadratic extension just to make this isogeny diagram more interesting. And J1 and J1 sigma are in one class, J2, J2 Sigma in another conjugacy class, and the fourth conjugacy class are these remaining J invariants. And you can see that these classes C1 and C2 are central. The degrees of all elements in them are 26, and the degrees of these remaining elements are 104. So here we have that. So here we have that n is 26, this is the degree from j1 to j1 sigma, and rho is 1, so there's two elements in the central class, and r is equal to 2, so n has two prime divisors. Okay, and let's recall this lemma. This is a lemma for general elliptic curves, but it will be useful. Curves, but it will be useful for us. So, say you have an elliptic curve E1 defined over a number field K1 and E2 defined over K2, and suppose they are isogenous over Q bar. Then you have that E1 is isogenous to a twist of E2 over the compositum of these two fields. So, you don't have to go too far up to get the field of definition of this isogeny. And maybe the key thing which lets us prove the results we prove. Which lets us prove that the results we prove is that if you take a Q class, which is non-CM, and then this score field LQ is contained in Qj for any J in the Q class. So somehow when acting with the Galois group on this Q class, everything somehow rotates around this core field. So and these central classes defined over the core field. And immediately what we get. And immediately what we get is that 2 to the rho, so a power of 2 divides Qj, the degree of Qj over Q, so for any J in the Q class. And another corollary is that, I mean, what we get is that any Q curve E over a number field K is K isogenous to a central curve, which is itself a Bayes change of an elliptic curve over a polyquadratic field. So, what this lets us So, what this lets us do is the following. So, we recall the theorem, another theorem of Elkis. So, every non-CMQ curve over a number field K is K bar isogenous to an elliptic curve defined over a polyquadratic field. This is what Elkis proved. And we prove, well, the same. And if you look carefully, you will see that there's just a little bit less. So, it's really k-isogenous. And this ends up being the key difference because this allows us to prove that. Well, allows us to prove that if the non-CM Q class Q contains an element J such that Q of J has no quadratic subfields, so for example J can be defined over an odd degree number field, then Q is a rational class. And this turns out to be very important because of the following. That means that using the notation that I used before, that for all odd integers d, we have that the same. D, we have that the set of Q curves over the grid in number fields are just a set of elliptic curves that are isogenous to an elliptic curve with rational Q J invariant. And Galois representations of curves here are comparatively well understood because I mean we know what Galois representations of elliptic curves over Q look like. Well, good enough. And then you can work out what these look like. What these look like. You base change and then you twist and then you take isogeny. So you can, in a sense, still control this somewhat. And finally, we also develop a quick algorithm, which for in this paper, our theory allows us to develop this algorithm, which for an input of an elliptic curve quickly determines whether the given curve is a Q curve or is not. Okay, and I'll swap there. And I'll stop there. So, if you're interested in this, the paper is online on my webpage and also on Archive since Friday. Okay, thanks. Great. Thanks very much. People come. Any questions or comments? Any questions or comments for Philip? So, hi Philip. So, these Q curves are closely related to these modular abelian varieties. So, they're the one-dimensional building blocks using PALS terminology. So, I was just wondering, can this be extended to higher-dimensional building blocks? I haven't really thought about that, but I'm not sure. I wouldn't be too optimistic because I mean, all of these results, if you go to a billion varieties, you basically don't know anything. At least that's my impression. Okay. Hi, Philip. This is Emin. Hi. Hi. You mentioned that when you When you're considering the problem for general elliptic curves versus Q curves, for instance, looking at torsion, there's a qualitative difference. How does that show up in the proof? Well, I mean, it shows up. Maybe I can share the screen again. Oh, I'm still sharing it. Yes. Oh, okay. Then, well, here, I mean. Then, well, here, I mean, you get this. To prove our results, you really need to get this. You have to somehow connect. I mean, the thing is, you know a lot about Gala representations about elliptic curves over Q. And you know nothing, I mean, basically, you know nothing about general number fields. So, here you really use the fact that you somehow connect it to Galois representations over Q. Okay, thank you. Any other questions or comments for Philip? Yeah, I had a question, although you might have just answered it. So you have these results for bounding torsion and bounding isogeny degrees where we can do better for Q curves than we can in general. I was going to ask about sort of more general MAZ or B. About sort of more general Mazer B type of questions. Can you classify the model Gala representations that can arise or say more about it than we can in the general case? Yeah, I guess you can. It depends what you know over Q. So this somehow these kinds of results let you connect to what you know over Q to more general things like elliptic curves isogenous to over Q bar to those Q curves and things like that. So yeah. And things like that. So, yeah, if you know the results over queue, you can. So, is that automatic? Like, I mean, no, I mean, you have to put in a bit of effort. Like, so we know that any counterexamples to Sarah's question over Q have to show up as either the normalizer of the non-split or an index three subgroup. Could you say something comparable for Q curves? Well, I don't think so. Well, I I don't think so. I mean uh you you have this uh result of Samuel that that uh you have serious uniformity conjecture o over over fixed imaginary quadratic number fields if you restrict to Q curves with which don't have rational J invariant and which are not C M. So I guess in some cases in this one case you have something better. I have a question. One of the things that shows up in Rivet's theory, along with Pyle and Guitar and others, is the endomorphisms of the restriction of scalars of a Q curve down to subfields. Usually that's about the precise and sometimes subtle nature of the isogenies between a Q curve and its isogenous curve. But it sounds And it's isogenous curve. But it sounds like, with the advances that you've made, is it now clear that if you had a Q-curve in hand, that you could understand the endomorphism rings or algebras of the restrictions of scalars in some kind of explicit or algorithmic way? That's a good question. I don't know whether I could say something now from the top of my head. Well, I guess. I guess, I mean, if you have an isogeny from E to E sigma, then this will somehow show in the endomorphism ring. So if you can somehow bound, yeah, but this will not show about over degree the number fields, over odd degree number fields. I don't know. I will say something wrong if I say now. I'll think about this. Okay, thanks. Okay, thanks. Cool. Any final comments for Philip? If not, let's thank him again and ask maybe he could send a link to the paper into the Zulu chat or like that. So thanks again, Paul. Thanks. So, the recording has stopped. We'll have a break for a few minutes and we start back again.
