She would talk about logarithmic sovereign inequalities on non-isotropic Heisenberg groups. Thanks very much for the introduction and also thanks very much for the invitation. So this is based on a joint work with Marcia Gordina and also some ongoing work. Here's the outline of my talk. I will first recall the Loksobolev on Recall the Log Soboleph on Rn, and then I'll move on to our setting non-isotropic Heisenberg groups, which are the simplest non-trivial example in the hypoelliptic setting. And after that, I'll discuss some applications of our result and some of our method. And if time allows, I will also talk about some further directions. Let's recall the log-soberlifting equality on Rn. Sober left inequality on Rn. So Rn, if we take the Gaussian measure here and the density is the Gaussian kernel, that's the heat kernel at the time t equals one. Then we have the following inequality. That is, the entropy can be bounded by a constant capital C times the feature information. And the constant here. And the constant here is independent of the dimension n. This means it enables us to extend this result to some infinite dimensional setting where Sobo-Life inequalities are not available. However, what are behind this is, first, you need the ellipticity of the generator. That's the Laplacian RM. Second, you need the rich-lower bound. You don't see that. Lower bound. You don't see that much on Rn because Rn is the flat model in Riemannian geometry. However, more generally, the log-Sobolev constant does depend on the richer lower bound, but still independent of the dimension. Last but not the least, as you can see, we need the heat kernel and its smoothness to prove this inequality. Now, let us move on to the setting. Us move on to the setting where most of those items on the previous slides fell down. So let's consider the non-isotropic Heisenberg group modeled on a finite dimensional symplectic space. So let's take a finite dimensional symplectic space V omega and this group can be regarded as Be regarded as the symplectic space V times R1, but equipped with a non-commutative group law in the last R1 copy given by this symplectic bilinear form. Here, the symplectic space is finite-dimensional, so actually we can rewrite this group in a more familiar Group in a more familiar way as we see in some of the talks before. So here, I'm sorry. So here, actually, we can rewrite it as Hm omega. And this is modeled on R2m plus 1, but equipped with a non-commutative law, again, given by this symplectic form, but this is on R2n. And this is because when your symplectic space is Because when your symplectic space is finite-dimensional, we can always show that the vector space V is even-dimensional. That's how we get R2n. Moreover, this symplectic form R2n can be made more explicit like this. Why can we do that? The reason is that once you have a finite dimensional symplectic space with the symplectic form omega, it's symplectic form omega it's always possible to kind of diagonalize this symplectic form that is we can find the so-called symplectic basis and when the symplectic space is also equipped with the inner product as we do in R2n plus one actually you can write out the length of all those symplectic space explicitly and that's Explicitly, and that's how we get those parameter alpha i's. So, here, as you see, explicitly, this omega is just the sum of some non-zero parameter alpha i's, length of the symplectic spaces in each direction. And inside the parenthesis, this is the standard symplectic form R2M. R2M. That means actually we are here considering a family of non-isotropic isomer groups labeled by omega. And when all those alpha i's are equal, that means your symplectic space is isotropic. This would give you the isotropic Heisenberg group. Otherwise, you get the non-isotropic case. Case the Lie algebra of this Lie group can be identified with the collection of such left invariant vector fields on the group. So xi omega, y omega all dependent on omega. And the non-zero bracket between them is only xi omega and yi omega. You will get z, but scaled. At z, but scaled by the length of the symplectic space. This means at every point on this Lie group, the whole tangent space can be generated by the span of only x, i, omega, and yi omega under their Lie brackets. So this is when the homondus condition is satisfied. The consequence is, if you look at the sublaplacium, Sublaplacium. This is a hyperelliptic operator. That means we are considering a much weaker case than the usual elliptic case we have talked before. So here, sublapsh means you are only allowed to move in X and Y direction, but not in the Z direction. Naturally, we can equip the group with a sub-Riemannian structure. sub-Riemannian structure. Here, H is the horizontal distribution. In this concrete example, these are only spanned by X, I, omega, and Y omega. And the metric is equipped on this horizontal distribution. And as we can see, this horizontal distribution and this sub-Riemannia metric, they all depend on the simple. On the symplectic form omega. So if you change the symplectic for omega, you will get a different sub-Riemannian structure on this group. Here, the Hn omega is a flat model in the sub-Riemannian geometry. Here is the problem we are studying now. So we want to study the hypoelliptic log-Sobolev inequality of Leaf inequality of a very similar form, as you can see before. But the difference is that we will consider the heat kernel measure, which is the law of the hypoelliptic Brownian motion generated by the sublaplash. And the density with respect to the car measure is the heat kernel of the sub-lab passion. Of the sub-lab function. So we want to prove this inequality also holds on the group. And moreover, we want to track the difference of the constant capital C on both omega and T. One to see all this depends on the underlying geometry, especially is it possible to get a uniform constant C over all those omega. So whatever. So, whatever sub-Riemannian geometry you take, can we get a same constant? And moreover, is the constant in this case still independent of the dimension? However, there are several fun difficulties in this set. First of all, the generator is low but hyper elliptic. This would make the system more challenging. Challenging. The most obvious part is that the explicit formula of the heat kernel is more complicated than the Gaussian Rn. Next, geometric techniques are not readily available. In the Riemannian case, we have the Baccary-Emory estimate that is the curvature dimension criterion there. However, in this case, the curvature dimension criterion does not hold. Criterion does not hold. Instead, we need to consider the generalized curvature dimension inequality, which would make the situation more complicated. Last but not the least, luckily we still have the heat kernel and its smoothness, but functional inequalities are more difficult to prove in this setting. Before I move on to our result, I just want to give a very brief Give a very brief partial literature review. So, most of the work has been done in the isotropic case. There are different approaches. So, the first two by HQ Lee and Eldridge, they used an analytic approach which relies on a very delicate Gaussian estimate for the heat kernel. The third one by Frank and Lieb, what they get is Log-Soberlife inequality with respect to the Harm measure, not the heat kernel measure. And the constant is dimension dependent. And the fourth one by Baudon and Bonifai, it's more with respect to the invariant measure in this case. And this approach is more geometric. The last one. More geometric. The last one used the random work approximation, but only works for n equals one. In the non-isotropic case, the work by Bodegar and Zagolinski, their inequalities with respect to the Gaussian type of measure. And the second one by Ye Zhang, it is with respect to the heat kernel measure. But no information has been known about the demand. Known about the dependence of the constant on the underlying geometry or the dimension. Even when you interpret with respect to the same Gaussian Gaussian type of measure, it's dimension dependent in this approach. Yes. And this one is dimension dependent, and this one is not clear. It would be crazy to track the. Crazy to track the dependence of the on omega when you have n different alpha i's in that heat kernel estimate. Isotropic case of what dependence of the no, it's not known. And this is pretty much what we did. Is pretty much what we did. So we showed Loxoberlev hold on the non-isotropic Heisenberg group, and we get more explicit information on this constant. That is, we can find a uniform constant, capital C, over all this families, over all this family of non-isotropic Heisenberg group in this inequality here. So the first equal first you call it's okay you can it magnifies right yeah so the second equality here as you can see very large uh we can actually choose the constant to be the same constant uh when thank you when n equals one but the symplectic form is The symplectic form is standard. So that's how we get rid of the dependence on the symplectic bilinear form. And as a byproduct, we will get the independence of the constant on the dimension. And the second equality here tells you this constant is actually linear growth in the time t. Growth in the time t. Let me mention briefly the idea of the proof. This proof relies on a tensorization argument, which is a very fundamental property of log-Sobolev inequalities. What you do is you first let n equals one, and then you study the dependence or independence of this constant on the omega, and you can get rid. Omega, and you can get rid of the influence of omega when n equals one. And after that, this is the standard tensorization argument. You take the n product group of non-isotropic Heisenberg groups when n equals one. So that's the three-dimensional non-isotropic Heisenberg group, and you get a Log Sobole F here. But the main obstacle to go from the product. obstacle to go from the product group to the non-isotropic isomer group for larger n is you have the non-commutativity in this case. So the product is not for the larger n. To connect these two, we consider this map pi. So you just take the commutative part, preserve it, and you collapse the center of this. You collapse the center of this product group into a one-dimensional center as this. And this map preserves the log-soberlave constant from the product group to the non-isotropic Heisenberg group. One way to understand this map is even in the subremanion setting, you can consider the tensorization as a direct product only on the horizontal distribution. The horizontal distribution. So that's what I write down here. Similarly, if you reverse the order of tensorization and lifting, this map also preserves the Lok Sobolev constant. But that's how we can get the previous result we talked about. But a different way to understand this. Way to understand this map or to look at the non-isotropic Heisenberg group is you can regard it as a quotient space of the product space mod normal subgroup H of the product group. And here, actually, what it tells from the theorem is that if you let a normal subgroup act on the right. Act on the right or left on this big product group, this group action doesn't change the Lok Sobolev constant. That's actually the starting point of some application we are looking at right now. So, first, take a n-dimensional connected and simply connected Lie group satisfying Homonda's condition. condition you have the star plafacian which is hyperelliptic and also the heat kernel measure we we have then if you take a k-dimensional connected closed least subgroup and you consider the collection of the right cosets of h inside g and this will give you a homogeneous space Give you a homogeneous space. And let's take the quotient map pi. So from the group G to the quotient space, you can push the heat kernel measure from G to G mod H. That's what we have here. Then it's known that this homogeneous space is again an n minus k dim. And n minus k dimensional sub-Riemannian manifold, sometimes it could be Riemannian, but not so much like Riemannian we have seen before. And the push-forward operator on the quotient space is again hypoelliptic. And the push-forward measure here satisfies this a heat equation on the quotient space. So actually, this tells us the push forward. us the push forward measure of the heat kernel measure on G to G mod H. This is the corresponding heat kernel measure on the quotient space G mod H associated to its own sublab partial. What we showed is that if you consider the natural quotient map. Quotient map. And suppose G satisfies a Log-Sobolev constant with respect to the heat kernel measure, the quotient map still preserves Log-Sobolev constant. That means on the homogeneous space G mod H, you can get the Log-Sobolev constant, but with the same you can get the same Logo You can get the same logosoble of constant as the one on G. And one example is the map we have talked about before when we are going from the product group of some three-dimensional Heisenberg group to the non-isotropic Heisenberg group. But there are also some other examples that is the Grushen plane. So if you take So, if you take G to be just three-dimensional isotropic isomer group, it doesn't have to, but for simplicity, I put it like that here. And then let the subgroup H to be a one-dimensional closed subgroup of G. Then the quotient space G mod H is topologically isomorphic to R2, but not. To R2, but not the usual R2 we have. This is because the push forward of the sub-Laplacian to the G mod H is no longer the Laplacian RRM, but this is the Glucian operator. And this is this operator is not elliptic, but Elliptic, but hypoelliptic. And the corresponding geometric structure on this crucian plane is a singular Riemannian metric. This is because when you consider an orthonormal frame under this metric, these two vector fields are linearly independent on other places. But if you look at the vertical The vertical axis, these two vector fields, they are dependent. So that's why it's called the singular Riemannian metric. And from the previous theorem, we can show the Log Sobolev on the Russian plane, and the constant will be the same as the one on the three-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg group. So again, Heisenberg group. So again, you don't see the dependence of the dimension here. In the last few minutes, I'll mention briefly another application to the infinite-dimensional Heisenberg group. So this is an infinite-dimensional Lie group modeled on an abstract Wiener space W, H, and mu. Mu is the Gaussian measure there. The Gaussian measure there, and this group can be regarded as W times R, but equipped with a non-commutative law. So, still on R1, you make everything non-commutative. And omega here is a continuous surjective anti-symmetric bilinear form on W. So, this is a simplest model of the sub-Riemannian setting in the infinite dimension. setting in the infinite dimensional case. Similarly, we can in this case we have the bracket generating condition and also we have the sub elliptic operator and here's the gradient and we want to consider the log soboleph on this infinite dimensional group. But the problem here in this setting is in the infinite dimensional case. Case, Lebesgue measure is not available. But fortunately, the heat kernel measure is well defined. So you take the Brownian motion generated by the sub-elliptic operator, and the law of the Brownian motion is the heat kernel measure there. So what we showed is we proved the clausability of this associated Dirich one. Associated Dirichlet form. And also, we proved this Lok-Sobolev inequality on the infinite-dimensional Heisenberg type group G. Moreover about the constant capital C here. Even G is infinite-dimensional, you don't see any dependence of G or of the constant on the anti-symmetric bilinear form omega. Bilinear form omega. Moreover, this constant can be taken to be the same one in the finite-dimensional case. So that's the same constant you see in the first result. And this argument, the proof relies on the finite-dimensional approximation argument. Finally, let me Finally, let me discuss briefly some further directions. So, one direction is: we want to study how the Log Soberlev constant can be influenced by the group action of some subgroup on let's say a Carnot group or even a neopotent Lie group. And second, And second, we want to study some more general examples than the Heisenberg type group that is the Carnot groups of step two. And these are some stratified Lie groups. And we also want to look at their infinite dimensional extensions and show some log-sopolific inequalities there. So that is all I want to talk about. So, that is all I want to talk about. Thank you very much. Thank you for this very nice talk. Are there any questions? Can you go back to one of the earlier slides? Yes. Sorry. Which one? All the way to the beginning. Which one? All the way through the beginning, I think, of course. Even more? A little bit more a little bit, sorry. A little bit more. Oh, yeah. This has some relationship to a contact structure. That the contact structure, like the odd dimensional or something like that. Yes, when the at least. When the, at least when the symplectic bilinear form is isotropic, it is a contact manifold also. Maybe I just have a quick comment that uh probably not into restrict to the case uh good look. So normally you are looking at the preservation above the water constant. Yes. You could imagine the situation where you have a group acting isometrically on the manifold. Yes. The matching of the manifold to the Cauchon space, the multiplication motors are national, which is going to preserve the multiple groups. Yes, yes. But actually, the two examples I had here, the subgroup. The subgroup does act isometrically, but also there are some examples when the group action does not have to be isometric. Yeah. But it's just concrete examples. You still have the same Loxobole F constant. Yeah, I think it's quite fun. Yes, yes. And also for the remote was the case of the Russian plane. In the plane, yeah, but this is an equation follows from the stronger one, which is already known. That means by actually an re-estimate, you know, we know one by estimating the ocean plane does imply. Okay. But here, I think the point of here, of what we are doing here, is we want to connect the Sobolev constant from the homogeneous space to the group G. We want to. To the group G. We want to show they have the same constant. Yes. Yes. But does Valcari Emory also discussing Russia? Okay. So the conference also there. Okay. I see. I don't know about that, but yes, sure. Thanks. Thank you. Oh yes, sure. Thanks. Any other questions? Are there some natural concepts exist with the loss of the method quality? For example, in relation to the type of this is something we would like to look at also, but I don't think we have put down anything yet or we haven't looked at the Or we haven't looked at the case, especially in the infinite-dimensional case. But that's, I would say, that would be some natural next step. Okay, let's thank the speaker again. Thank you. And we have a five-minute break.
