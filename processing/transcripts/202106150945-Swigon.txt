It is my pleasure to introduce David Swigan from the University of Pittsburgh. He will talk about and stochastic simulations of supercold knotted and linked DNA. Hi, everybody. Thank you, Eleni, for introduction. And I want to thank you for organizing this beautiful workshop with many interesting talks and topics to explore. To explore, and for giving me the chance to show you some of the research we've been doing. So, I mean, this talk is going to be on a new procedure or method, computational method for simulating dynamically DNA molecules. And I mean, the reason why we want to simulate or study DNA dynamically. Or study DNA dynamically are more or less obvious to everyone in this audience, I believe. We know that DNA is involved in many important biological processes, such as replication, translation, transcription. And we also know from experimental results that the dynamical properties of DNA, mechanical and dynamical properties of DNA, have a great influence on many of those processes. Influence on many of those processes. That's why they are studied by a number of experiments and such as DNA closure assays, where you take a segment of DNA with sticky ends and you let the system evolve, and what you obtain is supercoiled, knotted, or catenated DNA configurations. There are single molecule manipulations in which you grab the DNA by In which you grab the DNA by the two ends, and then you can twist it and do all kinds of things with a single molecule. We can study it by electron microscopy images, as you can see on the right. And also indirectly, we can study the mechanics by, for example, gene expression assays in situations where, like black repressor, where the transcription Regulation of a particular gene depends on the mechanical properties of the upstream segment. Or we can also emerge DNA in a fluid and then study how its conformations change as a result of the flow. Now, interpretation of all these experiments requires us to have a good model that can help us understand. That can help us understand the behavior of the DNA. And from a physical standpoint, you know, there are a few basic properties that such a model should account for. The first is, of course, DNA as a semi-flexible polymer has a bending and twisting rigidity that should be accounted for. The DNA also has a uniform electrostatic charge distributed along its length, which leads to self-repulsion between segments of the molecule. Proportion between segments of the molecule. The DNA is also in its natural state immersed in an incompressible fluid. So any motion of the DNA results in a subsequent motion of the fluid, or vice versa, motion of the surrounding fluid results in the motion of DNA, and that interaction needs to also be taken into account. And finally, there is also the thermal forcing, which of course The thermal forcing, which of course the thermal fluctuations move the fluid randomly around, which as a result actuates thermally the DNA motion itself. One important consequence of this that I want to point out here is that there is a hydrodynamic coupling between different parts of the molecule, which means that if you move one part of the molecule, if that, for example, is acted upon by some force. Upon by some force, other parts of the molecule which are not necessarily connected to the red part will be actuated because the motion of the red particle causes the fluid to move around, which will carry with itself or impart forces on the other parts of the molecule, which may not be directly in contact with the red particle. So you can think of these as You can think of these as sequentially distant segments of the DNA, for example. And this can happen during knotting. So, people have developed a lot of different algorithms for modeling dynamics of DNA, Brownian dynamics, for example, which represents the DNA as a collection of beads connected together. Langevin dynamics, which is a higher order dynamics, which includes the bar. Dynamics, which includes the baryon dynamics, doesn't include the acceleration terms, Langerion dynamics does. Molecular dynamics, we can study the DNA directly, either short segments or long segments when we reduce, restrict ourselves to some mesoscale level. Unfortunately, many of these types of Types of simulation algorithms do not directly include the dynamics of the fluid itself, and in that form, they cannot account for the hydrodynamic coupling that I mentioned earlier. Now, we don't know whether that coupling is important or not for the mechanisms that DNA undergoes. Undergoes, but it would be great to have an algorithm which can also take that coupling into account. So we kind of set out to develop a method that would include that coupling as well, as the other types of interaction within the DNA. And this method has been developed as an extension of what's called Of what's called the immersed boundary method for studying the interaction of fluids and elastic structures at a macroscale level. And there were several different developments that had to be taken into account. Now, what I want to outline in this talk is basically some basic setup for this. Setup for this method. I'll be talking about the deterministic simulations where we ignore the thermal fluctuations and then in the second half about the stochastic, fully stochastic method. And I'll show you some of the results. We haven't fully completed the development of the method and analysis, but I want to show you some results that we obtained so far. That we obtained so far. And this work is in collaboration with my colleague Sukyun Lim at the University of Cincinnati and my current graduate student, Addie Pakoski. So for the mechanics to put together the method, we need to account for the mechanics of the DNA. And we do that using either elastic rod theory or the Elastic route theory or the base fair level deterministic model that we developed with Will Marlson and Bernard Coleman. Now, this page lists the elastic rod model. And basically, you have the moments and the forces acting on a segment of the rod at each cross section. And then you have a set of resulting balance of forces, balance of moments equations. We also account for the self-contact. also account for the self-contact which is when the DNA approaches uh comes to proximity which is determined by the by the diameter hardcore diameter we account for the electrostatic repulsion by placing the charges taking them away from the from the phosphate groups and moving them to the centerline axis and then accounting for the electrostatic using screen repulsion forces the by hukal screening type now for the Now, for the fluid, the method is characterized by solving not only the elastic equations for the rod representing the DNA, but also for the fluid. And the fluid in the deterministic mode is represented by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, which is listed here. U is the velocity field. Now, within the incompressible Navier-Stokes, The incompressible Navier-Stokes, the main coupling between the DNA, which is immersed in the fluid, and the fluid itself, is transmitted by this force, F superscript B, which is a force that is added, that is extracted from the DNA modes, and it accounts for the force since the moments. Since the moments, the coupling terms, and the electrostatic propulsion. Now, the immersed boundary method is an interesting numerical method which approximates the solutions. What we need to do is we need to solve the equations for the fluid. And we do that by discretizing the fluid with a fixed grid. But we also have the DNA, which moves inside of the fluid, and the discretization points for the fluid, which are... For the fluid, which are fixed in space, do not quite correspond to the positions where the DNA is located. So to reconcile that, we need to discretize the DNA with its own discretization grid, and then we need to transfer the forces and moments acting on the DNA from the fluid onto the DNA and vice versa using these what we call a smooth. What we call a smoothed out delta functions. And so that's the principle of the method. You solve of the Meris boundary method, you solve the finite difference scheme for the elasticity of the DNA, and then you solve the fluid dynamics for the grid of the fluid. And then you transfer the forces and the moments back and forth through these smooth delta functions. So numerically, we have a finite So numerically, we have a finite difference scheme for the fluid dynamic solution where the forces come from the solving the system of differential equations for the DNA. So you compute the forces and moments coming from the rod onto the fluid, you spread them onto the fluid, then you update the fluid velocity by one step and then interpolate the fluid motion at discretization points. At the discussion points, then you propagate the DNA with the fluid. So these are no slip boundary conditions. DNA simply moves, the fluid moves around, then the DNA moves with the fluid as the fluid is propagated. And then at the end of each iteration cycle, you want to check the CFL condition to guarantee the stability of the method. Okay, so here's an example of a simulation where we start with a signal. Simulation where we start with a 600-base pair circle of DNA, which has been twisted to have an excess link of six. So you would expect it to undergo supercoiling, and here you can see the resulting shape with a plectonemic region and three different terminal loops. Now, one thing I want you to notice here. One thing I want you to notice here is the dots. The dots originally start in locations around the circle, and you can see that the fluid moves in the neighborhood of the original circular configuration. It moves along with the DNA, and then that's exactly what happens. Those points are hydrodynamically coupled with the original points on the DNA and moved around. So we can look at the dynamical um dynamics of the of the of the supercooling process. We can look at the different that the resulting limiting configurations, for example, as a function of a different ionic strength of the medium, starting from high salt on top row, going to low salt, and the main. Going to low soil, then the main things you can notice here is that in the high soil, the electrostatic repulsion is neutralized to great degrees. So you get these platonemic regions with a large, high degree of self-contact. While for the low soil, that's the bottom row, you get a lot of gaps within the structure, which signifies the strong electrostatic repulsion in that case. And you can see the difference. In that case, and you can see the different types of configurations that one can achieve. And in fact, what we found is that by putting a different type of perturbation on the initial configuration, we always start simulating from a circle, we can actually achieve a large number of different alternative limiting configurations by just a tiny initial twist perturbation. So there is a potential for multi-stability in the system. The system that could be exploited then during stochastic simulation. So now let's look at these results have been published and I want to show you some new results. We've been recently looking at the diet supercuring of NOTs. So this is for example DNA plasmid of length 600 base pairs, which is initially a trephoil knot. Again, we Again, we imposed an excess link of minus 12 in this case, and here you can see again what is happening dynamically. Now, again, we don't have any thermal fluctuation in this case, so the hydrodynamic coupling works mostly as a drag to the motion of the fluid. And some people have equated this to a gradient flow, which you know, this. Gradient flow, which this is to a great extent. But again, we're simulating not just the DNA, but the full fluid box surrounding it. So here is an example of elementic configuration in this case. And again, depending on the concentration of the ionic strength of the medium, we can find these configurations for low salt situation. We have a lot of gaps in the structure. For high salt, we have. In the structure for high salt, we have a much more compact structures, and Abby has been working on this. And she has now, again, we have the potential for getting multiple stable equilibria for each topological constraint, that being the excess link. Now, the trouble is, how can we achieve those equilibria for For we can't really do any perturbation because we are not starting from an equilibrium configuration to begin with. The circular configuration here is not an equilibrium for that value of the linking number. So instead, the strategy we take is we take a limiting configuration for one linking number and then adjust the linking number to another value and then look at how the what the What the resulting transition will give us as an equilibrium. And that way we can obtain the alternative structures for other values of the linking member for the terminal value. So from starting from negative 7, for example, going to negative 13, we obtain this alternative equilibrium, and from negative 8, we obtain this equilibrium on the right. They're both equilibria for negative 13 axis length. Access length. So we were at this point we have a nice table of different configurations. The diagonal in the table, so that would be negative 13, negative 13 going up. Those are the configuration we obtain from the standard Wound circle initially. And then if we go vertically from that configuration, either up or down by adjusting the linking number, we get the alternatives here. The alternatives here. So, within each row, now you can find alternative configurations for that particular excess link, and then the values of the energy in KT is in KT is shown here. And one can identify the minimum energy configurations, for example, which would be the most likely to be observed for those particular linking numbers. So, that's an example of an ongoing study, and our goal here. Ongoing study, and our goal here is to see what we can say about the transitions between individual local equilibria in a stochastic simulation. And I think I'm about, okay, 12.04. I have 10 more minutes, right? So I guess I should speed up a little bit. So going into the stochastic dynamics, what we do. What we do is we transition from the full Navier-Stokes, which is non-linear, into a linearized version that would be time-dependent Stokes equations, which we can solve using a finite difference scheme. And if we go into Fourier space, actually the stochastic, the Stokes equations decouple into system of ODEs. Now, when we include the thermal fluctuations, we actually get a stochastic difference. Get a stochastic differential system for each mode of the Fourier transformation, and each of the modes is actuated independently, so we can solve for these modes. One can solve for these modes individually, actually solve the stochastic differential equation, explicitly assuming that the force is approximately constant. And this was first done by Paul. And this was first done by Paul Otzberger, who developed this particular version of the method, not for DNA, but other types of simulations. The benefit is because you can simulate the stochastic differential equation exactly, you can extend your time steps. So, now what are the results? Here would be a stochastic simulation of just the circle, 1500 base pairs circle. This would be on the left side. Circle, this would be on the left side is a zero linking number, and on the right side it's linking number negative nine. And you can see kind of the development of the planktonemic supercoiling. And with these simulations, one can now study various types of properties. We can see, for example, how the writhe dynamically fluctuates and how it equilibrates. So we can compute the right relaxation time here and compare with the experiment. Time here and compare with experimental results. We can also look at the radius of geration dynamics during supercoiling and for circles. And now for the knot, here is a simulation of a 600-base pair knot with the delta length of negative 10. And at the bottom, I'm showing the different equilibria, alternative equilibria that you. Equilibria, alternative equilibria that you can find for the NOT. And if you observe closely, you can see how the NOT, after some initial transient, how it goes from the left-mode configuration to the second from left, and then finally makes a transition to the second configuration from the right, just about now. So we'll try to. So we will try to compute the dynamical. Now, knowing the energies, of course, has the energies, the energy values here, they have relevance to the proportions with which you would want to expect to see these different configurations in a stochastic process, but that's not the complete information because those probabilities are also affected by the width of the energy well and the height of the barrier. Well, and the height of the barrier also affects the time of transition between those, and then we want to study that a little bit further. Now, here is another example. This is where we're looking at the dynamics of a DNA hop fling, and this was inspired by Javier and by a problem we've been looking at, which is the kinetoplast DNA. At which is the kinetoplast DNA, when you have a bunch of DNA circles connected as Hauflinks, the goal here is to find the distribution of century distances for a fluctuating half link. And so you can see a simulation of two such circles connected in a Hauflink. In this case, we're ignoring the electrostatics and using Ignoring the electrostatics and using only exploded volume as a representation with an increased diameter of DNA. Now, on the left bottom picture, you can see simulations of about 10 or I think rings which start at different radial distances between their centroids. And you can see that within the time frame of the simulation, We get a fairly decent amount of mixing, and so that the ergodicity of the process is satisfied here. And on the right side, then we get a histogram of the century distance, distribution of the century distance between the two links. And we notice that the century distance has a maximum around 300 angstroms, but it approaches a low value. Approaches as a low value for zero, which is in contrast to, for example, if you have two rigid links where the maximum for this radial distance is actually attained at zero. Now, when we try to study larger objects, unfortunately, there are situations where the method seems to have some trouble. For example, for C. fasiculata, which are much larger rings, that's 2,500 base pairs roughly, so that's two and a half times larger. When we simulate for the same amount of time from the time traces, you can see that the mixing has not been achieved. And moreover, at the bottom, you can see that when you start, the simulation and the century distance is close to zero. Distance is close to zero, then the fluctuations are much smaller than the fluctuations when we started large distances. And we were kind of looking at what is the reason for this effect. And I'm not sure whether you can see it. But if you look closely at the fluctuations, you can see that some of the segments seem to be kind of moving in unison, even though they belong to two different segments. And we call this a sticking. And we call this a sticking. And you can kind of see the same effect on the right side when we monitor the closest distance between the two segments. So the first half would be one segment, the second half the other segment. So here this yellow line represents a contact, close contact between a segment from one circle and a segment from the other circle. And that line doesn't seem to be moving around or disappearing for a Or disappearing for an extended period of time. So we're currently trying to figure out whether this is an artifact of the simulation or whether that's actually some realistic effect due to the physics of the problem. I have one more slide. There are some folks here interested in bacteriophage packing. So here's a simulation where we take a large segment of DNA. Where we take a large segment of DNA, but we confine it to a small box of size 45 nanometers that would be roughly the size of a bacteriophage capsule. And we've looked at the simulations at a high salt that would be on the left that would be a situation where the electrostatic is neutralized to a great degree, 0.15 molars. And what we see during the evolution. And what we see during the evolution here of the plasmid is that it approaches a situation where the DNA sort of forms a spool here. It's a configuration in which it's mostly spooled around. I don't know if I can stop this. Okay. So the elasticity actually dominates here in this case. The DNA is trying to spread out as much as it can within the confines of the cube. Now, on the right side, that's in the high electrostatic regime, that would be the low salt. And what you see is a very different type of behavior where the DNA is kind of filling up the space. It's trying to separate as much as it can from itself and fills up the space. So what you get is kind of a like a space filling curve. Kind of like a space filling curve in three dimensions. So again, we're planning to investigate this further and see whether there may be some kind of a phase transition between the spool type, spool-like behavior and the space-filling behavior as you change the solar. So I hope you got some idea about the type. The types of results we can obtain with the model. We can account for the fluid structure and interaction and the coupling, as I mentioned, but we need to calibrate the method further, solve some problems with the grid sizes and fit for accurate diffusion coefficients and other autocorrelations. And analyze the sticking situation and see what the problems are there. What the problems are there. All right, so, and as I mentioned, this work was in collaboration with Suk Yum Sankim in Seoul and my student Abin. So thank you. Thank you very much. It's very interesting. Oh, there are, yes, any questions? I have a question. Do you consider? Do you consider in your model watching what happens under topology change, like strand switching? Like a strand passage. Yeah, it's something that we have thought about. Because of a limited bandwidth, we haven't done any type of simulation of that type. But it's something we have been interested in doing eventually. Thank you. Actually, this is for our next talk. So, if you have any questions, please, while you remember, please type them in the chat. We can continue in the working groups. Thank you very much, David.
