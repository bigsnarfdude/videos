So thanks Ivan and thanks I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to give this talk. So I would speak on the Brownian absolute continuity of the KPC fixed points starting with arbitrary initial condition and discuss the joint work with Balin. Balin Grug. And please feel free to stop me at any point of time if you have any question. If you have any questions, so I would just start by recalling some of the things that we have learned in this course. So first recall the airline ensemble. So the stationary airline ensemble was introduced by Ivan earlier this week. And whenever I will talk about airline ensemble in this talk, I would actually mean the parabolically shifted airline ensemble. So we just have this stationary airline ensemble and shift everything. Air dynamic ensemble and shift everything by a t square to get this shift everything down by a parabola to get this parabolic air dynamic ensemble. And the top line of this parabolic airline ensemble is the shifted Airy2 process. And Duncan actually introduced the ARI sheet in his talk yesterday. So recall that the ARI sheet is a random continuum. Random continuous function from R2 to R that is defined in terms of the last passage corporation across this Air Deline ensemble. And Metitsky, Kestel and Remenek, they had constructed the KPZ fixed point at time t standing for any initial distribution H0 that satisfies certain properties. So throughout this talk, I would fix Throughout this talk, I would just fix t equal to 1 because of the scaling property, that's not, we are not losing much by just fixing t equal to 1. Now, then using the notations of the AV sheet and the reducted landscape, the KPZ fixed point at time 1 can just be written in terms of the initial distribution. distribution and the direct and the area sheet and it just takes this simple form so the k v c fixed point at time 1 is the initial distribution plus the A V sheet from X to Y the supremum over all X so if you think of it in terms of this picture so we have the initial distribution The initial distribution h0 here, and we have the Airy sheet in between. And for any point x I move along the geodesic to y, that gives me h0x plus sxy and I take the supremum over all x. Okay, so that's how one defines the KTZ fixed point. Now just to go over a few special cases for Over a few special cases for special initial distributions. So if H0 is the narrow edge initial condition that is H0 is 0 and H0 at 0 is 0 and it is minus infinity for all x non-zero, then the K b z point is just the parabolic K2 process. And if the initial distribution is the flat initial condition, that is, x is identical to zero. That is, H0 is identical to zero, then the KPZ fix point is the AI1 process. So, those are probably the two most important special cases of the KPC fix point. Also, let me just define what I mean by Brownian on compacts. This was probably defined by Jacob yesterday in his talk, and I think he called it local Brownian. So, what I mean by Brownian compact is that a function is Is that a function is a random function which is Brownian non-compact if its distribution on any compact set is absolutely continuous with respect to a Brownian motion with dispersion parented to. So that is the Brownian uncompact. Now with that let me just write the theorem that we have which is that for all Initial condition takes 0 in a very large class of functions i. I will define what i is. The KPC fixed point H1 is Brownian on compacts. That is, it is absolutely continuous with respect to the Brownian motion on every compact interval. Now, this Now, this set i is actually the largest class of functions that is possible. So, its definition is precisely this: a function f is in this class if and only if it is not identically minus infinity. It is bounded above on any compact interval. And this quantity, fx minus x squared over the absolute value of x goes to minus infinity as x goes to plus or minus infinity. And one can show. And one can show that this is the necessary and sufficient condition that would ensure that the KPZ fixed point is finite for all y, if and only if this initial condition is zero is in this plus of functions. So is that theorem here? Let me just go over a partial review of some of the works in this area. So of course the first thing is the paper by Corwin and Hammond, where they showed the Brownian on compact for the ARE2 process, that is the KPCFX point starting with the narrow edge initial condition. Metitsky, Kester, and Romanik in their paper had shown the holder of minus continuity and the local limit convergence. And the local limit convergence for the KPZ fixed point, but nothing like absolute continuity on compact intervals was shown in their paper. Hammond, in a number of papers and also with Melind and Jacob, had first they had given of course some very strong bounds on the radio-clinical derivative for the Airy2 process with respect to Brownian motion on compact intervals. Which they spoke, Melinda Jacob spoke on yesterday. And but for general initial conditions, I think the best result that is here is by Allen, which is the Brownian patchwork quilt, which roughly says that the KPZ fixed point can be on a unit interval can be divided into a random number of sub-intervals where Sub-intervals where, and if I consider this, and if I call these fixed points on these sub-intervals as patches, then one can show, I mean, Alan had shown that the restriction of the KPC fixed point on these patches is absolutely continuous with respect to Brownian motion, and he had also given some random critique derivative bound for the he had also given some upper bound for the random derivative. He had also given some upper bound for the random decline derivative on each batch. So that's what I think the result was for KPC fixed points starting from any arbitrary initial condition with a random number of patches. But one can then think of this theorem as reducing this random number of patches to a single patch. So the whole KPZ fixed point on a KPZ fixed point on a whole interval can be The KTC fixed point on a whole interval can be thought of as just, so the whole KTC fixed the whole on the whole interval is absolutely continuous with respect to a Brownian motion. And some applications of this, I mean, there can be many applications, but a very quick application would be to just generalize the result of Johansson for the KPZ fix point. So if you recall, one of the applications that Eilmen had given for Given for the random for the absolute continuity of the AOV2 process in his talk was the existence of a unique maximum for the AOE2 process. So one can, with this result, with the absolute continuity result for K-Pcx point starting with arbitrary initial condition on every compact interval, one can then say that one can then show that K-Pcx point has a unique maximum on any compact interval. In particular, the Ari one process has a unique maximum. One process has a unique maximum on any compact interval. Any question to this point? I'll just check the. There was a paper I remember, Leandro Pimentel, that was somehow also about this unique maximum for general initial data. Could you just remark how this relates to what you're doing? Do you know the paper I'm referring to? There's some problem. Sorry, there there's some problem with the sorry, I cannot hear your question. I um can you hear me now? Yes. Okay, I was just asking, there was a paper from about six months ago of Leandro Pimentel that related, I think also to this unique maximum question. Could you just kind of explain how that's related? So, yes, the picture of Pimentel, he does not show absolute continuity on compact intervals, but he shows that starting with certain initial conditions. He shows that starting with certain initial conditions using certain other soft arguments that there is a unique maxima for many of these processes. For example, the test, any stationary process minus a parabola will have a unique maxima. And so those are, I mean, his arguments are different from showing the existence of absolute continuity. Um okay, so how much time do I have? Um okay, so I guess I have some about ten minutes, I guess. So in the remaining time, I would like to give some idea on how the proof works. So the proof will have two important components: one is, of course, the Brownian gibbs. Components. One is, of course, the Brownian-Gibbs property of the carrier ensemble, which of course it has been discussed many times in this course, so maybe I don't have to recall that. And the other thing is the description that we have issued in terms of the last passage population across Arielian ensemble. Across area and ensemble. So, in the TUV paper, the Airy sheet was described in terms of the last passage coefficient across the Airy line ensemble. Now, these two things together, like an LPP across the air-line ensemble and the Brownian-Gibbs property of the Airline ensemble, would together imply that the KPC fixed point can be thought of as an. Fixed point can be thought of as an, I mean, can be shown to be absolutely continuous with respect to some version of the Brownian last passage correlation. Now, what do I mean by a version of the Brownian last passage percolation? So, if you just recall what the Brownian last passage percolation was, it is just starting from one point here and another point here. One point here and another point here. We look at the geodesic, I mean, look at an increasing path and just add up the increments and then maximize over all increasing parts. Now, this version of Brownian-last message coefficient that we will have, if I call it a modified BLPP, is A certain mass passage calculation where we actually give the Brownian individual Brownian motion certain push. So these can be thought of as brown in motion starting from not zero but some non-zero point G L and our modified And our modified BNPP is this quantity, which is the maximum over all these L many last per such population started from 0, L. N many such things. Now, in the actual thing, these two things are random. GL and N are random, and GL is independent of these things. But for the time being, let's assume that everything is a fixed, everything is. A fixed everything is non-random. So suppose that G L is non-random, G L's are non-random for all L and suppose that N is just equal to 2, then this just turns out to be the Pittman transform of two independent Brownian motions starting from two points g1 and g2. So this question. So, this quantity for n equal to 2 is let me try to see it properly is by Pickman transform. This is a slightly generalized version of the Pikmin transform that was introduced in David's talk. So, this is just I reflect the top Brownian motion of the bottom one. So, the transform would give us, so this gets. So, this gets reflected across the bottom one. So, it will be something like this. And this path actually gives us the modified DLPP that we want in our work. So, it boils down to showing that this path is absolutely continuous with respect to Brownian motion. Now, just for a special case, if g1 and g2 are all zero, Case if G1 and G2 are all zero, then this Pigment transform is just the usual melon for the two Brownian motions. And we know that its law is that of two independent Brownian motions, conditioned not to intersect. And away from the origin, the law of the top line is absolutely continuous with respect to Brownian motion. A similar kind of an I mean so one can argue that if the Brownian motions are not starting from the origin but are starting from two different points. But starting from two different points, even then, the distribution of the Pittman transform away from the origin is still absolutely continuous with respect to Bravian motion. And one can then prove this fact for general n by an induction argument. For general n, one can just use induction. Now I'll just quickly see what the GLs are in this. In this quantity, so if this is the area line ensemble, and suppose I'm looking at the y is in some compact interval from 1 to 2, and suppose this is line x equal to 0, and here is initial distribution, initial function condition h0, then One would actually have infinite generic from x to y and gl would be the supremum of 80x plus the length of the infinite geodesics defined in a certain way. Of course, the length of an infinite geodesic does not make sense, but one can define it in a certain way as one defines the air issue. Certain way as one defines the early sheet as differences of finite last pathetic calculations in the DOV paper. And if one has that, then it is not difficult to show that HY is just the maximum of G L plus these last passage calculations across the area and ensemble. So now by conditioning on everything to the left of 0, one will have that this will be absolutely continuous with respect to Brownian motion and these two things would be independent. And then using the fact for the Brownian, using the fact for the Pittman transform Brownian motion, the result follows. Okay, so I would stop there.
