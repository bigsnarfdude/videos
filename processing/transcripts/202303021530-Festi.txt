So for this afternoon, last talk, I'm happy to have Dino Festivity tell us about K3 services with two involutions and local point number. Thank you very much for the introduction. Thank you to the organizers of the Night for inviting me and giving me the chance to talk about this recent work. Let me call the joint work with Limneg, which is Work with Lim Neck, which is a PhD student of Fernando Lao Leiden, and Daniel Platt, which is a differential geometer in King's College in London. So, as you might know, several people are working in algebraic geometry on finding a new example of irreducible holomorphic simplexing manifolds. There are only basically two big families and two sporadic examples, and all. And so, people are working to find four of them, new ones. And something similar is going. New ones. And something similar is going on in differential geometry as well. So in this case, they are looking for G2 manifolds. So, what is a G2 manifold? It is a compact seven manifold. Uh with a metric such that the only group is isomorphic to the Lie group G2. So, and this is everything I know about G two manifolds, so if you have more questions you can send an email today. So, okay, so only three constructions are known. So only three constructions are known. And the last one, the most recent one, is new one is due to Joyce and Karigianis with Incidentally, he works here in Canada at Waterloo and is organizing here a seminar a workshop at the end of May on the topic related to this. And so this last construction uses K-3 surfaces, uses complex projective K3 surfaces. But these k3 surfaces need to have some properties. So such that let's call k3 surface x such that the first property is that x as a known holomorphic involution sigma then it has Then it says you need to have also a holomorphic evolution iota, and these are the two involutions of the tiles. Sorry, sorry, until the next slide. A holomorphic one, and then these two evolution have to commute, and then it needs to have to be endowed also with a stable line bundle. And then this stable line bundle is used to construct the metric. Yes, yes. So we want a project K3, so we always fix a polarization. So, and then, you know, this project starts because Daniel emails. This starts because Daniel emails me one day and he asks me, Look, I'm looking for this complicated surface, but it would be nice if they are cortics because we like to work with those. So can we find one? And so we say, okay, then how can we find such a K-tree that is used for this construction? So what we want, first of all, the antelomorphic evolution, the most natural thing to consider is the Natural thing to consider is the complex conjugation. So if we have a KT surface defined over R, then the complex conjugation gives us this anthelomorphic involution. And then we want another involution, which is, if also this involution is defined over R, then they will automatically commute. So, and then for the last part, then if we have a line band, Then, if we have a line bundle, checking whether it's stable or not, it becomes harder the higher the Picard number. So, for this reason, for them, it's easier to work with KT surfaces with low Picard number. So, this means that this condition were translated into looking for a projective gateway surface. What does stable mean? Stable, this is stable condition, I think, with respect to the rank and the degree of the line bundle. I think. So there are these subtitle conditions. So it's not just let's invariant undertensive? No, no, it doesn't. Yeah, sorry, I should have said that. So, but this won't play. But this won't play any role anymore. So, once we just make this to the condition, so we want the projective KT surface X defined over R such that we have an involution. So, notice that here I'm writing X, so this is the involution. We want it to also define over R. And the second And the second is that the Picard number, the geometric Picard number, so we consider that the base change of X to C is as low as possible. Okay, so then given that we are working with projective KT surfaces As Klaus already remarked, they come with a polarization, and therefore it makes sense to talk about the degree of the surface. And this degree is always even because it's the self-intersection of the ample divisor. So it makes sense to define the following for every positive d, it makes sense to define the integer h to d. Integer H to D as the minimum among the K tree, the real Kt surfaces satisfying this condition. The find is aware of Z in that group and we have that. We have that the degree. Okay, and so and then now we are ready to state the main theorem of the day So So this we computed this number in all cases, so which is one if d is equal to one and two in all the other cases. Okay, so what is the idea behind? Well if d is equal to one then this is trivial. Is it's trivial because you can consider consider the genetic double cover of P2 ramified above a sex stick or a small sexic and then if this is generic then the If this is generic, then the picket number is one. And if this sexic is defined over q, then or over r, then also the pretty surface is defined over r. And then given that it's double cover, we always have the double cover involution. So now this, I said this is trivial. The point is that the first example of such a surface defined over Q came only in 2008 by Elsinze Janen. So the problem was not finding the example itself, but proving that the rank, the pickle number, was one. So, but now, I mean, thanks to Falag methods and other easy. So, if you take a random polynomial, homogeneous polynomial degree C over Q, then it will do. So, and then And then this case is already good. The rest is a little bit more tricky. So what is the idea? So the idea is to imitate this strategy. So to forever be find a K3 so we look for K3. So we look for K3 projective K3 surface over R such that they have a double cover structure. So we'll find X over R equal to 3 to D and double for structure. What does this mean? This means that we look for, and of course we want And of course, we want the Picard number to be as low as possible, as in our case, Picard number. So this means that we want an ample divisor of degree 2, because then this ample divisor will provide the projection to P2, and this will be the double cover of P2 that we look for. Okay, so some. Some background. So that was the introduction, I will write it. So this is some about evolutions of K3. So, involutions of petty surfaces are fairly well understood, thanks mostly to work of Nicoli. So, we have the first proposition. proposition so we have that if x is a k3 complex k3 such that you have lattice is generated just by h so theta number one then the automorphism screwed is either flat or Z or is Z2 if h squared is equal to 2, or it's the trigger one otherwise. So this result already gives a very big hint for our result because it tells us that two is a lower bound. So in order to prove the result, all we are left to do is to find examples realizing this lower bound. These lower bounds. And also, Nicole also gave a way to classify involutions of K3. So if we have K3, IOTA image and we call pass the fixed locus IOTA. IOTA, then we have that if iota is symplectic, then the pick and number of x is at least 9. So that's already too high for us. We are already not interested anymore. It's likely convolution. So and if Iota is not symplectic, then the fixed lotus is either empty and in this case the picker number is at least five. It's at least ten. It's at least 10, or it's the disjoint union of two elliptic curves. And also in this case, I think the pickup number is 39 of 10. No, I don't remember. Lower it's the union of the disjoint union of a curve of degree of demonstration. So, and finite number of rational curves. And in this case, the par number at least 11 minus the arithmetic minus of C plus K. So, this is the same result that was already recalled by Andreas and by Chiara. So, I just wrote it a different way stressing out the impact. Way stressing out the impact that this has on the Picard number. So you see, by this result, this result gives us another hint where to look for if we want low Picard number, because then in order to have low PICA number as low as possible, and we are basically forced to look for double colours of P2. There is no other way. Okay, then move on so this one. Well, case one, the case B equal to one was dealt with pretty easily. But the most interesting one at the beginning for the distinction geometers were perfect because it's also the next easiest one. So Well, also to prove this case, there is a natural choice because if we take a quarting with a single node A1 singularity. And basically, this solves the problem because we can take the resolution of this singularity, let's call it S, and then this S is a K3 and it has two devices. It has two divisors at least H which comes from the upper plane the upper plane section of X this then E, which is the exceptional divisor resolving The exceptional device or resolving the note. Then it's easy to see that in this case we have that if the rank of the typical number of s is equal to 2, then so basically So basically, it's as general as it can be, then the p-tar of S is generated by H and D and is isomorphic to the lattice or 0 minus 2. So with this notation, I always mean the lattice with gram matrix. So 2 times 2. The two tends to best dump meetings. Okay, and in particular its automorphic group is isomorphic to Z over to Z. And where is what do you mean in particular? Sorry, in particular it means that for us we are in particular interested in this. Interested in this. And so, where does this involution come from? Well, that is, you can see it either as the involution induced by the projection from the node on X or as the map induced by H minus E from this linear system. So, this gives the projection to P2 that realizes S is double. S is double cover of the two. Okay, so now the problem is that this is over C, but then we have to realize over R. But this is again not very hard because this can be realized as you can realize X as W square times a homotinous polynomial of degree two. Polynomial of degree two, that's homogeneous polynomial of degree three, and then a homogeneous polynomial of degree four. And then this will be, if you take F2, F3, and F4 generic and defined over Q, then this will define this X over Q. Yeah, I mean L so that's okay to have L so that's a good idea. Elsewhere to work. Yes. Well, I mean, in this case, it's much easier because in this case we want to prove that the Piccadilly is two. So it's enough to work with just one prime. Because you get this example, right? You take this generic and this gives you a quart-width node. Then you reduce over just one prime, and then you see that the pickaxe number is two. So you know that this generates a whole lattice. So, you know that this generates a whole lattice because there is no overlattice with this. So, this is yes. What? You only need an example of a q. Yes, yes, but this is even stronger. This is even stronger. And in fact, so this is over Q, for us, over Q is even better because then you can use it on a computer. So yeah, so I was writing you can take this even. Even yeah, and so and this is particularly nice because one can use this construction also to realize in particular this means this already proves that H4 is equal to two. But then you But then using the same surface we can do much more because T is a Is such that 2 mod D is a square, then there exists an ample divisor with square. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, mean square 2d. So, and this is by solving generalized Pell equations. So, this is a bit more technical, but it's not very hard. So, with this condition, you can always find a named divisor, D, with square 2D. And this in particular implies, so this tells us that H2D is equal to 2 for all these two. So, which are already infinitely many. So, and they are all realized over Q. Okay, so this solves the case for EH4. This is only one minor drawback that the differential geometers didn't like is that this x is singular. So, one might ask: what if we want X moves. Well, also in this case, something can be done. And we were inspired by two results, one by Modi, because it says under certain numerical conditions. There exist conditions on the curve C of degree D and genus G. So the numerical conditions are on the degree and the genus that exist a smooth quartet. A smooth quartic X containing C. And then this result was strengthened by Knudsen. So because it says in the conditions as above, This quartic you can find and exist a smooth quartic containing C and such that such that the P car is actually generated by C and the hybrid plane class, the hybrid plane section class. The average action class. Okay, so then these conditions and it was not so hard to find small numbers in the Latino. In particular, already for genus I mean we want the genus was fixed because we want the genus 2, because the the degree of the divisor had to be 2. The divisor had to be true. So, well, units too, already degree equal to five fits Morris condition. So, we know that such a kid reserves existed, but we have to realize it over R at least and At least, and we did so. The construction was not super hard, but now I don't have too much time. So, we say we realize over Q okay, so this was nice. And then, you know, as you might expect, so in a way, this completely solved the problem for the grid four, and then Degree four. And then the next step was, of course, uh age six. And also in the case H6, we provided an explicit example. So we wanted a genus to curve. So we wanted a So we wanted X even as seen before intersection of a cubic and quadric so and such and containing Curved C B genus 2. So how did we do in this case? Well, we consider a curve given, so let's put this C prime, given by this equation, so a double cover of the projected line. I mean, if I double six points, so this is two. And then we can embed so we can take the image side, we can complete this into the weighted projective space 113, and then we can embed this through the Veronese embedding into P4, Veronese embedding, and then we call C the in. The image of this curve, this will have, of course, genes too as well. And then we look at equations. Look at the equations defining C in before and then take those equations of degree 2 and 3 and then combine them until you find a quadratic. A quadric and a cubic such that the intersection is smooth. So, and then you would have that, given that C is containing both the quadratic and the cubic, then it would be also in the other sections. Combine them until we get one. And if you find them if you take polynomials generic enough, then also in this case the typical number will be two. So also in this case it was pretty easy because we just did a random search of a set of one and then it worked. Okay, but now you know even positive numbers have these remarkable properties that they are infinite. Property that they are infinite. So we cannot go on like this for every case. So we had to come up with another argument. So in order to cover all the other cases, we had to give up the constructions. So in order to prove the right, the proof of all the other cases, unfortunately, is not constructive. So, how do we prove this? First of all, let's state the theoretical first. So we prove something stronger at first. So we take n lattice, even lattice of signature one row minus one with rho with most ten and then And then there exists a K3 surface over R such that the picket lattice of X is equal to the picket lattice. Is equal to the pickle lattice of X basic chain to C, which is, and it in turn this is isomorphic to N. Okay, so how did we prove this? So first we use a result by silol or ne cooling. So I say orniculing because the first time I I in the earliest proof of this result I found was in silol. Result I found was in Silol, but reading Nicolin's paper, it seems that it was already known to Nicolin, but he didn't prove it. So I don't know if there is an earlier reference. So Bisel says that a complex K tree can be defined over R if there exists an evolution tau Now acting as the compact conjugation. So, what does it mean acting as the complex configuration that it sends H to 0? It sends H20 to H02, but the restriction to H2XZ is an isometry, and it sends the ample cone to minus the ample cone and the positive cone to minus the positive cone. So what you expect from the implementation. And then we have this result by Marthison that says that if n is as a ball Then there exists a K-tree surface, then there exists a complex K-tree such that the peaker of X is isomorphic to the K tree. And then what we do is we adjust What is on construction in order to ensure the existence of Taoists is a little bit more So what does it mean to adjust? Well, Moisson uses the subjectivity of the crion map, so it just cares about finding a period defined over C. In our case, we have to be a bit more careful. We have to construct our period starting with its real part. So we first construct one real part, then so our period will be of this form. For and we carefully construct v plus and v minus so that then we can find we can define this tau by sending the period omega to this. And this is exactly what you expect from the complex conjugation. But of course, we have to start defining it on these parts of the period. Okay, but then Okay, I think with this we are almost done because now we only have to choose to find a clever choice of this end. Just now you just need to take and if equals to the lattice this lattice then there exists a K-tree. A K-tree a real K-tree such that well and now we want to show that this has the involution that we want. Well, the point is that if D is greater than 3, then n is out. three then n does not represent minus two that means that there are no minus two vectors in there and uh but then it's enough to take if if this pick r is given by uh c and h where H where c squared is equal to 2, h squared is equal to d, and then ch is d plus 1. Then what does it mean? We can take them, we can assume them that they are positive. If they are not, then we just take minus them. And then given that there are no minus two vectors, they are also ample. So let's assume that log. That's loss of generality that H and C are positive, and this will imply that they are also ample. And then we are done because then this means that if h is ample, then x can be realized as k three of Tree or V3 and it's okay, and this luckily, I mean, this covers exactly all the leftover case because we only assume D to be greater than 3. So, yeah, I think I'm uh So, yeah, I think I'm ahead of time, so I think no one will complain about this. So, thank you for your attention.
