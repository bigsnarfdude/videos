Yeah, so thank you for inviting me. I'm a postdoc at Brandeis with Samuel Dudgic and Seth Brayden, part of the Brandeis Bio-Inspired Materials Mersec. And there I've been working on cytoskeletal deposits, and that's what I'm going to talk about today. So, this is mixing two types, parts of the cytoskeleton, microtubiles and actin, in hopes of understanding something about how active. About how active materials can drive material around them, reorganize that, and how that feeds back onto active stresses and how they can reorganize themselves. So this is a movie of a cell moving on a substrate down the slide here. And this sort of really captured my interest early in my postdoc because it is a representation of a single bag, a cell, organizing the actin, which is an agenda in this movement. The actin, which is an agenda in this movie, in two very different dynamical ways. So in the back, you see the mice and motors that are contracting the actin. And for the cell to move, this dynamical process has to be coordinated with the other dynamical process down here where that actin is polymerizing and you see much less contraactivity from the micellars. This is also playing a little, so that's really interesting. Like, how do you coordinate these different mechanical dynamics? Mechanical dynamical processes in the single organism. But it's also like playing the trick of fluorescence microscopy, which is that it's ignoring all the other stuff there. So this is actually happening in like a complicated cytoplasm, right? Where these dynamical processes are not just representing the reorganization of acting, but the material around it also has to be reorganized. And these things have to be robust against the material reorganization of the cytoplasm. Of the cytoplasm, right? So this is a classic, like good cell image of the complicated nature there, right? So this is sort of building a motivation of how do these active processes operate in media that are more complicated than just the fluid background. So the intent here was to build a simple in vitro system in which I have control over wide ranges of mechanical responses of some sort of material background. Of some sort of material background, and then add some active component which I can also tune independently to see some sort of broad range of behaviors that maybe in some way have something to do with the movies I'm showing later. So the tools I'll use for that are actin and microtubules. The actin in this case is going to play the role of some sort of network that I can tune its mechanical response. It's mechanical response that will be independent in that sense of the driving, which will be through microtubule network. So, simply we take actin, polymerize it, and stabilize it with fluidin. The fluidin also carries the fluorescence moiety that we can then image with. And I add faccin, which cross-links these filamentous actin, the filamentous actin into bulk. The filament is active into virals, into bundles that are chiral in nature. And then the nice thing about this system is that then you can image the three-dimensional structure with confocal microscopy. So you can directly observe on the microscopic scale the structure of this network. And also, you know, I'm leveraging the community that's here and all the information. And all the information and knowledge we've built over the years about the mechanics of these systems. Right, so then, in addition to that, I have a second network that's composed of microtubules. These microtubules are stabilized by GMP-CPP. They're a few microns in length. And they're bundled together with this microtubule cross-linker PRC1. And then that creates some sort of network of thick microtubule bundles, which spans three-dimensional space. Three-dimensional space. And they're driven out of equilibrium at the microscopic scale by these clusters of truncated Knessen-1 motors. So it's just a short part of the Knessen-1 that then has a biotenylation that allows us to connect them together with a biotin scriptabin language. At the sort of microscopic scale, when you have two microtubules that have opposite chirality nearby one another, these kinesium motors can draw some sort of sliding there that then builds up. There, but then builds up to this kind of chaotic flow that you see in this movie on the right, where you see these microtubule bundles using fluorescence microscopy flowing around. There's no actin in this case. If you then... Well, okay, yeah. So then the idea is how do you mix these together? This protocol is actually quite important. Obviously, it's very difficult to mix two different types of polymers together. So I steal the idea from polymer science that you build a first network. Science that you build the first network and then add the monomers of the second network so you can truly make an intertigitated network, you know, network of two different types of polymers. So the key here is that the actin network is, the actin is, the nucleotides in the actin are replaced with a synthetic nucleotide AMPPMP. And so that allows the actin to polymerize in the absence of ATP. In the absence of ATP, and then I add the AMP, PMP replaced actin to pre-made microtubule bondings. In addition to that, there's no ATP available in the solution at that point for the kinesin to move. So the actin polymerizes in the absence of flow. So then if you don't do that, then you'll have this flowing network that will entrain the growing polymers in your fluid flow, and then your fluid flow will. Fluid flow, and then your fluid flow will drive some sort of very uncontrolled network destruction. If you do this with caged ATP, where initially which is a type of ATP with a moiety that you can then plead with UV light, then you can polymerize the acting in the absence of flow, have a uniform structure of this interdigitated two networks, and then shine UV light, releasing that ETP that the kinetic motors can use and then generate flow. Can use and then generate click. It's all very complicated. So, why don't you memorize them together, like co-memorize them? Like, that's what we do in our classes. I mean, because then you're not having to, well, yeah, why don't you do that? And then have a memorized technical network. At the app, we'll memorize it. At some point, you have to flow it into some shape or type. How do you avoid flow alignment? You've already made your network. Yeah, so you avoid flow alignment by the You avoid flow alignment by making it, well, it's difficult, I guess. And you can't completely avoid flow alignment. But the chamber that I flow into has a small inlet that then expands out and then creates turbulent flow as you add. And so you don't have perfectly unaligned microtubules everywhere, but it's relatively not well aligned at the scales that we see. Why don't you limit them together? Library them together. I mean, it's more complicated. You have, but you I guess you could. This allows me to, you know, have a well-defined microtubal network that is sort of independent of the actin. So if you copolymerize them, I imagine that the polymerization will be different, and your blood volume of microtubules will be different because as you polymerize the microtubules, Polymerize the microtubules in the presence of the actin films, that will disrupt the bundling of the microtubules. In this case, you have bundles that are sort of well-defined because of whatever the passive, like itself being non-equilibrium pipetting that you do to generate the bundles. And then you have some sort of set bundle structure of microtubles that then you have access to. I don't know if it's necessarily better one way or another. The point is that you need some way. The point is that you need some way to have some kind of initial condition that isn't disrupted by fluid. So, this is just a movie of different channels of the microtubules and actin imaged in one slice of thin focal microscopy. You know, trying to convince you that initially the microtubules aren't having any preferred direction, that the actin network itself is independent of the structure of the microtubules, and they're interdigitive. Microtubules and they're interdigitated, and you can flash the EV light and it starts to move. There's no depleting. Yeah, so you know, the microtubules in the dojic lab traditionally use depleting to drive bundling. But if you do that, then the actin is depleted to your microtubules as well. There's really cool stuff you can see by doing stuff like that, but I haven't concentrated on it anymore. The PRC1 replaces that to drive bundling of the microcontrollers. So you can look at extremes here. So this is an example of kind of two extremes. On the top is a sample viewed at a long length scale of millimeters of a one micromolar actin sample where I'm showing you the actin channel on the left and the microtubules in the center and then those combine there. And at this low concentration, the actin doesn't. And at this low concentration, the actin doesn't form a network. The microtubule flow just drives fluidization of these. And it's sort of a trivial example here. The other trivial case is after high concentrations of actin, where you make a very well-connected network that undergoes very little reorganization at high actin concentrations under the drag and pumping up the genose. But if you look at intermediate concentrations, then that's where all the interesting stuff happens. Happens. So here I'm showing you on the top the actin channel and you know various increasing actin concentrations from one to seven micromolar. The bottom I'm showing you the movie of the driving by the microtubules and you can see that at three micromolar you see this really awesome oscillation of the snap work where you have you see this coordinated deformation over the millimeter wax scale of the system where you see this Scale of the system where you see this actinetwork sloshing and it's driving by the microtubules. As you decrease the concentration a little bit, you see a different regime of behavior where you don't see this system-wide scale coordinated motion of the active network, but instead you see much more local, albeit still longer length scale than the driving of the microtubles flow. The other thing I want to point out is that the actin network structure. The actin network structure here looks very kind of multi-scale. You see these very large holes in the network, and between those holes, there's this network that has a much tighter much size, right? So there's this complicated formation of this. I was just curious what a micro tube is. Yeah, so that's around 13 micromolar. And it's just constant, like, I have not varied that at all. I think you could see really cool stuff doing this. I think you could see really cool stuff doing that, but it's already too complicated for the other one at the top. Why doesn't Infasten drive phase separation that everything clubs up? Sorry. Why doesn't Infastin would sort of lead to more and more clustering, I would think, if you did. Yeah, so that's a good question, and I don't know why. And I think it has to do perhaps with the emergence. Well, you're not driving enough deformations eventually for you to explore the conformations that allow you to clump up. I have hidden. I've hidden some, you know, you can go in between these limits, and eventually you see clumps of actin forming at very long times. So it's something you can't see, I'm just not presenting. At the two microorphs, it looks like you're getting, I mean, at least if I'm looking at this, it doesn't look like it's at any stage. It looks like you're coarsening it. You're getting, it's starting out with more users. Yes, it definitely coarsens over time. So that your network's So that your networks so that does that affect does the changing of the structure of the app then affect the length of the momentum as well? I think it definitely does, and I will get to that at the very end. Do you have any way to measure or control the length of the active syllabus? I mean, I have Capsi Purified to do that, but I haven't done that. I've done that for other things without cross-linked facia. Could you take the length of that and fill them with what all the concentrations in which these patterns pop up? I think so, in that it will. I'm not sure. I don't know. I mean, I sort of always assumed that it's really like, in this case, the cross-link, you know, the fastening that matters, and the mechanics that come from that cross-linking. And you have these bundles, and so then there's some scale that's more important. So then there's some scale that's more important, which is like the bundle point scale, not the individual filming. It's definitely true if you do this with entangled actin, but then you don't see the sort of dynamics and stuff. Sorry, what's true if you do it with entangled paths? If you change the length scale of entangled actin, then you see very different response. But you don't see this other. I haven't tried that. I've just assumed it's not a super important parameter. Okay. Okay, so one thing that's quick you wonder about is like how what is this initial reorganization that happens. So this is a movie at a much finer scale here, 100 microns. And it's a projection in three dimensions of a comfortable micrograph that's turned into a movie. And so you can see here, initially, there's a really dramatic reorganization of these initial bundles. Organization of these initial bundles, and that they form this network that then sort of approaches a steady state where it's deforming in the act of driving, but it's not dramatically changing its structural remote microtubules. Yeah, a lot of this, you have to imagine them flowing in the background, but there are microtubules in here. You see them. What? This is the active. This is the active. This is the active. The microtubules are flowing, driving the motion that you see. I see movement of the sheet. I don't see the organization. So initially it looks like this. These are the initial bundles of Actin. And then, well, that's the next slide. To trigger happiness, there's at short times a really dramatic organization into this connected structure. And then, you know, there's some slow reorganization now that's happening, and at longer times, it becomes static, right? And so there's all kinds of questions that I have unanswered about how this is formed and how it's connected to the flow. Here's another example of this behavior happening. Of this behavior happening where you see the emergence of this even more large-scale pores in between these nodes. Which means that the cross-links are dismantled by the activity. Yeah, so at low concentrate in I guess my point is that at some point it starts to resist deformation in flow, right? Deform deformation and flow, right? So it maintains its connectivity over time. This is not flowing. Yeah, I mean, it's translating. That's what I would say. Initially, that's so. It's fluctuating. Yeah. So here, to then answer to Stella's question, I mean, if you like to network entangle like this, it cannot freeze it actively like this. Which is the idea to entangle. To entangle the actin and microtubule networks without question inference under driving. The microtubules are not connected rigidly into another. That's the point. The microtubules are not rigidly connected. They're not dynamically connected, say, by motors, but they... Individual microtubules can flow. There's no question to other microtubules. There is a bundler of the microtubules. I guess I should point out clearly, the bundler of the microtubules is extremely dynamic and allows for the slide. Allowance for the slide and that's not the measure. I'll hold on my should be more exact. Thank you very much. They're not, you know, infinitely, it's not true that they're true solids. They're connected by cross-sectors that have a time scale. Absolutely correct. I mean, there's not much stiffness in the acting bundles, but even if there if there's space for them to connect, even in that frustrated topology, they could still clump up. They could still clump up, I would think. Doesn't look like there's a lot of bending stitches. Yes, there is not a lot of bending systems. If you go to the limit of large bending stitches, you see very little of the organization. It's only because I'm able to use actin, which is this thing that I can tune its mechanics over a huge range to very soft amounts, where I can balance the active stresses to the mechanics of the active demonstrators sort of stuff. That's a key point. Because it doesn't look like you have a count point. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I mean, if you were to do like a Maxwell counting thing on this last thing, yeah, it's not extremely well connected. But I think the other point is that the things that are connecting it are like floppy to the flow. In addition, like the, I guess I'm not pointing it out very clearly because I'm not showing the microtubules, the correlation of the flow in the microtubules is much smaller than the length scales you see here. Scales you see here, right? So these deformations that actinoma come from like opposing flows of things that are happening, and then we're not done with them. It's hard to image these at fast enough time scales for me to show both at the same time. If I remove the fastin, I don't see any of these connected networks form. And in low concentrations of actin, you see something very similar to what you s I showed at one micromolar. Showed at one micromolar, which is that the entangled actin is driven and sort of has these density fluctuations that are correlated with the density fluctuations in the microtubules. If you go to much higher concentrations of actin, like 10, 20 micromolar, then you can start to see this entangled actin network completely change how the active stress is generated and microtubules drive the network. And so you see contraction into asters and other structures. If you increase the energy Structures. If you increase the entangled axial concentration even more, then you see system-wide contraction that likes in the absence of any flow. And there, in those cases, also then, in that sort of like, imagine the contracting structures are like phase-separated bodies. In the minority phase, the microtubrules are undergoing flow that's extensile. But I didn't talk about that. Here, I was really interested in trying to get at questions about, like, okay, you have a network. How does it generate elasticity? Is it going under percolation as it's being driven? So, this is an example of something at very intermediate concentrations where initially the actin network is not connected. But then I introduce flow, and that flow drives these separated bundles into each other, creating a connected network. So, here is a projection of an initial. Here is a projection of an initial actin network where the bundles are forming very small connected structures. And those are represented, connected structures here, are represented by a single color. So if you look here, there's some cyan, and it just looks like a zoo or a rainbow thread. But if you turn on the activity and watch this movie, then this green blob, which represents the largest connected structure in the system, then grows to the system size. In this case, it's the observing window of like 800 microns. Of, like, 800 microns or so. And so you see this percolation transition driven by the introduction of flow in the system. You can then look at sort of how the connections in the system change over time. So this percolation that I just described in this green image right here represents a very short time scale right here where you see a change, a dramatic change in how the fibers are connected. And then over longer time scales, which is And then over longer time scales, which I think came up earlier, there's a much slower scale, time scale series of events that happen that lead to a sort of steady state of connecting the network. Okay. So, you know, I don't have any. I think that perhaps it has something to do with Christophe's question about how does this stop and slow its bundling and it's the bundle. Bundling, and the bundles of actin are connected by fasten, they should just clump up at some long time scale. But I think what happens, you're driving the system into a structure that resists the deformations that it's seeing. And then the conformational changes become very slow on the time-specific experiment. The other thing that happens, which I haven't been talking about, is that we see a contraction of these actin. Contraction of these actin filaments into sheet-like structures. Okay, so this is an example of that. At the early time scale, it happens very quickly, but I think we saw it just now again. The actin is filling the chamber, which is like 100 microns tall, and then collapses into this vacuum. Where are the microtubules at this point? Yeah, so the microtubules are throughout the system and they And they partition into regions outside, inside, and both, you know, above, below, and also inside. In this case, I'm showing you a very thin sheet of actin there. There's very little microtubules inside. And I think that details of that are actually very important. If you have a sheet that's very thin, but very dense, like this intermediate concentration of active. This intermediate concentration of actin here, then you have this sheet that has very little pores in its XY plane for microtubules to move through. And then you've separated the flow of microtubules above and below, and that excludes the drive-in in the sheet of the microtubules. If you have a very thick sheet, then there are microtubules partitioned inside of this very open meshwork, which maybe has to do with slow reorganizational time scales. Time scales. And then in this case, this looks extremely erratic because it's fluctuating out of plane, but also because it has very large pores. So here, then the flow of the microtubules can move through these giant holes this much. You know, we can plot this over time. I think that maybe these are self-you know, it's not clear to me why does this thing contract? I mean, in some sense, like, I've started with this thing that will stay. I've started with this thing that will stick together as you drive it, and it does. But why do you form these sheets that are in the center? What defines this thickness and the time scales involved in these directions? I'm still trying to figure out. Some other very obvious thing that you see when you look at these movies there is that there's these really dramatic out-of-plane deformations in these acting sheets, which is exciting because I think there's a long history of membrane deformation in our community. Of membrane deformation in our community, and we can start to ask questions about: okay, if you have a system that has some sort of correlated noise or something, how does that lead to membrane deformations in the dynamics of those microbes? And so to that end, we've started to quantify these deformations and look at how they're changing. In this movie here, we've coarse-grained this network and assigned heights in X and Y to this. And you can see, I think, over time that the magnitude of the deformations out of planar coarsening. Deformations out of plane are coursening, and also the spatial correlation of those deformations are also coursing over time. You see that in this hydrograph or space-time plot of the same thing. And we can also start then to look at this power spectrum. There's a challenge to all that that we didn't realize at first, which is actually the magnitude of these fluctuations are very large. So you start to have problems. So, you start to have problems of confinement and stuff, which we haven't thought about very much. Well, I guess the role of that and how, like, as you can find, as a membrane sheet comes up here, it will cause a screening length in the flow and things like that, which are more comfortable. What in the different colors? So, here I'm finally showing you the microtubules and magenta. These are, this is the actin. I think it's a membrane? The actin is, this is a. Uh the actin is this is a XZ slice. And so you're slicing through a sheet that extends into a plate. So it is microto that for sex into? That's one of our hypotheses. Yes, but you have like a flow, you know, you have a surface that breaks the symmetry and then the drill. Supposedly the network is pretty easy to stretch. Yeah, that's not. Yeah, I think it's very, very soft. And then you'll have some sort of like effective change in the effective stretching modulus because of the fluctuations that are driving these folds and things. Does it always occur like it's always, I mean, so have you looked at sort of geometry of your sample chamber and like the height and the thickness of something else that? Yes. Well, in some cases, Well, in some cases. So, another thing that's really awesome is the large-scale correlated dynamics. If you change the width of the chamber, as Ray suggests I should do, then you can actually suppress these large-scale fluctuations, which we see here sort of and plotted more clearly here, where I'm showing you the space-time timer graphs of the velocity in the y-direction with varying chamber widths. And so you can see the skinny ones. And so you can see these skinny ones don't generate correlated motion, but over here you see that, and you also see signatures of a traveling wave moving through the system. This is getting at the idea that that correlation of that large-scale motion grows over time very clearly. So you can see at these long times it's very correlated in the live velocity, but at short times it's not. You can see that the chambers that are too skinny don't grow and these grow. And these well. Another thing that's awesome is that when this system is driven for long times, you can see this sort of uncoordinated motion at early times, and then this large-scale motion starts to set in. And at even larger times, we'll start to see what look like bands that go in this direction and this direction. And that's actually wrinkling of the sheet as it's being driven. And so maybe there's like some questions about as you drive this acting network. Acting network, which has bonds that can reorganize, are you doing some kind of trainability to the network that allows you to start driving these deformations more and more? So you can start to see these wrinkles appearing in its old age now. And those really are associated with folds, which are, you know, I'm trying to represent here with a conflict of micrograph that's not from the same sample, but a similar sample that the experiments are going at the same time with. And then this is hot off the press, so, but I've really been trying to characterize the flow in three dimensions, okay? But that's a major challenge. You can see that here, I'm imaging the microtubules and this acting sheet, and it looks very choppy, which makes it very difficult to do some sort of description of the flow in three dimensions because the images are more or less totally uncorrelated. If you do your imaging with much less resolution in Z, then you can't really track the image. Z, then you can't really track the individual bundles and have beautiful still images like this. But then you can start to do PIV by segmenting the regions in our system. So I can segment the three-dimensional micrographs into regions above the sheet, inside the sheet, and below the sheet, and then project those into two dimensions and look at the flows in those segmentations. And here's some representations of that here, where you see the micro. Of that here, where you see the microtubules above the sheet flowing and inside the sheet flowing, and they're clearly extremely different. Wait a minute, can you reduce ATP concentration to make things go slower to make it easier to enter this? So when you do that, then like, since all this comes out of this complicated, like, self-organizational pathway, like, we don't see that right off the bat, and then it's like, am I going to spend months trying to find just the right thing when that happens in the book? It's something I would like to do. Although it's something I would like to do, but I think the next step is to introduce optogenetic kinesin motors where we can prescribe the activity at some time. So I drive it at fast speed, form the network, and then slow everything down and see if I can capture something down. Do you have the ADP regeneration in here? Because eventually you get right out of the way. Yeah, I left that out. But there is a PEP that's sitting in solution that's used by a That's sitting in solution that's used by an ATV regeneration specification. Yes. Yes, but it you but Yes. I don't know how to guarantee that it's in steady state in that case. And so then there's like these systems last for many, many hours. And I yeah. Eventually when they run out, when they're dead, do you still have a Dead, do you still have a? I presume you still have a convoluted active sheet. Yes. Yes. Yes. But it's a question of: is like, I don't see any clear relaxation. Is that because the activity is slowly slowed down? And then you're left with this like microtubule, soft microtubule network that just barely supports the fluctuations, or is it purely because it's plastically deformed structures? I don't know. Is the structure, does the microtubule, the structure of the micrubule network change as you get this like base separation of the two? Yes, so that's this. Yeah, so this, I finally got back to your question. So these are microtubules outside and inside the network. You can see the microtubules in the actin are like completely different in kind of their spacing and their flow. I mean, is that like when it's in the sheet? Are you talking about like if you just look at the microtubules before that the facet compresses? Are they a little different than the ones you have? Yeah. Like, is this my is this are these microbials in the active once it's compressed, or is this like just yeah, this is these are these are taken at some sort of time that the grassroom that I just trained decided was steady state. And so I don't know what it looks like if he segments things that are taken careful at time and scale. Yeah, okay. So maybe you get more like alignment with like in the movies that look like this, movies that look like this, it looks like the microtegeols have a very similar structure and then just get thicker in the segment, in their partition regions. It looks like shorter, like the monotubules in the sheet are shorter than the ones outside. Did they partition in the more segments? Yeah, so the bundles of microtubules are, you know, much. Are much different. They're shorter, the length scale over which you see correlated flow is very different. And I don't know what the partitioning of the mass between the two phases is. The Z projection maximum intensity or something? Yeah, so what I've done is I've segmented an image like this into three zones: the zone without actin above, the zone with actin, and the zone below, and then I've done a Z projection. And they must be. Projection. And they must be shorter in the middle one. I don't know what you mean by shorter. The bundles are. They should be shorter because of that protection. That's the best protection. But like the micro the bundles, I don't know. I don't, we don't have like a well-defined length for the bundles. But it's the PSHR. Yeah, I mean like the tangent tangent correlation length is shorter. These kinesium aggregates, how these bundles of microtubules really organized? Is it indeed produces contraction or it is produces opposite movements? Yeah, so large-scale behavior is like extensional. Extension. And how that extensional behavior comes out, you know, people can debate about it, but I haven't really tried to focus on that. We're kind of slowly transitioning to a question period here, so I don't know if you have a conclusion slide. I'm happy to just go to questions. You know, my conclusions are. You know, I guess what I was going to say about this is like, okay, I'm using this segmentation, and we can start to get questions that really start to elucidate something about how the system is being driven. And so I'm excited for that, but this is like data that I got last week, so it's totally not analyzed. But here I'm showing you this. Here, I'm showing you the speed of the flow in the microtubules above and below the sheet in red and green, and then below the speed of the actin movement, and just below that, the speed of the microtubules that are moving inside of the sheet. So the flows are very different than just the velocities. And then, if you look at the autocorrelations of these flows, then you see things that are also similar to that, that showing. To that, that you know, showing that the flows inside the sheet are very different than the flows outside the sheet. Here, this red line, this like pink line here, is the actin moving, it has a spatial autocorrelation of its velocity that's much longer than the things that are driving it, be it the thing, the microtubule flow outside or that inside. And then, if you look at the microtubules that flow above and below, this seems very characteristic of microtubules that would be flowing. Of microtubules that would be flowing in the absence of any actin, and that they have like around 50 to 100 micron correlation length in their flow structure, and that they have this anti-correlation there, which is associated with like the pattern vortices of flow in the system. So, if you go past a vertical length scale, then you get to some sort of negative autocorrelation. That disappears when you look at that microtubural flow. At the microtubule flow inside of the sheet, and also the correlation length gets smaller. Presumably, that's because you have this tight meshwork through which these bundles now have to navigate. And so clearly, the microtubial flow is affected by the presence of the actin. You can probably presume that the actin network structure is changing, and perhaps there's some feedback there that's leading to some of these larger-scale organizations we see. Here is like a projection of the mind. Like a projection of the microtubules in that sheet and the actin network itself. And so if you squint by eye, this looks like maybe in some places the network is being driven by some sort of flow and then gets to some sort of displacement. And the microtubles push on and act and contracts. I have no proof of that whatsoever, but it's something like I would like to held order parameters to test. And here I'm showing you the spatial autocorrelation. With a spatial autocorrelation between the flow of the actin and the microtubles inside, which is this highly correlated thing, and those flows outside be above or below not very well correlated with the actin recognition. Well, actin flow. Yeah, so these are the conclusions you can skip from. Nancy? So, um, really cool. Um, you see the wrinkling with time. And they'll vary like with time. Is that because the sheet is thinning and so there's more area that has to be fit within this space? The sheets generally contract in the XY plane as well, but much more. I think that the contraction that we see the sheets contract continuously in the XY plane, so I don't think that's the cause. Are they contracting? I think it's. Are they contracting? I think it's a little bit more like a microphone. I mean, in in these movies that you see, you can see that the deformation of the actin network pushes it into the walls of the chamber and perhaps it's just sliding onto this solid wall that then buckles out of plane. So if your ATP runs out, eventually, does the active sheet come back? Is there sort of a sheet that then relaxes? Yeah, I haven't seen any relaxation. And so I am puzzled by that. I am puzzled by that. Perhaps it's because the actin itself is actually plastically deforming. And so then it takes on these structures constantly reforming itself. The other is that, you know, there's microtubules in the background. So they could be supporting this deformed structure. And for example, if I were to like cool, if the microtubules weren't stabilized, then I could cool it down and see the active network relax and flatten. That'd be very slow because PRC holds. That might be very slow because PRC holds it also, both holds the microgus together. Yes. That's a good point. Well, that's proof that I haven't tried that. I mean, would you see, wouldn't it? It's probably not relaxing because of the fast men there, I imagine. As it's coming together, then you provide more opportunities for the fastener degree cross-links. If you add fewer cross-linkers in there, how's it going to relax? Once it's like all bunched together, okay, now we use cross-links, then yeah, but I guess my thought is that I guess my thought is that, yeah, that's my point. If you have FASTEN, then you have plastic deformation because the time scale of the binding and binding can respond to the configuration that's driven. Have you tried, well I guess, have you varied the fasten concentration, or have you tried other cross-centers? Do you think it's the actual bundling of the actin by the fasten or do you think it's that by having the length of the cross-centers in there you're increasing the rigidity of the actin network? Yeah, so I have used other cross-link. I have used other cross-linkers that allow for bundling, and in those cases, I see similar things in that I see like a large-scale oscillation. I haven't characterized that very carefully. The only cross-lipper I've used in that case is IQ gap. In the other case, if I use biotin-streptavanin linkages between the actin networks, then I don't see any of this. It's all very, you know, I think it's just. The, you know, I think it's just too stiff. And also, the scale of the cross-linker spacing, I think, matters. Here, I'm using an active network which is bundled, and then the spacing between those nodes of the bundled network is much larger in scale than those that you would see in something that's cross-linked in other ways. And so, I think that's actually really important here: that scales of these network structures interacting is critical. Well, my question was just about cross-linkers. And uh alpha-actinium of course would be more interesting because form tight bundles but alpha actinium form bundles where the hexian filaments are distant from the other. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was going to try filament, and then I also wanted to make optogenetic filament to like turn on and off the processing. But however, I'm doing that. Okay, I will remind you that we have a group photo at
