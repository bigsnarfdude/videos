Okay, Sarah was going to talk about the Gaussian fountain mantle semi-looks of weak opening limit. So please please. Thank you, sir. Well, can you hear me? Yes, okay. So I will discuss about two of the classes of semi-group Gahana. Of semi-group that had appeared in this workshop. One of these is the Gaussian, and the second class is the weak coupling. What I want to show is that the intersection of these two classes is not empty. I will try to convince that this is so. This is a joint work with the Porgebolani and Gran Copa√±ola. The work is still in progress. Anyway, we have good indications that. Indications that our results, even when they are preliminary results, gives strong indications that these two classes of semi-groups, the Gaussian and the Wi-Coupling, have an only empty intersection. This is way to approach this problem. What is the motivation? Motivation is that, as you have seen in the previous talks in this workshop, Previous talks in this workshop, Gaussian quantum semigroups are very interesting, very important class. They have a lot of symmetries, they allow even explicit computations, but a natural question arises whether or not these Gaussian quantum Markov semigroups can be deduced from fundamental physical laws. I mean from first principles. I mean, from first principles. And we approach this question by trying to show that Gaussian quantum Markov semi-groups and weak coupling limit semi-groups have a non-empty intersection, because we know very well that the weak coupling limit semigroup is a class of generators, a class of semigroup that is deduced from fundamental laws of physics. On fundamental laws of physics. They are reduced, for instance, through an application of the stochastic limit. So I will try to convince you that there exists Gaussian quantum macrosymmetric that are with copying. This is the outline of my talk. I will very briefly recall the structure of generators of the Gaussian. Of generators of the Gaussian semi-group. Later, I will recall the weak opening limitability, the structure of weak opening limitability generators. In the case of several reservoirs, it is necessary to go to the case when the coupling limit generators are associated with cellular reservoirs because apparently. Apparently, this is a necessary condition to compare and to have a Gaussian semi-globes of the weak operating limit. Later, I will go to the main part of my talk to try to show that the Gaussian class and the Wi-Copling limit class share some elements. Here, I will consider the case. I will consider the case of weak coupling limit generators with a quadratic preference Hamiltonian, quadratic mean, quadratic mean, racial analytic relation. Finally, we'll discuss some sufficient and necessary conditions for these two classes, so semi-groups, to share some elements, some elements in both classes. So let me pass to the first part. Okay, I'll. Okay, I already speak about this. So, in the POC representation of the CCRs, in the dimensions, we will consider multi-indexes. So, the multi-indices can be written as these linear combinations of indicator functions of these singletons. Recall that this. Recall that this diametric focus space is symmetrical isomorphic to this tensor product here. So we have an orthonormal basis in each of one of these spaces, liberal spaces. Then the subset, the set of all these tensor products associated with multi-indexes, give us an. So, give us an autonomous basis of the complete symmetric focus based on C to power D. So, I will work with this with this orthonormal basis. And creation operators are defined in this form, in this way, and they are well defined on the leaders of space span by these vectors with R pi multi. With alpha multi-index. And this is an excession domain for both creation and an ecliptation and creation, as well for the operators an ecliptation and creation associated with vectors in C to the poverty. Now, the generators of Gaussian quantum Marco semigroup have this structure, the Korean structure. The Gorinikosakovsky Spoilers limbed the structure. This is the form of the generator. Well, this is a completely positive part. And G is given by this expression here. H is the Hamiltonian. And this is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup of contraction. The semigroup by itself is obtained as the minimal solution of this master equation. Of this master equation. Specifically, in this case, the Hamiltonian is a quadratic Hamiltonian like this, and the Kraus or noise operators are linear combinations of creation and nikulation. In this expression, omega is a medium matrix, and k is also a symmetric matrix. And well, these are coordinates of vectors in each is the power. vectors in situ poverty. The existence and uniqueness of the minimal solution can be discussed along the lines that are well known since long time ago, developed by Pancupanola and Alexander Tibotario. So now the weak coupling limit generators. This is the case for several reservoirs. For several reservoirs. This class of generators are associated with a preference Hamiltonian that it is assumed to be a separate gene operator with discrete spectrum and with finite dimensional spectral projection. This is the spectral representation of the reference Hamiltonian. This is a crucial element, this is the starting point. Associated with this reference Hamiltonian exists the class, the set of ball frequencies. Both frequencies are associated with pairs of eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian. More precisely, we could consider only positive frequencies associated. positive frequencies associated with differences of two pairs of elements in the in the spectrum. Okay, I denote by B plus these positive differences. And for every difference that I denote here by omega, I will consider this set, this subset, which is the set of all pairs associated, all pairs of positive operator values. Of the values of the reference Hamiltonian such that the difference equals omega. In general, omega is not given by a unique part. There may be very many pairs that are associated with the same omega. So this troubles uh mihat were. Hat where what did we have? Sorry, here, no, the hat is not, this should not be that here. Should be without the hat. So the structure of the generator is as follows. We have to sum over the frequencies and for each frequency and for each environment, the environments are here indexed by this variable j which runs from one to the number. With runs from one to the number of reservoirs, and the generator is a sum of generators associated with each frequency and with each reservoir. The structures of each one of these commands is a given specific gear. It's important to distinguish here. These are the noise operators, the crowd operators. Also, these are separate gene operators that are associated with the effective Hamiltonian. And there are some constants here, the so-called perceptivities that are associated. Sorry, it should be also depend, these gammas depend also on J, on the environment, on the environment, on the this should be gamma of G plus or minus somewhere. plus or minus omega. Okay, the class operators d omega, dj omega, have this structure here. They are the sum of all the pairs epsilon n epsilon n associated with this same omega and are determined by a certain interaction operator, dj. And here in the definition of these cloud operators also appears the spectral projection of the reference Hamiltonian. So this is the structure of the Kraus operator associated with the Wiccoplan limit type generator. As I told you, these deltas are associated with the F. Are associated with the effective Hamiltonian. This is the effective Hamiltonian. And it is assumed that these operators are turbine joint and belongs to the commutant of the reference Hamiltonian. The gammas, these are important, these constants, gammas, are associated with the environment and with frequencies. And they are defined in this form. Beta J is the inverse temperature. It is assumed that this beta j is the same. And it is assumed that this means that regular enough functions, positive and regular enough. It always happens this inequality. So I will assume now, from now on, I will assume that the reference Hamiltonian that we define, that will be associated with our with coupling limit generators. With coupling limit generators, this reference Hamiltonian is a very special form. I will assume that this reference Hamiltonian is quadratic in an equation and creation. So, since one can apply unitary transformations to this Hamiltonian, to be a general quadratic Hamiltonian, in order to arrive to an expression diagonally. Arrive to an expression diagonal like this one, I will assume that this reference comitonia is diagonal. It's the sum of this restricted, it's a linear combination of this restrictive number of paragraphs. So, this is my starting point. Okay, so we can write the spectral decomposition of this reference Hamiltonian in terms of multi-index associated with the eigen Associated with eigenvalues and with the spectral projection. Here, the eigenvalues are functions from the multi-index, the spatial multi-indices, and they can explicitly written in this form. Here, the omega cast, the omega case are, which I will call the fundamental sequences. Fundamental sequence, fundamental, sorry, fundamental Frequencies, right? What are the files? Let me see. The fundamental frequencies are associated with this reference Hamiltonian. Okay. So on the spectral, this is a form of the This is the form of the eigenvalues and the spectral projections can be written in this as this expression here, where the sum is over all indexes, multi-indexes alpha prime, such that the eigenvalue said to be associated with alpha prime coincides with the eigenvalue associated with alpha. Of course, this family of sets. This family of sets, this family is a partition of the multi-index set. So the bulb frequencies, the positive bulb frequencies are described by these differences with pairs of elements in the spectrum. And one can see that every frequency can be written in this form. In particular, we want to consider one multi-index alpha fixed, and we consider that all the concentrates of this multi-index are positive, are greater than one, greater or equal than one, then the fundamental frequencies can be obtained by means of this difference. Difference here, where alpha is fixed and the alpha k is obtained. starting with alpha and subtracting this indicator of the singlet of the singleton k well let me let me emphasize that there could be infinite infinitely many pairs of eigenvalues associated with the fundamental sequences frequencies but not all of these pairs belong to the spectrum only the spectrum. Only the pearls associated belonging to this spectrum are acceptable as to be associated with frequencies. So we have this proposition. And the reference Hamiltonian is not almost here that the reference Hamiltonian is a separate gene operator with Thermagen operator with discrete spectrum and with finite dimensional spectral projections. So, how to ensure that these conditions hold in the case when the Hamiltonian has this form, this diagonal form. Well, for instance, here I wrote on sufficient conditions. On sufficient conditions to assure that the spectrum of the reference chametrian has no accumulation point. This goes through whenever we assume that the fundamental frequencies are positive. This is something that we already established, but this is not an uncomfortable indeed. Moreover, if we assume that the Moreover, if you assume that the set of fundamental frequencies is rational independent, then it results that the spectral projections are not only finite-dimensional, but rank one projections indeed. This is the proof, for instance, in the case when since these frequencies are positive, if this limit exists, then this limit imposes a bound on. Bound on the polynase of the multi-index alpha. So, this shows that the normal alpha cannot be arbitrary. So, we cannot have this condition. This spectrum should be insulated. For the second condition, if we have the fundamental frequencies, Frequencies is the set of red mental frequencies, is linearly independent on the rational numbers. Therefore, every pair of multi-insets, this condition here implies that the eigenvalue epsilon alpha has a unique representation in strength curve. And then this top state reduces to only one multi-index. And this means that the spectral projection P epsilon alpha is a rank one projection. It's a rank one projection. So these are sufficient conditions to have an acceptable reference Hamiltonian. Now we have some sufficient conditions for a Gaussian hemi-group to be of a weak coupling limit. Assume that we have a Gaussian generator with either the close operator being creation articulation or creation. creation articulation or creation here L runs on the on the number of clouds operators in the representation and the maximum number of these operators is two times the dimension assume that also that the Hamiltonian is quadratic in this form with omega and Limitian matrix adoption generator with this with these two properties With these two properties, this wheel coupling image type with this reference Hamiltonian with the associated reference Hamiltonian with the wheel coupling image generator, bearing this number, the number operator, and the interaction operators are given by the creation or an equation, depending on whether the L the corresponding class. The corresponding clause operator is any creation of creation. And the effective Hamiltonian coincides with this Hamiltonian. These are sufficient conditions for a Gaussian temperature to be we completely limit. This equation may be very restrictive, but anyway, this shows that even in this very restrictive, very Very restricted, very special situation. The intersection of these two classes of generators is not satisfy your condition of being independent. No, no, but this is just an idea. The world is still in progress, really. So, we are just trying to show how can we. Trying to show how can we construct demographics. Okay, we have to work more than this. We are working more. Okay, so how to prove this? Well, let us prove that for each L and multi-index transparen, one has that the two clause operators, the associated with the equilibrium limit generator, associated with the Lausanne, coincide. Laussen coincide for this for some omega, for some frequency omega, in with the interaction operator DL coinciding with the cloud operator LOL. So assume that we have that this clause operator is an equation associated with this vector. Then we apply to If we apply to an element in the autonomy basis, we have this special here. On the other side, since we have that the sum of all spectral projections equals identity, then there should exist a multi-index such that the corresponding spectral projection with this eigenvalue. With this eigenvalue, sends this Y-C vector into itself. I mean, the Eigen value associated with the multi-index N and the multi-index alpha both coincide. Then for such an N, taking the interaction operator as the annihilation, we have for every alpha. We suppose here a very special basic vector. We suppose that alpha. Basic vector. I would suppose that alpha here has all these coordinates greater than or equal to one. Here, it could not happen. This is a very special situation, but I'm just illustrating how it's possible to get that both generators coincide. So, we apply these clause operators to the basic element and compute. These are valid computations and finally. And finally, we obtained that this condition, that this is the result of applying this close operator to the E alpha. Please observe that this expression here coincides with the one we obtain here. This is a very special, very simplified A very simplified situation. Anyway, it indicates that it is possible that we have these two operators coincide. Well, in the last identity, we have used that for the fundamental frequency omega j, this difference coincides with it. When this set here reduces to just one multi-unit. And this is why you want. In it, and this is why we obtain this expression. Okay, in the case, the reference Hamiltonian in this situation is N should conmute with the effective Hamiltonian. And this is a consequence of this computation. Also, the effective Hamiltonian satisfied conditions that we impose that we need for the generator to be a weak coupling limit. Let me recall you here that the assumption of the effective Hamiltonian is that it belongs to the commutant of the reference chemical. The effective Hamiltonian should be in the commutant of the reference chemical. Of the reference chemical. So, and we have the, we have so. So, let me explain now where do these conditions, I started with these conditions here, with a Gaussian semigroup satisfying this condition. Now, I will try to explain where we. Now I will try to explain where this do these conditions come from. And this is okay. We have this lemma. These are the computations of some commutators here. And the result is this. We assume that the fundamental frequencies are different between them. Difference between them. If a Gaussian generator is web properly limit, then for every L, we have eight that the raw operator is any creation associated with a vector B or creation associated with a vector U, which vectors belong to this T to the power D. Okay? Before you said that a necessary condition is that. A necessary condition is that if all the omega are one, no, you want no, no, let me sorry. The assumption here is that the Gaussian QMS is such that the L L is allocation or pH. Right, but you say that Hs. Hs is a number, okay. But this is for the weakness. But this is for the weak open limit. Now I am trying to explain why these conditions come from. I am trying to show that these are necessary conditions. In the omega j, what are? In your new notation? Omega J will be this omega. Ah, this, no, the small omega j. Omega j. The two you say. You say omega j different omega k in the usual. Ah, yes. This is small. Well, yes, okay. Let me. The assumption is here that the Gaussian generator is a weak coupling limit type, and the omegas are the frequencies associated with this weak coupling limit. Okay? If it is so. If it is so, then we can prove that the ROS operators are any creation or creation. Okay? So this comes from this first, this operator should commute with the reference Hamiltonian. And from this commutativity, these conditions come out. comes comes out and in the case when h equal to k we have this this product should be zero for all for all k and we obtain from here that this vl k or u l k should equal to should be equal to zero for all k this implies that the curves operator have has this this form this structure now if we continue we We can doing the product of this, we obtain this expression here, and using the lemma, for instance, this part, this piece of the operator L star L L L that is, I mean, it is this part doing the commutation. With the different Hamiltonian, we have to obtain zero, but this yields to this expression here, and our assumption implies that these products will be zero. So, for instance, this is enough to have that in this part, we'd have all products with different j and k equal to zero. We have a j equal number, but in a similar way. But in a similar way, working also with the commutal with another part, you obtain that these products are equal to zero. So this part disappears. This sum, the same happens for this. And finally, we have that the noise operators or the cloud operators, 40,000. clauses operators all the gaussian semi-group have this form or this form okay these are necessary the the necessary condition so we as i told you the work is still in progress and we are still working with the proof nevertheless we we expect that in a short time we will have more more more More more complete news of this result. So I will finish here. Thank you. Have any questions? So, can you repeat the conceptual conclusion? The conceptual conclusion is that there are not, but in your talk you showed that there are some. So, I am. No, the conclusion is that the intersection of the class of Gaussian semigroup and the Wyckoplin limit is not empty. It's not empty. It's not empty. We have elements in both classes. And you have a characterization of the integral. Not yet, not yet, but we have example. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, in a very restricted, in a very simplified situation, but nevertheless non-trivial. Okay. This is the risk. The result is strange. I would have conjectured that the intersection was empty, but the use of I think that question go ahead. Yes, thank you for a very interesting talk. If we will be interested in quantum Markov semi-groups with a Gaussian with Gamiltonians like A dagger squared minus A squared. A squared, something like that. It's naturally to have HS with non-discrete spectrum in this case. If you know how to generalize weak coupling limits for the case when HS with non-discur spectrum. Well, no, I don't have an idea how to generalize that situation. For us, it's an essential. For us, it's an essential assumption. The discrete spectrum of the reference Hamiltonian is essential. Thank you. And possibly another question. So it seems that there are, if you have this, well, number preserving situation, then possibly after unitary transform, you have all this number preserving situation besides these cases with. Besides these cases, with with non-discrete spectrum, because due to due to Bogaloop of transforms. Yes, probably. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Another question? Thank you for the talk. It's just a comprehension question. So the A comprehension question. So, the sufficient and necessary condition was on the jam part. So, the jam operators purely creation or creation in some basis. Okay. And what were the additional sufficient conditions? Could you repeat that, please? The additional sufficient? This is the condition on the noise operators, okay? They are annihilation or creation. And the additional is that the Hamiltonian is quadratic. And for the corresponding weak open limit, this is the reference. This is the reference Hamiltonian number or computer. And the interaction, these are the interaction operators coming from the interaction with the batch, with the environment. They coincide with this with the graph operator. The X assumption is the one on the Emilian. Yes, yes.
