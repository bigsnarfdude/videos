So, well, um uh thank you for inviting me to here. Um and I must I must say that I want to say this at the beginning. I mean music critics say that the symphony, the three and five, third and fifth symphony of the toll are the very strongest ones. Heroic, a ruby multiple talk, and the fate symphony that is going to be the next talk. And in between is a fourth. Next top, and in between is a fourth, and that's mine. And it's a light one, it's my favorite one. So it's a very light one. So this is going to be a story. I'm trying to tell you a story, fill it in a little bit on the nine spot. And then let me start talking. So thank you to help me. Every paper on Hitchmanders starts saying that I will. That they were discovered or created as a philosophical western by Nader Litzen in the 80s, 1987, and that they have a rich geometry. That's always, we always say we have a rich geometry. Well, let's talk about a part of this rich geometry, that is the synthetic geometry of these quality spaces, and that's our fixed systems, this Hamiltonian system. That I'm going to define everything. Which we already see the definitions many times, but actually don't that the repetition is nice. So I'm relying on that sentence. Also, I must say that I have a question at the beginning. I just want to pause you and then if you get bored with my talk, you can keep on this question. I mean, we are thinking of teaching systems in relation with supersymmetry, or I mean, of this neurosymmetry things and then all the Defense and all the nice and very cool stuff that Bundarani talked about yesterday, his introduction gave to us. But Hamiltonian systems come from mechanical systems. The very beginning of physics, mechanical systems, synthetic geometry was created to give a language for these mechanical systems. And actually, was written in a paper of you long term with Lee a long time ago when you were describing Ago, when you were describing, I mean, infinite Gauss Vanions to give a link between AP interall systems and modulus species of fixed vendors with any twisted Lamb alphabet. Actually, if you go to Mark Hunt's paper, student of 49, there is a section, number 9, stasis, number 9 section. He talks about a paper of Pericera Bergier, where he explains that there are where he explains that there are if you think on modular spaces of these bundles with metomorphic spheres over a limited curves then you also recover the well you recover this in curves I mean but through a paper of Trevich and earlier that I never was able to to find this something there I don't know what this is on the screen okay so let me start Um okay, so let me start with um the the I promise. And now you see this stop recording. So, I mean I was thinking, naive thinking, very naively thinking, what happens when we mix this very cool stuff, this very cool physics, through these interval systems and other mixing systems. Intergoable systems and other region systems with a very classic physics. I don't know. It's a question for the physicist. What does it tell us? I don't, I mean, I think that it's very curious, these very classical things very much related with these very new things related with the string theory. So I I don't know. So if you get bored during the talk, think about that. I get that very often. So for me uh I I derived completely the whole system. I direct completely the whole system, and it will be on a positive manifold. So, and then for that is a vibration over the the Washington force to K plus L uh dimensional and the variations over a K plus L um Functions. And then these the functions are paired with, how do you say, Poisson invariant. Then these are the ones between K, and these L are the customers, these are the ones that commit all the functions. Of course, I'm thinking holomorphically. The fibers, the combined fibers of the casomirs, let's say I1, I L. Well, let's put the last ones, or the first ones, whatever. You don't mind. Um are the fibers are alerian varieties, or they say alerian varieties? Um and buttons? What else is it? Well, of course you will say that they create um what that's that's it. Um so our examples will be what? Which ones should person commit here? These are the well, these are the ones uh given by the rank of the of the person uh structure. Of the POSOM structure, and these are the and the Casimirs are the ones that commute with every function. You got 2k functions or three functions? Sorry? I mean, here about. 2K plus L is the rank of the manifold, and K plus L the number of functions. Here, okay. Um then the nice. Then, the nice tip, so I'm the kind of person that never gets examples, but in this talk, there's everybody examples. We are lucky, and then the examples for these things will be modest of examples, where we have, I think we will have simple complete internal systems, and we will have class for K, as well as zero, and then we will have a million varieties as fibers of our region. We will have something that is. We will have something that is called that we call frame Higgs mandals. We will have parabolic Higgs handles and we will have maybe I say a little bit for future ongoing just mentioning that it will be frame parallel. Which the idea of talking about those was supported on Ron's talks yesterday because he said that it was important to produce examples of architectural computing systems. So I'm giving the examples. So let me recall you. Let me let me tell you this way. Let me fix notation. I'll give you this remote source. Compact complex. Here is the genus. Complex. All the dimensions will depend on the genus. And then our physical response. Usually you always fix the rank and the degree. You are thinking of principal principal vendors and you fix the order type of the principal vendor. But let me forget about rank I think at the time. Forget about writing that giving the time from now on, since here, but and then what then? Instead of giving you the principle, the definition that we are, I can go into the definition that we have today. Let me say, I want to stress something, which is the problem that our case. It's a holomorphic section of the nomaface times the canonical. So it's one form of the canonical, but and then you have this holomorphic space of different state. Anything will be a stable because that's easier. It's being a little bit easier. If you want, R D, but for now I'm not going to write R or not. What are the information that's going to be? What are the what is the deformational space of this volume space? How do you compute the landing of this? And it's going to be a reversal thing that if you want to get this in target, you just do some validity and then you get your sections at work. So this is very natural to say, okay, I've got tangential things. Say okay, and the tangent of the Moon space of vector bundles actually is an open-down subset, a subset of the Muller space of fixed bundles. And as I said, a potangian it has a natural symmetric structure, the Libyan sympathetic structure. And actually, you can compute, in a paper of Simpson, you can say that these are the syplotomic. You can say that these are the symplatonic sponges and the ones that are in this outside the stable modes. What is happening here? Why it's open-bens? Because you have that stable for all software and you find that in the game such that in that response table. That is a price table. Then we follow the condition. So you may have something that is unstable, but because the heat field is not making it fire stable, then you can make an unstable. Can make you can make an unstable itself bundle stable because of the things to do it's field. So it's important in the sense that always you can have, I mean, always that you define yourself, that you think all these spaces as contangents or something, you will have to think of what. To think of what are these open subsets of the holiday space and I extend the synthetic polymorphically. Actually, you can, we did in an acrodic theory, we compute exactly this condiment in the case of hitching purposes. So, okay, this is the classical story. Then the theorem is by heating. Kitchen. Very well-known paper of all of you. I'm talking in front of an audience of a lot of experts in Kitchen systems. It's a little bit embarrassing. Thank you. I don't enjoy this, but you already know. But Nigel proved that this model space of each analyst is and actually this paper is for several. For several, I'm thinking on the definition that Ron gave for the case of principal and he gave many examples with G values. I mean, G principal H values. So G S O, G S L, like many things, many Libraries, semi-simple groups. Okay, that's good. But that's what we get there. It was. It was an idea. There were many people working at the same time on this, but have, sorry, let me define this moving space. Let me go enter. And then what I'm doing is taking the unsubstantial or Cycle of two pairs, n pairs, twisted by L, whatever you want to call it in many ways, but this are the actual. And actually, I will have given my children how we check the model space of such things. The space of such things in exist, if the degree, of course, the degree of L should be bigger than 0, because otherwise you don't have such a, but if the degree exists, you have half of the space. Which is a fascinating ready dimension dimension plus two degree of L plus one okay this degree of L plus one is suspicious because if you want a symplectic manifold you need a fairly an even dimension. So that not expecting that depending on the degree of L but of course. I mean, it can be a filter, but of course, you're not expecting it to be symplectic. And furthermore, this irregularity is not happening. So, this is an attack of tangent. So, what did you do? Actually, it was a both in the eighth of this and Magma independently. Mark money independently that says, let me write now, because again I write it before, but that's a better place to write it down because it's more general, that you have this space. I use the 18 map in my space and then this is just sending your fixed field, I mean your fixed handle, to the characteristic polynomial of the fixed field. What time between What I'm doing, I will. When I'm moving through the examples, I will give more details in the most general cases. We will kind of particularize the previous ones. So, in the case of each others, this one was okay. So, they proved that this is an anti-recomputing control system in the possible sense that I am describing. Um well they also even say more condition I think you need not use the degrees bigger than 2g minus 2 but that the difference is actually effective. Uh that L A That L is K twisted by something effective. It could be. Could be. It could be. I remember it was if it was 2g minus 2, it should be the canonical, otherwise how can I write it? What is the condition expression? To write it down there. I don't know if it's K or D. At the end? K twice, D. Just like. Ah, well, we should have to. Should have to. No, I don't think that is necessary. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. But, well, put it back. The next thing is that for proving that this is in an algebraic computing or system, you rely on the result of Bobina estimate. I think that this means a head of a lion. Tell me. Parasima. Robert. That just, I mean, the paper is not, of course, but the essential result, I think, was very helpful for all of us in general. And you will see that even if we add biological structures or frames, the only way to relate this result is this spectral correspondence. Correspondent, which says that the ISO fixing up, I'm giving you the covenant of the spectral curve. The spectral curve is uh is red is just the curve given by the eigenvalues of your fixed field. Right in terms of precisely for for our device. For our department. And this was actually in the language of the day, they also have a little bit of a paper. Also, the case of the particular case of having K D first, I think that normally does K D first and both in that enterprise and then that's the reason because there is the condition that I was thinking of was The condition that I was thinking of was without this. And in Markman, if there is this condition, but achieving the path. I think that that will be the case. Well, the first that would be Meromorphic expanders. But what is happening there? They are thinking of expanders that have poles of first order, or at some points, that are devising of reflective devices. I think I use invasive. But if you think of the Labelian project theory, this leads you to think what is what happens, I mean, bodily space under Narbene Hoch. Under Nalabian Haut's theory, modular spaces of Higgs bundles are related with representations of the fundamental group. So, what happens if you are removing some points? What happens is that you have representations of the fundamental group without some points, but then you have loops around these points. Well, this theory works well if you put some condition on these loops around the points. This condition means that you have to impose on another requirement. So also you can see orbit of your group where you are representing the here we are working on GL. So then this introduces, I mean this gives us the idea of what happens to this other side. Here we are not imposing anything on the points, only saying that we have poles. The way of imposing things is getting these parabolic structures. This means that you have a band that has a valid structure for a point in the device, you have a flag. Probably because the automatic is flag has the probability to group of here. And actually, there are some weights involved in that. We already have things going around, which are just what's given by the angel, I mean, the root of the object parallel. Well, in that case, I can think of the movie space of parallel triangles. Now we have to prescribe the rank, maybe. To disguise the run, the degree, and the weight. So, pairs there are pairs such that your pixel belongs to the problem you want a function. And then you need to know to do something with this hybrid structure, which means that over each point on the divisor, you use the repotent matrix. These are the so-called strongly parallels. No surprise. You're let me write it here. The problem that we were trying to look for simplicity structures, of course, not structures. They do think on the body state of parallel buttons, the deformation of the space, and stage one. In stage one, x, angular morphism, but where you use triangular matrices there. This will be the Lie algebra of your parabolic, so it's triangular. You can use rectangular matrices instead of hypotenuse. Sorry? And so that's what in this case is funny. It gets So this table two months are that for the remember, says you have a table table endomorphism, text endomorphism and you compute the trace, better the matrices and then compute the trace. In this case, when you have the real button once it's going to get. The new button once is going to get you all numbers. That will get you zeros on the left. So that's the reason because you have the D here. So, and these are your hits here. So, for the modeling space of strongly parallel hit formulas, you have a what you are. Ah, yes, of course. I was saying there's a regularity for this, and I was not going to do it. This moment I was not quite sure. Okay, so in this case, your modulus space of parametric Higgs vendors is as intractably manifold the same way it was before for the modulus of Higgs funders without biobotic structure and without poles. But in this case, in the strongly biobotic case. For those, you have a time limit. Okay. Okay. Um Nippoten is what is parabolic mandos was what the Monica was told yesterday. I was told that that was because of Mazda's thing. But in Google and written paper, all paper, creating this ramblify, they call it parabolic pix mandos. Parabolic fixed mandulas because it ramified geometric language things. They are interested in the non-strong UIs. Let me say that if it is strongly, let me put an S here. And then these other ones are mine. Well, no, not this or my considering these guys. We also have these guys. Then the problem is they are not acquitted and actually not. The monastery was supported by the Corawa as a normal quasi-community of the dimensions. It's similar with what happens with when you have and remember the if it was the degree if it was uh an uh hitching breath, the dimension was the degree of breath. The dimension was the degree of the n would be n would be of your with the dimension. So it's kind of line. Actually it's interesting because the model is space of parabolic bundles with one picture. The dimension depends on the flag but on the type of the flag, how is your flag. But not for the most pace of when you have kids. So there was a theme by Yoko Agua to construct this movie space and it was work of Jeham myself say that this new space. This face is a passion by finding the puzzle and prove that it has a baseline structure, and that the hitching map in this case, let me always write the hitching space as an H that we would understand what kind of spaces we have here, just out of the context. Meaning that I intentionally can That I intentionally can base I times. So the nice thing about, I mean I remember in this paper, which is an old one, because it gives an idea of why to introduce the next work. And it is because you may reproduce, you may try to find this Poisson structure through This Poisson structure through the same ideas and arguments as Wolverton Kamagman, but we found that for proving A, what we did was to use show that the model space for the open space where it is stable Is a rule of a million. This was nice because it saved us a lot of computations and because that's because there's a theorem of grand that says that the dual of Adia Jeffrey has a natural partial structure, then we only have to check that that natural partial structure was the one. structure was the one induced by, let me say, a typical thing to do is to have a Poisson bundle map, a Poisson director, which goes from the cotangent of the Moody space to the tangent in Moody space. And how do you write this? This is H1 plus how I remember when you look, it goes back to a I think it's eventually this one, this I think it's in LB's last thesis, but he computes the deformation of spaces of these fundamentals. And then the gold rex is this one. This is one of the going. Okay. I'm going to the H1 of this. I think that the conversation is because here is the joint map for the screen. You are maybe doing like this because you see nearpotent to nearpotenta and parabolic to parabolic to parabolic. This is how it makes that this map is a Poisson and not a symplectic map. Because if you have this nipoten to parabolic parabola to nipoten or nipoten to parabolic again, you will have a dual a dual uh complex and then you have A complex and you have anisomophies between these spaces. And it's not the case, and that's a resomme that we have was something. So, in the case of a structure parabolic, what happens is that you get, this way you get a simple creative structure, you see, just by checking that the complex are two. They use in parameters. Um so this is the the the question mark. Uh and then what is the D algebra that we get? What is the idea algebra that we get? Um, actually go on an algebra is a selecto-bundle over a variety such that it is a these sheaf of sections are algebraized, pi-agenized. So is the one that appears in the paper where he is proving how to get a connection on the province on bundles, the programmatory. So the adjoint, this is the final just the variant. Okay. Here with the joint joint representation. Uh here is this. Uh here is this. Here is this is this is the at the algebra and our at the algebra rod here is the correlation the algebra that we need is this one um divided by um Uh left under um this is where there is going to be away. Of course, I would Let me explain what I mean by the smoothly space of frame parabolic bundles. I'm very happy to talk about this in Canada because the papers that I know about frame bundles are by Sahma, Mr Jeffreys, and Utubis. So it's And boot to be, so it's kind of Canadian-made. So I would say that I have a frame on a parabolic button. If I have for the gathered pieces, you know, the I have a shower fix on the decreasing of these cases. So in each, I mean, you have a flag, and the flag didn't have, I mean, this equation, they have to be with dimensions, the steps of the dimension of the equation didn't have to be one, could be two, three. So then this will be chunks of dimension two, B, or once. So this is what I mean by a frame there. This is some of it by these chunks. So this So this makes the modulus space of frame parabolic vandals and L lambda, L principal lambda, over the modulus space of parabolics, where L is this union of levies, which are these chunks here causing by the center. It's just the action of the levy on the chunks of the Other vary on the chunks given by the flag. So then this is a principal number, and as you see, it gives me an Ardidia sequence. And what happened is that my model space, this modulus space of parabolic X founders, non-stroke, the ones that are with X fields from the non-Nilbotton, is dual to our HP. Then what we have to do is use this construction of Poisson half to say that it extends the natural Poisson structure given by the algebraic half. Okay, then I feel my purpose of getting a Poisson structure, and now I make you curious on what happens if you add frame structure. And what happens if you add frame structures, framings to your variable balance, to your balance? Let me continue talking about the second part of the theorem, which is the federal energy of our system, which is almost enough. So, in case of B, I say that what we have, that we would like to We would like to understand, for instance, the symplectic leaves. Let me say symplectic leaves of the structure. How do we get there? There's a trick here. So you have, let me say, we go to our base process. That was what we have to do is that we can use the valuation map the following to caution this by what do we get this way? This way we get the eigenvalues. So eight one. So this is essentially Why? Because what we are doing is just sending our fee to this. We are going to get a polynomial. A polynomial that is alpha to there plus alpha a one plus one alpha plus two then where what I'm considering is I have my I write my short list, I have my my phone forms. I one forms with poles, then I have the total space of let me write it, what let me write this AB total and then I have this like this is the projection, this is a pullback, my line map is the section, and then what I'm doing here is considering this one force panel. This one force and if lambda will be my variable, and if I equal this to zero, this is lambda is the variable, this is what describes me the zeros of this describing my a zero r a zero is one, sorry. Um and this is my And this is my spectral code that we have been talking about. So remember, if it was round two case, we would have lambda two, trace, and determinant. So with that, we are kind of expecting the eigenvalues of the hexphale. So when we are taking the validator map, we are just getting to this over the points, we are getting the values, over the mark points, over the Over the my point, over the device. So you mean the idea that there's a present you move? Or the residual metrics here. Yeah, over the point. So, good. And then, okay, the next part I will, and then I say, I should say what I want to say. Sorry, because the symbolic games of V C, eight bots for each for for each set I mean for each A then we will have then we have the image of this is given you will have a Jacobian will be copied by Jacobi and using Bobi gana Sigma Ramana kind of description we will have a Yacon Kind of description we will have in a colour of this spectral curve. But actually, you will think, okay, I have my eigenvalues and I have my biotic structure. What is happening there? Okay, my biotic structure is giving me chunks of different dimensions, and I have my eigenvalues. So what happened is that I can reorganize eigenvalues. So for each reorganization of the eigenvalues, according to these chunks, so I will have m1 equal to 2. M1 equal to 2. And then two of these are the values, I may change them. When I fix the, when I fix this flag, then I have a base. In some base, I will have an diagonal and I have this values there. You can see them easily. But then I can gauge them in each chunk. So I will have different reorderings of the eigenvalues. I will have a union of Jacobians of my spectral quota. So this is the So this is the this is the spectral correspondence in this case and the components of I mean and those are my selected pieces okay good so and with that I already say in Lones discussion I already say this is indeed analogy. This is indeed an A Dervico Liberly internal system in the sense, in the possible sense. My casimirs are these functions with this unpredictable here. And the dimension of this is like I am far and much more. So this is amicosinus. So it's very interesting. But as I told you, I already introduced another structure, which is a film. And then this one, so I'm going to get interested on the following spaces. So I will have M F H. F M F H and then the object that I have are if I'm putting a frame I need to know where to put a frame. So my fixed field has to be an annual device but not to say what I put a frame. Uh and then the frame is just um Uh and then the frame is just uh this point and then we're gonna work um so and it's it's very nice because again in this case what is the quadangle of the common case of frame boundaries? The quadangle is given by page one of x and the most case of p. And the mark is of E times for O minus Z. And that's what? So the variety give us X mode of the in a motor space um that is uh symplectic. That is symplectic motor space. So it was first, myself, and Anna Pelmito that show the sympathetic structure in this case, symplectic. Um the dimension is to uh square d mass n minus 1. Note record this is a degree of divisor. And we get an algebraic complete interval system in a easy way because what we do. Easy way, because what we do is that you have the body space of frame bundles has a possible map in the border space of fixed bundles, but twisted by KD. But then you just forget the frame, the forgetful functor, the forgetful map is just a positive map. So then we get for free, so to speak. Our complete interval system. But if this was an alternate complete interval system with the fibers, okay, with the right dimensions and so on, what is happening here? This should be bigger. Well, the thing is that this model space in Frankie's followers was already worked out by Margman, at some point, they call it level structures, but he gave a condition for stability. He didn't talk you about the stability here. I didn't talk to you about the stability here. The stability condition of Magma was like the degree of the subander divided by the rank. The subander would be ranked plus r 1 divided by the rank of the sweep under 1 divided by the rank of the bundle. And the condition that we are using here is just forget about the frame. Just forget about the frame. Forget about the frame, and we just think that this is a bundle, I mean one of these triples is stable if this is stable. So what we are doing is just a torso. We're having an automorphism of our frames here over this. So we have a lot of functions, too many functions. The fibers have to be. So this is what in So this is what in symbetic, well, in Poisson geometry, in the real anti-biology, in the differential geometry way and physicists and so on, that does superintegral systems and partial integral systems. So when you have less functions than the usual ones, you call them partial integral systems. And that's also our case. So what happened here? What could we do? Okay, cut cut the fibers, reduce them. Reduce them, go on a diet, and through the spectral correspondence, what you do is that you find that you can find what which in this torso what are the diagonals and then say, okay, just get to the diagon diagonals and the diagonalized we call them the diagonalized it's it's kind of a face form for me. It's kind of a pastoral for me. These ones are the ones that are giving our Anti-Ri-computing the whole system. Also, another thing that you can do is, what can I do? Complete the system. And then what I do is just to the other option that you can have is just That you can have is just add functions which will be adding the casimirs that you need to make it to make this an algebraic function. Okay, so this has been recently used by E and B. I don't know if there are your students. This is a paper by Pube called Lee Andy. Well, what they do is, they say Donraghi and Panter, you say? Tony, I don't know. They find that some heating systems are calabital systems, and then what they do is they consider this the synthetization of the heating system, and then they find that this They are normal ones. Because here I'm assuming that there is a normal. That's very interesting. Okay. There is much more work done already in that direction because if you think on the principal bundle, okay, I understand how many people threw I understand now many people write the name yellow. I was thinking, oh, the white chop looks like yellow, but no, it's not yellow. If we look at the version, um the definition of these guys um you say y the You have a PC by debugger, you will have a frame, you will put it here. In principle, it should be here. You need to put the device on for putting frames. But what is a fiber here? Um a frame. Um Afraid of the majority of map reduction, and you take a shoe group of your structure group of your bundle. So, what you really do is you take the Higgs field, okay, here, but you ask on the division, you ask the kitchen to belong to the regulator space of the Space of the adjoining bundle of your reduction of the structure loop. What happened there? That what you were doing there, so before we were doing here, where the frame was like not involved. The frame was not involved in the stability condition whatsoever because the Higgs field, we didn't see anything in the Higgs field about the frame. It was not respected to the frame, it was just there, the frame. In this case, the frame is just given your condition of the Higgs field. And now, in this case, it's a much more general case, you really understand what is going on with the frames, with our definition for the standardity of the frames. Actually, then here it's more important. So the So, again, the theorem here is that it has a natural synthetic structure. And in the very same way as before, just put the j's here, you will have the same kind of situation. You have too many, too, too, too big fibers, then you have to chunk, I mean to cut the fibers to realize the film or to fill out with more functions. That's it. So it's very easy. This one, doing the change. But, well, now that we went through so much trouble, what is the future? What are we working now? We met Silar and Silar is the regular Hisundos guy. And then he said, what happened if you think on instead of having the beams? So the leaves affected the task. I cannot give now the full things, but till now what we can say is that we have to first deal with the parabolic examples. Let me write it here, like I write for L here. My L is this one. This was one. This Poisson. So we already proved that this is a quoissant. We already compute the symplectic glyphs. And I have to apologize to my co-authors because it's my fault that we didn't finish yet. But it will be easy. And very much interested because there will be some better resolutions. synthetic resolutions that it was in in this in this case. I'm sorry, not a non-strongly parallel case, but I yeah, it's okay because it's I'm just calling it that. That's it. We have hitting equations for this kind of situation? What would we do? Well, you have the hitching equations everywhere, but what you have over the points, just over the points, you will have some kind of equations there. But I would like to p one question that I have can I ask myself a question for you? Some questions for you guys, especially for you. I mean, I have a question: that if you got the equations out of the body space of fixed boundaries for Kd, twisted by Kd with a parabolic structure, this was these equations. Can you do this relation with other equations from physics, from mechanical physics? Physics, I mean, from these mechanical systems, can you find others? And then here you have a very funny. I mean, notice that the hitching base was almost all the time more or less the same, because you always have this naughty k d, k d bar, I mean all the whatever. So you will have some kind of relations to this. Relations through this interval systems, would it give any relations for the equations, Kp equations, regardless, all these systems? Would it be at some kind of hierarchy? I don't know what you mean by hierarchy when you see hierarchy, but what will be the relation? That will be my question. And then this is what I'm meaning. And all the relations are not much functional. Say a few words about what you mean by diagonalized training piece. It's a bit technical because what you do is you take the line bundles over the simple the relative you think on the on the spectral curves. On the spectral curves as a family, take the relative Jacobian to understand precisely line boundaries over these spectral curves and then go through the, and then think like they are giving you special one-dimensional superspaces for the corresponding for the spectral the correspondence for the corresponding bundle. And then that will give you a give you a base and that will give you the dialogue. I will give you the dial in the base. It's kind of forcing a frame in a way. Just for the frame, you make no compatibility. And here you make some compatibility. No, you take it's kind of an auxiliary kind of frame. I mean, you're just choosing a a frame on on on on the spectral correspondence. You're kind of Correspondence. You're kind of throwing a frame through the spectra correspondence doesn't have anything to do with the. Well, it does. I mean, it's not. I don't like to call it a frame. It's much better to push a base to the spectral context products and then you have a dion. That will be a diamond on every point of something. Can I ask her a question in a different way? Like, how did you construct these moduli spaces of frame-fixed bundles or this stuff? Because typically what you do is you consider a moment map and you take the moment map are fixing equations and you are considering symptomatic quotient for this moment map. What did you do in this case? I can't wait. Literally. Literally. I mean, kind of, it's more or less a frame and that's already constructed by Sachman. And they're kind of analogous, analogously, it works. Bit of angry, I mean, we didn't write it down precisely, but I mean, kind of it's like it it it goes the same way as well. And actually when in the model displays of of of the construction Of the construction, simple construction doesn't use a framing at some point. Actually, construction frame boundary spaces, and then you can just start from there. In the meantime, we are lazy. But they exist. But you got to ask a question. Questions? Well, I'll ask his question in a different term. Because I assumed you were constructing this from a local map, sorry. I think you were doing an alphabetic construction from this. How could you? Well, I don't remember the details now, but for instance, for the frame the frame parabolic that the we we gave I mean, Johanna and I in the paper we gave an appendix kind of hand waving a construction. Kind of hand-waving a construction. But on the gauge theory side or on the side of the side of the market, that's what I thought. Yeah, yeah. So they're not allowed to maps. Even though, I mean, I don't, I think that Konal kind of construction will work. Very general. More questions? Okay, let us uh think my alignment. Let's take five minutes. I was talking to stuff like in relation to customers, but people talk about like another media. So that's my answer.  Part of the character for parabolic character for parabolic buttons. So distribution some parts or some prescribing that the groups are on these products. But for me, it's not one of the first class feelings. Some of you are very important to very much. It's not clear whether you actually speaking maps because it's not something very algebraic. Only the maps can fit, but the maps is not already bright. Then we have a signature spread. So this is continuous path, but it's not actually digital vibrations are currently. I think it's happened. It's not very clear what's happening. And that could be kind of the to say, Okay, I'm seeing the the hitching map here, I'm trying to mimic this fitting map is hard and that will is the for the mapping of the red. So then having a point. Yeah, I would I'm going to announce my first question. I won't let them. Oh, yeah, but you can do that. I think that's like interpretation. So
