This is a joint work with Wenzhao Chen when I actually get to my work. But first, I want to just give some background about this stuff and some motivation, which it's taken me far too long to learn. So maybe it'll be faster for you. So the first thing I want to talk about is involutions on S4, and there's a lot of things you could mean by that. So I should give you a definition. So for now, let me just say continuous map from F score to itself with, I guess, we want F squared to be the identity. And for me, in this talk, I'm just going to insist that it's actually an involution and not the identity. Okay, so for me, this is a topological involution. Okay, but this is kind of a bad definition because there's a lot of these things and they can behave badly in the sense that the fixed set of this involution might not be a submanifold. Might not be a sub-manifold, and I want to work in the category of manifolds. So, I should put some extra structure on this thing so I don't have to worry about that. Before I do that, I want to give some notation the fixed set F. I'm going to write this as capital F for fixed set, and then I'm going to say F, and you'll know which one I mean, hopefully. Okay. Okay, so the first thing I want to say is: if f preserves distance. Okay, then I'll call it an isometric involution. Okay, and that's great. This will solve all of my problems. These will be as nice as I could possibly. Problems, these will be as nice as I could possibly want, which I'll get to in a second. If f is differentiable, then I'll say f is smooth. Okay, and then the third thing I want to say is if f is locally linear, sorry, I want to define locally linear. So there, I'm going to save the answer in a second. So hold on, yeah. So, hold on. Yeah. That's a good question. So I'll write some terrible notation here. So for all points in the fixed set, if I have the property that there is a neighborhood of x, which is this is my homeomorphic symbol. Okay, and Um okay, and f restricted to n is linear. Okay, so what is this saying? Every fixed point of my involution has a neighborhood that comes with a homeomorphism to R4, and F restricted to that R4 is linear. Then I mean there is homomorphism with R4 might be bizarre, but but then we want it linear. That's right. Linear, that's right. So, this sorry, this can be any homeomorphism to R4, but it has to be linear after I do that. What does linearity mean that the targets shape? So, once I'm on R4, I guess I know what linear means, an element of O5. Sorry, so for every fixed point of my involution, I'm asking that. Yes, yeah. Yes, I um you could write this definition in a way where you took any point x in the sphere, but if it's not at a fixed point, then it has a neighborhood that just gets exchanged with another neighborhood. So that's sort of trivially going to be a linear map. So it's only interesting at the fixed at the fixed points. Oh, thank you. The question was about this definition. Okay, so I just want to briefly mention that these different categories that we can think about involutions in correspond to different structures that you want to think about on the sphere. So this is, you know, a topological involution is just thinking of S4 as a topological space. You're not asking for anything except continuity. Isometric, you think about S4 as a metric space, of course, you want to preserve the metric. metric space, of course, you want it to preserve the metric. You know, a smooth involution, you're thinking about it as a smooth manifold. And the only one that's a bit weird is this locally linear involution is when I want to think about S4 as a manifold. Okay, in other words, I want to work in the category of manifolds. And this is the condition that guarantees that my fixed set is a manifold. So I can sort of keep working in that category. And this is, I think, the right notion for thinking about topological indulgence, not this one. Not this one. Okay. So I'm gonna start by telling you a theorem, which I'll attribute to Smith, although I don't think Smith would have written it in this way. So the theorem is that the sum of the dimensions of the homology of the fixed set. Fix that with mod two coefficients is less than or equal to the sum of the dimensions of the homology of S4 with Zeeman 2 coefficients. And there's nothing special about S4 in this theorem. This is like for any manifold with an involution, you'll get this theorem. But in this case, what it tells us is that. What it tells us is that, well, the sphere doesn't have very much homology, so the fixed set can't have very much homology. In particular, if you add a little bit of extra information from a fixed point theorem, this is going to tell us that the fixed set has to have the homology of a sphere. And if I'm in any of these three ninth categories of isometric, smooth, or locally linear, then the fixed set is actually a manifold. Okay. So the conclusion is. Is let me number these so I don't have to write them again. So, in one, two, and three, f is, well, what could it be? It could be empty. It could be an S0, an S1, an S2, or it could be have the homology of an S3. So, I want to write S3 there, but of course, once you get to three dimensions, we have. Course, once you get to three dimensions, we have other spaces with homology of S3. So here I have to write something like integer homology S3. Okay. And now I think I'm at a point where I can draw you a table that's been living rent-free in my brain over here. Yeah. No, no, that's a good question. No, no, that's a good question. F, the question is if F has to be orientation preserving, and I specifically want to consider not necessarily orientation preserving. I guess that will be determined by this classification here. So these ones will be orientation reversing and these ones will be orientation preserving. I think it's easier to see on the blackboards. I'm going to just erase this one. Oh, great, yes, thank you. I yeah, I agree. That's not the question was, why not do two homology sphere? And I think that's right. It can actually be an interesting homology sphere. I don't know about the difference between Z. I don't know about the difference between Z and Z Mart 2 homologies, Spears. I think that you can look that up, but I haven't. Okay, so let me flip to the right page here. I want to draw a table. So this is my table of everything that's known about involutions on S4. So I'm going to label the columns by the possible fixed sets, so they can be empty. Fixed sets so they can be empty, S0, S1, S2, or let me just write homology S3. And I can think about this in some different categories. Isometry, isometric, smooth, or locally linear. And again, you should think locally linear is like the topological manifold category. Okay, so for isometries, well, isometries on the sphere, of course, classically, those are just given by the elements of the orthogonal group. So we're looking in O5. And I haven't told you yet what we should consider these things up to. Of course, there are infinitely many involutions in the isometry group. But I think the right thing to, equivalence to think about, is up to conjugate. To equivalence to think about is up to conjugation. How many conjugacy classes of involutions are there? And a little bit of linear algebra will tell you that there's exactly one. And these are given by sort of five by five matrices. And they're all conjugate to something with just plus or minus one on the diagonal entries. And furthermore, some of these are conjugate where you sort of move the minus ones around. Okay, so you're just counting how many minus ones you have. So, you're just counting how many minus ones you have on the in your matrix. Okay. So, what about all these other cases? Well, the first thing I want to notice is that this table comes with vertical maps going down. Because if you have an isometry, you can forget about the metric and you still have a smooth manifold. And if you have a smooth involution, you can forget about the smooth structure. You can forget about the smooth structure and you still have a locally linear involution. That's not maybe not a completely trivial theorem, but I guess it's classical that a smooth involution is locally linear. So we know that there's at least one thing sort of in every box here. But the question is, up to conjugation in the appropriate category, so in this case, up to conjugation in the diffeomorphism group, or in this case, up to conjugation in the homeomorphism group, how many things go in here? How many things go in here? So I'll write what's known, which is that we can put some things in here. And of course, infinity is like the cheapest pop-out answer because there's really interesting structure there. So I'll tell you a little bit about that. And then these ones we don't, I think we don't know anything about. So let me give you citations and at least say verbally what's going on. At least say verbally what's going on in each of these squares where I've put something. It's a two, yeah. It's a two, yeah. Maybe that's better. Okay, so let me start over here. So this two, well, what's a locally linear involution on S4 going to give you if it has an empty fix set? That's a free involution. So the quotient is going to be. So, the quotient is going to be a homotopy RP4. And if we're asking this to be distinct in sort of the category of topological manifolds from the regular involution that gives regular RP4, then we're asking for a homotopy RP4 that's not homeomorphic to RP4. So, this is a fake RP4 or equivalent to a fake RP4, and that was found by these guys. And Tuesday one is what I have written down. And this is classified by the Kirby-Sevenman invariant. And we know that there's, I guess, by work of a lot of people, maybe Friedman, that there's exactly two of these. And okay, so that's that box. Let's go over to this box. This is maybe a box people are interested in. So, fixed involution on the four-sphere with a fixed homology three-sphere. Well, if you sort of forget about one half of this, because this will be separating, then this is, you know. Can I interject? Yeah. I don't think that's that's quite that's quite right. Um, great. Thank you. Yeah, so first off, in the smooth category, this there's the there's Capella Shanison and Finta Schultz Stern from. Finished Stern from the I mean the Fintitchel-Stern is correct about something locally linear. So the topological case, it's sort of due to Friedman, but it also, I guess I gave an early construction of the maybe the non-smoothable RP4. Okay, great. I'm really glad you mentioned that. Mentioned that, yeah. Uh, I'm absolutely talking about it. But if you move, if you move Finish Al Stern up one box, uh, you could write them in with Capella and Shannon also from 78 or something. But as you say, it's still unknown, but there's at least two. Great. Okay, yes, thank you. Um, I'm actually kind of hoping that I would say something and someone would correct me here. Um Me here. I ultimately want to talk about just this one box. So yeah, please tell me if anything else is wrong. I think we can never completely answer this smooth category question until we, well, okay, we don't understand smooth things, but I guess some more stuff is known there. Okay, let me say something about these boxes as well. So I guess in this case, In this case, I want to say MAZER gave us smooth contractible four-manifolds with boundary integer homology spheres. So doubling those gives us a smooth involution on the four-sphere with this fixed set. And of course, these can't be the isometry because the isometry has fixed set regular S3, and these have fixed set some other homology sphere. Okay, I guess we can just map these down here to get some things here. Map these down here to get some things here. These are distinguished just by the topological type of their fixed set, so they're still not going to be equivalent in this box. But I think more than that, Friedman, or I guess I have a strong citation here, told us that there are every rational homology three-sphere bounds a contractible four-manifold in the topological category. So those will all give us locally linear involutions in this box. I think. I think this is what I have written down, but again, I don't really know the history of this. I think probably Friedman deserves the citation for a lot of this stuff. Okay, great. In this box, the sort of ran out of space here, so let me put a star, which I'll write over here. Yeah, I think every rational homology three-sphere bounds a contractible four-manifold. Yes, thank you. Sorry. If it's an integer homology three-sphere, yeah, which is in particular a Z mod two homology three-sphere. Okay, so this star, I want to give a Star, I want to give a so in constructed involutions, smooth involutions with knotted S2 as a fixed set. And these are slightly different, independent works that sort of did the same thing, building on work of Giffen, who did it in the odd order case. So the involutions was a little bit later. And so that's just infinitely many examples again of, well, smooth involutions, they're distinguished topologically by They're distinguished topologically by their fixed at having a different not type. Just check that by looking at the fundamental group of the complement. And so, in particular, when we map them down here, they'll still be non-trivial in the topological category. Great. Okay. Accepting my misunderstanding of these boxes, I think that that's sort of everything that's known about these involutions. I should say maybe a couple of words about what we know about this map here. Let me call this P3. I don't know what to call it. So Phi3 is not subjective, which you can tell by looking at Um uh the Rockland invariant. Sorry again, I'm not exactly sure the history here. Um, I think this follows relatively easier from the Rockman invariant, although I don't think Rockman wrote it down. But there are integer homology three series which bound a contractible four-manifold topologically, but it's not smooth. Okay, and they, in fact, can't bound any smooth contractible manifold. In fact, can't bound any smooth contractable manifold distinguished by the Rockman invariant. It's also not injective, which I think follows from relatively recent work of Akbalid and Ruberman, where they find Where they find an integer homology, three spheres which bound two distinct smooth contractible four manifolds. Great. I think probably stuff is known about this map too, but I want to say it now since I am confused. Okay, great. So, this is all sort of my setup and motivation for wanting to talk about. For wanting to talk about maybe these four boxes in the middle here. And I want to discuss a strategy for constructing things that should go in here and maybe answering some questions then about the difference between the smooth and topological category, or at least maybe filling in these question marks and whether there's more than one involution. Great. Other questions, comments, accusations? So here's the idea. Here's the idea: instead of thinking about S4, let's think about the four-ball, because then we can have a boundary S3 and we can start thinking about knots. We want to do what I want to do. So I want to find involutions on B4. And okay, if I have an involution on B4, then it induces an involution on the boundary S3. On the boundary S3. Okay, I guess I should tell you a theorem. So on S3, isometric is the same. This equals is maybe not justified to call equals, but the same in some sense as smooth as locally linear. Locally, we need. Which means that, well, we have only one in each of the sort of possible fixed point sets. And so we can take some weird involution on B4. We have this standard involution on the boundary S3, and we just glue in the isometry on another B4, and we'll get back an involution on S4. Okay, involution whatever. The involution, okay. We can hopefully use this to build new involutions in S4. So, how are we going to do this? Well, I want to use not theory. So, what I want to do is I want to find a symmetric knot in S3. And I want to prove that it founds. And I want to prove that it bounds a slice disk in some category with respect to some involution. And then I want an obstruction that tells me that it doesn't bound a slice disk with respect to the isomic, the isometric involution. Okay, how would I guess I'll write that in slightly fancier words? I want to find one which is equivariantly. Slice with respect to some involution, but not maybe in this talk I'll call it isometrically equivariantly slice. And I think, well, this is about quantum invariance. So I guess I'll leave it to you guys to maybe imagine. It to you guys to maybe imagine how you might use something like Cavano homology to find an obstruction to being isometrically equivariantly slice. And the rest of my talk will be focused on trying to construct examples of knots which are equivariantly sliced with respect to some involution that's at least not obviously isometric. So, if you remember which category I was thinking about or which box I wanted to talk about, it was the fixed set on S4 was supposed to be an S1, which means on B4 the fixed set will be an arc, and on S3, the fixed set will be two points. So, one interesting case. One interesting case as fixed that S0 in S3 and I guess the interval in B4. Okay, so I guess I should start by maybe drawing you a knot that's invariant under. Drawing you a knot that's invariant under that type of symmetry, so you know what I'm talking about. Okay, so here's the figure eight knot, and I've drawn it so that it goes through the point at infinity. And I'm going to think of my involution as having fixed points at the origin and at infinity. So you can think about this as point reflection on this R3 that's projecting this chalkboard. That's projecting this chalkboard. Or maybe a little easier way to think about it is as rotation around this point and then reflection across the plane of the chalkboard here, which has the effect of changing all the crossings. So this looks rotationally symmetric, except all the crossings are backwards. Okay, and you can check that exactly zero and infinity are fixed under that institution. I think in the literature, this is usually called Usually called a strongly negative amphichiral knot. The strong here refers to the fact that the fixed point is on the knot. You could also have strong, or sorry, the strong refers to that as an involution. The negative refers to the fact that there's a fixed point on the knot. You could also have a strongly positive epichiral knot where the Have a strongly positive amphichiral knot where the knot doesn't go through the text point. But okay, I'll focus on these today. So the goal then is to construct equivariantly slice max. This is my abbreviation for. This is my abbreviation for strongly negative amplifier knot. And hopefully, these will be with involutions that are weird. And I guess for the rest of the talk, I'm going to be in the sort of topological category. So I'll just think about locally linear involutions. So with respect to weird, locally linear. What going on here? Involutions, and the colours are a little bit more difficult. Okay, so I guess I'll tell you a theorem and then discuss. So given a strongly negative amphibirl not k, yeah. Yeah, so the question is, what do I mean by equivalently sliced? Can I tell you a slice not that's not equivalently sliced? The answer is yes. Did I have one prepared? I think, let me think about the strongly negative Anfarl motto. Let me think about the strongly negative Vanfa-Carl mass. I think 61 is slice, but I think it's not equivariantly slice with respect to the strongly negative Vanfor-Karl symmetry, which means there's no possible extension of the symmetry from S3 to B4 such that there's a slice disk which is invariant under that symmetry. Yes. So we fixed. That's strange. That's right. So we fixed the involution on S3, but we can't extend it to any slice disk on B4. Okay, so what's this theorem if the Alexander polynomial is trivial? Well, okay, of course, we know if the Alexander polynomial is trivial, then it's slice. This theorem says if the Alexander polynomial is trivial, then it's equivariantly slice. Okay, and I should specify when I say equivalently slice which category I'm thinking about. In this case, I'm thinking about the locally linear involution category. Maybe I should call that topologically equivariantly slice. I'll just say with respect to locally linear involution. Okay, and the way we construct Okay, and the way we construct, I'll give a few details, time permitting, but the way we construct these, we don't really expect that these involutions are smooth even or anything nicer than what it said. The fixed arc of that involution fits on the disk, on the slice disk. That's right, exactly. So the question was if the fixed arc of the involution fits on the slice disk, and yes, it does, because we're in the Because we're in the negative case, the fixed points are on the knot, so the arc has to be on the disk. Okay. I don't know if you can see this, but over here I've drawn an example. So the first objection you might have to that theorem is: I don't know any Alexander polynomial one strong. Any Alexander polynomial one strongly negative amphichiral knots. So is this theorem even saying anything? And the answer is yes. Here's a knot, which I will describe how it's a knot to you. So again, this is a picture of S3. So here's a fixed point and the other fixed points at infinity. Here I've drawn a three component link. And I'm supposed to think about these other two components as surgery curves. So I'm going to do plus one surgery on this yellow curve and minus one surgery on this yellow. Surgery on this yellow curve and minus one surgery on this red curve. And you can see that that respects the symmetry because the yellow and red curves get exchanged. And because orientation reversing, the plus one surgery will become minus one surgery on the other side. Additionally, you should notice that if you forget about the white knot that I've drawn, then this is just a two-component unlink, like a split, like a trivial unlink. So this plus one surging, minus one surgery is going to give me back S3. So this is really a picture of a strongly negative. A picture of a strongly negative amphibial knot in S3. I didn't draw the knot diagram for you because, well, this diagram already has 20 some crossings, the knot diagram has like 50 crossings. I don't know the crossing number of the knot diagram. But okay, you can check using this surgery presentation that the Alexander polynomial has tried. I also don't know if that knot is smoothly sliced. Yeah. How generalizable is this picture? You just sort of like do as many of these twists as you want in the middle. Yeah, so I think you can add twists. Yeah, adding more twists in the middle will give you more an infinite family of examples. I think there's other easy ways to generate more infinite families. Do I know that the knot is non-trivial was the question. And the answer is yes. Trivial with the question? And the answer is yes. We computed its Hagard floor homology with the computer. So it was non-trivial. I think it's genus 3 or something. The clasps are here, so that is not the unknown. If these red and yellow curves could kind of come apart, then you would just get a trivial unknown. Trivial. I'm not. And then, of course, we have to otherwise be very careful to construct this so that we get back S3 with this entry. Okay, great. So let me ask a couple of open questions about this. So I just answered that yes, this is not a completely trivial theorem. So here's an open question. Open question are all snacks with Alexander polynomial one smoothly sliced. Probably you can answer this question if you get a big enough computer. The problem is. The problem is just that the examples are kind of big. So a lot of our slice obstructions aren't that computable for somebody who doesn't have the computer knowledge that somebody who has the computer knowledge that I've used in the lab. Right. So the question is what kind of obstruction could even work? And I definitely thought about this question and had an answer. Definitely thought about this question and had an answer, but now I forget. That's a great question. I think if you ask me that again in an hour, I can probably answer it for you. Okay, great. You might also ask if every strongly negative amper-chi-lot with Alexander polynomial one is smoothly equivariantly slice. I can tell you the answer to that is no. I can tell you the answer to that is no, because you can take your favorite knot K, which is slice but not smoothly slice, and take its connect sum with its reverse mirror. And that will be a strongly negative amphiciral knot, which is equivariantly topologically sliced, but not equivariantly smoothly sliced. Okay, great. So what's the idea of the proof? Of the proof. The idea of the proof here is: well, we want some idea of, let me tell you what it is. So there is an equivariant version of the Alexander polynomial. Four strongly negative amphibiomax. This is really defined by Hartley and Kuwuchi. Maybe I'll give the theorem. Maybe I'll give the theorem. So for KSNAC, the Alexander polynomial, well, not quite the Alexander polynomial, but the Alexander polynomial when I plug in t squared factors as I guess I'll just write I guess I'll just write. I already used square f again. Okay. For some polynomial f and it has a nice property that f of p inverse is f of minus p. This is supposed to be the amphichiral version of the symmetry in the regular Alexander polynomial, except Alexander polynomial, except when you reflect, you did sort of it in an orientation preserving instead of reversing way, so you get an extra minus five. So this F is like meant to be the equivariant version of the Alexander. So idea is reproduce. Is reproduce the proof that the Alexander polynomial being trivial implies topologically slice while using f of t instead of the Alexander polynomial. Instead of the Alexander Polly. Okay, in some senses, this makes sense. I didn't tell you this, but f of t really is like an Alexander polynomial of the quotient of the strongly negative amphichiral knot, or rather the strongly negative amphibl naught exterior. There's fixed points on the knot. So we just take the quotient of the whole thing. We won't even get a manifold. But if I take the knot Get a manifold, but if I take the not exterior and take the quotient, then I get some non-orientable three-manifold. So I can, well, Kawuchi has a whole theory of Alexander polynomials for non-orientable homology circles. So you can sort of apply that idea. But there's an easier way to think about that, which is also sort of work of, well, okay, there's an easier way to think about that that we can think of. So we can think of f of t as I'm going to say some words and then I'll write something. So if you think about the strongly negative ambient evolution on S3, you can actually lift that to the infinite cyclic cover of the knot. And how it lifts is as a square root of the deck transformation action. So t in the Alexander Polynesian. So t in the Alexander polynomial, I'm supposed to think of this t as the deck transformation action on the infinite cyclic cover. And now I have this square root of that. So what I can do is just look in the infinite cyclic cover, forget about t being the deck transformation action. Now tau, that's the deck transformation action of the quotient. Turns out they have the same infinite cyclic cover. And now you just think of just exactly the same Alexander polynomial construction, but using tau instead of t. But using tau instead of t, and that gives me this polynomial f of t. So this is like Alexander polynomial sort of with respect to, I'll write square root of t here. And the point is, square root of t exists and makes sense in the strongly negative amplifier case. Maybe I should write like root t here. Here. Okay, I wrote it squared here instead of t here and root t here, which is maybe confusing because I wanted to think of t as the deck transformation action, but same idea. Okay. Great. Maybe I'll just briefly mention this is not like entirely routine reproducing this proof, because in this case, you're dealing with orientation. Dealing with orientation or non-orientable manifold. So, for example, in this proof, you work with spin cobordism. Now we have to work with pin minus cobordism. So it's the same idea, but there's like some annoying extra details. Okay now. Okay, now I was going to talk more about that proof, but I think the sort of integrity of skein relations was recently called into question. So, what I'm going to do instead is tell you about a skein relation and a topological application of the skein relation. Okay, so our theorem is basically. The polynomial f of t, which is to say that factor in the Hartley-Kuwitz theorem, satisfies an equivariant stain relation. Let me just draw it quickly for you. Let me just draw it quickly for you because it's annoying to explain. I guess I need a third one. Okay, so here's three diagrams. This is the figure eight not and those are the unknown. Not and those two are the unknown. And you might notice that they differ sort of at a pair of crossings, which are exchanged by the involution. So this is somehow like an equivariant resolution. But you might also notice that if you just look at the signs of these crossings, I'll write zeros here. We don't know how to write down the stain relation because. Down the steen relation because, well, this is a minus and a plus, this is a plus and a minus. Which one's supposed to be plus, and which one's supposed to be minus? It's not totally clear. And even worse than that, you can't just do this mod two, because if you do this mod two, you get back the regular Alexander polynomial mod two. So you didn't get anything. In fact, you can check from this theorem pretty easily that this implies that these two polynomials are equivalent mod two. To. Okay, so the idea here is that we actually need a little bit of extra information, which is a choice of fixed point and an orientation on the knot. For me, I like to draw my diagram so that my choice of fixed point is at infinity, and my chosen orientation always comes into my diagram from the left. That way, I don't actually have to indicate it on the diagram. I can just draw the diagram. And once I have that, well, now I have a point to start at in an orientation. Now I have a point to start at and an orientation, so I get an order on the crossings just by going along them. And well, now I can say, okay, here I see a minus crossing first, here I see a plus crossing first. So I can distinguish maybe between these two and assign a sign to this pair of crossings. So I'll write that. So the sine of p1 and p2, this is just the sine of Just the sine of d1. And it turns out for, I guess, slightly technical reasons, it turns out to be nicer to take the second crossing to be the one that you use to determine the sign. So in this picture, my plus crossing is second. I saw this minus one first before this plus one. And here, my minus crossing is second. So I'm going to use this as the plus diagram. This is the minus diagram, and this is the zero diagram. Diagram, and this is the zero diagram. So this will be k plus k minus k zero. And now we just get to write down the regular outgender polynomial stimulation. So what's the what's the relation? So, what's the relation? I'm going to write now. Well, let's write F plus. Okay, so these are the sort of quotients of the L or the factors of the Alexander polynomials for these three knots. And it satisfies, there should be a Z here, sorry. Now I wrote F here, so I don't want to write Z. F here, so I don't want to write z, I want to write t minus t inverse. All right, that's really small. Okay, of course, secretly, this is also implying a normalization of this thing. So there's a normalized Alexander polynomial quotient. Okay, which we called the half-Conway polynomial. Okay, and that's what's really satisfying this simulation. Okay, I'm almost out of time, I think. So let me end by giving a corollary of this. Corollary of this, like a topological reason you should care, which is that the z coefficient of the last conway polynomial is a lower bound on the equivalent. On the Aqua Verna nodding number. Okay, that is the equivariant unknown number is the number of sort of pairs of crossing changes you have to do to get the unknot. Easy theorem: the equivariant unknown number is finite. This should remind you of. This should remind you of, well, the Z coefficient of the regular Conway polynomial is the linking number. We call this the half-linking number, but it turns out it's not zero for strongly negative and for Kirl Knotts. And so it acts sort of like the linking number in the sense that it's a sort of unknotting number bound. As far as I'm aware, this is the only equivariant unknotting number bound in the literature. Yeah, so no, for not for not here. Ah, so this is the half-Conway polynomial. No, no, but you said it should remind us of ordinary knots. Yes, so this is one difference, I guess. For regular knots, the Conway polynomial has Z coefficient zero. For strongly negative amphi-carl knots, this equivariant version of the Conway polynomial can have Z coefficient non-zero. But it is similar. But it is similar to the linking number in the sense that it's a lower bound of the unknotting number, which we can check because of the stain relation. And I don't know of any other way to check that besides this gain relation. Other questions? There ought to be a theory of the D coefficient alone, which doesn't require all of the rest of the former equations. Yeah, we have that too. Yeah, um, so the d coefficient you can also recover from these by adding up the signs of equivalent pairs of crossings almost yeah, it's like some self-linking number. Easier self-link, I don't know. No, go ahead. No, maybe I'll wait for it. Okay. I guess I'm done. Yeah. I guess I'm done. Yeah. So is there a finite time theory of maps? That, yes, is I think yeah. I think not yet. Okay. Because this suggests that there is, right? I totally agree. Yeah. Hi, so what is the Z coefficient of this guy? Of this guy, yeah. You don't know the unknown numbers. I'm just curious how huge maybe it could be. Well, that one has outstanding polymer one, so its equivalent is. So its e coefficient is zero. Oh, oh, right. One. Yes. There's another theorem we okay. This is a good opportunity to tell you another theorem we proved, which is that every possible half-crown wave polynomial is realized. So did you prove that that one is not isometrically sized? No. No, that's a great question. That's something that someone should prove. Okay, we go. Other questions? Can you just say again how that, how you decide which one of people? How you decide which one is k plus and k minus? I don't catch what c one means. Yeah, so uh, first of all, I'm gonna choose a base point orientation on the knot. Yep, that gives me an ordering on my crossings by starting at the chosen base point, following along the orientation. And I'm just, you know, I'm gonna add to my order the crossing every time I see it. Now, I see crossings twice. I really sort of have to go check through all of them. But eventually I'll see every crossing, so it gives me that order. And now, if I have a pair of crossings, I choose the second one in my order. Second one in my order, and I look at the sign of that second crossing. I mean that's the sign of my pair. Now that I'm talking, I sort of realize that I've lied through a little bit here. This skein relation doesn't work for every pair of crossings. In fact, it only works for pairs of crossings between different arcs. So these two fixed points separate it into a pair of arcs. You might have a crossing of an arc with itself. You can't do this gamulation on those buttons. You only get to do this gamulation. You only get to do this emulation on crossings between the two different. But that's still enough to compute all of these. And is there another scale relation for the self-park? Not that I know of. We tried a bit to get that. There should be some correction. We sort of decided to give up rather than pursue that. I think that there is, and there is a correction term for it, but the correction term is like so annoying to write that. Maybe it's not worth it. So, my understanding was that you chose the pair of postings, such that they were assigned to one another. Yeah, that's your issue. Yeah, so. Um, yeah, so these need to be um equivariant crossing pairs, so a pair that are exchanged. And then you were you start talking about like the arcs and other conditions that have that computer, but you basically choose the hashtags that are signed to each other as the unification of the condition. That's right. Yeah, let me just quickly illustrate that. So you might have, for example, this diagram, which is strongly negative amplifier, unnaught. These paraphrases. Negative amp for carol unnaught. These pair of proxies are between the arc and itself. And the problem we have with these is if you want to do a scan relation on these, now you need to think about links. And links are annoying in this case because you can't choose a base point in orientation and get an order on the crossings. So this sort of these crossings are nice because they still give you a knock when you resolve. I'll ask one more annoying question, which is I'll ask one more annoying question, which is: do you have any thought about how do you categorify this Alexander polynomial? I guess I'll say that the work in progress to categorify this than not polemology. I believe there is a candidate for what the categorization should be. And in order to do that, somehow we need to check the signs, which involves understanding this sign definition in the categorified setting, which we don't know how to do, or I don't know. Which we don't know how to do, or I don't know how to do any other questions. Okay, thanks for the speaker again.
