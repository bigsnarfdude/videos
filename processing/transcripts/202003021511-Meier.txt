Thank you very much for the opportunity to talk here. So, before I start giving the talk, I want to say this is joint work with Marcus Lant and Bj√∂rk Tammel, but I also want to stress that we benefited a lot from discussions with Akir Matthew and Dustin Clausen. Okay, so what is what I want to talk about? So, let's first start with something non-chromatic. So, a nice feature and important feature. So, a nice feature important feature of some hormonal theories computer rings is that they can. is that the time characteristic p things to come to a surface. So what do I mean by cohomology theories? So one thing would be like a very classical choice would be like guitar cohomology. would be like a target homology. We say the L coefficients, this was developed around 1960 to solve the weight conjectures. And there are some other kind of crystalline cohomology or some other things which I don't know much about. And then there are also like K-theory to T C and T P. So a little bit more topological guys. So during the talk I would say During the talk, I would say nothing about these things, so you can forget that I ever said something about it. So, and I will concentrate on these things, especially like, as you can see from the title, on YK. So, let's be a little bit more concrete. What do I mean by characteristic P to characteristic 0? So, let's take our favorite ring, namely R equals F P. So, we can actually calculate something. We can actually calculate something about this. So if you can say calculate TP about this, and let's just, for simplicity, just take phi zero. I mean, we know the whole thing, but so this is Vp. And luckily, the same is true for phi zero of Tc. So we have Fp. And the same is true for the K-theory of T. For the K-theory of Fp, if we p comp. So, of course, you cannot just say that pi zero of the K-theory spectrum of Fp is the same as K0 of Fp, which is the integers, as is true for every field, because we know very much about projective modules of finite generation of our field, namely they are just free. So, it's just this statement. Okay. So, do you see what I mean? Okay. So do you see what I mean? What I start with something in characteristic P, what I get is something which is not characteristic P, but if I rationalize it, it becomes non-trivial. And just kind of if I do the same thing with THH, this would have been not the same effect because this would be FP. And yeah, this is a very useful feature. And for example, one thing Lars has One thing Lars has done with Tp is define the Hasse Wei zeta function, which was kind of what the We conjecture was about, in terms of Tp. And in my understanding, it's very crucial to know that it's actually something characteristic zero. So in other words, so if E Excuse me, T C or T P and if we invert P in the ring that's zero, we still expect that if we invert P here, it's non-zero. P here is non-zero. Okay. So now it turns out that staying with inverting P is just the first step, or I should maybe say zero step, in a whole letter of things you can do from the perspective of chromatic homotopy theory. So working T just the zero step. And the chromatic letter, there. Thank you. So, more precisely, so I let E be a spectrum. So, okay, so I can consider E. So I can consider E, okay, what I just said, I can invert E. And just reflect shortly about what does it mean. Why should we invert P. So it seems stupid, but let me just rewrite. This is E tender the sphere spectrum, so I will use the tensor for the smash product. So if I invert something, it should be better be a non-neopotent map, else I would just produce zero. So what are the non-neopotent self-maps of the sphere? Self-maps of the sphere, self-map of the sphere, even if I have a greater sense, then non-niepotens of one is just multiplying with an integer. And certainly p is a very kind of canonical choice of integer to what the difference is p. Okay, so but I could also quote by p by saying I'm not so much interested in the things here, I just want to kind of so speak to the opposite in quotient by p. So to speak, to the opposite encoding by P, and just rewriting this in the same manner. Okay. So considering here, multiplication by P would be not very interesting anymore. So I can ask, is there maybe another self-map I can take of this guy? And the answer is yes. There's an essentially unique, up to kind of doing iterates, a unique self-map of this guy. So there's a self-map that's called B1 of a degree which I don't care. Of a degree which I don't care about, but which is positive of this thing, and this is essentially unique non-nepotent self-map, which means that every other self-map will be equivalent up to two iterates. Okay, so then I can just say. So then I can just say I can invert this guy. But maybe I'm not up for inverting, I want to kill stuff, so I can kill this thing and the same thing as a tensor. And you might have a clue what happens next by saying, oh, this Next, they're saying, oh, this guy maybe has a self-map. And luckily it does. Again, essentially unique, and I can invert it. And so on, and so on. So of course I'm sweeping like a number of big fields here under the A number of big theorems here under the rock. So, this is this kind of false story that this can be done and can be continued. So, Adam started this list of introducing this map. There's some names I maybe should name here, which I don't. And for people who really figured out the whole story, the Hopkins and Smith with the periodicity theorem, which says this can be really done for all indices here. For all indices here, repeatedly. So I guess you're writing VI for like any power in the indices. I don't claim that this map induces on Warmer KTU exactly modification. Okay. So this seems like a very natural thing to do to me. I'm not sure everybody agrees, but maybe I don't care. So let's give these things names so that yeah be n minus one be this thing. So note this is not So note this is not 100% well defined because I said these are essentially unique up to iterating and stuff like this, but they are well defined enough for all purposes that I will talk about today. Okay. So and note that T0 exactly. So uh what we can say now is like this uh perspective was like E of uh ring R. So it was R tensor T0 might vanish but uh E of R and the T0 is nothing. So we might So, we might ask what happens for the other guys, like the TI. Okay, so let's talk a little bit about the notion of height. So, this, I mean, there might be slightly different notions here, but let's just fix one. So, the height with respect to E. For spectrum E at a fixed point P is the maximum and such that T n tensor E is non-zero so So if all Tns of E are zero, say the height of E is minus one. Okay, so I should say a few things about this kind of notion of height. One is that it behaves very nicely for E infinite T wings. But before I do this, maybe I should give you a few. But before I do this, maybe I should give you a few examples. It's maybe even better before I state any general properties. So, example would be if I take, for example, the height of complex k-theory would be 1, and the height of an Einer-Plane spectrum depends. So it's minus 1 converting P is 0 and is 0. This is non-zero. It's non-zero. The height of the sphere spectrum would be infinity, and the height of more, and the n of Mohawk K-theory is n. So there are a lot of kind of examples one can play with. So let me first now say a few words about how this kind of TNs relate to the maybe slightly more familiar Morava K-theories. And if you're not familiar with Morava K-theories, you can just ignore what I say now. So with respect to this kind of homology, the UST, and I can look at localization. So, and the telescope conjecture says that Pn localization is the same as Kn localization, so it doesn't make any difference. I think there are different opinions about this whether it should be a conjecture or it should be a conjecture with unequal here. So I think there's no kind of general opinion about whether it should be true or not. But some people might disagree. But I think the disagreement would kind of speak in favor that there's no general opinion about this. Tell the question here. Why is this KN and not EN? Because for EN it would be warp. Yeah, I mean I could kind of have localization with the the direct sum of all the Ti up to n. Then it would be E n here. So this is known due to work of Miller and Maholo for n equals 1. It's also known for Mu modules. And what is also known is that The condition this is 0 or was the same as dn tensor x is 0 as equivalent to L Kn x is 0 for x to wings 1. This is kind of main things to keep in mind, but it's certainly not known in general that these things are cool. Okay. Okay, so I want to say one more thing about the notion of height, because this is asking for the maximal n, it's non-vanishing. So say it could happen, like for Kn that Tn this kind of sorry. So if we have this tensor Ti, this is non-zero. This is non-zero if n equals k. So we have exactly one thing here at height n, but nothing below and nothing above. And there might be maybe other spectra which have something here, something here, and something here, but the zeros in between, which doesn't make the nicest notion of height, because at some part it's seen as zero and then it's non-terminal again and so on. So, but we can restrict to a nicer class of spectra where this kind of Nicer class of spectra where this kind of nonsense does not happen. This is a very nice theorem due to Matthew Naumann Noel. I guess I should also name Hopkins here. In the most general form, you could tell me how that if R is an E infinity wing spectrum. then Tn tensor R0 implies Tn plus one tensor R0. So this kind of stuff cannot happen. So we just have here kind of one region where it's non-zero and then there begins a region where it's zero. Which is like in accordance with what we know from the infinity spectrum we know and like. Spectrum we know and like, so the theorem is also just mean that there are no counterexamples, which is clear because it's a theorem. I mean there might be theorem with counter-examples, but maybe I shouldn't call it theorems. Okay. So let's move back to kind of original goal, understanding the chromatic behavior of K-theory. K-theory. So I said before that it might happen that you have something which has height minus one, but has height at least zero afterwards, equal to zero. But you might say, okay, it would be even cooler if it could jump further. I mean, like you start with height minus one, and afterwards it's height 15 or something like this. And or start with height zero and you get something like height. Take your favorite number. So, but there's like a philosophy which says this does not happen, always shifts exactly by one. This is the redshift philosophy, which is in some form, I'm not sure kind of Jan would kind of exactly state it like this, but in one form would say if R is an infinity ring spectrum. And the height, the k theta of r, is its leg theta. Height of r plus 1. And I can also, if I want, I can plug in the usual ring and just take the eigenplanes. And this is kind of proven to be true in some cases. So known in some cases. So we can take R with H of P, then Quill computed that the k theorem of P, I just stated the Paisillo statement, but actually it's after P completion is just the Einberg lane spectrum, and luckily this has a height. 0, why this is height minus 1. And this is also the case of the integers. So this is height 0. And Mitchell, and maybe I should also name Thomason here, but I'm not quite sure about the exact history showed that this height is 1. Uh this minus one. They prove that it's less than or equal to one. Yeah, who proved that it's uh equal to one. Okay, uh and then there is the K. So you can take little K u or capital Ku doesn't really matter. This has high. Doesn't really matter. This has height one. So let's just prime to the bigger equal five. And then Alzonian hardness show that the height, the K the ult is 2. Yeah, so there's a lot more work I just kind of say in words. So there has been some work by Clausen, Matthew, Naumann. Clausen, Matthew, and now Manuel, who kind of, for example, show that even like at primes 2 and 3, the height is at most 2 here. And also, a lot of other cases, like they have bounds on heights of dual K view spectra. There's been also some recent work by JD and Gay, kind of have kind of four other classes of non-E-infinity ring spectra, kind of try to prove some kind of redshift phenomena. So there's a lot of work going on, which I maybe don't want to summarize. Which I maybe don't want to summarize completely yet. So, but let's just take another kind of very classical kind of way. So, what about r equals z mod e to the n? Just move a little bit further from here. So, as a little test question, what is the height of this guy? Of this guy? Minus one. Minus one. Minus one, very good. So what should be the height of the scale theory? Zero, yes, exactly. So this is exactly what Klaus and Matthew showed. I mean, they showed more, but in particular, they showed the height of the case. Of the k-theore, c mod p to the n is zero. So, i.e. another way to phrase it would be a t1 localization of the kc is zero. Or could also take k1 localization, but like that's true. And I will say in a few moments a few things about consequences of this thing. So what got the project with Marcus and Keok started was that kind of I think Akhil asked one of them whether one might be able to give a different proof of this. Be able to give a different proof of this result using methods from a paper of Georg and Marcus, and then we join Foss actually managed to give a different proof and a slight generalization of this. So to see in which generality I want to formulate this, So that R being infinite such that if inverse p it becomes zero and the height Okay, uh, it's just one like zero I And in many cases it's often I mean like in all cases of interest I guess specific case it can actually show it's zero probably usually this shouldn't be too hard to show but I don't really want to claim this in full general I don't really want to claim this in full generality. Maybe some other people know how to do this in full generality. But I think if it's con uh for example, if you start with any kind of commutative ring, then it's very easy to see that the height of the k-theory is very precisely zero because you can just map to a field where you know that k0 is closely zero. Okay. And there's actually a second part which says essentially the same thing, one step higher. One step higher. So say we have T one K of R, so T one k of R is zero. So which means that the height R is smaller or equal to zero? Yeah. Then the height. Then the height k. So you might guess that we want, would like to prove it also, not only for these kind of two first steps, but we're not able to solve it. So any questions about the statement of this theorem? Do you have any examples where the height doesn't change? No, I would I would presume that the height always changes by once. I'd always change just by once. You can have, sorry, if I mentioned correctly, like if you have a infinity ring, which is algebra, okay, so zero is going to have an example. This can happen. Yeah, so an example would be that feed h sequencing on that in K0 as a few. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so. Ah, thank you. Okay, so we know that this is not always true. Okay, so thanks. So I would like to hear more details about this after the talk. What was the example? FP tate. Take HF the tate CP of HFP. Oh, oh, the the oh, ah, ah, ah. Okay, it's always good. That's why it's good to give these talks because some people know stuff. Okay. Okay. So sorry, let me ask another question that was sort of confusing me. So is I'm just maybe I'm just totally missing something, but it might is there an example? I mean, I know you can have many non-trivial E-infinity structures on Islam-McLean spectrum. Structures on Alenberg-McLean spectr, you know, on generalized Alenberg-McLean spectrum. But is there an example of an R where we invert P where it's not at E infinity and not Heilenberg-McLean? So, like a way to Heilenberg-McLane's quite true. We certainly know that if certainly know if it's like the homotopy, we certainly know the homotopy groups are an FP algebra, then it's an I'm. FP algebra, then it's an Einberg lane spectrum. Okay, just checking to make sure. I'm not quite sure how it is when we, I guess there should be examples which are not underlying Einberg lane, which are generalized in Einberg Leplane. Oh. I mean, certainly there are, so there are a lot of examples which are not underlying Einbert plane. Namely, sorry, so we could, for example, take Okay, sorry. May I'm not sure. No, I'm not sure. We're in the same boat then. Yeah, I was wondering about a similar question for the second statement. Do you have a sample? Do you have an example that are HC algebras? Which are not HC algebras? Because theorem would apply for HC algebra. Yes. It's not HC. Everything which is truncated would be an example. Right, okay. Further questions? Okay, so uh, I think that's a good question. Right, I just want to kind of say one more thing that why this kind of result, or even like in this very special case, is very useful because it directly, or not directly, but was already kind of known to Bud Klaus and Matthew, that this implies a more general theorem, namely so consequence of theorem. Of theorem of Bert Claus Matthew. So the T1 local K-theory has many pleasant properties. So for example, take T1 log to K-theory ring R. So this might be now the usual commutative ring R. Might be now the usual commutative ring R. It's true of slightly more general, but let's just assume it's the usual commutative ring R. And this thing is always an equivalence. And uh I should say this is totally not true for T C, certainly. And it's a special feature of algebraic K D. Feature of algebraic K D. This fits also very well. This fits very well with the result of a lot of people. I guess there should be again Voybotsky. And I think the latest inclination is Claude Matthew. This is like saying, okay, T1 log over K3 is often, or sometimes 0, but so if 1 over P is an R. 1 over P is in R, plus some further conditions which are actually pretty mild, then the T1 local K-theory of R is equivalent, I leave a little space here, to the etal k-theory of R when we look at high enough degrees. It's always true for n for the Tall King theory is the system of Tolkien theory. Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry. This better? Sorry, if you put a tall k theory. Sorry, I mixed this up. So if I put a tau k theory, then it would be for bigger or equal to minus one. With, yeah, sorry, I mixed up two statements. Thank you. So I put here, let's just put this statement here. And but this is an also equivalent to This is what I wanted to say, I think. That entire k-theory is equivalent to the k-theory for if we truncate high and high enough with things. Yes, but it's not our results. Physically balanced processes. I mean, I mean, I never found this in the generality you give it in any other source, so let's say it this way. So, okay, but this says that kind of T1 local K theorem is actually very interesting and variant. What does that tau mean? Oh, I just kind of truncate. I can just look at how much picoops starting at that. Oh, connective colour. So let me tell you a bit about how we prove such a result. I will focus on the first part. And because I think this contains some techniques which might be of independent interest. And I guess in some sense more fundamental than this application. So let me start by reminding you of the theorem of Althaus. So let R S be a map of connected wing spectra. So when I say wing spectrum, I will mean by default A infinity. Will be by default A infinity. It is an isomorphism on pi zero plus equivalence after tensoring width. I could, for example, say z1 over p, or I could also say rational numbers. Or I could have taken arbitrary localization of the integers. This is the most two relevant cases, maybe, for this present purpose. So then k of r, k of x is equivalence after tangent width. So you can take tensoring with on homotopy groups or you can tensor with the ionyl plane spectrum, doesn't matter. So example would be, for example, if you take the sphere spectrum to the ion-plane spectrum, the integers, this versional equivalence, isomorphism phi zero. So we have By zero. So we obtained that rationally kc of the sphere spectrum is the same as the kc of the integers, which is known by royal. And this is a guy kind of of great interest in geometric topology and that who can bring this information. Bring this information to them. So, and what P of Marcus I prove is an analog of this theorem which works with higher chromatic levels. I think I mean what I say that I have Oh, that's a good idea. So the assumptions are very similar to the Whitehausen theorem, so that R to S be an n-connective map of the Of connected width spectra that is an equivalent after uh tensoring with uh TI. With uh Ti for I is equal to n. And the same is true for the K-theory space. So we're n-connective, I'm always confused with n-connective and n-connected. So what I mean is that the omatry fibers n-connective. Is that the homotopy fiber is n-connective, which I think means that it's an isomorphism in degrees smaller than n and a surjection in degree n. Or maybe I've shifted by one, but maybe this doesn't matter for the purposes of the talk. Okay. So this is like an analog of Walthausen's theorem for higher chromatic levels. And one feature which is maybe kind of interesting here is that we really have to ask, at least with our proof, this Ever prove this to be true for all things from 0 to n. And there's a slight variant which says from 1 to n would be also enough. But we cannot just say, oh, we have an equivalence after tensoring with T5, and then we get an equivalence of tensor with T5 and T5 homology on Kth respectful. And actually, another kind of comment I want to make, one reason why I work with Ti instead of Ki, because we can only prove the theorem when it has input with Ti coverts this here. Has input with Ti called at this level. So K. Do you have any structure in your ring spectra? Like in the Wall-Hausen theorem, you require them to be A infinity. Oh, yes, it's A infinity, you can. Oh, A infinity? Yeah. Else, I wouldn't even know how to take such A curve as well. Oh, sure. Right, gotcha. Okay. So let me get this straight. The this the naive conductivity of that map is related to the chromatic height. Is related to the chromatic height of the wave. I would say that the ideal theorem would be if it's an isomorphism on Ti homology from 0 to n, and the same is true on K-theory. But we can only prove it if we have an additional connectivity estimate. I mean, you certainly need it to be a pi-na. Yeah. Well, come to this point. Does this have anything to do with Eilberg-McLean spaces? Halberg and space is to Hamilberg. Yes, exactly. There's a stereo of Welmer at Wilson which you might have thought of. Okay, so I want to... Wait a minute more minutes. So maybe I give a proof sketch and that's why not start with the wrong proof sketch but which can be corrected. Which can be corrected, but this kind of maybe gives the idea. So assume that omega infinity. But I mean, can't just assume. So, assumptions that R to S is a Ti equivalence. So, then we can easily deduce that this thing has a Ti equivalence as well. Okay, and if we additionally assume that omega also Also detects TI equivalences, then it's not very hard to show that this implies that PGLR infinity to PGL infinity s is also Ti equivalent. Okay, and now we know to get K-theory, you have to apply the plus construction. So this is Ti equivalence. So this part is actually solid because we know like the plus construction doesn't change any value for homology theory. So this is omega infinity k of r at least above kind of ignoring pi zero, but pi zero doesn't really matter for T i equivalence for i to zero uh one. Let's for i begin to one and then we can deduce from here that k r to k s is a t i equal to so that's the idea of the proof so as I said because we assumed something wrong we actually have to correct the proof idea a bit So this part is actually correct. So omega affinity text, TI equivalence for I to go to zero. This is maybe surprising, but as a consequence of Pauswell factor. But this part is wrong. But this part is wrong. And we already heard a hint about this from the audience: why it's wrong. So look at the following example. Look at this guy. And if you believe me what I said earlier, if we tender this with Ti, it's a zero. So take omega infinity, you get C p infinity, but C p infinity non-zero. So you might be a little bit more familiar with the related fact that C P infinity, the K i homology of C p infinity is non-zero. And yeah, this implies that this is also non-zero. Yeah, and this implies that this is also not zero. So this does not work. But there's a very nice statement by Robin and Wilson, which says, okay, if I just make this thing bigger than this I, at least roughly, I'm always one by a shift of one, then this kind of nonsense doesn't occur anymore. And there's also like a Ti version of this. And so if connectivities. If the connectivities are high enough, these kinds of problems disappear. So this is a little bit of a vague statement, as you see, but the precise statement uses work quite well. uses uh work by Bausfield and if you would have liked to have the Knversion instead of TN version you'd use the work by Robert Miller Wilson and for the TN version we need to work by or the recent work by Kamieri Schlank Janowski from the every dexterity paper where they kind of approve a kind of version of this logic Proof of kind of version of this rottener Wilson vanishing result, what I'm obtaining spaces for the Ti. So that's the proof idea. That kind of using this kind of stuff, you can almost pretend that omega infinity preserves TIA cohesion. As you can remember this, sorry, but so in the pre-sketch, yeah, so if you assume the kind of Yeah, so if you assume the connectivity, the proof sketch still seems to do one Ti at a time. So like why wouldn't it work with the connectivity estimate and then T n as input and T n because the result of so okay let's say a little bit more about this. So there's a notion of Vi periodic homogeneous groups of spaces and so there's a result of Hausfit. So what is true is that if a Ti equivalence then becomes omega infinity. Then becomes on omega infinity a Vi periodic covalence. And what Bausfield tells us is that if you have like a V0 up to Vn periodic covalence and connectivity is high enough, it becomes a Tn equivalent or T0 to T n equivalent. But this is exactly the problem. And I mean, you know, this without, I'm not sure whether it's also maybe I'm not sure whether it's also maybe. I think some version is maybe due to darkness, some other version due to Mausfield. Then, if you have a space whose direction is it? It's Kn homology vanishes, then also the Kn minus 1 homology vanishes. The right direction? So it's like So it's like very hard to really separate the different layers of spaces. Okay, so how to apply this to proof the earlier scale. So, in particular That's the T1 localization, kt of C not P to the NSR. So the input was we have an E infinity wing spectrum R. This is true, and at the end we want to have that T1 localization. T1 localization of the KTV of R. So, what do we do in between? First of all, so can we use to the connective case as T1 local S the K-theory of R is a module. Theory of R is a module over the K-theory of the connected cover of R. So because we have this, the same is also true of the T1 localization. So if this guy vanishes, and certainly this guy vanishes as well, because you have a module with a zero ring, you don't live a happy life. Okay, so. So, what can we do next? So we can look at the map from here to I0. And we see this is a one-connective map. And what I claim furthermore is that it's a covalent. Cool answer. On T0 and T1. So why is this? So we assume, certainly it's an equivalence on T0 because we assumed that by invert P, this guy is 0. So the same must be true for pi 0. So both things are 0. But I tensor this with T1 is also 0. But y is T1. Okay, but why is tensoring this with T1 zero? Okay, we had this theorem before that if an E infinity wing tensoring inverting P is zero, then also tensoring with arbitrary Ti homology is zero. So this is using this kind of, I think this version of the theorem is already like uh due to this kind of main conjecture thing uh from from Makiel, uh Nico and uh Justin and kind of generalization of uh uh generally Generally. Okay. So we have this, and so this implies by our theorem that k that this is a T1 equivalent. So now's the question, how did this help us? Ask the question: How did this help us? Well, first of all, we've reduced the general connective case to the discrete case. Problem is, even in this case, it was like not known before, so we cannot really have reduced them. But now, we can use kind of a nice theorem by Georg and Marcus, which say that they call these kind of things truncating invariants. If you have something where you plug in a connected ring spectrum and doesn't see a difference to its price zero, you call the invariant truncating. Call the invariant truncating. And this says T1 local k-theory is truncating, at least if I assume that this is also T1, basically. Or at least in this situation. And they have like nice, they prove several nice properties about truncating invariants. And one thing is that so lamp tunnel show that Show that truncating implies Neil invariance. So i.e. that in this case that we have R, K theory of, let's call it A because it's a discrete rate. But the K-theory of A is the same as the K-theory of A mod I if I is newpolant. So this is not a property usual K-theory has, but if we T1 localize, it follows from this method that K-theory has this property. It's nearly. So in particular, we have the K-the-value the We have the k-theory of z mod p to the n is t1 equivalent to k-theory of fp. And we know that this thing is HCP after p completion and this is certainly zero, t1 locally, because if I tend to this was t1, it's zero. Tensor this was T1 at 0. So that's the idea of the proof. How do you get this thing? How do you get the general case from this? If you have an arbitrary commutative thing, commutative ring, where P inverting P is 0, it must be a Z mod P to the N algebra. Because I know 1 must be P to the n coordinate for some n. So we get form there, sorry, for the chaotic If this is zero, T1 locally. And then it follows because this thing, the same T1 locally is this, but this is it. So this is how the proof goes. I think one nice feature of this is at the end we want to prove a result about a discrete ring. And in between, we really have to use a non-discrete ring spectrum to show this. To show this. This nice feature, this result of London Tammel, which says, okay, sometimes you have to go to non-discrete rings to prove something about discrete rings. I mean, the idea is why this might be true is you can just some way shift this neopotent ideal to a degree one, DGA. So this would be going to degree one, and then you can apply this. So this is the basic idea how this proof goes. And right. So, and just let me say one thing in the remaining two minutes. So, we had this kind of severe kind of connectivity assumptions in the theorem. And you might ask were they actually necessary. So, without any assumptions, probably not. But we believe that in many cases it's actually not necessary to have these assumptions. So, for example, for So for example, for little KO algebra, for HC algebra, or modern little KO algebra, we can show the same theorem without any connectivity assumptions. So what I also want to say, the theorem I wrote is also true for TC. So this was don't just Buddha and McCarthy theorem. You can use it from the K-3 version for the TC version. But the kind of stronger clear, like for without any connectivity hypothesis, it's just for algebraic K3 and not for T C. And I think it's open how necessary this connectivity assumptions are in general. Okay, that's everything I want to say. Thank you very much. Any questions for Lennon? So uh since I refer to the result K1 local P, K theory local rank is the same as K theory local P. And the result that said earlier it's for rank tetra and you have a high bond version of that, so is there also a high right version of this fact? Well yes, so at least partially, so So just repeating this, yeah, just take two minutes to answer this. So if R is the H V algebra, I said earlier that if we take a K theory of R, get a T1 local equivalence to K theory of R1 over P. So now I can move one chromatic level higher, and R might be a little KO algebra over P. Algebra or K-theory here. So the question is: what should we replace this by? And we should not just inverting P again, should do something slightly more complicated. So we can invert P, or we can also invert another friend of ours, namely we can invert the bot element, which is essentially the same as inverting B1. And you can also invert both. And you can also invert both. And then you can form the pullback and get something which one might call L1P. And the statement is that this is the Ti equivalent. So this should be one kuvatic level higher. I think it holds for i bigger or equal to 1. And we can also make a similar statement actually for little TMF algebras, where it has to kind of go have a cube now that can also invert v2. And we would like to kind of generalize this even further, but the problem is kind of one thing we use in this process is that Fp. FP is a compact module over little KO, also a compact module over little TMF, but like it's not a compact module, say over Shear spectrum or MU. And this way one runs into Trail 1 on here at K3. Actually we're using this kind of notion of Clark and Tyler of regular wing spectrum. I mean BPN, if you find E infinity structures of BPN, but this is trickier if But this is trickier, I've heard, yeah. Yeah, um I actually don't know how low we can go in the E something. E2 might be enough, so E1 is certainly not E1 is tricky. E2 might be helpful, E3 or E4, E4 would be almost certain. So there's a sign-up sheet for people who want to go on the excursion on this pan of paper. If you want to do that, sign up.
