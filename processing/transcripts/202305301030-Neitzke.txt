So, thank you very much for the opportunity to come here. Thanks to the organizers. It's been a wonderful conference so far and looking forward to learning a lot more. So, yeah, so this talk is about, as I say, kitchen equations, wall crossing, and quantization. So, in the first part, I'm going to describe a kind of conjectural picture of the moduli space of Higgs bundles and the hypercaleer metric on it in very And the hyperkillar metric on it and various kinds of geometric structures that it has. This conjectural picture is something that's kind of old. It arose in joint work with David A. Gallotto and Greg Moore, and subsequently it's been developed by me and others, particularly in some joint work with David Dumas and Laura Fredrickson. So in the first part of the talk, I'll just tell you about that picture. And then, time permitting, I want to say a little bit about the relation to structures that came up in Adam Shakura's talk about the quantization of character varieties and the skein algebras. Okay, and so everything I say is somehow a picture that's motivated by supersymmetric quantum field theory. And if there are questions, I can try to describe it, but my sort of default is just going to be to just explain what the mathematical. Is just going to be to just explain what the mathematical structures are. Oh, right, right, right. I'm supposed to sort of fold one into the other, right? Okay. I think that's the smallest I can make the cross section. Okay. Oh, and which boards am I supposed to use? This one and that one. Okay, so let me start by recalling some of the structures that we just heard. By recalling some of the structures that we just heard actually in Richandra's talk. So let's have a little recollection on non-abelian Hodge. I'll write NAH for short, non-abelian Hodge. So now and forever, I'll let C be a compact Riemann surface. Compact Riemann surface. I guess it should have genus at least two. Two, um, and I'll have a compact group which we may as well just take to be uh um SUK. Um, and then uh, so what I mean by a Higgs bundle is always just a Higgs bundle in dimension one, kind of the usual plain vanilla kind of Higgs bundle. So a Higgs bundle is a pair scripty and thumb. Right, kind of script E and phi, where script E is a holomorphic vector bundle of rank K over radio surface. So that's one part of the data. And then the second part of the data is the Higgs field, which is a kind of matrix valued. Locally, what it is is it's just a matrix valued in homomorphism. It's just a matrix valued in holomorphic one forms, but globally that matrix is an endomorphism of this holomorphic vector. So it's a section of endomorphism of E. That would just be a matrix valued endomorphism. It's valued in one form, so I tensor with the surface. That's what I mean by Higgs model. And now, what's the sort of famous analytic fact about? Analytic fact about Higgs bundles is that even though it starts out its life as this purely kind of holomorphic or algebraic object, it actually has kind of this, you know, kind of inner secret differential geometry in it. The way that you see the differential geometry is through the following thing. You say, so suppose I'm given a, suppose I'm given a Higgs bundle, or okay, so to be precise, I should say. Okay, so to be precise, I should say a polystable Higgs bundle, but I won't make much fuss about stability in this talk. So, you know, most of them are polystable. So given a polystable Higgs bundle, I guess I'll write HB for Higgs bundle. Then it has this, it actually has a unique permission metric with kind of wonderful property. So there it is. I'll call it H. So what's the property that has? So this is a so in particular, so this is a Hermitian metric in this complex vector bundle. But what makes it harmonic is that it obeys this equation. obeys this equation hitchen equation um as we heard in uh sounder's talk um uh it'll be the hitchin equation which says that the curvature of the turn connection the churn connection determined by this holomorphic bundle and harmonic metric the curvature of the churn connection um simplest thing would be to say that it's zero here we don't say that it's zero but we say that it should be equal to uh this kind of This kind of quilinear thing in the Higgs field, the bracket of the Higgs field and the adjoint of the Higgs field. Adjoint, to talk about the adjoint, we have to have the Hermitian metric. So this is, once we have the Hermitian metric, we talk about the adjoint. And so the condition is that that should be equal to zero. I'll write that equation star. So that's Hitchens' equation. And so the theorem, yeah, so I should say. Theorem, yeah, so I should say this is a theorem, which I think is correctly attributed to Hitchin and Simpson. I think, but closely related work of also Corlette and Donaldson. Okay, so anytime you've got a Higgs bundle, it comes with this kind of best. At this kind of best metric. Even if you don't care about metrics, you might care about some of the downstream consequences of that. So, like, the one particular thing that this allows you to do is do the following. So suppose now that you fix a parameter, let's zeta in C star. Now you do the following thing. You say, let me define. Let me define. I'll define Nabla zeta. That's going to be a connection in E. And the way I'll get it is I'll start with the term connection. The trunk connection, we said, is generally is not flat. Its curvature obeys this equation. But what we can do, we can take the term connection now and just shift it, right? If you have a connection and you add to it any endomorphism value in one form, then you get another connection. You get another connection. In particular, we could add to it one form phi. Let's multiply that by zeta inverse. So zeta inverse times phi plus this turn connection. Okay, that's still not flat. But now I also add to it zeta times by dagger. And now if you calculate the curvature of this one, you see that sure enough, it's flat. You see that sure enough, it's flat. It's flat exactly because this equation holds. And so now the statement, even if you don't care about harmonic metrics, the kind of interesting statement is that if someone gives you a Higgs bundle, then canonically associated to it is a flat connection over the surface, a flat complex connection over your surface. In fact, not only one, right? Not only one, but a whole C-star family, the canonical C-star family of flat connections over your surface. Connections over your surface. So, all right, so back here. Oh, sorry, I didn't write the punchline. So, so writing zeta, this connection exists and is flat. Not unitary, but flat. So, it's like a representation of the fundamental group into, not into SUK, but into SLKC. Okay. Okay, so at the level of moduli spaces, we can say it like this. So for any fixed parameter, you know, zeta and c star, we have a map which takes Which takes a given Higgs bundle to the corresponding flag connection. And that induces a map of modulized species. So if I look at objects mod equivalence here, that gets mapped to objects mod equivalents here. And so, and it's not only a map of modulized spaces, but now this is the, this is the. But now, this is the cool thing: is actually a diffeomorphism of moduli space. Diffeomorphism between the moduli spaces. So, let me call the moduli space here, this moduli space M Higgs. So, it's the polystable Higgs bundles up to equivalents. And And that's isomorphic to the moduli space of flat SLKC connections over the surface. I guess I've omitted something. Okay, I made a small. Right. I said SUK, but so far, actually, I didn't impose the SUK condition. So I've been talking about rank K bundles. I guess I should have. I guess I should have said that for my Higgs bundles, now and forever, I'll impose this traceless condition. So that means that the holomorphic bundle, its determinant should be trivial. So in particular, it's a degree zero bundle. And then the trace of my Higgs field should be zero. That's a relatively minor technical point, but if I don't say that, then this is not actually quite right. But right. Okay. And so the so the sort of surprising geometric structure here then is that we have the modulized base of Higgs bundles, we have the modulized basis of my connections, which a priori look like totally different things, but there's this non-abelian Hodge diffeomorphism between them. And in fact, the C-SAR family of diffeomorphisms. The Dipium orphanes, which are really different. So you identify Higgs bundles with flat connections, you do it in many different ways. So, one way to think about that is that it's some kind of surprising structure that M. Higgs has. And how do we describe that structure just internal to M Higgs? Well, one thing you could say is that what they induce is they induce a hyperkalar structure. They induce a hypertail structure on M. Higgs. So I won't say completely what a hyperkiller structure is, but let me just say a few things that are downstream from that. So in particular, one part of being hyperkiller is to have a metric, so a Riemannian metric, which is like among other things, Ricci Flat. Richie Flynn. So, how do you get that Riemannian metric? Hyperkiller structure. So, in particular, we get a metric on M Higgs. And the fastest way to tell you what that metric is is to tell you its Kayler form. So, it's Kayler with respect to the way we constructed M Higgs. The way we constructed M Higgs as a moduli space of complex analytic objects, it comes to you directly as a complex space. And so when I say it's Taylor, I mean Taylor with respect to that kind of obvious complex structure. So then to give you the metric, I just have to give you the Taylor form. And so what it is, is it's the real part of Heart of on M flat, there's a canonical holomorphic symplectic structure called the Atiabat-Goldman symplectic form. I guess this symplectic form appeared kind of implicitly in Shapura's talk, but I won't write the formula, but it's a kind of some standard geometric structure that the moduli of flat connections has. Like it's related to the fact that the moduli of flat connections, if you have functions on the moduli flat connections, If you have functions on the modulo life like functions, there's a Poisson bracket naturally on those functions. So there's a whole reference symplectic form here. And what we do is we use this non-abelian Hodge map to pull it back to the moduli of Higgs bundles. So I should, I'll use the non-abelian Hodge map at zeta equals one, pull that holomorphic symplectic form back and take the real part. And that gives you this hyperkiller. Um, and that gives you this hyperkiller. That's one way of saying what this hyperkiller metric is. So you could compute it if you knew somehow this non-abelian Hodge map in some explicit way, then you could write like an explicit formula for this hyperkaler metric. Okay. Another part of the structure. So being hyperkaler, part of what hypertailer means, right, is that the space has not just one complex structure, but a lot of complex structures. I already told you. A lot of complex structures. I already told you about one of them, the one that it kind of manifestly has from its definition. How do you see the other complex structures? Well, this M flat is also a complex space. Here we have this diffeomorphism, so we can pull back a complex structure from M flat. That complex structure is different. So this map is not analytic in the usual complex structures. That's somehow what makes it interesting. It's only a Diffium morphism. So we use it. So, we use it, use this map to pull back complex structures. So, then we'll get a complex structure. All right, I zeta. Just by pulling back, using this non-amillion hodgemap, parameter zeta, pullback of, I guess I'll write I flat for the I flat for the standard complex structure on moduli of flat connection. That one you can think of as like, if you think of flat connections as representations into the representations of the fundamental group into the complex group, SLKC, then this complex structure just comes from the fact that SLKC is a complex group. But particularly, that one has nothing to do with the complex structure of the Riemann surface, where this one had a lot to do with the complex structure of the Riemann surface. Complex structure of the remote circles. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If I are equal footings about one forms, if you say the very mutation system is a reduction from 4D to 2D. Yes. Whereas the whole thing is just one big dimension 4D and it's just self-duality equations, and you're dimensionally reduced to that within. From that point of view, it's probably. From that point of view, it's probably not super surprising. Okay, that's a that is a good question, which I probably can't quickly um which I probably can't quickly answer. Uh yeah, it's not a physician at all, but you're just asking about the surprisingness that you know on one side you have things that are. You know, on one side, you have things that are linear over sections, and on the other side, you have things that are only linear over numbers, see, but are derivations of the product rule. You can go rapidly before the structure mathematically is having any loss because of the meaning of very changing. Yeah. In that sense, certainly it's surprising. I take your question to be like: if I'm very familiar with the self-de-agonals equations in four dimensions, then how surprised should. Diagonals equations in four dimensions, then how surprised should I be? I actually never thought carefully about that. But as okay, as a kind of down-to-earth practical statement about it, let me just say that this map, one measure of how surprising it is is whether it's easy to calculate it or hard to calculate it. Like if you actually want to describe this map, that's not simple to write it down concretely. I mean, the way I've described it so far, you would have to. Described it so far, you would have to actually solve this non-linear PDE. There's no shortcut that can avoid that. Okay, so now, so a question you might have is, here's this kind of strange map, and what can we understand about it quantitatively? So that's what I want to, the contextual picture that I'm going to describe is like a way. The contextual picture that I'm going to describe is like a way of getting some quantitative information about what this map can actually do. Okay, so what can we say? Quantitatively, beyond the fact that there is a diffeomorphism, what can we say quantitatively about what it is? Okay. So, I want to describe a kind of conjectural answer to that question. I want to describe it as concretely as I can, and so I'm going to specialize a little bit so that I can. And so I'm going to specialize a little bit so that I can write kind of really explicit formulas. So let's first, so instead of considering all of the Higgs bundles, I want to consider just some special ones. And also I'll specialize now to rank two, which has kind of most of the essential features now. So suppose I'm in SU2. And now I'm going to give you a, I'm going to give Now, I'm going to give you a concrete example of a Higgs bundle, which will depend on just the data of a holomorphic quadratic differential on the Riemann surface. So fix a holomorphic quadratic differential on C. In other words, I guess I would write phi 2 and Two in h0 of the canonical bundle script. Then I can make a Higgs bundle. I can make a Higgs bundle like this. I'm supposed to give you two things. I'm supposed to give you a rank two holomorphic bundle, and I'm supposed to give you a matrix-valued endomorphism. So my ranked two holomorphic bundle will be, I'll take the canonical bundle. I'll take the canonical bundle to the power minus a half, direct sum the canonical bundle to a half. Okay, so I have to choose actually this holomorphic square root of the canonical bundle. That's the choice of a spin structure. So always such a choice because then I'll just fix one. So then I'll take this to be my holomorphic bundle. And I'll take my one-form valued endomorphism now. I'm going to write like this. Now, I'm going to write like this. I'm going to write a two by two matrix with respect to this decomposition into k to the minus a half and k to the half. What that two by two matrix is, it's just zero, one, by two, zero. So that's, if you check, you know, each entry has to be a section of an appropriate line bundle. And if you check, each entry is a section of the correct line bundle, but this is actually like a globally defined Higgs field over the over the surface. Higgs field over the over the surface. Okay, so so there's an example of the Higgs bundle. And so more exactly, it's one Higgs bundle for every quadratic differential. And so we got to map. So this is a Higgs bundle over C. And so we got a map from the space of all holomorphic quadratic differentials. Quadratic differentials actually injective map, even holomorphic map into the moduli space and Higgs models. And that's a copy of this vector space just sitting inside the moduli space of Higgins. And The image of that map. So the image of that map is what's sometimes called the hitch and section S sitting inside the modulized space. Sitting inside the moduli space of Higgs bundles. Why ancient section? Because it's the section of some natural kind of fibration structure. So, one way of thinking about the moduli space of Higgs bundles actually is that it's fibered over, it's like a complex integrable system, which in practical terms means just it's like a vibration over the space, which is just a vector space whose generic. Vector space whose generic fiber is a compact complex torus. Then there are some degenerate fibers, which can have kind of worse and worse singularities as you go deeper and deeper in some stratification of the base here. But if you just look at the generic fiber, you just have really complex tori. So this whole picture is supposed to be M Higgs. And then this hitch and section that I'm talking about is literally a section of. Is literally a section of this projection, which is to say that on each torus you have some distinguished some distinguished element. Okay, so inside of this whole moduli space of pink bundles, we're looking at just this green subspace. Okay. And And on that subspace, the Hitchin equations, the meaning of the Hitchin equations also becomes kind of more maybe more geometrically transparent. So before I said the Hitchin equation means that you're trying to find some metric in some bundle, but here the bundle is something very concrete. So you can ask, what does it mean to give the metric here? It turns out that what it means is, so the Hitchin equations. What they reduce to is that you're trying to find a harmonic map, a harmonic map from the universal cover of your surface to the hyperbolic disk, right, SL2R, but SO2. Given such a harmonic map, Given such a harmonic map, there's an associated polymorphic quadratic differential called the Hopf differential. And this quadratic differential of phi2 is the Hopf differential of this harmonic node. Okay, so in this particular case, the equations correspond to some relatively concrete differential geometry question. Differential geometry question. So now, so what I want to discuss is, or what I want to review, let's say, I want to describe what is this non-abelian Hodge isomorphism when it's restricted to this particular setting. So NA zeta as a map from the Hitchin section to Two the moduli space of flat connections. And I want to describe the metric, this hyperkiller metric, G restricted to the just second. That's what I want to tell you something about. Okay. Okay, so things are getting a little more concrete. Now I want to make it even more concrete. So, I want to consider. So, in this story, we still have the Riemann surface of at least genus 2. That's a somewhat sort of complicated ingredient. Somewhat sort of complicated ingredient. So, let me even now replace the Riemann surface just by CP1. And the way we can do that is: so now we're going to make our little baby example. So, statement is that there's a version of this theory, the version of this whole story, where the Higgs field is allowed to have poles. So, for example, we can take a Riemann surface to be actually just CP1. That's much simpler, right? Have actual coordinates. And we'll have a pole. How about we just have a single pole at infinity? And it'll be a pole of kind of high order, but that's okay. So, in that case, you know. So, in that case, you know, we were talking before about this holomorphic quadratic differential. Now, holomorphic quadratic differential becomes something yet simpler. It's literally just going to be a holomorphic function. So, z, I'll take z to be like the usual inhomogeneous coordinate on cp1. Now we're literally writing just a just a function, p2 of z, z squared. And that function, because I want to have a pole at infinity, non-essential singularity, so that function will be just a polynomial. Polynomial. Okay, so now my data that determines the Higgs bundle is just a polynomial. Oh, this version of the theory, I should say. So this extension with poles was developed by various people. So, but particularly Simpson, Ecard, and Bulch for the higher order poles. And then there's a very general version of the story, Duda Mochiduki. Due to Mocha Duke. Okay, so now the data of my Higgs bundles now has been replaced ultimately by the data of just polynomials. Now you say, what's going to be on the other side? So what is the non-abelian Hodge map going to be in this kind of highly degenerate situation? So let's write it. So, for example, so let me fix an odd integer, n. And now, my moduli space of Higgin bundles very specifically will be, I'll consider all polynomials of the form z to the n plus. Z to the n plus some lower order terms of degree less than or equal to n over 2 minus 1. There's a little fine structure that goes into exactly what kind of behavior you allow at the singularity. So this is one example where you can say easily what it is. So it's polynomials like that. And then, so that's my M Higgs, or this is my Hitchen section, I should say, inside of M Higgs. And it's going to be mapped by non-abelian Hange at, say, zeta equals one. Well, what did we say? We said that solving Hitchin equations corresponds to finding some kind of harmonic map. So in this case, what we look at is harmonic maps from just defined on the complex plane. Just defined on the complex plane, there was nothing maps from the complex plane into the hyperbolic disk. So but not all of them, they have some asymptotic behavior that's controlled by this polynomial. So they're going to be maps whose image whose image is an ideal n plus two god inside of the hyperbolic. Of the hyperbolic disk. So the picture is something like this. Here's the hyperbolic disk, and say n equals three. Then I've got some ideal pentagon, maybe like this. So these are geodesics. Here's the image of this map. You're taking a map of the complex plane into the hyperbolic disk. It images some pentagon here. Some Pentagon here. And we look at the moduli space. So the analog of the kind of moduli space of plant connections here is the moduli of these ideal polygons. So concretely, concretely, the problem of finding the non-abelian Hodge map in this case. Hodge map in this case corresponds to mapping on the Higgs bundle side, the coefficients of this polynomial P2. And the analog of the flat connections in this case is to just give you this polygon. Well, to give you the polygon, what do I have to give you? I have to give you the vertices. The vertices of the polygon completely determine the polygon. Well, but it's all up to SL2R transformation. So that means what I should really give you is not the So, that means what I should really give you is not the actual vertices, but rather just the cross ratios of the vertices. So, it'll be cross ratios of n plus 2 points in RP1. So, here, yeah, because we restricted to the H and Restricted to the pitch and section, the way that it looks is here. We've got complex coefficients. I guess two complex coefficients. So I think I have a factor of two button in my note here. Right, we have a homeomorphism between two spaces. On the one hand, the space of this complex space, which is the space of coefficients of these polynomials. And on the other hand, here, we have just this real space, which is the space of cross ratios of these n plus two points. Okay, so someone who's Okay, so someone who's quick can calculate the dimensions of these two spaces, the real dimensions of these two spaces, and check that they're the same. They should be the same. I wrote some nonsense here. But we'll see it explicitly in the example. Okay, so hopefully the problem now is quick. So this is kind of a prototype of the general non-abelian hogs, this very specific thing of mapping polynomials to cross ratios of some polynomial. Polymer. Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's right. So these space, right? I mean, remember, the Hitchin section was just this, was just like a vector space. So that's exactly what we expect. We just have C to the N here and R to the 2n here. But the map is going to be some very complicated, you know, it's not like an algebraic map or anything. It's some transcendental thing that we're trying to find. So, okay, so now let's. So now let me say what's the picture of this map that came out of quantum field theory. So here's the conjectural picture. So suppose we want to compute one of these polygons. For example, suppose we want to compute the corresponding polygons. example suppose we want to compute the corresponding the the polygon corresponding to the polynomial z cubed minus one um so then it's as i drew it here there's literally five vertices we want to compute the um in that case there's two invariant cross ratios of these uh um uh of these five vertices um and this space is just going to be c so in this case it's going to be c equals r2 um uh so So, I want to somehow tell you that polygon, so I'll describe it in the following: let's label the vertices. I'll label the vertices like this. So you can study the asymptotics of the map easily enough, and you can figure out that as you go off to infinity in different directions in the z-plane, you're getting mapped to the different vertices of this polygon. So, a label of vertices. Of this polygon. So I'll label the vertices. Vertex one is the one you reach when you go this way, vertex two, three, and so on. So vertex four will be here, and vertex five will be here. So this is the picture in the z-plane. And I'll let what I want to compute are the cross ratios. I'll compute specific cross ratios. I'll let Xb be the cross ratio of vertex one, two, three, and five, and xb. And xb be the cross ratio of verts x1, 3, 4, and 5. In this particular case, it's going to happen that xa actually equals xb. But for a general polygon, these two cross ratios would be different. So to describe this polygon, we have to introduce another player which already appeared in the In, I think, a few of the talks now, which is this spectral curve of the Higgs bundle. So, let me introduce the spectral curve here. So, in this case, the spectral curve, so in general, it would be swept out by the eigenvalues of the Higgs field. By the eigenvalues of the Higgs field. In this case, it's given just by this explicit equation inside of C2. In other words, since the polynomial was ZQ minus one, it's just this elliptic curve, one genus one curve. So if I think of that as a, you know, this way of presenting it presents it as a branch cover over the z-plane, and its branch at the three points, which are. Its branch at the three points, which are the three zeros of this polynomial, which is to say, there's branching points here, here, and here. And it turns out that somehow the most important quantities in this story are certain integrals over the spectral curve, the periods. So I'll write periods. Let's say periods. So Z gamma, some complex number, which is just given some cycle on the spectral curve, I take the integral of the one form. There's always a canonical one form on the spectral curve, which in this case is y dz. Or, you know, more pragmatically, what we're doing is we're doing some integrals of the form. We have to integrate the square root of zq minus 1 dz over some. minus one dz over some cycles. Okay, so what are the cycles I'm going to use? Well each of these cross ratios, each of these cross ratios is going to have some associated cycle on the spectral curve. So this cross ratio xa is going to be associated with this. So I draw this loop. This loop encircles two branch points. So it lifts to a loop on the on the double cover, a closed loop on the double cover. Loop on the double cover. And here, similarly, I'll draw another loop. And then these periods then become some concrete numbers. So for example, the period ZA, if you actually do this integral, it's like minus 2.524 plus or minus 1.457i. Just to give you. Just to give you the feeling that these are some concrete numbers that you can calculate. Okay, fine. So now, okay, now I can tell you the kind of conjectural picture of what the polygon actually is. Yeah. A, yeah, sure. So we consider this surface, this Riemann surface, which is a double cover of the double cover of the. A double cover of the z-plane. Now it's a double cover, but it's a branched double cover. It's branched at the zeros of the z-cubed minus one. So I've marked those zeros by crosses. Okay, so then I take this loop on the take this loop on the base. I go around it with some orientation. Okay, now actually I didn't tell you the orientation. So strictly speaking, I'm only going to tell you this up to a sign ambiguity. Up to a sign ambiguity. But up to a sign ambiguity, what you do is you start at, you know, say this point, lift this point to one of the two sheets of the cover, which is to say choose one of the two square roots of z cubed minus one. And then just follow that, follow that, take this loop on the base and lift it to a loop on the cover. Now, because we encircle an even number of branch points, when I come back around to the original point, also on the cover, I will have come back to the original point. Cover, I will come back to the original point, and so therefore, this loop lifts to a loop loop on the cover. Not yet. So, so the cross ratio, so so far in this part of the story, so far we've used the spectral curve, but we actually haven't used the polygon anywhere. So, I'm going to use this momentarily, I'm going to say that these periods, which a priori are sort of completely Higgs bundled data, that these periods allow you to. These periods allow you to calculate the polygon. But so far, the polygon wasn't involved. Yeah, good. Other questions? Okay, great. So and I started at 1045, was it? Okay, good. Okay, so yeah, so let me let me try to formulate Formulate what the picture is. So my goal now is just to determine these two numbers. These are the cross ratios vertices of this pentagon that I get from the harmonic map. I just want to calculate those numbers somehow, tell you what those numbers are. Numbers are. And so, okay, so let me give you, you know, the conjectural picture of what these numbers are. Actually, let me give you two flavors of the conjecture. So the weak statement, which is kind of easy to write, and then the more interesting statement. So the weak version of the conjecture, the weakest version of the conjecture, let's say. So the weakest version is a kind of asset product statement. It says that it says something about. It says something about the limiting behavior of this map as I go to infinity in the space of polynomials. Suppose I just want to describe that. So, suppose here that I would take this polynomial and I would rescale it by like a big real multiple. So instead of z cubed minus one, I take like a million times z cubed minus one. And I ask how is the polygon going to behave in that limit? But in that limit, I should also be going to infinity. I could also be going to infinity in the space of polygons. And what that means is that, you know, this polygon is becoming very, very degenerate. So some of the vertices are getting very close together. But, you know, so how do you describe exactly what happens? Claim is the following, that then the cross ratios will behave like, just write one of them. I'll write the cross ratio xA. This cross ratio behaves exponentially with this parameter. And the coefficient of exponential growth is this real part of this period. So it's equal to this plus some correction, but the correction goes to zero in the limit as r goes to infinity. In other words, it says that in leading order, these periods of the spectral curve completely control the asymptotic behavior of the The asymptotic behavior of this polygon, or more generally, the asymptotic behavior of the non-abelian Hodge map. So, asymptotically, what's the punchline? The punchline is that the spectral curve of a Higgs bundle controls sort of much more than you first think. So, when you define the non-abelian Hodge map, it has nothing obviously to do with the spectral curve. But, nevertheless, if you want to actually calculate this map asymptotically in a limit near infinity, the periods of the spectral curve are actually. The periods of the spectral curve are actually the only data that you need. Okay, so that's the kind of weak version of the statement. The strong version of the statement is somehow more interesting. So, the strong variant says: suppose I want to actually calculate this. Suppose I want to actually calculate this quantity on the nose instead of just kind of asymptotically. Then, first of all, it says what you should do is you should not actually just calculate this number. You should extend it first to a function. So, the statement is that it can be extended to a piecewise analytic function. Piecewise analytic function. So, I'll write x. function. So I'll write xa of zeta where zeta is in c star. And this zeta appeared earlier in the talk. So we talked about this one parameter family of connections. Whenever you have a Higgs bundle, you've got a one parameter family of connections. So the idea is that if you want to study the non-abelian Hodge, the sort of effective way to do it is to study that whole one parameter family of connections. So we're going to, so that's what we're going to do. We're going to consider xA as a function of zeta. Of zeta, and this function is going to be determined as the solution of some integral equation. So let me write the equation. This equation is like a little bit to, you know, when you first see it, it's like a little much to take in, but the key thing is just what are the. Take in, but the key thing is just what are the ingredients in the equation. So, yeah, okay, so I just write it. So it says that the cross ratio that you're after, it has a simple explicit part that's just determined by the that's just determined by the period, like we said before. And in some sense, you know, the leading behavior really is just this. But the exact answer is not just. But the exact answer is not just this. There's one other important thing that you have to know about. And that other thing is, well, it's a bunch of integers. So for every homology class on the spectral curve, there's going to be an integer. I'll write omega of mu. These integers, what are they? So these integers in this case, so they have some kind of general geometric meaning, but in this particular example, let's just say what they are. They'll be one if mu is gamma a plus or minus gamma a plus or minus gamma b. plus or minus gamma b or plus or minus gamma a plus gamma b and zero otherwise so this is this integer valued function on the lattice of homology of the spectral curve that's just supported at six points so it's a function on a whole lattice z2 but it's supported at six points and everywhere else it's zero um and that function is the only other ingredient that you need apart from the periods to to conjecturely to To conjectually, to completely describe the 90 million Hodge map. But what do you have to do? So you don't just write this, you have to write this times some funky interval. So this is the part that is a little unpleasant. So I write the inner product, the intersection pairing between gamma A and mu. And then I have to write some integral over array in the array in the um in the complex plane which integral is it it's the which ray is it it's the ray determined by the period um i have to integrate something a little gross so uh zeta prime plus zeta some kernel prime minus zeta and then there's the log of one plus x mu of zeta prime sorry that i just barely selected um I guess the only important thing to take away from this is that it is indeed an integral equation. So the function xA appears here, but also function x mu appears on the other side. So what we have is we have these functions xa, similarly xb. And more generally, when I write x mu here, what I mean is, I have to erase this. All right, x mu is xA to the n, xb to the m, if mu is n gamma a plus m gamma b. So in other words, we have a function. I talked about this function xa, but actually we have a function for every cycle on the spectral curve. And this integral On the spectral curve, and this integral equation somehow mixes up all the functions on the spectral curve. It's an integral equation for all of them at once. Okay. Okay, so this looks a little gross, but as a practical tool, this is actually extremely useful because somehow this gives you information that's very, that's orthogonal to the other way of computing this function x. The other way of computing this function x would be just to directly solve Hitchin equation somehow, directly solve a PDE. Here, that PDE is no longer. Here, that PDE is nowhere. But yet, you're supposed to get the same information. Why do I believe it's true? The most convincing reason I believe it's true is that with David Dumas, we numerically actually did this. So we solved Hitchin equations just on a computer, and we solved this integral equation on a computer, and sure enough, you get the same cost ratios. Okay. But what would lead you to write this down? Okay, let's just say very briefly. Would lead you to write this down? Okay, let's just say very briefly: what would lead you to write this down? So, as I say, it originally came from quantum field theory, but if you think of it truly as a mathematical statement, the way you would try to get it, okay, so let's call this equation dagger. So, if you ask where does this equation dagger come from? Well, in one sentence, where it comes from is it comes from studying the family. Remember, I said there's this family of flat connections, right? The Nabla zeta, zeta inverse phi plus d plus zeta, right? Whenever we have a solution of Hitching equations, I told you at the beginning, there's this one-parameter family of flat connections. And what we do is we study. Connections. What we do is we study, you want to study zeta equals to one, but the way you do it is this very peculiar way of expanding around the singularity of zeta equals to zero. Now, there's an essential singularity at z equals zero. So that that expansion is somehow subtle. It has it suffers from Stokes' phenomenon. And these integers omega. phenomenon and these integers omega of mu ultimately are integers that measure the stokes phenomenon uh in the expansion around zeta equals zero so this goes this is something that's in some form is well known to physicists it's called the wkd method um but in this form this version of it should really be called the exact wkd um and at this point one of the main reasons why this story why i'm describing it all is a Why I'm describing it all as a conjecture is that the mathematical underpinnings of WKB applied to this kind of family of connections are still not like 100% there. So that's a subject being actively pursued. But like as of today, as theorems, it doesn't completely exist. And for that reason, this is still kind of a conjectural story. Okay. So I have like one minute left, right? left right um so i just say in one minute um i'll just say in one minute that um one kind of uh uh one more recent uh um uh offshoot of this that we're currently developing with uh uh Davide Giotto, Greg Moore, and Fay Yan is a kind of quantized version of all this. So, so far, you know, one way you could understand what I'm saying here is that there's a kind What I'm saying here is that there's a kind of elaborate geometric structure on the moduli of flat connections or on the moduli space of Higgs bundles, right? This hyperkalar structure and all of these distinguished functions that you use to determine the hyperkaler structure. So, what we're developing is a kind of similar story, which applies not to the algorithm. Which applies not to the algebra of actual functions, not to the commutative algebra of functions, but to the Skein algebra, which is a quantization of the algebra of functions, which Adam talked about in his talk yesterday. Not for arbitrary value of the parameter q, but for q a root of unity. So when q is a root of unity, there seems to be some parallel story to this, where now these functions xa, if I'll just write the kind of key relation, there'll be analogs of this xa and xb, but instead of commuting, XA and XB, but instead of commuting, they Q commute. And then they're thought not as functions, but as endomorphisms of some vector bundle, so-called BBB brain over the moduli space of over the moduli space of these Higgs bundles. Okay, but clearly there's no time for that, so thank you very much. Thank you, Anna, for a really nice talk. Thank you, Anne, for a really nice talk. Are there any questions to get started? Yes, there. Yes. Is it difficult to ask? What the mu is counting for those that are next? Oh, this function. So, okay. So, we're the context is given this beta, we're supposed to produce some four-dimensional. We're supposed to produce some four-dimensional n equals two supercentric quantum field theory. Um, and the data of the quadratic differential is giving you a point on the Coulomb branch of that theory. And then what this omega is, is it's the index counting BPS particles, one, you know, one particle BPS states in that supersymmetric quantum field theory. And in that language, this mu is like, so you know, if you go out on the Coulomb branch, the theory is generically just like an abelian gauge theory, right? So it just has electromagnetic charges. And that's what this mu is. And that's what this μ is. So, this is the count of particles with electromagnetic charge μ. So, the statement is: in this theory, there's six such particles.
