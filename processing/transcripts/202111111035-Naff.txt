It's about the higher codimension mean curvature flow. We had some talks recently on intrinsic flows, so let's just set some notation and context to go back to the extrinsic setting. So I mean, in the background today, I want to look at solutions of mean curvature flow, which are families of submanifolds evolving in the direction of their mean curvature in the ambient space. But often, like, you can always think there's probably a parametrization in the background in most contexts, but today I'll work with level sets of the flow whenever possible, and you can always imagine that there's a parametrization. And then, okay, so we've talked quite a lot, I think, already about the mean curvature flow and the fact that singularities arise. So, in particular, if the initial data is compact, then the time of existence has to be finite, and then as Has to be finite, and then as we saw in some lovely talks earlier, this implies that the so the curvature has to blow up before you reach the first time of the long time of existence, capital T. And so then the fundamental objective, right, let me put it maybe slightly differently, is to understand so high curvature regions. So, high curvature regions in the sort of space-time of the flow, and this leads to the study of singularity models. And the hope is that if we can study these things that model singularity formation in the mean curvature flow, we can recover information about these high curvature regions. And then if we have such a thing, maybe we can recover information about topology, geometry, and other things. Geometry, and other things in general. Okay, so, but singularity models are a slightly different class than just ancient solutions, and so that's where I'd like to begin today's talk. And I'll begin with this word inheritance. So let me use some notation for today. I've already said that, like, mt, this will just denote a compact mean curvature flow. And then why don't I put a bar above it? And so this m bar t, this will be some limit. This will be some limit of a sequence of flows of rescalings of this compact mean curvature flow I have. So you have some sequence of scales and then a sequence of space-time points. And if this limit exists, whether you can take some kind of smooth limit or some kind of weak limit, let's denote it by m bar of t. And so this is an ancient solution, and we call it the blow-up at a singular time. At a singular time. And then let me denote by m tilde of t. So again, maybe this limit only exists in a weak sense, but let me call this the blowdown. So associated to our ancient solution, we can also sort of take an asymptotic soliton. And so there's a relationship between each of these flows. In particular, it sort of restricts this class of singularity models in the class of ancient. Singularity models in the class of ancient solutions. And the sort of diagram looks something like this. And so this guy is often called like a limit flow, and this is often called a tangent flow. And our goal is to study these limit flows, and the point is that they inherit properties from the original flow and from the asymptotic shrinker. From the asymptotic shrinker. And so let me give you some examples. Well, maybe, right? The point. So MT inherits properties from both, sorry, and bar T, so the blow-up inherits from both the blowdown and the original flow. And so classically, so in mean curvature flow, often we've studied. mean curvature flow, often we've studied inheritance from the original flow and proved a number of great results. And so let's just go over what those are and for now we're going to stick in co-dimension one. And so here on the left let me write the original flow and then on the right we can do the tangent flow or the limit flow. And so certain properties on the original flow entitle you to certain properties on the blow-up limit. So for one of like Go-up limit. So, for one of the most useful is if you assume the original flow is embedded in codimension one, then you get an alphanum collapse condition on the tangent flow and the limit flow. And alphanum collapsing provides a lot of great estimates, including some of these other estimates. For example, if we restrict ourselves to this mean convex setting, then old work of Huskin and Sinestari gives you sort of weak convexity. Sort of weak convexity. This is like a Hamilton-Ivy type estimate. You get curvature positivity when you start with some weak positivity on the original flow. And then, more generally, if you assume some kind of uniform k convexity on the original flow, then you get actually sort of, not only do you get sort of one convexity better on the blow-up limits, but they actually satisfy some kinching condition. So, this is sometimes called curvature pinching, and we'll see it come up in the higher codimension case. And then, one, so all of these estimates are kind of famous, and then they're sort of this last one, let me either write here embedded or k-convex. Let me write uniform. And then some partial progress on this. It's certainly true in the embedded case. I think it's going to be true in the uniform k-convex case, but you also get these very useful. But you also get these very useful pointwise derivative estimates. And so each of these estimates tells you something from the original flow about your tangent flow and your limit flow, and then you can use these properties to really characterize and understand what kind of singularity models you're getting. And then subsequently, we can hope to understand those high-curvature regions. So I think with the line on top, you mean embedded and mean convex implies? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you're right. Uh yeah, yeah, yeah, yes. So you're right. Uh yeah, definitely. Um right. So so alphanum collapsing uh currently is only defined in the context of mean convex flows. Uh but I won't go into too much detail on that. But yes, thank you. Okay, so that's one viewpoint. This is the viewpoint that these blow-up limits inherit properties from the original flow, but you Inherit properties from the original flow, but you can take another viewpoint, which is you can just look at the sort of asymptotic profile of your singularity model, which I'm denoting by m tilde t, and you can ask, well, what does this tell you about your singularity model, right? And so this is a conference on recent developments in these geometric flows, and one of the major developments is that if you assume this blowdown is, say, a cylinder, then you can get some significant flow. Can get some symmetry condition on the blow-up limit. And so, okay, so initially, originally, this is work of Grendel and Choi. And so they didn't prove it in its full generality, right? But the context is they assume, so either you assume that the original foe is embedded in two convex, which tells you that the blood is That the blowdown here has some additional conditions like it's alpha-non-collapsing and two-convex, and they work in a smooth setting. So, that's maybe the first way that this implication was proved. But then subsequently, Choi, along with some of the people here and Brian White, so they actually showed that you don't need these conditions. So, you really can work. Conditions. So you really can work sort of without smoothness and without these extra curvature conditions, and you still get the symmetry result. So maybe I'll say this by saying the tangent flow is enough. And so this is a wonderful result because when you know you have a very symmetric blow-up limit, then you can work in sort of a much simpler setup for your flow and then subsequently. Up for your flow, and this subsequently has led to these wonderful classification results that Orr told us about in his talk. Okay, so this is sort of the best we have in codimension one for the symmetry improvement, but there's also been some partial progress in this context of the bubble sheet. And so I'll just do a dotted arrow and put the partial here, and the hope is that that this will tell you uh SON minus one symmetry. SON minus 1 symmetry. And this is recent work of Jing Zeju along with three of the four authors here, Joy, Pashofer and Herschkowitz, which we found out about in their talk. Okay, so in these symmetry inheritance results, we've forgotten about the original flow. We can work actually with a weak solution of the flow and take a tangent flow by itself, work with these Brocket flows. Flow by itself, work with these bracket flows and get the symmetry inheritance. But the initial part was to start in a smooth setting and show that you inherit symmetries under certain conditions. And okay, so yeah, I mean, I think the compact thing is going to be yeah. For compact three convex solutions, right? Compact, three-convex solutions, right? Great. Okay. And so the fundamental result in each of these cases, I'd like to state just for these cylinders, and then there are other results here for these bubble sheets. So this is the neck improvement theorem, and this is due to Brendel and Choi. And here's what it says. So there exists a large number L corresponding to sort of the size of your parabolic neighborhood and an epsilon 1, which tells you how close you are to the cylinder. And so if you give me a flow, a mean curvature flow in codimension 1 and a space-time point x naught. time point x naught and t naught so that if every space-time point in a parabolic neighborhood around this point, so a parabolic neighborhood at the scale of the curvature, but sort of at the scale of the curvature, the distance to the points are naturally of sort of size L. So if every point in here is on an epsilon one neck and is epsilon symmetric with epsilon With epsilon less than epsilon 1, then actually the point at the center of the parabolic neighborhood exhibits better symmetry. So epsilon over 2 symmetry. Despite the fact that you've only assumed some level of symmetry in the parabolic neighborhood, which is worse. So this result is fundamental whether you work in this sort of smooth setting. In this sort of smooth setting with curvature conditions, or whether you work in the weak setting. You need some kind of symmetry improvement result. And what it's capturing morally is if you have an ancient solution whose blowdown is already rotationally symmetric, then you don't expect to lose that symmetry as you go forward in time. You expect it to be preserved. And moreover, so now if I have a solution which is not ancient, but it exists for a very long time and it's very close to a cylinder, then I expect that the symmetry will actually improve. Expect that the symmetry will actually improve. And so, just to fix some definition, so right, just to make sure everybody's on the same page, here, an epsilon one neck means that, so just for any of these points, that in a parabolic neighborhood of some fixed size, so that this is, let's say, so a small corresponding to epsilon one, and you could fix some small. You could fix some smoothness class. So, the point is, it's a small graph over your shrinking neck. And here, this epsilon symmetry. Okay, so the idea, let me draw you a picture. So you have some neck. It's a nice enough neck. It's not quite a perfect neck. It's a small graph over maybe a perfect neck here. But then you look at sort of rotation vectors. Rotation vectors, k, around the axis of the neck, and you measure how close are these to being tangent. So we say it's epsilon symmetric if there exists, okay, let me fix, so n is just 2, so let me work in R3. So there exists a rotational vector field in R3, and so morally, right, k is just say y2 dynam. y2 dy1 minus y1 dy2 up to some ambient rotation in the space. And then what you do is you measure sort of the orthogonal component of this rotational vector field. And in the right scale, you want this to be small. And there's some other normalizing condition, but this is like natural because if this were zero, then it would tell you this rotational vector field is tangent to your flow, and that would say it's rotationally symmetric. And that would say it's rotationally symmetric with respect to this axis. So here's the cylinder, and here's MT. And I'm not sure the picture's so clear, but I hope the idea is. And I'll say more on the proof when we talk about this in higher code image. Let's see, are there any questions? Let's see, are there any questions so far? Just setting the stage. So that's the co-dimension one setting. I haven't written about it, but there are some analogous results in Ricci flow for symmetry improvement, at least in the context when you have a neck. And then, yeah. There's no progress yet in the overshield setting. Okay. Okay, so I'd like to shift gears now and switch to higher codimension mean curvature flow. And in order to set the stage, I'd like to sort of tell you three results in this setting. And then I'd like to finish by telling you that this neck improvement theorem also applies in higher codimension if you talk about symmetry improvement in the right way. So to motivate the discussion though, I want to tell you about a class of flows that has interested me. Interested me. So there's a theorem due to Ben Andrews and a student of his, Charles Baker. And here's what it says. So if you have a constant in this range 1 over n to 4 over 3n, and you start with compact initial data, but in arbitrarily high codimension, and it satisfies this pinching condition. Satisfies this pinching condition that we saw that you get out of k convexity and things like this, but for some constant c. And so here, let me let h denote the mean curvature vector as opposed to the scalar mean curvature. But so maybe I won't write it all the time, but from now on, I mean the mean curvature vector. So if it satisfies this initial condition, then the forward evolution of the flow continues to have this condition. And so these preserved conditions, so I sometimes call this sort of C-pinch flows. And so these preserved sort of conditions in higher codimension are non-trivial to find. This is one of the examples of a curvature condition. Other sort of ways to break into higher codimension mean curvature flow include studying like Lagrangian mean curvature flow or the mean curvature flow with a graph. Or the mean curvature flow with a graph condition, but this is one of the curvature conditions that has interested me. More naturally, so this is just a technical constant, but a more natural choice of c would be like 1 over n minus 1, or 1 over n minus 2, or 1 over n minus k plus 1, which we saw in the pitching condition that you get out of k convexity. So sort of corresponds to k convexity, but it's improved. Okay, and so then it turns out that you can get a bit of a kid It turns out, short story, that these flows exhibit a lot of properties that codimension one flows have. And in work from a while ago, so for a same, for again a class of constants, which is mostly just 4 over 3n, but there's some technical condition in dimensions 5, 6, and 7, so it's some other constant. But it doesn't really matter what. But it doesn't really matter what it is. The point is that for these natural choices of C, they lie within this range for a high enough dimension. So if I have one of these flows in high-dimensional Euclidean space that Andrews and Baker consider, then the blow-up limit Actually, it lies in codimension one. And so these flows that they studied, they observed in some context that they only get these codimension one spheres or codimension one cylinders as tangent flows, but actually more generally, regardless of what blow-up limit you take, you'll get a codimension one singularity model. And so, to tie it back to our discussion from earlier, this is an example of the Example of the singularity model inheriting something from the original flow. And just to advertise a little bit about the idea, I mean, maybe a lot of you have seen me talk about this before, but I just want to say a word quick on how the proof goes. So the idea is in these seed-pinched flows, you have sort of a mean convexity condition in higher codimension, and this allows you to Dimension and this allows you to define a principal unit normal. And in that case, you can decompose the full vector-valued second fundamental form as the codimension one part, or the part that you would see in codimension one, and then sort of a higher codimension component to the second fundamental form. And then this C-pinching condition can be interpreted as As a smallness condition in a suitable sense of sort of the traceless component in the traceless principal component of the second fundamental form and this higher co-dimension component of the second fundamental form. And now this is well studied in co-dimension one and this is very closely related to the symmetry results that we're talking about. It's an umbelicity estimate for the first component of the second fundamental form. And it turns out that this is a planarity estimate for This is a planarity estimate for the remainder of the flow. So, what you can show under this assumption is an estimate that resembles Huskin's roundness estimate in the case of convex codimension 1 flows. So you prove a sort of not scaling variant estimate like this. In particular, it tells you that A hat is equivalently zero on the blow-up, and this implies codension one. Code mentioned one. And so the sort of key technical component to all this is that you can look at the evolution equation of how, let me call this the planarity component of the second fundamental form. You can see how planarity is evolving along your flow at high codimension. And as you expect, there are some terms that appear that like sort of reaction terms. So all of these equations are reaction diffusion equations. And sort of you always hope diffusion. And sort of, you always hope diffusion wins, you get more symmetry and understanding, but the reaction terms want to drive it towards singularity. So there are some sub-reaction terms, but then maybe the key technical component, and maybe here's a Baukner term, there's these first-order terms that never appear in codimension one. And so this Q here is some tensor that depends on the derivative of A and the derivative of the mean. The derivative of A and the derivative of the mean curvature, and it's super nasty. And I don't have a good interpretation for it for you yet. But A hat, we're assuming, is quite small. That's what this C-pinching condition tells you. And then there's this term here, which is called torsion. This is just like if you have a space curve in R3 and you take the normal derivative of the curvature direction, then you would get something called torsion. And in higher codimension, torsion exists. And the Kodazi identity tells you that if A-hat is small, then actually torsion is small too. Then actually, torsion is small too. And that's sort of the key technical component to proving that estimate. So that all of these terms are somehow quadratically small in the evolution equation. Okay, so this is the blow-up inheriting something from the original flow, but there's also this very nice recent result by holding a mini cozy that gives us Gives us another perspective. And so here's their result. So if you have an sort of ancient solution in high codimension, so as usual, maybe the first thing you should do is work in the smooth setting and then later try remove that assumption if you can. So and the blowdown. And the blowdown is equal to a cylinder, so blowdown, and more importantly, its multiplicity one, so in a sense that means your flow is also a graph over this cylinder on a very large region. Then what they can show is that the original ancient solution of the flow actually lies in the region. Actually, it lies in a codimension one subspace. So here is an alternative viewpoint of this theorem. So this theorem is inheriting planarity from the original flow, and this theorem is inheriting planarity from the blowdown. And so planarity, the moral is that planarity is inherited. In mean curvature flow. I think that's a really interesting phenomenon, and then the question is: how far can we push this phenomenon and how can it improve our understanding of the interface between the codimension one theory of the mean curvature flow and the higher co-dimension theory of the mean curvature flow. And let me just say in words that their approach is very different. This is like Hugheskin S maximum of principle provenation. And then get some information on the blow-up. And this is what they do is they study the dimension of caloric functions of bounded growth on your ancient solution. And so the coordinate functions on any ancient solution are caloric functions, and they measure the number of linearly independent caloric functions and show that you can prove a bound for that. Okay. Any questions? Okay. Any questions before I go on? Okay. So then let's talk about neck, neck and planarity improvement. And then, so often in this discussion in higher codimension, just to Codimension, just a simplified notation, it will make sense to just work with two-dimensional flows in an ambient space of dimension 4. But the theory will work for n-dimensional flows in capital N dimension. The other theorem will work. Okay, and then let me just start with some definitions before we get to the theorem. So we have a higher codimension flow, and then in higher codimension, embeddedness isn't preserved, and multiplicity. Isn't preserved and multiplicity might be a problem. In this result, here, for example, it's important that the blowdown be multiplicity one, and that will be an important step for us, too. So again, we'll talk about an epsilon neck centered at a point, a space-time point, XT in the flow. And so it's just going to be exactly the same definition that Brendel and Choi use. So this is a small, in the sense that, you know, epsilon 1, maybe with the, in, in the class. Maybe with the in the class of C100 functions, graph over some S1 cross R sitting in R4. So shrinking. Some shrinking neck, but in the higher codimension space. That'll be my definition. So, if you have like this condition in the smooth setting for n equals 2, then you'll certainly have some region where this is true, and a quite a large region. Okay, and then since I'm working in R4, let me introduce some coordinates y1 through y4, and then let me introduce some rotation vector, just the one. Rotation vector, just the one that we saw before. Okay? And so then there are rotation vector fields, and these are going to be vector fields given by the following. So at the point Y, it's sort of a rotation. So here S is something in O4, and Q is a point in R4. A point in R4, and so it's just a normal rotation matrix, but it fixes a two-dimensional space. So there's sort of a two-dimensional axis for this, as opposed to in R3, where it actually fixes a one-dimensional affine linear subspace. So those are my rotation vector fields. And then, okay, a translation vector field, well that should be even easier. At the point y, it's just some constant vector. It's just some constant vector in F3. So you've got some unit vector field in all of R3, or R4. And so the idea is: given an embedded cylinder, a two-dimensional cylinder in R4, you certainly have both of these vector fields. You get them from one direction, which is sort of the, there's sort of a three-dimensional space containing that cylinder, and in that space you have a rotation vector field, and then there's sort of one extra direction corresponding to like how flat the cylinder is. And of course, this is in the normal bundle of the cylinder. Is in the normal bundle of the cylinder. And so then, very similarly to the definition of Brendel and Choi, so I'll say a space-time point is epsilon s, epsilon f cylindrical if on a sort of a parabolic neighborhood. A sort of a parabolic neighborhood. Again, at the scale of the curvature, maybe sometimes you work in a smaller space than the sort of the neck condition, but that's a sort of small point. So I want it to have three properties. So the first one is I want it to be epsilon s symmetric in the sense that Brendel and Choi used. So that means there exists some k rotational with this condition, which I'll now write. With this condition, which I'll now write as k per sort of normalized by the second, by the mean curvature, is less than epsilon s. And then there's again some normalizing condition, but this is the important one. And then I also want it to be epsilon f planar. And so that condition is just that this unit vector should be nearly tangent, so that rather, sorry, it should be nearly perpendicular to my flow. So I want this to be small when you take the tangent. To be small when you take the tangent projection of it. And then the last thing I want is some compatibility condition between the two of them, just as you have on the cylinder. So I want k dot omega, again with the right scale h. This is the orthogonality condition. And I'll make it less than epsilon s. And we'll see why that's important in a moment. So this is going to be my definition of epsilon s, epsilon f cylindrical. So of course, just as in the code of So of course, just as in the code of mention 1 case, being on an epsilon 1 neck tells you that you're on like an O of epsilon 1 cylindrical condition, but symmetry can improve in the presence of some fixed graph over a neck, and you can get much better, you can actually expect much better, and that's what the neck improvement theorem in codimension one says. Okay, sorry, can you explain this? I've signed up plane again. So W doesn't So W doesn't point along the axis of the cylinder, but yeah, yeah. So W should be this. So on S1 cross R, I'll have four vector fields. D theta and DZ are my tangent vector fields. DR is the radial one that corresponds to the normal of the cylinder. And then there's sort of this D4 which corresponds to like the orthogonal extra direction that you're in higher codimension. So it's present only because there's sort of an extra sort of way that the flow can be perturbed off of the cylinder. Flow can be perturbed off of the cylinder. And so I want this guy to be orthogonal everywhere, and that would correspond to the normal bundle of my flow having some orthogonal unit vector field. So if you have a unit vector field in the ambient space, which is orthogonal to your flow, that says precisely the coordinate is constant on your flow in your planar, is the idea. Right. Does that answer? Yeah, thanks. Yep. Okay, so here's, and then here's the. Okay, so here's the theorem. How am I doing all the time? So it will look very similar. There exists a constant epsilon 1 measuring how close you are to this cylinder, and there's a big constant L corresponding to sort of how big a parabolic neighborhood you are close to it on. So that, let me just state it in the n-dimensional setting, but we'll go back to this two-dimensional setting. So that if you have a high co-dimension mean curvature flow, Codimension mean curvature flow and a space-time point. And if all of your points in this parabolic neighborhood sort of are epsilon one neck-like and epsilon F epsilon, well, which way did I write it? Epsilon S? I guess the order matters. Cylindrical. And with, so with here, I may have. With here, one one sort of I made a sort of assumption here that this one I chose to be epsilon s, and it also comes up in the proof. So I want the measure of flatness to be smaller than the measure of sort of symmetry, and I want this to be smaller than the threshold of the neck. So if I have all of those, then actually the cylindricality of the point at the center of the parabolic neighborhood improves. And so again, what this theorem exhibits in the context of the two theorems we saw before is that we really expect planarity to improve along the flow in higher codimension, especially when you're next to one of these cylinders. And then I think it's a very interesting question to what extent you can expect it to improve over other objects like the bowls and translators that we've been discussing. Discussing. Okay, so that's the theorem. Are there any questions before I talk about the proof a little bit? Okay. And then let me just say a word here. And then let me just say a word here as to why one should expect flatness to be sort of better than the symmetry condition. So the idea is the closer you are to being planar, you should recover the theorem of Brendel and Choi, right? That already works in codimension one. So you just want your sort of planarity to be better than your symmetry condition on a neck. If you let the symmetry condition go to zero, but you don't have the flatness, then it sort of messes up the role. And it sort of messes up the role of this rotational vector field telling you that you're actually symmetric within some three-dimensional subspace. It wouldn't necessarily say that, so you kind of want the flatness to be better. Okay, okay, so let me do as I guess I just had it here. Let me write the tangent space of the cylinder as, say, d theta dz. So let's choose coordinates on our cylinder where those that are in. Choose coordinates on our cylinder where those vectors are in the ambient space where those vector fields are tangent, and then we can write the normal bundle of our cylinder as sort of this fourth direction in R4, and then the usual radial vector in the first three coordinates corresponding to the normal on the cylinder. Okay, and then so I want to tell you about sort of four steps in proving this theorem, and they really. Steps in proving this theorem, and they really have analogs in the codimension one case with the caveat that there's like a little bit extra to keep track of because you're also trying to improve this flatness condition. So, in the first step, so the sort of symmetry condition I've written down is some local condition, right? But the idea is these vector fields will satisfy, especially if they're quite small, they'll be quite close to solutions of the linearized. Close to solutions of the linearized flow, but in order to get improvement, I want to study the linearized flow on a large parabolic neighborhood, and then I can expect it to improve as time goes on. So I need some, in the Ricci flow, what you need to do is you need to patch all these vector fields together, but in the ambient space, what it tells you is sort of like if all of these points are on epsilon one next, then, and they have some symmetry, then the vector fields that are a measure of that symmetry can't really differ except by the choice of the axis. The choice of the axis. And so, okay. You can find ambient vector fields, k bar and omega bar, and then, like, without loss of generality, you can even choose them to be the rotation vector field over the cylinder on which you're a graph, and sort of the extra-normal vector field over the cylinder. And moreover, so So each of the vector fields measuring symmetry around any of the points in your parabolic neighborhood will differ from the vector field that you've chosen by some small, but I mean you've introduced some error, some small constant, though. And sort of this last condition that, well, actually And sort of this last condition that, well, actually, because I can normalize them, I can assume that these sort of vector fields are orthogonal. So you can find some vector fields which satisfy this. This is for all points in the parabolic neighborhood around the center point that I'm interested in, but here, sort of on a large parabolic neighborhood. And then, moreover, what I was telling you about. What I was telling you a little bit earlier is that, like, so if you if you look at the difference, say, projected to the rate, the normal vector to the cylinder, if you look at the difference of these two vector fields and then take the perpendicular and look at it sort of in the normal to the cylinder direction, then these will actually agree to a much better To a much smaller, they'll agree a lot larger than you have over there. But the only difference is you have to sort of adjust the axis of one of the two rotational vector fields. So I think if you've seen this before, then you'll know what these terms mean. And if you haven't, then the way you should think about this is that the rotational vector field measuring similar. That the rotational vector field measuring symmetry at the point x and t in this parabolic neighborhood here has an axis, and the sort of vector field I've chosen in the whole parabolic neighborhood has an axis, and those might differ, but if you account for that difference in those axes, then actually you get some sort of better measure of symmetry. So this is just an example. But okay, I still have a lot of error here. I still have a lot of error here. What I would really like is, so for the, so this holds near x and t for that guy, but what I would like to do is find a vector field near x0 and t0, which satisfies these conditions, but with epsilon s and epsilon f replaced by 2. Now this is just an example. I don't want to write them all, but you have these ambient guys, and then up to some choice of axis around each point in your parabolic neighborhood, you have good symmetry, but you've introduced some error. Good symmetry, but you've introduced some error and constant, and actually, we can expect that to improve. Okay. Right, so we assume that this is small, so I guess maybe I should write this as like k bar per dr minus this stuff is small. And these A naught, A1, B naught, and B1, they depend on. In B1s, they depend on the particular point x and t, but the goal is to sort of find sort of vector fields that don't. Okay. Okay, so the first step is to choose these vector fields in the large parabolic neighborhood, which satisfy some symmetry, but not quite as good a symmetry condition near each of the points. And then the second step is to study how this evolves along the flow. So, right, in codimensional. In co-dimension one, let's see, I have about five or ten minutes. You can go a bit louder than the start of later. Okay, okay, great. So, in co-dimension one, what you do is you only study sort of this term. So, in co-dimension one, you look at this function, k dot nu, or in other words, k dot dr, and this guy satisfies the linearized flow, and you look at the evolves, but in a higher codimension, you'll have a lot more sort of terms. So, here's what I want. Here's what I want to do. What you do then is you take your ambient vector fields, let me call them this, and let's write them down in their components. So we could write this as in each of the components on the cylinder. So ur uz dz plus, let me write it as r to the negative 2, u theta, d theta, and then u4 d4. And you can write down something similar here for v. Okay, and then the goal is to study how these components, which this component here is the only one that you study in co-dimension one, but there are more components that are worthwhile in higher co-dimension, and you study sort of which of these are small, and those that are not small, how do they evolve along the mean curvature flow? And it turns out some of them are already quadratically small. So this term, this term, this term. This term, this term, this term, and this term sort of corresponding to whether you're taking some guy who should be orthogonal and dotting it in a tangent direction, or you're taking some guy who should be tangent and dotting it in a orthogonal direction. Actually, I guess I should flip that. You'll get already quadratic smallness, but what it leaves you is four components that you should study the linearized flow over and see how those evolve. And in fact, two of them are the same. So because of our normalization condition over there, sort of Condition over there, sort of u4 is the same as v theta, actually, I guess up to a sine. So you really have to study only three components in this setting. And then the second step is to, well, we want to compute the evolution equation of these things. And so I'll just write it down for you what it looks like. So if you look at the evolution of this thing, This is the analog of like the if you wrote this in codimension one and you accounted for the normal, this would just be the Jacobi equation over the over the flow, but it's a vector field so it introduces some extra terms. And okay, so there's also some normal derivative term. Maybe it looks like something like that. And then, of course, there's also a slightly more complicated evolution equation for v. Evolution equation for V. So let's see. Well, actually, it doesn't matter too much what it is. Okay, but the idea is: if you then take a look at these vector fields and you move them, pull them back to the cylinder and look at the components, then what you expect is to get evolution equations as follows. So I guess in dimension two, it'll be something like this. This. So this will be small of order epsilon 1 times epsilon s, but quadratically small. And then these other two, these other two new components that aren't present in codimension one but are present in higher co-dimension, so they actually are just solutions of the heat equation. And So it looks like U4. And actually, this one you can assume, so is small of order epsilon f because of the relationship between the two of them here. And then, okay, similar thing here. Vz is small. Okay, and so this is sort of to be expected because you expect the coordinate functions of your flow in higher codimension to just be solutions of the heat equation, whereas you expect Whereas you expect sort of the orthogonal component of a rotational vector field also corresponding to a symmetry to be a solution of the Jacobi equation. And so this one was already studied by Brendel and Choi. And with this improved condition of symmetry, they can show that, draw you the picture. So maybe this was the second step, and then the sort of third step is to use separation. Separation of variables and then study mode decay. And so I think Orr made this point the other day that when you have an ancient solution and you have an elliptic or parabolic operator for the linearized flow and you look at the eigenvalues of this flow, you only expect, so you expect modes which sort of which decay forward in time, would grow backwards in time, and that rules out the presence of modes going all the way back in time. Of modes going all the way back in time as far as domination goes. And so here we have a large parabolic neighborhood. If the parabolic neighborhood is large enough, then the modes which decay should decay hopefully before you get to your smaller parabolic neighborhood. So the idea is this picture, I have some X naught, some T0, and then some large parabolic neighborhood. And what one can hope for is that the symmetry of Of these components, or like sort of how small these components are, improves up to, as over there, a choice of axis. So, this difference here, this will actually be small of epsilon s plus S plus some big constant error introduced for moving it over to the cylinder. Okay, and then similarly, so let me say in words what each of these modes that don't decay under the evolution equation mean. So the fact that you have A0 and B0 times cosine theta and sine theta, that's like positioning your axis within the three space of the cylinder, and A1Z, B1Z, sine theta, that's tilting the axis within the three space. That's tilting the axis within the three space. But now I'm in a higher codimension, so the only thing that I can expect to happen in the presence of one of these additional vector fields is I should also be able to move the three space over which I'm a graph, and I should be able to tilt the axis. And that's exactly what happens. So if you track these other components, sort of U4 and VZ, you'll get exactly that. So U4, so Z is going to play the role, is going to be replaced by time here, but it's going to be like some. But it's going to be like some c0 cosine theta c1 sine theta times minus t to the negative 1 half. And this will also be order sort of small, but of order epsilon f. So order, yeah, l to the minus 1 half. Okay, and now I'm out of space, but there's a similar one here for VZ, and Vz is just going to differ by a single constant, capital D. Single constant, capital D. That's just translation in the space sort of defined by D4, and then this is tilting within the space defined by D4. Okay, and since I'm just out of time, okay, the last step, as in the Rendel-Choi proof, is to find the right axis. So now I'm in this small parabolic neighborhood. I've got this improved symmetry for each of these components in this region up to tilting the axis in the whole M. Tilting the axis in the whole ambient space. And so, okay, just in words, the last step in the proof sort of is to find k tilde and omega tilde using these constants a0, a1, da, da, da, da, and the original value. And that just corresponds to finding the right axis. And so, okay. I'll end by saying, so now the next questions are, so flatness improves in higher coding. So flatness improves in higher codimension. That's certainly true as long as you're close to flat. The question is: how can we push this beyond either the cylindrical regions? How can we push it from these cylindrical regions into cap regions, which has seen a lot of success in Codimension 1? And then sort of another step, I only have proven this in the case over of a neck, but certainly following work of genes as you, you could expect it to work over bubble sheets or more general cylinders, and it kind of gives a local result. Cylinders, and it kind of gives the local result of the result of holding it in a cozy, and one expects it to work over any cylinder in any co-dimension. So somebody should write that down, I guess, if it will be useful. Yeah, I don't know. Okay, thank you for your attention. Are there questions for Catan? I see you alluded to a little bit, but uh as far as I know, But as far as I know, so this net improvement was only used in the context of ancient flows, right? So far in Skodimension 1, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Whereas you sort of, by calling it quadru, you already know it's codimension. So do you have any application in mind in which you use it for non-ancient flow? Well, no, the hope would be that you can do it in sort of the ancient flow setting without the smoothness assumption, or that you can. So, that you can, maybe you could also say something prior to singularity formation. I mean, maybe, but no, I think the first application would be do it in the ancient setting, but like give an alternative approach. I mean, another thing to keep in mind, right, is that like, so when you're classifying these ancient solutions, there might be, their assumption is you have a multiplicity one blowdown, but maybe you can also assume, like, okay, it's not multiplicity one, but it's graphical. Multiplicity would be one, but it's graph. If there is a cylinder over which some region in the immersed setting is a graph, maybe you can also talk about planarity proving in that context. But yeah, for now, ancient solutions, maybe get rid of the smoothness assumption. Thanks. Another question from the underlying audience? So Coda mentioned one, there was both a neck improvement and a cap improvement. Is there also some cap improvement? Not yet, but that's the question, I think, to Orr's point. Yeah. So the cap improvement can be done in two ways, right? You can either assume some curvature positivity conditions that we have some idea of what those might be in higher co-dimension and use the maximum principle, or you could hope to adapt this moving plane method, but that's going to be difficult. But morally, you're close to co-dimension one, so maybe there's So maybe there's a way to push it, but other questions? There might be a somewhat more philosophical question. So for Ricci flow, there is not really codimension one and higher codimension. But does this give any newer insight on Ricci flow? It's an interesting question. I don't know, but I think No, I I don't know. But I think I think morally the Ricci flow is closer to the higher codimension mean curvature flow. Um but no I don't know the analog of planarity improving yet in the Ricci flow. I mean yeah I don't know how to measure non-planarity but maybe there's a way of sorting singularity models in Ricci flow where some are embeddable because of their rotational symmetry in codimension one and some of them aren't. And if that's true then maybe there's some notion of planarity. If that's true, then maybe there's some notion of planarity. Good. Any other questions? Okay, if not, let's thank Hidden again.
