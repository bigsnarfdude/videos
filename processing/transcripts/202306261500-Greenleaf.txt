Okay, I'd like to start by thanking the organizers for putting on this very nice conference. Okay, so this is going to be at the model theoretical end of model-driven medical imaging. So this is some work that I did a few years ago with Matteo and some other people I will mention in a moment. There'll be a twist at the end, which is a recent idea, which is still work in progress. So this is work with Matiolasis, Mateo Santa Cazaria. Matilasis, Mateo Centrifazaria, Samuel Sultanen, and Guthruman. Now, there is this problem with acrobat if I'm not. Not if it's in full screen mode. Oh, okay. Okay. Great. All right. Okay. So this involves electrical pediatric. So I think this audience knows the story, but let me just say a few words. So we're imaging the electrical connectivity within a body, which we assume is scalar value, doing non-invasive voltage and current measurements of the boundary. Voltsh and Curt measurements of the boundary of the object. And because this is based on Calderon's inverse conductivity problem, which is very badly ill-posed, there are lots of problems with this in practice, including the logarithmic stability that Matteo mentioned. So one way of trying to improve things in the real world is to couple this with another kind of physics. So in general, with hybrid imaging or multi-physics imaging, you combine. Multi-physics imaging, you combine one modality, which is typically high contrast sensitivity, with another modality, which is typically high resolution. So you use one for measurement and one for the illumination. And these have to be linked by a physical coupling. So what I'll be describing is something where, in fact, there isn't a second kind of physics, but rather a fair amount of mathematics. So we call this virtual hybrid edge detection. Virtual hybrid edge detection, and the meaning of virtual will come out in a few minutes. So, this exploits a PDE structure which has been known to be the basis of the Cauldron problem for a very long time, going back to the original work of Sylvester Ullman in the 80s. And this is what's called complex principal type operator geometry. Okay, so rather than coupling EIT to a second kind of physics, working For second kind of physics, working just in R2, we take the CGO solutions that were used by Astla and Pavarenta to prove uniqueness in the Cauldron problem for L-infinity connectivities. Those solutions were modified by Untanen and Paramecki in a way that was very useful for computation. So we take those CGO solutions and we add to them some micro-local analysis, some complex analysis, and some ideas, and it creates a Born series. And it creates a Born series. And the first term in this Born series is the Born approximation. And that is the basis for this virtual hybrid edge detection. Okay, so I want to describe this in some detail and then at the very end talk about a possible cubic correction where a higher order term in the Born series may prove to be useful. Although that's still conjectural at this point. Okay, so one of my Okay, so one possible application of the bee head is what we call inclusions within inclusions. So, a typical example of this would be: you have the human skull, the bone is very low conductivity, and inside of it, you have regions where you would be are interested in the conductivity being either high or low. So, for example, for stroke diagnosis, you can either have a blood clot or an ischemic stroke, where there's a region in the brain which has insufficient blood. Which is insufficient blood, which means it's going to be low in conductivity. Or you could have a hemorrhagic stroke where you have a brain bleed and there's an area, a region with more blood than there should be, and therefore it's high in connectivity. And so you're trying to make a binary decision inside the skull, which is essentially an obstacle to EIT imaging: is there a large region with low connectivity or high conductivity? So you're not trying. Conductivity. So you're not trying to produce a super high-resolution image, you're just trying to make a binary decision. Okay, now there's work that followed our work by Agnely, Cole, Matilasis, Josh Miamurti, Mateo, and Samu, which took the, as the training set, output from the method that I will describe rather than raw EIT data and built a neural network on that. A neural network on that, and that seemed to produce very good reliability for making this binary decision. And in fact, Rashmi is going to talk about this on Thursday. So, this will be providing some background for that. Okay, if you were able to do this, this would have a possible useful application of being able to monitor someone in real time. So, in terms of actually making a diagnosis, if somebody is exhibiting stroke-like symptoms, are they having Symptoms: Are they having an ischemic stroke or a hemorrhagic stroke or neither? That actually can be done these days, actually, at least in the U.S., in an ambulance. There are special ambulances that look more like armored trucks. They're rather big, and they have little CT scanners in them. And so, when the person is put into the ambulance, they can do a diagnosis. However, if you then have somebody who's admitted to the hospital and needs to be monitored continuously, Monitored continuously, you can't do that for various reasons with either CT or MRI, and therefore this could possibly be an application of V-HED. Okay, so let's do some of the Ostlov-Havarenta CGO solutions and their modifications. So we're just working in two dimensions. So a bunch of notations. So omega is the region that we're interested in imaging the conductivity inside of, and it's the boundary of Connectivity inside of, and it's the boundary of omega. We will be making the voltage and current measurements. We will denote points in the complex plane by either z or x plus iy. Same thing for the frequency variable c eta or zeta. Sigma will be an L infinity connectivity bounded above and below by positive constants. As is often the case, we will assume that sigma is identically equal to one near the boundary of omega, extended to be one on all of R2. It to be one on all of R2. And then you can also do the same thing with the sigma inverse. If sigma satisfies these conditions, sigma inverse will as well with different constants, of course. Okay, so Aston-Pavarenti consider two simultaneously two connectivity equations. Using the connectivity sigma, you look at a solution U1. This is in the absence of sources and sinks. Absence of sources and sinks. With the asymptotic behavior, the U1 looks like e to the ikz. So here, k is a complex number which encodes the frequency for the CGO solution. So in the direction of z going to infinity in the direction of k bar, this product will be real, and you have essentially a Fourier mode behavior. But in the direction i plus or minus i k bar, this function. This function here will be either exponentially growing or decaying. So here we have our exponentially growing function times one plus big O of one over Z. So that's a classic CGO solution. And you also do the same thing for the connectivity one over sigma. And that gives you a solution u2. Okay, so now you convert this to a first-order problem where you can use complex analysis. So you define mu, the so-called You define μ, the so-called Beltrami multiplier associated to sigma, it's simply 1 minus sigma over 1 plus sigma. And because of our assumptions on sigma, that sigma is bounded above and below by positive constants, mu is, which is row valued, mu is bounded in absolute value by 1 minus epsilon for some epsilon bigger than 0. You can do the same thing for sigma inverse. And the Beltramian multiplier for sigma inverse is simply the negative. For sigma inverse is simply the negative of the Beltrami multiplier for sigma. And now you look for CGO solutions, CGO style solutions, which we'll call F sub mu of the following Beltrami equation. So d and d bar are the standard differential operators in the complex plane. So you want d bar in the z variable. k is a parameter at the moment. d bar of f mu should be mu times d of f bar. times D of F bar. And again, you're looking for a CGO style solution. So e to the ikz times 1 plus a correction term omega superscript plus, which is decaying at infinity. You can do that for mu and you can also do it for minus mu. And so we get two correction terms omega plus or minus. And so Astla and Pavarunto showed that in fact both omega plus and minus can be computed. Plus and minus can be computed from the Dirichlet-ton-Neumann data for sigma. So if you have perfect knowledge of F mu and F minus mu, it's the same thing as knowing mu1 and u2. And so now we're going to look at one of these omegas. So let's say omega plus will simply denote by omega. The other one, omega minus, will have a reappearance in a few minutes. Okay, so it suffices to understand. Okay, so it suffices to understand these CGO solutions in order to solve the original problem. Okay, now, something implicit in the paper of Astan Pavarinta, which was then exploited by Boutani and Paramechi a few years later, is the following related solutions, which are computationally efficient. So, the previous solutions, like all CGO solutions, are exponentially growing, which means once the complex frequency gets even moderately large, you have a Large, you have a very large range and amplitude for the solutions, they're hard to deal with numerically. This gets around that problem. So, now what we do is we form these functions we'll call e sub k of z for each complex number k. And that's simply what it says here. And that's the same thing as e to the i 2 real part of k z. So, this now is a for a mode in the plane. Its absolute value is identically one. And if you do this for negative k, you simply get e k bar. Okay, now some notation. We're going to form two auxiliary functions from mu, the ultramarine multiplier, and these ek's. So beta of zk is going to simply be mu of z multiplied by e to the minus k. So it's a highly oscillatory version of mu. And alpha is almost the same thing, but you multiply in front by negative i. multiply in front by negative i k bar. So that has a growth in k built into it. A few more things we need from complex analysis are the solid Cauchy and Berlin transforms. So the solid Cauchy transform P is simply the fundamental solutional Green's function for d bar. It's convolution with one over pi z. So that's a fractional integral operator in the plane. It's smoothing of order one. Well the Berlin operator S is the principle operator s is the principal value of convolution with one over pi z squared and that intertwines d and d bar up here so it's a zeroth order style okay then you do some algebraic definitions you let u be negative del of omega bar because of our um the results of aspirin pavarento we know that belongs to l p we let omega be negative p of u bar and del negative p of u bar and del of omega is negative s u bar. In any case, we reduce the Beltrami equation from the previous slide to this equation here, one prime, which is identity plus a rho of u equals negative alpha bar. What is rho? Rho is still the complex conjugation, thought of as an operator. And A is a linear combination of the Cauchy and Berlin transforms, but post-multiplied by multiplication by alpha. Multiplied by multiplication by alpha, which has that factor of k bar in it, and multiplication by beta, which is simply multiplication by the exponential. So this is some operator which both involves with the fundamental solution of d bar or the Berlin transform and then post-multiplies by things that are highly oscillatory. Okay, so this equation one prime here. So this equation one prime here has a negative alpha bar on the right-hand side isn't in homogeneity. So an obvious thing to do is to form a Neumann series for this, and that gives rise to the Born series that I referred to earlier. So you expand U as a sum from one to infinity, a formal sum of Un, U1 plus U2, and so on, where U1 is simply that right-hand inhomogeneity negative alpha bar. negative alpha bar and recursively u n plus one is simply negative a u n bar that's the the normal series and the corresponding omega is negative p of u bar so that becomes an infinite sum as well omega one plus omega two plus omega three and so on okay so u n and omega n are n linear in mu so mu remember the Beltramian multiplier is a weakly non-linear Is a weakly non-linear version of sigma. It's simply one minus sigma over one plus sigma. So in mu, these are n-linear. They're sums of two to the n minus one terms, and they, in some sense, encode the n-fold scattering that's implicit in that Beltrami equation. And so let's focus on the first three terms involving omega 1, omega 2, and omega 3. So omega 1 is p applied to. One is p applied to alpha, omega two is this sum here, and omega three is this sum here, which we'll get to at the end. Okay, so let me give a brief overview of the leading term omega 1, which is really the born approximation in this approach to EIT. Talk about it briefly, talk briefly about the higher order terms, and then come back and talk about omega 1 in more detail. So, first of all, So, first of all, our basic transformation is that we're going to take the complex frequency k, and we're going to simply expand it in polar coordinates as tau times e to the i phi, where e to the i phi lies in the unit circle, and tau is real. And then we're going to take a partial Fourier transform in tau. So we're going to convert omega 1, which is a function of z and k. We're going to turn it to a function of z. We're going to turn into a function of z and t and e to the i phi. And when you do that, it turns out that the leading term, omega 1 tilde, is in fact a generalized round transform of mu, which means in terms of the connectivity sigma, it's a weakly non-linear generalized round transform. So it's relatively easy to understand and has good inversion properties. Now, for fixed z-naught on the boundary, if you fixed z naught on the boundary if you simply evaluate omega one at z equals z zero it turns out that the information that contains is essentially independent of z naught which is a rather strange situation but but that again is a reflection of the complex principal type structure of this problem so it turns out that omega one at z naught is essentially um is similar to the standard branch transform and therefore determines the singularities of mu and therefore Of μ and therefore determines the singularities of sigma in the same way that the Radon transform does. However, there are certain artifacts due to the symbol of this operator. And it turns out by the magic of Cauchy's theorem that integration over the boundary, varying z naught over the boundary and doing a complex line integral, in fact, removes these artifacts from the symbol, which result from the symbol having a From this symbol having a large amplitude and a large gradient. So, complex analysis comes to the rescue. Let me briefly say something about the higher terms before I go back to omega 1. So, we have some general results about all the higher terms. So, in particular, we can control the wavefront sets of all of the omega n tildes in terms of the wavefront set of mu and therefore sigma. However, these wavefront sets of omega n tilde get bigger and bigger and bigger. Totally get bigger and bigger and bigger, more complicated. We can say something about them. We have some operator theory for omega 2 and omega 3. So if we make the prior assumption, and I'll get back to this at the end, if we assume that sigma and therefore mu is piecewise smooth with jumps over interfaces which have positive curvature, which is a fairly artificial assumption, but it makes some of the micro-local analysis better. If that's the case, then us better. If that's the case, then in fact we can describe omega 2 tilde and omega 3 tilde very precisely in terms of certain existing spaces in micro-local analysis, which means they have nice oscillatory representations, but it's a pretty strong assumption. And then there's an important symmetry property, which is that you can get rid of all the even order terms. Even order terms are bad because they all have a very strong artifact at A very strong artifact at t equals zero. And the artifact at t equals zero is so strong that it really interferes with the numerics that we're really interested in. So you can simply symmetrize by replacing omega with one half omega plus minus omega minus, and that wipes out the even terms. And that's really what we can work with. And since Asta and Pavarento showed that both omega plus and omega minus can be extracted from the Dirichlet. Be extracted from the Diersley to Neumann data, this is realistic. So, in fact, omega 2 we don't need to worry about. Okay, so let's go back to omega 1. So, omega 1 was P of alpha, where P is the solid Cauchy transform. And writing that down, that's an integral over the complex plane in Z space. So, let me call it Z prime space. So you have mu of Z prime integrated against two-dimensional Lebesgue measure, which is what dimensional Lebesgue measure, which is what this superscript means. You have the kernel of the Cauchy operator, the one over z minus z prime. You have e to the i2 real part kz prime. That's the e minus k. And then you multiply by i k in front. So we're going to do polar coordinates in k. So we write k as tau times e to the i phi. And then we perform a partial Fourier. And then we perform a partial Fourier transform, leaving the e to the i phi alone, but converting tau to a variable t. Now, since tau is the radial component of a frequency variable, whatever t is, it's sort of dual in some sense to part of a frequency variable. It's reasonable to think of it as a spatial or a temporal variable. And we like to think of it as sort of a time variable, but it's not a physical time variable, so we call it virtual time, hence the name of virtual. Hence the name of virtual hybrid edge detection. Okay, so you do the calculation of this partial Fourier transform. So omega 1 tilde at zt e to the i phi. You do a calculation here. And what happens is that the e to the negative i t tau from the partial Fourier transform combines with the exponential that's already built into omega 1, and you get e to the negative i tau t minus minus two real part of e to the i phi times z prime. But in front of it, you had an ik, and i k is i e to the i phi times tau. So that includes an i tau. And when you do Fourier inversion, i tau times this exponential integrated d tau, that turns into the derivative of the delta function at zero. So putting this all together, this becomes an integral over the complex plane. becomes an integral over the complex plane mu of z prime. There is this factor one over z minus z prime that I'll get to in a second. And then it's being multiplied by the distribution, the derivative of the delta function, delta prime evaluated at t minus two real part at e to the i phi z prime. Now as t runs over the real numbers and e to the i phi runs over the circle, this runs over all the lines in R2. In R2. Any line in R2 can be described as this thing equaling some number. So this is giving you the values of not of delta of this integrated against mu, which would give you the Radon transform. This gives you a more singular version, one derivative of the Radon transform, essentially. But there's also this weight here, one over Z minus Z prime. Okay, so let's recall our assumptions. So let's recall our assumptions. We're assuming that sigma is L infinity, identically equal to one near omega, near omega's boundary. Therefore, mu is identically zero near the boundary of omega and zero with an extension outside. So let's call the support of mu, let's call that, let's say it's contained in omega zero, where omega zero is compactly contained in omega. So now we can define an operator from distributions of compact support on this smaller subdomain omega. On this smaller subdomain omega zero to distributions on complex plane in the Z variable cross R in the T variable cross S1 in the e to the I phi variable and simply given by this omega one total at Z T e to the I phi. We're calling that T1. So the Schwarz kernel of T1 is this delta prime on this thing here, on this line. On this line, multiply by this factor in front, and that first factor is in fact smooth, despite its appearance, because if z prime is in the interior omega zero and z is not an omega zero, meaning it's on the boundary of omega or further out, then in fact this denominator here is not equal to zero. So this factor in front is in fact smooth. Now, if z prime is a point in omega zero, which is point in omega zero which is relatively close to the point z on the boundary of omega they're not equal but they're close to each other then this factor here is still large and has a large gradient and that causes artifacts coming from the symbol as we'll see okay so t1 is a generalized radio transform generalized because it's although it's integrating over the standard collection of all lines in r2 it's using the derivative of the delta function Derivative of the delta function and it has this weight thrown in as well. Now, generalized Radiant transforms can be analyzed as Fourier integral operators, which are a special example of. And so we're going to use that micro-local point of view. So if you write all these things down, then T1 is in fact an FIO of order zero in hormones notation associated to a canonical relation, which I'll call C0, and C0 is contained in T. is contained in t star of complex plane cross r cross s1 cross t star of omega 0. And the important thing here is that the geometry is independent of z. Z really doesn't appear in this expression in any important way. It occurs over here, but it doesn't occur over on the right-hand side. So the amplitude from the expression on the previous slide depends on z, but the geometry doesn't. But the geometry doesn't. Now, this operator t1 is over-determined. It takes a function on c, a function of two variables, and turns into a function on this space here, which has four variables. So, of course, when you have an overdetermined transform, it's natural to look at slices. So, we're going to slice this by fixing z equals z naught, a point on the boundary, a measurement point on the boundary. And that forms a determined version of T1, which we'll call T1 Z naught. call t1 z naught so this is simply evaluating t1 at z equals z naught so now if you do that you have a determined operator it goes from functions on omega zero which is two-dimensional to functions on the cylinder r cross s1 right so t1z0 is a weighted and differentiated version of the standard radon transform on r2 but it's one derivative more singular than the standard radon transform Than the standard Radon transform, but it's associated to the same canonical relation, which is well known to be a canonical graph, which means that it's good for inversion. But again, although C is independent of Z naught, the symbol is not. So here's the symbol of T1 and Z naught. So the fact that you have a tau to the one half here rather than a tau to the minus a half, that's because this is one derivative more singular than the Standard Radon transform. And the factor one over Z naught minus Z prime, although it's smooth because Z naught is on the boundary and Z prime is in the interior, it does decay linearly in the distance. And so this gives you a fall off in detectability as you move away from the measurement point. And also, there is these artifacts that appear, as we'll see in a second, because this symbol can be quite. Because this symbol can be quite large when Z prime is close to Z zero and the gradient is larger. So here's a simple example. So here we have an inclusion. So blue here, it's constant connectivity one. The red dot is constant connectivity five. And if you look at Z naught, I guess is the point over here in the boundary, 0.10. 0.10. In this graph here, the horizontal axis is phi, or part of the circle is phi measured in degrees, and the vertical axis is t, and you get this rather odd banding phenomenon. And if you apply a standard back projection algorithm for Reynolds transform to this data, you get a horrible picture. Now, hidden in this picture is in fact that inclusion indicating that there is a singularity there, but it's very hard to see numerically. To see numerically. So we'll see how to get around that. Namely, supposing we take an average around the boundary of omega. So for each Z naught on the boundary of omega, we do what I just said. And now you form a, you pick your favorite complex valued weight function A on the boundary. And you form what I'll call omega one tilde superscript A, which is the linear superposition of all the omega. superposition of all the omega ones at z naught but weighted by a of z naught and then integrated dz naught and this is important the dz naught is the complex line integral right not with respect to arc length but with respect to complex line integration and we let t1a be this operator so it's simply doing a linear superposition via complex line integration okay so it turns out that this is just like each one of the This is just like each one of the T1Z naughts. This is an FiO of order one-half associated to the same canonical relation, which is the same one as for the Radon transform. T1A star T1A, back projection, is a psi DO order one on omega zero. And its principal symbol, do a little calculation, it turns out that by the Cauchy integral formula, it turns out to be a constant times the absolute value of what I'll call alpha. absolute value of what I'll call alpha squared times zeta prime, where zeta prime is dual to z prime, and where alpha is the Cauchy line integral of a. This is the standard thing from complex analysis. So in particular, if you choose a to be a constant, say one over square root of two, to make things work out nicely, then when you do this, t1a star t1a is simply equal to a constant, namely the constant one, times minus Laplace. Times minus Laplacian square root, so you're standard side O of order one, modulo an operator of order zero because we're using the calculus of side EOs. Now notice that if you use this constant, this is not an average because the complex line integral of A is zero. So this is what you're really doing is in some sense, you're unwinding the phase as you're doing this superposition. But in any case, it works. Works. And so, with this formula, this gives you sort of a local tomography type of imaging of μ and therefore σ, which is good for detection of singularities. So singularities of the data that you have manipulated by taking this partial Fourier transform in the radial direction of k, singularities in that determine singularities of the Lotromi multiplier and therefore the conductivity. And therefore, the connectivity. So, this is good for locating positions of jumps and also signs of jumps. Is it jumping up or is it jumping down, which is important for this application to stroke diagnosis? As you go through the skull, right, the skull was low connectivity, you come out the other side, connectivity jumps up. But then, when you hit this suspect region, does the connectivity go down or up? That's really all we want to know instead of using. Instead of using the calculus of side EOs, you can just use harmonic analysis and you can write down an explicit, exact back projection operator formula. Okay, so here's an example of how that works. So here is, here are two numerical stroke phantoms. So in both of these, the outer circle, which is blue, is the skull, which is low connectivity. You move past it and you get relatively higher connectivity. It and you get relatively higher connectivity. And now, on the left side here, this oddly shaped phantom that's supposed to be an ischemic stroke, a region of low connectivity because it's been deprived of blood. Well, over here on the right side, the same shape is given a higher connectivity, denoting a hemorrhage. So, if you use the technique that has been described in the last few slides, taking, I think, 128 sampling points, xenon. 128 sampling points z nod around the boundary, doing this comp a discrete approximation to the complex line integral, you get these pictures. Now, as with all EIT pictures, these are very fuzzy, but you can clearly see that the one on the left, you have a region of low connectivity, and the one on the right, you have a region of high connectivity. So ischemic stroke here, hemorrhagic stroke there. Okay, now this set of calculations has used as Of calculations has used as the basis for this neural net by Matteo and Rashmi and so on. So she'll be talking about that on Thursday. Okay, so just to conclude, we can ask the following. So T1 is the Born approximation. It's the first term in the Born series. So you can ask, can the higher Born series terms help at all? Now, as I said, by taking one half omega plus minus omega minus, you kill off the even term. omega minus you kill off the even terms and so the next term of interest would be omega three tilde so omega three tilde either at z naught or integrated around the boundary it'd be handled in the same way basically that is a trilinear form of mu mu and mu right and it turns out to be a sum of four terms and this goes back to that expression i had a number of slides back where omega three it was a sum of four terms which were super Terms which were superpositions of compositions where you either applied P or S, the Cauchy or Berlin transform, and you multiply it by either alpha or beta. So you get a sum of four terms, each of which is three copies of mu, mu of z1, mu of z2, mu of z3, integrated over three-dimensional complex space, but really integrated over omega zero across itself three times against the curl function. Against the kernel function, so this kernel is a function of eight variables, t, e to the i phi, and the zj's. And what do these things look like? Well, the kernel function has a derivative of the delta function. For omega one total, we just had one derivative. Here, the number of derivatives can be one, two, or three. So this can be as singular as three times a delta function. What is it a delta function of? It's a delta function of t minus two real parts. t minus two real part of e to the i phi and now we have an alternating sum z1 minus z2 plus z3 right and in some sense that's encapsulating the third order scattering for this beltrami equation so we have derivatives of delta functions on the this surface and then we have that multiplied by a couple of expressions which didn't occur for omega one which is z1 minus Which is z1 minus z2 to either negative 1 or negative 2, and z2 minus z3 bar to negative 1 or negative 2. So these are really the kernels of either P or S. And for omega 1, the only one that occurred was Z0 minus Z1, and that you could take out as a smooth factor. But here, these are singular. It can be that Z1 can be equal to Z2, and this could be 0. Z2 and this could be zero, or Z2 can be equal to Z3, this can be zero. So this actually is a generalized round transform for multiple reasons. It has this defining function up here within the delta functions, which is for some strange surface in R cross the circle across C3. Secondly, there are derivatives of that delta function. Thirdly, that's being multiplied by a singular function or By a singular function of different possible singular functions. So, this is a generalized singular Radon transform and it's multilinear. Okay, so from our work a few years ago, we know that under this very strong prior that I alluded to before, that if you have a connectivity and therefore a mu, which has a smooth jump across an interface which has positive curvature, then in fact, positive curvature, then in fact, omega 3 tilde is smoother than omega 1 tilde at the singularities of omega 1 tilde. It also has other singularities located elsewhere, basically at the triple scattering points, but those are also lower order. So under that prior, omega 3 total really could be considered as a lower order perturbation of omega 1 tota. So it made sense to do the image construction using just omega 1 total. Just omega one total. Now, T3, as I said, you know, can be described in terms that would be familiar in some sense to harmonic analysts. It's multilinear, it's a singular generalized Radhan transform. In harmonic analysis, people study things like this, try to get estimates for them. So one can certainly ask, can we relax the prior on sigma and still see that omega three total is smoother than omega one total? Can you do that in terms of? Can you do that in terms of some assumption on sigma being in some conventional or relatively conventional function space? And the answer is we can't, at least as far as I can tell. So if you try to relax the prior even a little, so for example, the things with smooth jumps across interfaces, those belong to the Sobolev space H1 half minus epsilon. So if you stick around in the vicinity of H1 half and you Of H12, and you say, okay, supposing we just assume that sigma and therefore mu belongs to this Sobolev space, T3 seems to be so badly behaved on those spaces that, in fact, you can't think of omega 3 tilde as lower order compared to omega 1 tilde. So this raises the question about whether omega 3 tilde actually is low order. It may really not be. And therefore, it might be interesting to include omega 3 tilde in numerical calculations. Tilde in numerical calculations, as painful as that might be, because it may, in fact, improve the image reconstruction, possibly. And in terms of feeding training sets into machine learning algorithms, it might be useful. Okay, however, this is work in progress, so I can't say anything more specific at the moment. So, thank you very much. Thank you for the very nice talk. Do we have questions from the Stalk. Do we have questions from the audience? Yeah, okay. Thank you very much for the talk. Very interesting. I have a curiosity mainly. So you discussed this connection with the CT, with the Radon transform problem. And I was wondering, I mean, it's very effective to use micro-local analysis on Radon transform also in the case of. On Radon transform, also in the case of limited data, let's say. And typically in Radon transform, you have limited angles or sparse angles. So, is it possible to say something also in this case where you have limited data? And I imagine like typically with CGO solutions, the limitation is that you can't push the frequency too high. Yes, yes. So, is it possible to say something when your tau variable is limited? So, that's a very serious problem. That's a very serious problem, and that basically limits the resolution very severely, which is why this is perhaps suitable for these binary decisions, you know, stroke of this type or stroke of that type. The numerics in terms of the frequency variable are very forbidding. It's a real problem. An interesting feature here is that because of the complex principle type geometry, which I never really explicitly described, but the reason that complex analysis is all over this problem is because. Is all over this problem is because that's geometry is sort of hardwired into CGO solutions. The fact that, in fact, there's no limited angle in terms of measurement, you can measure anywhere, and at least in principle, you're able to detect singularities. In practice, you really do want to integrate over the boundary in order to get removed certain artifacts. But some of the things you see in regular CT and involving limited angle, they don't come up here. But you're absolutely right, the frequency. Yeah, the absolute frequency implementation is a serious problem. Thanks, Saban, for a very nice talk. I'm just on this last slide, I'm just curious. When you say it seems to be, it's based on theoretical consideration or numerical models? I've thrown at all sorts of techniques and tricks I know to prove estimates, and they don't work. I don't have a counterexample. Work. I don't have a counterexample in this sense. I don't have a mu for which actually I know for sure the T3 of mu mu mu is more singular or as singular. But the fact that so many methods that usually do something to help you don't help makes me think that there's a problem. Okay, because it needs more work. Because when we used to, I mean, now our work, we did some numerics for omega-3. And I mean, of course. And I mean, of course, it was in the probably it was always in this case where you have this non-zero curvature, and it really was a lower order perturbation. But so it probably could be interesting to do numerics to see if it works on some specific class of conductivity. And as I recall, actually, there was one graph where omega-3 tilde, you could see it, but actually you had to blow it up and create great. But that was under the prior. It was true. No, thanks. No, thanks. Questions? Yes. How does this assumption of having a positive curvature relate to anything physical within that problem setting? It doesn't. In other words, I mean, for example, when you look at some of these phantoms, right? So those, for example, don't have positive curvature. The first mature does, right? And of course, there's no reason on Earth to think of any. And of course, there's no reason on earth to think that anything inside the human body is going to have positive character. I mean, you can imagine having one thing, right? But once it gets to be of some extent, then it's not going to. It's a mathematically convenient assumption, but physically unrealistic. Right. Mathematicians do stuff like that. Physicists do something like that. That's usually. Second, if you have the slide up there, it's if you change these slides. if you if you change these like phantoms these like made-up phantoms to have like less severe differences let's say like maybe okay you have like a region a second circle in there that is let's say with with conductivity of one and a half instead of like one and then have this uh this three uh five sorry um for for the black one i mean obviously it's gonna fade away the effect is gonna fade away and i can The effect is going to fade away. And actually, since I don't do the numerics, I'm not sure exactly where it becomes sort of invisible to the human eye. But I mean, certainly, and this was done sort of to make a point, but certainly the contrast difference could be much smaller and you would still see that one was negative and one was positive relative to the background. I was just assuming that it will also break some of your mathematical derivations because it will have an even more. Or no, actually, so in terms of the mathematics, all you really need is that there be a jump. In other words, if you have whatever smooth jump, no matter how small it is, it's still a singularity. Thank you. Any more questions? I don't see anyone raising their hands. So we thank Alan again for the talk. Thank you so much. Before we go to the coffee break, just a small thing. So I was given by the So, I was given by the beer's organization some bus ticket for regular bus rides, which could be convenient. For example, if you want to go to downtown or something like that, it's approximately three each for the entire week. So if you're thinking of going somewhere downtown and you want one of these tickets, come to me and I can give you one. And yeah, I think up to 90 minutes. I think up to ninety minutes, they say. I think it's last nine minutes. How long does it take from this to go from here to the downtown? Oh no, I think it's way less. It's like 20 minutes, the max. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And if we're, oh, yeah, maybe. Okay, that's about 20 minutes. Great. And I don't know. It could be also interesting if wherever we decide to go on Wednesday or where you want to go on Wednesday. It's like a beta. Day, it's like that's also a good option. So, so that you know. Okay, so we have the coffee break, and then we resume a quarter past.
