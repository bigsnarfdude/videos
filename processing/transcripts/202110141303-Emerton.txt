Categorical laminess. Well, thank you for the invitation and for the introduction. So, sorry, I mean it's a somewhat technical title and maybe it's going to at least turn into a somewhat technical talk towards the end. But well, I'll do my best. I'm somehow trapped into talking about this just because. I'm somehow attracted to talking about this just because it's kind of what I've been thinking about. But hopefully, I can try to make it interesting and somewhat understandable for kind of people who are far from the language program. And so maybe what I need to start with is how number theorists think about cohology and arithmetic groups. So So maybe I can't presume to think how everybody in the audience thinks about homology barometer groups, but I will dare to kind of presume how Benson farmed that because I've had sort of, as has Friend and probably other than number theorists who know him, I've had the experience of kind of trying to communicate with Benson, who's a very open-minded topologist, maybe even looking like Val, he's officially kind of some kind of number theorist nationalic dromator. Another theorist and astronomy traumatis, but it's somehow not someone from the Landlands program. And so when you are someone from the Landlands program and you try to talk, it's you know, it's sort of an there's an exercise in kind of translation and trying to kind of figure out how each other thinks about things. And so here's my picture of how a kind of non-number theorist might think about homology of arithmetic groups. So they might choose, again, there might be an arithmetic group sitting inside Sitting inside something that they might call G, which might be a real, like a semi-simple wing group. And they might think about the homology of gamma, but one way they might think about it is that they might be a compact open subgroup, not open, I don't know exactly that's a gamma, a maximal compact subgroup in this real weed group G, and they might form X might be G mod K, might be a symmetric space, and then you might form. And then you might form the quotient of x by gamma, or for Benson, you would never just, you would always say, gmod k mod gamma, that's the most important thing in mathematics. And so you would write gmod k mod gamma. And you would study, well, the cohomology of gamma with maybe Q coefficients or integral coefficients, different kind of coefficients. And that would be the same as studying the cohomology of this quotient. And you would, you know, you try to say things. You know, you try to say things. And also, I guess number theorists do essentially the same thing. They study the chromology of these portions and they try to say things. But they think about the information and the chromology being organized in a certain way. And one of the first things that number theorists will kind of think about when they think about the chromology of these spaces that may not be how kind of more topologically inclined mathematicians think. Mathematicians think is that the chromology, from another theorist perspective, the chromology of the G-Mark-Mond gamma, the chromology is not just making vector spaces. They have more structure than modules over certain algebraic hectares operators. And that's kind of very, very crucial. And so I want to kind of briefly recall it. So one thing that happened. So, one thing that happens when you have an arithmetic group in a semi-simple Lie group, they often have big commensurators. And the typical example I have in mind is that if you have SL2Z sitting inside SL2R and then you have SL2Q sitting inside SL2R, SL2Q commensurate. Commensurate, whatever the right verb is, commensurates with, well, SL2Q commensurate with SL2Z or whatever you're supposed to say. In other words, if you conjugate SL2Z by adding it to SL2Q, you get another arithmetic subgroup in SL2R, which is commensurable with SL2Z. So these arithmetic groups, they're not going to be normal inside this semi-simple. They're not going to be normal inside these semi-simple regroups or anything like that. And they're not normal in, like SL2Z is not normal in SO2Q, but it is somehow approximately normal in SL2Q. It has this enormous commensurate gap. And so there are different ways to organize that information, but number theorists like to organize it sort of in the following way. So number theorists, yeah, so maybe I should sort of, I mean, I said that, could have written it, kind of in this kind of topologist, my pretend. Kind of topologist, my pretend topologist set up, this would be like a real seminar simple leader. But a number theorist, a number theorist might kind of really begin with G being an algebraic group over Q. And when you have an algebraic group over Q, Great group over Q, then you can take your gamma would be sort of the way you introduce arithmetic groups is you look at congruent subgroups. So, as probably everybody here knows, so a congruent subgroup is going to be Go to the, for example, well, if I talk about an algebraic Q group of Q, that means I have some equations cutting out this group of coefficients in Q. So it doesn't literally make sense to solve the equations in Z, because the property of having integer coefficients is not going to be, you know, the property of a solution to an integral is not going to be preserved under change of coordinates that involve rational numbers because of the denominators in the rational numbers. But as a sort of a minor technical point, so let's talk about. That's just sort of a minor technical point, so let's not worry about it. And so then we could talk about the z-points of the group T, and then inside the Z points, we could look at Z points that are congruent to one module or some modulus, and you get congruent subgroups. And so for a number theorist, a congruent subgroup is, they mean a subgroup of the Z points that contains all the matrices that are congruent to one module or submodules. And so those are kind of particular examples of arithmetic groups. Examples of arithmetic groups. And the sort of the so what sort of the basic idea is, so maybe this congruent subgroup even kind of has a level, so this won't be a congruent subgroup of level n, so i.e. the set of gamma in maybe g of z such that gamma is congruent to 1 mod n and And we could look in particular at I could sort of fix at prime B and then I could look at sort of my group G and I could look at sort of just the Z points and then I could look at the congruence segment group level P and then I've level P. And then I've level p squared, and so on. And obviously, all these subgroups, all these congregate subgroups are commensurable with each other, and there's kind of a part of the commensurator of G that just interacts with all these guys. And so, a good way to think about it from a number's perspective is that if you have G of QP, the QP points of G. The QP points of V kind of commensurate with this town. So we have the conventionators can kind of be organized as coming from the paired points of the group. And if you want to think about more than one crime at once, or want to think about all the crimes at once, you even Want to think about all the primes at once, you even can think about the idelic points of G. And so that's how the sort of idyllic picture comes in. The idyllic points of the group over Q as a good way of thinking about the kind of as a good way of making concrete the sort of abstract commensurator of all the congruent subgroups of Q. And so now if we were to look at cohomology, we could look at the cohomology of the symmetric space mod. Space mod one of these convergence subgroups. And I could take homology with coefficients in, I could take Q, or I could take C, or I could take Z, or I could take some finite field F, all of these things to be interesting. And I could take a and well, if I have a decreasing power of subgroups, I may have a decreasing chain of subgroups, that That means I get a kind of a tower of quotients. So I get these kind of local symmetric spaces of higher and higher level. And so I think of them as some kind of tower. The high-level quotient subjects onto the low-level quotient. But then cohomology is a contravariant function. So the cohomology classes pull back from lower level to higher level. And if I take the limit over all levels, I get some kind of limiting cohomology. Limiting topology, which has an action of this commensurate, which has GFTP. And as I said, I could take a limit over all levels, not just prime power levels, but over all levels N of the permolecular. Of the homology of these arithmetic quotients with whatever coefficients I want. And that limit will get a natural action of g of the finite adequacy. So this is essentially a product, it's very close to being a product of all primes of G of T P. It's elements in the product of all. It's elements in the product of all of the GFQP, which at almost all places, at almost all times, you should ask that the element actually lies in GFC. That's what this little dashed here on the product is just telling you that you want to look at elements in the product that are integral at almost all terms. And that's kind of a commensurator for the tower of all these condominiums quotients. And so that group acts on the limiting homology. And so number theorists tend to not think about the cohomology at any particular way. To not think about the cohomology at any particular level, but they tend to think about the cohomology as being organized as you look at all the possible levels. So you look at all the converse quotients of your symmetric space at once, and you think about the cohomology, say, in some given degree, kind of at the top of the tower, so the limit of all inverse limit of all levels. And that cohomology is not just a vector space, it's a representation of this idelic group. And And well I don't want to spend all my time just kind of reviewing or explaining this material, although I want people to have some sense of what's going on. But maybe just to say how this relates to heck operators. Where heck operators come from is that, for example, if I was in this picture, Picture. I was looking at the chromology at the top of the P to the N level tower. And I wanted to get back to the bottom of the tower. To get back to the bottom of the tower, I would just quotient out by the action of G of Z P. On the topological space side, I would quotient back out by G of Z P to get back down to level one. To get back down to level one. And on the chromology side, I would take invariance under G of CP. So the chromology at the bottom of the tower will be the G of VP invariance of the chromology at the top of the tower, where G of VP is acting because there's a subgroup of GFQP. So when I take the G of VP invariance, I get back the chromology at the bottom of the tower. So I'm kind of back to just, I don't know, the kind of topology situation, if you're in chromology of x. Situation of doing homology of X mod gamma, where gamma maybe has level one. And so you might think I haven't really gained anything by going all the way up this tower and then going all the way back down. But you do gain something when you go up the tower and then go back down. Because we realized that the cohomology at the bottom of the tower has some kind of action. For example, if G of Z P were normal in G of QP, and I had a G of QP representation. And I had a GQP representation, and then I took the GCP invariance, the GCP invariance would have an action depotion group of GSQP by GCP. Now, GUCP is not normal, like SL2ZP is not normal in SL2QP, but it's again virtually normal, meaning any conjugate of SL2ZP in SL2QP is commensurable with SL2ZP. So there's a heck algebra that acts. So whenever you have a group in a bigger group, Have a group in a bigger group that's kind of virtually normal in the bigger group. If you have a vector space representation in the bigger group and you're taking variance under the smaller group, that space of invariance gets a Hecker action. There's a certain Heckel, a double-posed algebra that acts on it. And so we see that even if we go back down to level one, the cohomology at level one remembers something about having, it remembers something about these temensaries. And what it And what it remembers is that it has a heck action. So, number theorists kind of think about heck operators, or they think about the action of this group, and they think about them as being very similar data. The main thing is that what they have in mind is that this chromology is not just a vector space, it has an action of this group. And so you can try to decompose it into irrepressibly. And so you can take this columnology, the one that was sort of at the top of the tower, and we can try to, I put approximately because this is an internet dimensional vector space or a module, and this is a big group, and it may not be the case that the representation is semi-simple. Be the case that the representation was semi-simple, but you could imagine a balls just to kind of think about what's going to happen, and it might break up into a direct sum of representations of this big group. And each representation would appear with some modificity, which would be whatever it is. But what does a representation of this group look like? Well, a representation of this group, this group is basically a product. Product. And so if we have an irrep of a product of groups, that will be a tensor product of irrepress. So this pi is basically a tensor product of irreps of each of these piadic points. Now, as a big industry that people study what the kind of irrupts of these piadic groups are. And there are papers about them and tables and there's kind of some kind of them in tables and there's kind of some kind of various complete or partial classifications depending on exactly what G you chose. And you can choose them. Like you could go to, you could choose GQPGL2 and then you could find locker books some kind of representation of GL2QP. And for each prime p, you could choose a pi p and then you could tensor them together and you could get a pi and then you could Pi, and then you're going to say, oh, well, what's the valuplicity with which that pi appears in the chromology, say, when I take GGDO2 or SO2? And actually the answer, if you just did what I said and just kind of just randomly chose a pi p for each prime p and tensed them together and got a pi and asked what is the multiplicity with which this pi appears in the chromology of modular curves. The answer would surely be zero. Because, well, one thing is that there's an infinite number of these pi's, pi p's, to each t, and there's a countable number of primes t. So that means there's a huge number, like I guess maybe some uncountable number of these pi's that you can make. But this chromology is just a limit over all levels of a fine-dimensional vector space. All levels of finite dimensional vectors. So, this cohomology is countable dimension. So, just for cardinality reasons, only some small number of possible pi's can appear inside this chromology. But more than that, it turns out to be an incredibly restrictive property for one of these pies to appear in this chromology. And that's why number theorists are so interested in this chromology. But I have to kind of just try to explain briefly. Let's try to explain briefly where these pi p's, oh, in what sense is it restrictive for this pi to appear in this chromology. So I want to kind of recap just what I said, although I know what I'm saying is very familiar to a lot of people here, but I want to recap it just to think about it in a certain way, which I think is useful for just kind of the formalism of the situation, which is that when you choose When you choose this group G over Q, like you choose G S L two or S L N or some symplectic group or some orthogonal group, and then you get this family of congruent subgroups, so you get all these arithmetic groups inside that are commensurable with each other, and you get this cohomology, and you get homology at each level, and then you organize all those homologies together into this representation. What you have is you've kind of built a machine. You've kind of built a machine, and that machine has spit out a bunch of data. So, what data is that machine spit out? I spit out a list of pi's, all the pi's whose multiplicity is non-zero, all the pi's that actually appear here. And giving one of these pi's is really giving, for each prime, a pi p. So, somehow, cohomology of congruence subgroups kind of leads to a list. A list of certain pieces of data that's a list of representations of the different, you know, this is a representation of DFP2, and this is a representation of DFQ3, and so on. You'll just get a list of representations of these categories. So Those which the multiplicity is positive, so that they actually appear inside cohomology. So, among all the kind of possible representations of among all the possible lists of pi sub p's that you would make just by looking at a book on representations of paired groups and kind of making such lists, the chromology of congruent subgroups produces certain very specific lists. So, number theorists have another context in mind that produce lists of data depending on a prime. Because number theorists might care about the rational numbers, and they might care about its higher-grade closure, and they would especially care about its Gala group. And they might have a representation of this Gala group. Well, let me just write down something. Well, let me just write down something concrete into like GO2 of the eladic numbers. For example, if you had an elliptic curve over the rational numbers, you could look at its so-called eladic k modules for some, or each prime L, and each eladic k module gives you a representation of gq. Or more generally, you could have a variety over the rational numbers, and you could take the atal cohomology of that variety, and the atal cohomology. homology of that's right and the A-calc homology of that riding will have the eladic Acalc homology will have a representation of the Gala group of Q, the absolute Gala group of Q. So Diophantine equations, which is to say algebraic varieties of the Q, just spit out lists of Gao representations. And if you have a Gao representation, what can you do with it? Well, Well, you can try to study it, whatever that means. So, number three is, you know, well, they wanted to study them, so they tried to figure out how do you study a Gauer representation. And one way you study a Gauer representation is the following way, which is that GQ kind of completes up to QP, and QP has an outdoor closure QP bar. And the symmetry that QP is a barrier to the bar And the symmetries of Qt by over QP, which is the local Galileo, they sit inside the symmetries of GQ. And so we put neuron restricted to GQP. And for each prime P. And of course, well, that's I mean, if you've never ever looked at these Bauer groups, I've just kind of taken a representation of some pretty big unknown. Of some pretty big unknown infinite Gala group when restricted it to some other pretty big looking unknown infinite Gala group. So it maybe doesn't look super exciting. But the key difference between this Gala group and this Gala group is that this one, the absolute Gala group of Qp, you can basically write down by generators and relationships or very close to that. And so these can be classified. And in fact there are different ways to organize the classification, but they can be classified for GO2 or for GLN or for SLN or for other algebraic groups as well. And in some sense it's related to the fact that these local data groups are comprehensible in a way that Comprehensible in a way that this global DAO group is not directly comprehensible. And so this row gives rise to a list. So maybe I'll just call this row P to kind of make the analogy closer to the other thing. I get like a row 2 and a row 3 and a row 5 and a row 7. And that's a global dollar representation, which I might get from an Olympic. Which I might get from an elliptic curve or some other diethrinking equation, gives me a list of local Gau representations, and I can imagine that I can't even know what these local Gauer representations actually are. And you could ask the same question that I asked up here about this with the pies. You could ask, if you give yourself a list of these local dollar representations, do they come from a global dollar representation? And the answer is typically no. The answer is typically no. Because just imagine the simplest case. So the abstract situation would be like I had a group G, and maybe inside I have two free groups of ungenerated. Maybe I have a free group of ungenerated generated by alpha and a three group of ungenerated generated by beta. And I say, well, let me give myself an n-dimensional representation of this subgroup generated by alpha, and an n-dimensional representation of this subgroup generated by beta. Generated by beta and asks: Can I find a representation of G which agrees with the matrix I chose on alpha and agrees with the matrix I chose on beta? And unless G is the free group generated by alpha and beta, the answer will be no. Because if G is not the free group, then alpha and beta will probably satisfy some relations inside G that you don't notice when you dust put the alpha, and which you don't notice when you dust put the beta. When you just look at beta. But what you do notice when you look at them both sitting inside G. And so for a representation of alpha and a representation of beta to kind of glue together into a common representation of G, some relations will have to be satisfied. So what happens is that all these subgroups of GQ as P varies, all together, they generate GQ. At least if you take, it turns out these subgroups are really only defined in. Turns out these subjects are really only defined inside here, maybe up to conjugation. So you shouldn't really think that you just have GQP inside GQ. You should imagine that there's like GQP and all its conjugates as a well-defined collection of subjects of GQ. So all those conjugacy classes of all those GQPs, they generate GQ, but definitely not free. They all satisfy these mysterious relations inside GQ. So what the way people phrase it is they kind of The way people phrase it is they kind of say the different crimes talk to each other inside GQ. So, classical theorems like the reflex theorem on crimes and arithmetic progression can be thought of, number theorists who do kind of lay length of these things, think of that as being kind of an example of how the different crimes are speaking to each other. Or quadratic pressures, people think of it as how different crimes are kind of speaking to each other. And so the different crimes kind of speak to each other inside. Different primes kind of stick to each other inside GQ because these different subgroups are not kind of independent of each other inside GQ. So if I write down a list of these rows for each prime P, I can't expect them to come from a representation of GQ. It will be some kind of special condition for each of these guys, for this list of errors to be glued together into this global bio. So, for a list of RPs to come from a single global row is a super non-trivial condition. It's also hard to make explicit because we do know that the different crimes are talking to each other inside GQ, but we don't really understand how they're doing it and what language they're using and what they're saying to each other. So, that's one of the difficulties in numbers. But what we do have is this kind of rather amazing conjecture. Amazing conjecture. So here's the Lenin's conjecture in a very kind of a very rough form is that these pi Ps Eurex of GPP they set up are in bijection with representations. What kind of representations? Well, the semi-simple group G has a dual group, G hat. And here was a slight issue, like when you do atop homology, when you do atoke homology of a variety so some people also call it eladic homology partly that reminds you when you talk about the when you talk about the singular chromology of a complex manifold say which is what the complex points of a variety would be you can take singular cohomology with q coefficients but if you take uh if you want to do a calculator you can't do it with q coefficients you have to kind of choose a prime l and do eladic coefficients so it means that kind of represent so it means that kind of these dialogue Of rep so it means that kind of these Dalai representations that come from varieties that I had written down here. There's kind of this annoying L you have to choose, and it's not normally like not no L is necessarily any better than the other, but you kind of have to have chosen one. So there's kind of an L floating around here, but it doesn't really matter which L I'm choosing as long as L is different from P. So you can just so the L, this L, L doesn't really matter. If you're not an expert and the L is annoying, you can just And the L is annoying, you can kind of pretend the L is not dead. And so basically, very roughly, irreps of GQP are kind of in bijection with Gala representations of, so irreps of G of QP, like QP points to some semi-simple algebraic group, are in bijection with representations of the local valid group into, well, the dual, so this is the dual group, the Lenin's dual group. So, for example, if G is SLN, this will be PGLN. If G is a symplectic group, this is a corresponding auto-fogenal group. And there's kind of this dictionary of Lenin's duality that picks any semi-simple group to a dual group. And this is sort of an amazing conjecture discovered by Leynes. Conjecture discovered by Lawrence. I'm stating it not quite correctly by any means, and certainly not in a way that's kind of good enough to have a statement you can kind of prove, but it's the rough idea of what local landlords says. And it's, I mean, it's tricky to give an idea of why it's true, but one way you can prove this correspondence. You can prove this correspondence, for example, this local Lennon correspondence for the group, say SL2. And in that case, the way you would prove it will be almost by just computing both sides and seeing that they match in a certain way. And I just want to give you a, just to give you one idea of how things match. If you have a, I said just before that going back to GO2 ZPM. To GL2 ZP invariance is the same as looking at some hecka algebra active. So inside this collection of irrex, they are the ones that are so-called our spherical representations. Inside all these possible irrex, some of them have an invariant vector under G of Cp. Not all of them do, but some of them do. Those are called spherical representations. And when you have an invariant vector under G of Cp, some HECA algebra acts on it. Some hacker algebra acts on it. And for the group SL2 or GL2, there's a famous kind of heck algebra called T sub P, like a double coset operator corresponding to the matrix P001. And so if you have a spherical representation of, say, GL23P, there'll be a certain eigenvalue. There'll be a certain heck of eigenvalue so that some of these representations spit out hecker eigenvalues. Spit out hexa-eigenvalues as a kind of way to classify them. But on this side, among all the Galois representations, a particular one you can do is G of Qp has a natural subjection onto the Galois group of Ft, and the Galois group of Ft has a canonical element called the Frebenius. And so among all these representations, they're the ones that factor through G of Ft. And to give a representation of G of F T, you just have to say where the stabenius goes, because it generates G of F T. Those because it generates G of F P. So you just have to give a matrix. So some of these representations have spherical vectors. Some of these representations are numerified and are just given by sending for BBST to a specific matrix. And those collections will match under this bijection, and the way they'll match is that a Hecker eigenvalue on this side will match with the trace of the matrix under this side. Matrix of so that kind of maybe gives you at least a flavor of how Yukon this bijection is going to be. Even in like special cases on each side, the bijection is not any kind of obvious thing, as somehow on each side you have some slightly elaborate way of producing numerical invariants, and the bijection is sort of defined so those numerical invariants are matching. But on one side, the numerical invariant gives an eigenvalue of some heck operator, on the other side, Of some heck operator. On the other side, the numerical invariant is a trace of some matrix. And then these kind of things are supposed to coincide. So, okay, so that's kind of an elaborate story for local Lennons, but why am I talking about it? Because basically, that was the local Lennon's conjecture. So the global Lennon's conjecture tells you that So again, very told you that some pi appears in combo. So sorry, back up in a minute. Back up and remember that this cohomology of my congruent subgroups coming from the group category G was like a direct sum of certain very specific area of G of the I delts. So only very special pi's but kind of contributing homology. Well, which ones so which ones are appearing in homology if and only if When we go from the collection of pipe Ps to the collection of rare P's by local lens. Well, so maybe I should write it this way. So that this pi kind of gives rise to a collection of pi P's. In fact, this pi is just a tensor product of all these pi p's. And then each pi p gives me a rogue p. And so Gives me a european. And so then let me write the conjecture down the board. So if and only if European is come from a common rhythm, this is why number theorists kind of care about the homology of these arithmetic groups, because the tomology of these arithmetic groups produces very specific representation of pi, and they should be exactly the pi. And they should be exactly the pi's which correspond to global value representations Europe. And the way they correspond is that the sort of the local pi p's, this pi gets risk to should be matching with the local row p, so this row gets risked to. And so number theorists, they don't really have, or expect to have formulas for what the pi's that appear in chromology are. And I Up. And like I said, we don't really know how the primes talk to each other in GQP or what they're saying to each other. So we don't expect to have an explicit way to know when a given collection of local roties can be blung together into a single row. So we don't expect to compute the pi's. We don't expect to compute the rows, really. But what we do believe is that this incredibly amazing condition that a bunch of pipe p's blew into a single pipe that appears in chromology. That appears in chromology, which is a very, very simple condition on the pipe piece, is exactly the same condition as a set of different row piece gluing together into a single row. So on the representation of our p-adic group side or on the representation of our gallic group side, there's an amazing kind of thing that can happen, which is, as I said, like a bunch of pi P's can all be somehow put together into a pie that actually appears in homology. Actually, appears in homology. That's an amazing condition on the pi peas. Most bunches of pi peas won't satisfy that. Some incredible kind of sympatheticness between the different pi peas that you chose. And there's also some amazing kind of thing where if you choose a bunch of RPs, you might have chosen them so they all grew into a common robe. And that's a very difficult thing to have happen. And it's kind of, again, it expresses some incredible kind of sympathy between the different Europees. It's very hard to see directly. It's very hard to see directly. So we don't expect to really directly be able to describe what the condition is for a bunch of pie peas to come from a pine pomology or what the condition is for a bunch of grocas to come from a global growth. But what we do believe is that those two amazing conditions that we can't say explicitly match with each other under local learning, so that they're the same condition. And so that's why we study the hormone in the groups, because it's telling us about what's happening in the elotic hormone. Happening in the automobile of our varieties in some indirect way. So, okay, so I'm sort of, so that was kind of my first 10-minute warm-up on local and local. So I don't know, so I'm sorry to kind of spend so much time on that, but maybe, I hope for some people here it's kind of useful. Because I don't know if number theory, I don't know if I did a good job explaining it, but I know that as a rule, number theories don't. So my bar was low. Don't. So my bar was low, so I might have cleared it. But I want to say, just to tell you, so now I'm going to have to accelerate, but just to say that this local language is something Langlands wrote in his famous letter to Bay in 68, and he explained this local language can get to in some way. And of course, it's like a massive topic of study. And some of you will know there's a company called the Some of you will know there's a company called the Geometric Finance Program, which studies some other version of it in some other context. And there's a lot of stuff happening, but very recently, there's been some kind of convergence of ideas from a bunch of different parts of the language program, the most number-theoretic parts, the geometric parts. And they've led to kind of a much kind of a richer kind of version of local LEMS, which you might call categorical local lens. Local lens, where you don't just look at the irreps of GFPP, but you look at a category. So you look at the category, so smooth is a technical condition that you either know what it means or you don't, it doesn't really matter. So you look at smooth representations of this category group, GFQP, and that's a whole category of representations. And conjecturally, That has a fully faithful embedding as a category into the category of coherent sheaves on the representation variety of GQP into this dual group G hat. So we can, that's like in topology, you look at representational varieties of pi 1s or whatever, like we can look at gqp, but look. Whatever, like we can look at GQP. Well, look, GQP is a profinite group, so this representation of variety, they're all kind of technical caveats. And I should probably call it not so much a variety as probably call it a stack, per se, a symmetry, the kind of symmetries we should take into account. So with the coherence she's on the representation stack of GPP into this dual group G hat. And the very vague idea is that an irref under this local length, an irref is going to match up to Gauer representation. So the irref will kind of maybe go to spice gate. Will kind of maybe go to skyscraper sheets sitting at points. Like a point of the stack will be a representation of the Incinergi hat. And so the classical local lands would be taking a given irregular on the left-hand side, which is like a building block of the category on the left-hand side, and sending it to a skyscraper sheet sitting at a point in the representation stack on the right-hand side. But then a non-iract on the left-hand side, you think of as being somehow made up by some kind of direct thinking tool of iraq, by pickforio analysis, and think about to. I like a good Fourier analysis and think of L2 of R as some direct integral of all the characters of R. So you kind of imagine some typical object on the left-hand side as some kind of direct integral of all these different erax being glued together to make that object. And so that will kind of map into some kind of coherent sheaf on this stack, which is made up of all these skyscrapers coherent sheaves being glued together to maybe make some interesting sheaf like a line bundle or a vector bundle or some other coherent sheaf with some support. So that's the So these are sort of the categorical local Lennon's conjecture. These are kind of big sort of a strengthening of the original local Lennon's that sort of takes into account the fact that they're not only irrepressed of this guy, but the irrepress can be organized into interesting representations. You know, just in the same way that Lactorio theory takes into account that they're not only characters of locally compacted ulium groups, but they can be organized into interesting families, like L2 of the interesting families like L2 of the local combat could be alienated. And so that so this is so this kind of categorical local wellness correspondence is far from being constructed in general, but it's a topic of pretty intense sort of current activity. Some people here will have heard that Fargo Schulzer did something kind of big recently and got a sort of 300-page manuscript on the archive and that Farg Schulzer The archived and that five-cholzer manuscript. If you can prove everything, all the conjectures you make in that manuscript, you would in particular construct this fully faithful embedding. So now I was looking at taking global DAO representations and restricting them. So I could do the following thing. So I could do the following thing. I could look at the representation stack of gq into g hat. And I could map it to the product of these local stacks. I'll call that to give it a name. So it's the restriction map. So that's kind of that. Restriction map. So that's kind of the way of organizing the fact that I can restrict representations of GQ to these local DAO groups, but organizing it into a more geometric context. So I have kind of a whole representational variety of GQ. So I think I got all the representations of GQ into this matrix group, not just one at a time, but the whole kind of collection of them organized as a representation of variety or local stat. And I can restrict it as part of local stats. And Let me, so I want to choose now a level, so I choose a level n, which is maybe like some product of product of prime powers. And so choosing a level sort of Choosing a level sort of basically means that I've chosen kind of a congruent subgroup, this congruent subgroup, gamma P I A I. And that's sitting inside the whole piadic group. It's sitting inside, it's sort of a, we have the piadic group, we have the kind of Z P points of the group, so this is the sort of PI, the QP added points of the group, we have the ZP points of the group, and inside the ZP points of the group, we have the kind of devices congruent to one module. kind of buys it congruent to one module of this power of p as a congruent subgroup and I could do an induction of say the trivial representation from this compact open subgroup of this group to the whole thing in fact I want to do the compactly supported induction and that's an object in this category it's not an irreducible representation it's kind of a metaphor it's kind of a metaphor for all the different possible A metaphor for all the different possible representations that could be kind of appearing at this level. But it's supposed to, by my local lemmings, it's supposed to give me some kind of coherent sheaf that I'm just going to call A sub I, because it depends on the data I chose at this I prime. So kind of choosing a level gives me a coherent sheaf for each prime in the level. Prime in the level. And so I could look at the product over all the primes I care out of the local stack. So this is a coherent sheaf on the kind of GTPI stack. So over the product of those local stacks, I can kind of product together, I can kind of put the coherent sheet for the ith prime. The coherent sheaf for the ith prime on the ith stack, and then I can kind of tensor part of them together to get a coherent sheaf on the whole thing. And then I could look at my global stack, so my GQ stack. So, this is a rep, again, this is like a representation stack for the global GAO group. This map F. And so, I could pull back this coherent action of my idea with derived upper. But actually, I'm going to do a drive, upper street pullback. So I'll do an ad upper street. And that's some kind of stat globally. And then I want to make, so here's kind of the actual kind of secret goal of, well, the talk, which has to be finished now, because it's kind of a bit rushed. But the conjectural formula is that Is that the compactly supported chromology at level N is computed via you look at this C from the GQ stack and you throw in You throw in a certain piece of global data. So this comes from the Schmurr data. So now I should assume that I'm in a Schmur gravity function. So basically I want to assume that this is I mean the Hermitian symmetric case. And I take the cohomology of this thing Listing on my again, I mean I should write it the same way, so on my GPS test. So that's kind of the conjecture that tells you how to compute homology of, well, at least congruence quotients of permission symmetric spaces in terms of. In terms of sort of data built out of the interaction between representations of chaotic groups and Gala representations that come from local lengths. So it's supposed to be a generalization of this global length, which I should definitely have said as a conjecture, because it's of course proved in lots of cases, but opened in many, many more cases. So this is kind of a kind of rephrasing and strengthening of. Of rephrasing and strengthening of kind of a global Levants conjecture, directly relating homology of Hermitian symmetric spaces to this kind of the Galo-Aphrietic data. And so somehow, I think it's a very interesting conjecture. It breaks up the question of studying this homology into a bunch of different aspects. Homology into a bunch of different aspects. There's sort of aspects coming from a Shimora variety. There's sort of this aspect coming from kind of local considerations. There's the geometry of this restriction map from kind of global to local. So there's kind of a lot of ingredients on the right-hand side, which make the left-hand side, which at first seems kind of very indivisible, kind of gives you different vantage points to study the left-hand side, because the right-hand side, although it's complicated, has a lot of moving parts. It has a lot of moving parts, and so you can study the different moving parts separately. So, in any case, I'm out of time and over time, so I have to stop. Hopefully, if nothing else, this talk at least gives you some sense of where some number theorists are right now and what they're thinking about in relation to kind of chromology of athletic groups that everybody here is probably interested in in one way or another. So, thank you for listening. Thank you for listening. Questions for our speaker? I think you can ask either out loud or in the chat over Zoom or out loud in the classroom. Yeah, I don't see, I don't, just because of the way I have my thing set up, I don't see the chat. So if something appears in chat, maybe someone else can just tell me what's in there, or I can just stop sharing and they'll probably see the chat. So I can stop sharing and I'll probably see the chat. I don't think I could stop sharing and then I can probably see the chat. So the chat is not being overwhelmed with questions, maybe not surprisingly. I have two questions which relate to your notes. If you wouldn't mind sharing them again. The first one is this The first one is this, I'm just going backwards chronologically because it's right here. This chromology compactly supported, is that basically the same thing as like the chromology in the interior or like custodial chromology? I mean, just. No, no, it's like the no, you should just. It's just a compactness of body, so it's literally the kind of concurrent dual to the. The kind of Pankari duel to the usual chromology. But there's not so much left to think about a case where gamma is co-compact and then it would just be the co-knowledge. So this compact is supported is not a technically important, but not a big deal. What's sort of more interesting for number theories? So this kind of goes back. For number theories, so this kind of goes back to many discussions with me and friend Kenya Benson: is middle, how close you are to the middle compared to the outside. And so middle cohomology is the one that sees the most interesting gala representations. And then kind of as you get closer to the edges of comology, like the top or the bottom, you're seeing more exotic gala representations that maybe tend to be reducible. Maybe tend to be reducible. But all the middle and outside the middle are all interesting for various different reasons. And on the right-hand side, the difference between chromology the middle and chromology outside the middle will be related to why I put this f-upper streak. So f upper streak is some kind of pullback on sheaves, but it does, but it kind of sees the kind of thing this f-upper streak sees is it sees the way this global representation stack kind of. this global representation stack
