Sears set. Yeah, I was started as a mathematician. My career as a graduate student, also as a postdoc, was in infectious disease modeling. And I always wanted to go into industry. And I actually just happened to go into pharmaceutical modeling. And I really enjoy it there. And so I want to give you guys kind of a brief overview about how we use modeling and simulation and drug development. And I was kind of wondering, you know, you guys are not the typical audience for this kind of a talk. You know, how can you guys help? How can you guys help this in terms of what can your contributions be? And so, kind of what I was thinking, and maybe you can keep in mind, is you guys are talking to policymakers sometimes. And this is a part of the puzzle for the pandemic. And so maybe kind of having an understanding of where they're coming from in terms of drug development and the kind of questions they're looking at and the kinds of models they're looking at. You know, that's another piece of the puzzle. So maybe this is just something to keep in mind when you're creating your model. Just something to keep in mind when you're creating your models, you're talking to policymakers, you know, these are what they're thinking about as well. Um, okay, and a disclaimer: um, so I work for DillySim and Simulations Plus, and these are two companies that have proprietary software that do some of the modeling that I'm going to be describing. And I will talk about this software a little bit, but I will talk about other kinds of models. Uh, and so just you know, be aware that I work for these two companies. Oh, yeah. Okay, yeah, I'll see right. Okay, yeah, I'll stay right here. All right, so let's give a background about the drug development pipeline. And so it can be broken up into these four different categories, drug discovery, preclinical phase, clinical trial phase, and a regulatory approval phase. And so when a company wants to bring a drug to market, meaning they're going to take a compound through all these different phases all the way to the shelf so that we can purchase it, they're not just starting with one compound. They're starting with thousands of different compounds. Starting with thousands of different compounds. And throughout this process, they're getting whittled down into the one product that's actually you're going to see come to market. So they're going to start with the drug discovery phase. And so they're going to have thousands of different compounds. And this is not my expertise, but what I do know about this is they start with one molecule that does something that they want to do. Let's say it binds to a receptor. And they can take that one compound and chemically manipulate it so that it's just slightly different, still does what they want to do, but it's still. Still does what they want to do, but it's still slightly different. So it's a different compound. And then they do this for a bunch of different molecules. And, you know, kind of that slight manipulation maybe, you know, lessens some side effects or something. So they just do this, just kind of get a broad range of this one compound that does this thing that they want to do. And it looks a little bit different. So it's going to behave a little bit different in the body. So they have these thousands of different compounds they start with. Then what they're going to do is they're going to run a ton of different assays on these compounds because they need to know a lot of different properties. Know a lot of different properties about them. They also need to know, you know, at this phase, they have a compound that binds to a receptor, let's say, but there could be many different diseases or many different indications that would benefit from this drug binding to this receptor. So not only do they have to figure out all of these different properties about this drug, but they now need to figure out, you know, what kind of indication do they want to go with? And so that's what they're going to do at this point. So they're going to run all these different assays, know all these different properties about these thousands of different compounds. Properties about these thousands of different compounds, and then they're going to generate a lead compound. So, it's called lead generation. And so, this process takes between three and five years. So, then, based on what they find in this, all these different assays, this is going to whittle down the number of compounds that they're going to take to the preclinical phase down from these thousands to maybe 200. And so, they're going to take these 200 and they're going to go into these preclinical studies, which just means they're going to run tests in animals. And what they're really trying to understand here is toxicity. Here is toxicity. If we see toxicity in animals, they're not gonna take it to humans at all. So we wanna know different toxicities. How is this drug going to distribute throughout the body? One of the reasons you want to know this is if you have a drug that tends to accumulate in a tissue, well, that's maybe going to cause toxicity and that's not something they want to bring into humans. So we need to figure that out. If you have a particular biomarker that you want to look at, they're going to look at that in animals first. So that's kind of what happens in the preclinical phase. And this can take one. Pre-clinical phase, and this can take one to two years. Designing the clinical trials, you have to pick the right animal for the drug. So, if you're looking at an ocular drug, rabbits are actually the best animal. If you're looking at a topical drug, mini pigs are what they typically use. If you're looking at something that affects the CNS, you're going to look at monkeys because those are the closest to humans. So, you got to design all these different experiments, pick the right animals so that you can have the best prediction for how this is going to work in humans. Going to work in humans. So then, based on what you find in the preclinical phase, you whittle down those 200 compounds down to five that you're going to take into humans. And the clinical trial phase is broken up into three different phases, one, two, and three. So in the first phase, all you're really wanting to do here is make sure that the dose that you've identified in your pre-clinical species will not cause toxicity in the humans. And so you're going to look at about maybe 10 to 30 participants at most, and you're just looking for. At most, and you're just looking for toxicity at the dose. You don't even care about efficacy at this point. If you make it past phase one, then you're going to go into phase two, and here you're looking at efficacy. Is the dose that you picked, are we really going to see efficacy? And this is going to be maybe 100 people in this clinical trial. So getting a little bit larger. If you make it past phase two, you're going to go on to phase three. And here you're going to have thousands of people. And really what you want to see here is not only efficacy, but you're looking. See, here is not only efficacy, but you're looking at side effects. You know, let's say there's a side effect that affects one in a thousand people. You're not going to, it's unlikely you're going to see that in phase one or two trial. Hopefully, you'll see that in a phase three trial so that you can understand, you know, what this compound can potentially do in a human. And so that phase takes about six to seven years because you have to recruit people for each of these different clinical trials. If you have different cohorts, If you have different cohorts, you have to create separate cohorts of people that match each other so that you can compare how the different aspects of the drug compare to the different cohorts. Some drugs you can give to healthy volunteers, and so you just kind of have to be able to gather the appropriate number of volunteers for the study. But some drugs, like cancer drugs, you can only give to people that are for that indication because they're very toxic. And so, not only do you have to recruit. And so, not only do you have to recruit people for this clinical trial, but you have to recruit very specific people. And that can take a long time if it's a rare disease and there's not very many people. And so, that's kind of what you're doing in this clinical trial phase. And that's why it can take a long time, depending on, you know, how difficult it is to recruit people, how long is it going to take to run this clinical trial. And so, let's say you make it past all of these phases in the clinical trial, you've whittled down your five, and now you're just going to take one to market. And that regulatory approval phase. And that regulatory approval phase, what you're going to do is you're going to take this packet of information to, let's say, the FDA or the EMA. It's containing all the information that you've learned from drug discovery all through your clinical trial. And this is your case to tell the regulatory agency that, yes, this drug is safe and it's efficacious. And so actually, as part of a one client, I actually had to talk with the FDA to argue for our model. And so they're very thorough. That's why it just takes a long time. And so, Long time. And so this whole process takes upwards of 15 years, and it can take a billion dollars to get just one drug to market. And so clearly, this is not something that is reasonable in a pandemic. You can't take 15 years. And so what you can do is use modeling and simulation to speed up some of these different parts, because I hope I've convinced you that these are all really necessary. You know, all of this information needs to be known before. Information needs to be known before taking a drug to market. But maybe we don't have to do a clinical trial for everything. Maybe we can try some modeling and simulation. And so that's what I want to talk about today is how we can use modeling and simulation to potentially speed up some of these different processes. All right. And so what can we do? So in the drug discovery phase, instead of running those high-throughput assays where we're looking at, you know, testing all of these different We're looking at testing all of these different compounds, we can actually predict the lead compound using its chemical structure. So, that's one model I'm going to talk about. And the other ones relate to both the preclinical and clinical trial phase. And there's just so much modeling and simulation to do here. We can predict drug-induced toxicity. So, in particular, we're looking at the liver, heart, and kidney. We can predict treatment efficacy. So, we don't have to wait until we go into the clinic. We can actually do some modeling to predict how. Actually, do some modeling to predict how this might work out. A big one here is predicting optimal drug dose and regimen. So, when you're moving from your preclinical phase to your clinical phase, you know, you've decided on a dose that works in your preclinical species, but you have to scale that to humans. And so, modeling is a really huge application for modeling in this sphere. Sensitive populations. So, you need to gather the appropriate people to run clinical trials, but it's really. People to run clinical trials, but it's really hard to get pediatric patients into these clinical trials. And so, you know, we can use modeling and simulation to hopefully avoid that. Predicting drug interactions. This is another huge one. It's very unlikely that you're going to be taking just one drug by itself. It's common that you're going to be taking multiple drugs. So cancer patients, you know, they'll have a drug for their treatment, but they'll also have an anti-emetic. So something that makes them not nauseous. If that anti-emetic, let's say, induces the clearance mechanism. Induces the clearance mechanism for their treatment drug, well, then the treatment drug is going to be less efficacious because it's being cleared more rapidly. Whereas if their, let's say, anti-emetic inhibits their clearance mechanism for their treatment drug, well, now the treatment drug is just going to accumulate in their body and cause toxicity. And so it's something that we really have to be aware of. And it's something that is really on the forefront of everyone's mind when they're doing these clinical trials. So that's a clinical trial in itself, doing these drug-drug interactions. And finally, we're talking about doing all these clinical trials. About doing all these clinical trials, getting all these different patients, volunteers, wouldn't it be better if we could simulate this instead of having to gather the appropriate people? Can we come up with virtual patient populations so that we can run these kind of clinical trials? And that's something that we can do as well. So I just want to kind of go into depth for each of these points. So, talking about, I wonder if I can do this. I can do this. Okay, I can't move this. So, predicting the lead compound from the chemical structure. So, on the left is what there is typically done. So, you have your thousands of different compounds, and what you're going to do is you're going to screen all of them for the property that you want. So, let's say you want an inhibitor. You're going to take all of these thousands of different compounds. You're going to screen all of them if they're an inhibitor. Then you're going to have a subset of those. And then let's say you want a nonspecific inhibitor. So then you have to go and screen all of them again. And then you're going to get your lead compound. And then you're going to get your lead compounds. And the problem with this is, again, it takes a lot of time to do this. Wouldn't it be great if we can do some sort of modeling to be able to predict the property that we want? And we can. So you can take, let's say, this is a caffeine molecule. You can take your compound and you can look at different properties about it. So let's say like number of carbon atoms, number of nitrogen atoms. Carbon atoms, number of nitrogen atoms, how many bonds are there? What's this configuration? And you can use these as inputs into what's usually a machine learning model, like a feed-for-alnet, as inputs into this model to predict different properties about this chemical structure. Of course, this is under the assumption that you already have a trained model and it'll take seconds. And there are models like this that are pre-trained in the literature that you can look at. So once you have a pre-trained model, you can just put in these different properties. Put in these different properties about the molecule and predict different properties, such as, let's say, solubility and distribution. So, this is going to be important when you're looking at how is the drug going to behave inside of your body. But then you can also get at the property that you want, like if it's a nonspecific inhibitor, for instance. So, with these kind of the old method of doing this hype-throughput screening, you can just get this one kind of proper. Meaning, you can just get this one kind of property out of it. Is it a nonspecific inhibitor? But with these machine learning models, you can actually go a step further and look at these physical chemical properties of the molecule. And so that's one way that we can use modeling and simulation to kind of speed up this process so that we can come up with our lead compound much more quickly. And so now let's move to how we can use modeling and simulation in the preclinical and clinical trial phase. And so the first major thing that we can do. Thing that we can do is we can predict liver toxicity. So, the reason that you want to know about liver toxicity is because all orally taken drugs are going to pass through the liver, and the liver is a major clearance mechanism for these drugs. And so, if you have toxicity in the liver, they're not going to be able to clear the drugs as well. And then you have buildup, and then you get, you know, toxicity. So, drug-induced liver injury, also called Dilly, is a major reason behind why clinical trials are terminated or, you know, Are terminated, or you know, there's regulatory action taken on drugs. And so, this graph tells you about the different organ systems and the reason for termination of those drug, so the reason of termination for those drug programs based on organ system. And so you can see that the liver is a major player in this, both preclinical and clinical. So, preclinical, it failed in the animal species, and the clinical, they made it all the way past the animals into humans, and it's and it failed in the liver, and they weren't able to predict that from the animals. And they weren't able to predict that from the animals. And so, what you want is a model that can, you know, predict this before you even go into animals. It'll save you a lot of time and money. And so, one way that you can be able to predict liver toxicity is using these different biomarkers. So, on the x-axis, we have peak ALT levels, which is something that the liver will secrete into the blood if it's under injury. And so, if you're And so, if your peak ALT levels are greater than three times the upper limit of normal, then you have an indication that there's liver injury. On the y-axis is total bilirubin level, and this relates to liver function. And so, if you have a total bilirubin level greater than two times the upper limit of normal, then you will have an indication that there is impaired liver function. And so, what they're looking for in the clinic is if you have both high ALT levels. Both high ALT levels and high total bilirubin levels, you're in this law, which they call high's law range, which means that you're going to have liver toxicity and your drug is not going to get approved. And so, ideally, what we'd want to do is be able to predict a drug that would fall into this high as law range before actually going into the clinical trial. And so, this model by Dilly Sim can actually do that. It's a mechanistic model to predict liver toxicity. So, I'm not going to go into any of the details of the model, but basically, it's a Of the details of the model, but basically it's a large system of differential equations, and there's a lot of different components that are leading to the ultimate concern, which is the biomarkers. So, are we able to predict if we're going to see liver toxicity based on these biomarkers? And again, there's this whole, all these different processes in this model to be able to do that. Another tissue that we were interested in and toxicity would be cardiac tissue. So, again, you can Cardiac tissue. So, again, you can see on the plot that this is actually a major player in the reasons why either pre-clinical trials or clinical trials are terminated. And so here what we're looking at is cardiac arrhythmias. And so on the left-hand side, you see what's an EKG, it's a normal EKG, and we're looking at the QT interval. And so the shape of this EKG is driven by this ventricular. Is driven by this ventricular action potential, which is here on the right-hand side. And so the shape of this action potential is going to determine the shape of the EKG. But the shape of the ventricular action potential is actually determined by influx and outflux of different ions into the cardiac cell. And that is represented by what looks like green equal signs here. And that's determining the shape here. So in the beginning, we see that we get a really sharp increase because we have. Sharp increase because we have sodium ions coming into the cell. And this kind of little dip here is controlled by calcium ions coming into the cardiac cell. But what's really crucial is we have potassium ions leaving the cell, which causes this action potential to take a sharp decline. And so this outward current here is called the Herg channel. And this is really important because drugs can actually block this Herg channel. And so what happens is when drugs, oh, no. is when drugs, oh no, when drugs block this HERG channel, you get delayed repolarization. So then the ventricular action potential is now delayed. It doesn't have that sharp decline, and you get a prolonged QT interval. And if you have too many of these prolonged QT intervals, you get a cardiac arrhythmia because your heart's not beating correctly. And so there are assays to determine if your drug is going to block the HERG channel. And what will typically happen is if you, if the company finds that out, they'll actually kill the drug because, you know, there's They'll actually kill the drug because you know there's a chance that you can have this cardiac arrhythmium. But what's actually known is that if you proportionally block an input channel, so maybe a sodium or a calcium, that actually negates the effect of blocking the Herg channel because now you have this kind of equilibrium. But there are no tests to do that kind of a thing, and this proportional block is very non-linear. So what we can do actually is model and look at Is model and look at, you know, can we predict if there will be a proportional block if the HERD channel is blocked as well? And so there's actually a model out by the FDA called the Comprehensive In vitro Proarrhythmia Assay, SIPA, in silico model. And so what they did is this is a mechanistic model to predict cardiac toxicity. They kind of took two different models and combined them. So they have a Markov, oh gosh, they have a Markov model here to predict drug binding and trapping in the herbicide. Drug binding and trapping in the HERG channel. So that's really one of the crucial steps here: to understand how the drug is impacting that HERG channel, that outflux of potassium. And so once you have an idea of, you know, what the drug is doing with the HERG channel, you can take that information and then put it into this human ventricular myocyte model to understand what's going on with the other channels. How is this affecting that ventricular action potential, which will then subsequently affect your EKG if you're going to see any cardiac. If you're going to see any cardiac arrhythmias. And so this model can predict if you have a low, medium, or high risk of having a cardiac arrhythmia. So, in the absence of this model, you'll have a lot of drugs not being taken to market because they might think, you know, they're blocking the HERG channel. There's a high probability that you're going to have a cardiac arrhythmia. And so, here, if you're able to model this, there might be other drugs that you can take to market because, yes, they're blocking the HERG channel, but maybe they're proportionally blocking another channel. They're proportionally blocking another channel, and it's not as dangerous. And so, that's how this model can be used. And then, a third kind of tissue that we're interested in, again, because of this clearance, is renal toxicity. So renal toxicity isn't a major player, but it's still important because drugs are also cleared through the kidneys. And so there is a model called Rhenasim, and it's There is a model called Rhenasim, and it's a mechanistic model to predict renal toxicity. It was basically a repurposing of that DillySim model. A lot of the same toxicity mechanisms that lead to liver toxicity will also lead to kidney toxicity. And so what they did at DillySim is repurpose their DillySim model to make renasim, also adding in some kidney-specific physiology. All right, so those are. All right, so those are the different models that we have to predict tissue-specific toxicities. But we can also use these mechanistic models to predict treatment efficacy. So there is this model, it's called IPF-SIM, and it can be used to predict the treatment efficacy of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF. Again, not going to go into detail at all in this model, but it's pretty complex. It's got a lot of granularity into it. Granularity into it. And models like this have been used by different clients to predict their treatment efficacy. And so, if you can do that before you actually go into the clinic, you can save you a lot of time and money too. All right, so those are the different kind of what they would call in the pharmaceutical industry quantitative systems pharmacology models. So, those are the more mechanistic models. And then, the second class of models I'm going to talk about are called. Class of models I'm going to talk about are called physiologically based pharmacokinetic models or PBPK. And so these they don't classify these as mechanistic models, but there's a little, there's a little mechanism in there. With the mechanistic models, you really have a sense for, okay, you know, this drug is affecting the mitochondria this way, which is decreasing the ATP, which is causing the cells to either apoptose or necrose. In this model, we're more interested in understanding how the drug is circulating throughout the body. Throughout the body. And so these are just a large system of differential equations models. And on the left-hand side, you have the graphical interpretation. And so, really, what we're doing is compartmentalizing the human body. So you have a compartment for the venous blood, you have the compartment for the arterial blood, and then all of the different tissues of the body. You can even kind of personalize this depending on what you want to look at. We have things called minimal PBPK models, and you can have, you know, Models, and you can have a couple of different tissues represented, and then you can cluster all of the rest depending on the application. And so, the way this model works, you can see that if you have an IV administration, the drug gets deposited into this compartment. It flows through the lungs back here and then into the arterial blood compartment, which then it can flow into all of these different tissues. And so, what we're looking at here is not only flow into the tissues, but then actually partitioning into those tissues. That's how the drug. Partitioning into those tissues. That's how the drug is going to stay in those different tissues. And that kind of model within the tissue, within the compartment, will differ depending on the drug. These are different properties of the drug. If it's perfusion limited, it's limited by blood flow. The model will look one way. And if it's permeability limited, meaning the drug is large and it's going to, you know, has to permeate through the tissue, then you're going to have a different kind of model for how the tissue looks. And then, here, if you have, let's say, an orally absorbed drug, it's going to get deposited into the gut and go through the liver again, where that major clearance mechanism is, and then flow through the venous blood, and you know, then it can start circulating around. So, this is kind of at a high level what these kind of PBBK models look like. And you can even go so far as to make a more mechanistic gut absorption model because, you know, you have a lot of orally absorbed drugs and it's very important to be able to capture those dynamics. To be able to capture those dynamics with inside the gut. And so, here this is the ACAT model in GastroPlus, which is the software from Simulations Plus. And so, the gut is just, they've, in that previous model, was just one compartment, but actually, your gut is your stomach and your small and large intestine. And so, what they've done here is divided that gut compartment into nine different compartments. You have your stomach, they've divided the small intestine up into five components, and then the large intestine into two components. Large intestine into two components. And so within each of those compartments, your drug can exist in one of three states. It can either be unreleased, undissolved, or dissolved. But the drug can only be absorbed into your system once it's dissolved. And so it's really important to capture in what part of your small intestine is that drug going to be dissolved because that's going to change the absorption kinetics, how much it gets absorbed. So you can have these really detailed models that can capture a lot of the reality of the system. System. And so these models can be used to answer a lot of different questions, but in particular, they're mostly used to answer dosing questions. And so talking, if we go back to that visualization of the drug development pipeline, you have to at one point go from animals to humans. And so you make a prediction about what the dose should be in animals. And what you're going to want to do is scale that into humans. How can you do that? There's a couple of different ways to do it, but here is one of them. So what you're going to do is you're going to take all So, what you're going to do is you're going to take all of the data that you've collected in your non-clinical species, and you're going to fit one of these PBPK models to that data. And you're going to get drug-specific properties. So, like, let's say absorption rate of the drug. And then you're going to take that PBPK model that's been fit to your preclinical species, and you're actually going to do physiological scaling to get to the human. So, you know, scale organ weights, blood flows from the preclinical species to what they are known to be in humans, because all that data is known. Humans, because all that data is known. And then you're going to have a model that is predictive of humans. And so now you can actually predict what that dose should be in humans before you even go into your clinical trial. And so hopefully you'll have a more successful clinical trial at that point. Another way that we can use this, which is very similar, is predicting your doses in pediatric populations. So again, it's quite difficult to be able to get enough pediatric volunteers for a clinical trial. So instead of doing that, let's actually model. So, instead of doing that, let's actually model how this drug would behave in the pediatric population. And so, this kind of scaling is very similar. You take all of the information that you have in the adult population, because you're always going to run these clinical trials in adults. You fit the model to the adult data to get the drug-specific properties, and then you do some physiological scaling to get to the pediatric population. And then you have a model that works and hopefully predicts very well in the pediatric population. So, not only can we do this kind of scaling, but these models are really important to look at drug interactions. And so, if you, let's say, like I said, drugs can interact with other drugs, food, different medical conditions. So, like I talked about before, it's very unlikely that someone's going to be just taking one drug. And it's very crucial to understand how this drug can interact with other drugs. And a lot of clinical trials are dedicated to looking at. Trials are dedicated to looking at how this drug interacts with different kinds of inhibitors and inducers. There's a lot you have to look at. But modeling and simulation can actually take the place of these clinical trials, and it has. So this is not a new concept. It is being put into place. It can just be difficult sometimes. Food effects. There are clinical trials dedicated to how does food affect this drug? So not only can some food interact with, let's say, the clearance mechanism, but food changes the pH. But food changes the pH of the stomach, which will change the absorption of the drug. It can change the volume in the stomach, which will also affect the absorption. Different medical conditions. So, if you are hepatically impaired, which means you have liver impairment, you're not going to clear this drug very well. Let's say you have renal impairment. Again, these are all facets that are dedicated to clinical trials because it's really important to have an understanding of how these different nuances within the population will affect your drug absorption, which again, Your drug absorption, which again affects, you know, how the drug is going to work inside your body. But, like I said, there are instances where modeling and simulation have replaced some of these clinical trials. So we can save people time by doing this, and it is done. And so finally, kind of the overall umbrella is that we're looking at these different, we're looking at these different modeling exercises, but we're doing this within a clinical trial simulation. This is within a clinical trial simulation. So we can create virtual patient populations based on data that's readily available in the literature. So we can find, you know, female body weight to height, and we can create a whole population that can capture the range of what we see in the literature. So we don't have to go out and find, let's say, a female patient population that has these exact specifics. We can create them and run these models with these created patients. We can look at age versus. We can look at age versus adipose tissue. And so we have that distribution. So we can create a virtual patient population that has the real distribution. Same with age and liver weight. So again, there's a lot of information in the literature available to parameterize a virtual patient population that is really representative of, let's say, a clinical trial or maybe a clinical trial that you would want to hold, but you can't find the right volunteers. You can create these people to be what you need them to be in order to test. You need them to be in order to test the limits of your model. All right, so I just want to wrap up with how, you know, these are my ideas about how to use modeling and simulation in drug development to prepare for the next pandemic. So, you know, one of the thoughts that I had is using modeling and simulation as soon as possible. So typically when we have a client come to us, they're one of two people. Client comes to us, they're one of two people. They're either someone that, you know, understands how modeling can help them and they want to get started from the ground up and they're very excited about this, or we have someone that's gone to the FDA and they have no modeling or simulation in their, you know, their packet of information and the FDA says, no, you need to do some modeling. And so they come to us at the last minute and they say, the FDA says we need some modeling. And so those people are kind of who we need to target because they could have had modeling and simulation done. Have had modeling and simulation done early, and that would really help them throughout their drug development pipeline. And so, kind of the first part of this is: if you use modeling and simulation as soon as possible, you can avoid spending time developing a drug that will ultimately maybe be proven to be ineffective or unsafe, you know, once you get to clinical trials. If you use modeling and simulation as soon as possible, you can build a model that can be used to answer many different questions. So, if you think about that PBBK model that we created. About that PBBK model that we created to predict your first inhuman dose, that same model, once you have that adult model, can then be used to extrapolate to a pediatric population. That same model in the adults can be used to do a drug-drug interaction study. So there's a lot of different questions that this one model can answer. And so once you have it, you know, you can use it throughout the drug development process. The second point that I think it would be helpful is to repurpose existing models. So a lot of information exists in the literature, and let's not reinvent the wheel. And let's not reinvent the wheel. Let's, you know, take what's already exists, maybe make it better, add more data, things like that. The RhenaSim model is an example of this repurposing. So they had this liver injury model that they noticed had kind of the same aspects that they needed for a kidney injury model. And so they just repurposed it rather than making a kidney injury model from the ground up. So things like that. And so finally, I think this is something that we all do is developing interdisciplinary collaborations. So we can't all Operations. So we can't all do it by ourselves. You know, I don't know anything about the chemistry. So, you know, I need someone on the team to help me with that aspect of the modeling. And so I think developing these interdisciplinary collaborations is really going to help us, especially, you know, you might have someone that's from a completely different field and knows about different literature and that, you know, can help you find something that'll be able to answer your question. And so, kind of what I said at the beginning, maybe a lot of this isn't applicable to. Maybe a lot of this isn't applicable to everyone in this room because you guys are mostly in academia, and unless you have a compound that you're trying to get to market, maybe this isn't a lot of information that's useful to you. But, like I said at the beginning, I think maybe the way to frame this is you're interacting with policymakers and they're interacting with people that are looking at developing drugs. And this is kind of the questions that they're looking at, the kinds of models that they're looking at. And so, maybe if you have an understanding of that, you can kind of help frame your modeling and how you're talking to them about it, maybe include some of this. You're talking to them about it, maybe include some of this in your modeling. And so, I just want to end with some resources in case you are interested. These are kind of, you know, papers or different software. The FDA SIPA model is actually on GitHub, and you can download it yourself and run it. I've done it, so it's not too difficult. A lot of information about PBBK modeling and drug discovery and virtual clinical trials, if that's something you're interested in. If that's something you're interested in. So, thank you so much. And any questions that you have, I'll welcome them.
