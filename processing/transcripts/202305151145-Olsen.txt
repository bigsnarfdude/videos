So, well, we have now Mika Olsen, who's going to speak about using geometric properties to color levy graphs of generalized quadrangles. Thank you so much, and thank you for this wonderful workshop. It's my first time in Canada, and I think it's very, very beautiful. I will talk about colourings of lady graphs. Colorings of lady graphs, and it's a joint work with Diego and Napoleon at the other table. And we will use finite geometries. I think all of the basic definitions were already defined in the previous talks, so I will not go into details. And for graph theory, we only need piper type graphs, KT graphs and KT h's. And what we use is from finite geometry, we use avoids spreads and distance are avoids or distance are spreads. The avoids is a set of points which is Which is at maximum distance between each pair of points, and the spreads is the same but for lines. And maybe the distance R avoids or distance R spreads is when it's not necessarily the maximum distance, the maximum possible distance, but a distance R. And the context. And the concept that we need in graph theory is degree, distance, and diameter, and that's all. And this photo is from Kamloops. No, Kamlups. When we came here, we take this wonderful train from Vancouver to Panff and we made a stop for the night in... For the night in camp loops, and there was a lot of morals, and one of them had this cage, so it was like... It's a good thing you took the train. Yeah. But when we put these things together, we have the linigraphs. They are the incident graphs. So we have points and lines, and we put an edge between a point and a line. A point and a line if they are incidents. So when we have a projective plane of order Q, we have a Q plus 1 6 cage. When we have a generalized quadrangle of order Q, we have a Q plus 1 8 cage. And if we have a generalized hexagon of order Q, then we have a Q plus 1 12 cage. And we can we have used two kinds of colourings. They are somehow related. Both of them have applications of assigning frequencies to radio stations. And the first one is the packing chromatic column. What we what if when we you When you have vertices of color i, they must be of distance i plus one. So the idea if it's they are close, then their colors may be more or less close. The difference between the colours are not that big. But if they are far apart, their colours must also be the difference between the colours is also big. We colour with numbers. With numbers. And one thing that is easy to see is that if you have a vertex of color bigger than the diameter, then it's a singular class. I cannot have two vertices of the same color if the distance between them, no, if the color is equal to the diameter. And for projective planes, we proved that the best that you cannot color with less than Q squared plus Q plus 2 and that is also the best coloring. We have a colouring where with all the lines we call them both a single. We colored them with a single color and the rest of them with different colors. This result, the proof of this result, use another result from other authors that say that if it is 5 part side and the diameter is 3, then the chromatic packing number is. Packing number is found so that well, we use this result. And for the daily graphs of classic generalized potangles, we prove that the best we can do is all the lines, we call them. We colour them one color, and we have the best we can do is that the vertices of color two is an avoid, and the vertices of color three is an avoid, and the rest of them have different colors. So, that is what we used for the lower bound, and for the upper bound, we found a colouring. No, it's me. We found the colouring, but the two avoids intersects. Okay, so we have an upper bound and the lower bound. And it is known that for odd powers of Q, if Q is an odd prime power, and we have Power and we have a classic generalized quadrangle, then the avoidance intersects. And if Q is even prime power with at most 64, which is at most 64, then the avoids does also intersect. So They attain the lower bound, and the upper bound is only possible if we have to avoid that does not intersect. But it's an open problem whenever Q is a prime, even prime power of at least six to four. Okay, and we have for the generalized hexagons. Generalized hexagons when Q is an odd prime power, which is at least 9, then we have this lower bound and this upper bound. And essentially what we did was bound the avoids, the two avoids, three avoids, four avoids, five avoids, and the avoids the number of vertices to the lower bound, to find the lower bound. Bound to find the lower bound, and for the upper bound, we found a nice coloring. But as you can see, there is a big gap between the lower bound and the upper bound. So one of the questions that we propose is one could be improve this upper bound and lower bound. Another problem could be to try to extend these results for. To extend these results for non-classic quadrangles. For the packing chromatic number, that's and the other coloring is the LHK coloring. Once again, we assign the colors integers, but we include the Integers, but we include the zero, which caused some problems. But that is in this case, we are only we are only restrictions for adjacent vertices and vertices of distance two. So if So if we have two adjacent vertices, the colours must differ in at least h, and if they are distance two, the colours must differ in at least k. And this LHK chromatic number is the smallest number of colours or the smallest number of the span of colours because in this kind of colourings we in this kind of colorings we it's we don't use not necessary not necessarily we use all the colors maybe we skip some colors because they cannot be assigned due to the to the restrictions so we find in one of those surveys that the Levy graph of projective planes for the 21 L21 coloring is Q square plus one Q square plus one. And so what we did was to try to extend this result for the L H K chromatic number. Okay, and what we proved was that if H is small, smaller than or equal to 2K, then the L, the chromatic HK HK coloring is K times Q square plus Q and it's the same case when H is bigger than 2K, but Q is bound up by this. And when Q is not bound below by this, then By this, then we have this bumps. And in some special case, when the cage admits a structure that we call staircase structure. Then we also have this case, but I didn't include it because it's like case one, two. Page one, two classic quadrangles. We found these bounds, this lower bound and upper bound. So once again, a problem could be to improve this. To improve this upper and lower bound for the projective planes, to improve the upper and lower bound for the generalized radicals, and to study this parameter for the non-classic generalized gravan quadrangles. Gravan quadrangles. And I would just like to mention another result that we have. When we were studying this colouring, the way that we colored the lines and the points, we We discovered that what we were doing really that we were given a partition in a kind of TAC structure. It's called TAC structure because Gabi have a paper of TAC structure in projective planes. So it's like the same idea. Same idea. We have each petal is an avoid, all of them intersection in exactly one point. And the steams are the points of the lines that intersects exactly one point. Okay, and for the lines, we have a similar, but not that nice. That nice structure, and we call it a sunflower structure because it has a pea center and a lot of small petals, and it also have harvest peaks. So, this were the structures that we used to color the lines, and the structure that we used to color the points, and that gave us. And that gave us the upper bound for the L H K albar. And well, I put the four problems that we think that would be nice to solve. Excellent. Thank you very much, Pika. Are there any questions or remarks for Mika? I remember a question that you used to have in the other impacting, but I don't even remember that, but it's probably interesting. Do you have an open question for the for the uh fan play I remember that we have you have a gap? We have a gap between some corner in the projective plane in the hebrew graph or no, in he would graph now, but in when because I think that it was a question. That's why I remember what was. I think it's this one. Yeah, but you have the graph. I remember. No, no, no, that wasn't the well. Ah, no, no. Okay, yeah, that's the. Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah, that's the when we uh that's another colouring. Uh-huh. The colouring of the edges. The rainbow colouring? Maybe you can say it to the people because it's a very nice question and that was probably some people here. And it's easy because it's for kilo. Yeah, it's a six or seven. I think it's six is the lower bound, seven is the upper bound, but we don't know which of them. But what is in rainbow colouring? Rainbow colouring, but a path is a rainbow path if each edge has different colour. And the colouring of when you have a graph which has an edge coloring, we say it is rainbow connected if there's a rainbow path between any pair. Rainbow path between any pair of vertices. And a graph is three rainbow edge connected. If between every vertex there are exactly three rainbow paths, that does not intersect. So the three rainbow connection, which is not about if it's connected to the graph, but About if it's connected, the graph, but really about the coloring. So we don't know what the exact number of the three rainbow edge connection number of the hue. Either six or seven. You take one pads between any pair of graphic and you color in all the paths and you don't know if you can have to use six or seven. Use six or seven. I don't remember if the problem is five, six or six, seven. But it's, I think it's six, seven, no? It sounds very easy, but but maybe here there's a lot of people who knows a lot of things about finite geometry, so maybe for them it's easier. Any other questions, remarks? If not, I guess we can thank you.
