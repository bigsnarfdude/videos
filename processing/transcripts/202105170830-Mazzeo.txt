Okay, I guess it's time to start. It's a pleasure to introduce Rave Matziel, who will talk about AHG spaces and the Hitchin equations. Hey, so hopefully everybody can see me and hear me. So anyway, it's a pleasure to speak at this conference. Thanks very much to the organizers for the privilege of talking. And I think I had the perfect And I think I had the perfect lead-in to the talk with Roben's talk, which was, you know, I caught the last bit of, and in fact, extremely closely related to precisely my topic. So what I want to talk about today is a set of things. So I'll review some of the things I've been doing over the past several years, hopefully fairly briefly, and try to talk about the new theorem soon. But it's really focusing on one of these very particular types of gravitational instantons that. Gravitational instantons that was being discussed. So, let me remind you that a gravitational instanton for me is so it's four-dimensional, non-compact, complete. Hypercaler manifold. And well, there may be various curvature decay conditions. I'll discuss these momentarily. And so, as you just learned, so I won't review this in any detail. The known ones come in several categories. And of course, there may be some that we don't know. They have exactly one over R squared decay, but they're the ALE spaces that were investigated thoroughly by Kronheimer. Investigated thoroughly by Kronheimer. ALF spaces, which have a three-dimensional tangent cone, which, so they have a circle collapsing under the under the blowdown limit. ALG spaces, these are the ones that I'll be concentrating on. And then a very closely related type ALG star that I've also been thinking about recently. And then ALH and ALH star. So all of these symbols relate to how sort of how big of a Sort of how big of a fiber. So each of these things look like a torus bundle over a cone. And the dimension of the torus and the dimension of the cone add up to four in each case. And so here it's zero and four, three and one, two and two. Here the tori are degenerating in a certain sense. And I may have a time to talk a little bit about this. And then here the tori are three-dimensional and the base is one-dimensional. Is one-dimensional. And here, once again, the tori, the three-dimensional tori, are degenerating in the asymptotic limit as you go to infinity. So, these spaces have been much studied. They're very beautiful, very crystalline objects, and quite a lot is known about them. And the thing I want to focus on is how they might be realized. And so, I'm going to this talk will be coming from the point of view of something that has been informally called the modularity conjecture. And I'll have to be honest, I don't know the precise. And I'll have to be honest, I don't know the precise motivation for this name, but this was due to Phil Bolch. And the conjecture, so maybe don't take the name too seriously, but the conjecture is that all gravitational instantons can be realized as, well, hypercalar reductions or infinite dimensional hypercalar reductions. So let me just say it very informally: all gravitational institutions. It can be realized through gauge theory, or let me say, can be realized as gauge theoretic moduli spaces. This really comes from the physicists, I guess. It probably does. That's exactly right. And there are various reasons why one might want to know this. And in particular, if you've realized something. If you've realized something as a hypercalor reduction, even in the sort of infinite dimensional setting, it can be extraordinarily useful in terms of understanding the certain vector bundles over these gravitational instantons. And they're sort of have a lot more structure than you might initially. Forgive me. So sorry about that. They have a lot more structure than you might originally suspect. So in the nature of Originally suspect. So, in the nature of various vector bundles, representations in these bundles, and so on. So, I'm going to take this as sort of a good motivation without going too much into it. And I'm going to really focus on one particular case of this conjecture that we've established. I should say that there's been a lot of work. There was very, well, there's beautiful work by Cherkis and Kapustin using periodic monopoles and various other contributions over the years, which I'm not going to detail. But I'm going to look at, so today, I'm going to look at so today I'll be looking at ALG spaces of type D4. Okay, so let me tell you what these are geometrically. So it's a two-torus bundle over a two-dimensional cone, and the geometry is actually very simple. And really, the best picture of this was developed by Bicard and Minerbe. And this was a beautiful paper about 10 years ago, where they just implemented a fairly straightforward gluing construction, but they gave this by sort of a process of gluing in sort of simpler models that we understand well. So the starting point is I take the complex plane crossed with any torus and then divide by Z2. Now, partly to answer what Alice was asking at the very end of last talk, you know, you can start off with sort of a construction like Start off with sort of a construction like this when you're, excuse me, I don't mean Z2 that way, I mean Z2 that away. So just plus or minus one. You know, any torus admits an involution. But if you look at sort of other finite groups, Z3, Z4, and so on, then it's only very special tori that admit these things. So when you divide out, or as Robin was saying, if you sort of look at the monodromy at infinity, so if I look at this thing, here's the C cross C mod Z. C cross C mod Z two and then over here I have a torus bundle and as I go around infinity the monodrome is plus or minus one or is in fact minus the identity okay so uh you know this is the base picture it's obviously a singular orbifold and uh out near infinity it looks like a non-trivial Tutorus bundle over a circle or over an annulus okay so what happens near the base point here well if I look at the the central fiber Well, if I look at the central fiber, if I look over Z cross over the zero cross T2, modulo Z2, there are four orbifold points. This just corresponds to T2 modulo Z2 being a copy of P1 or S2. And there are four points where, so here's just a copy of our friend S2, and there's four ramification points. And at each of these, locally, And at each of these locally, well, locally, the whole picture. So, if I look at this bit sort of enlarged by the Cross Z2 picture, so locally, this looks like C2 modulo Z2. Okay, so I have two directions, one on the on S2 and the other sort of in the other C direction, dividing out by Z2. And so these are an orbifold points, and there's sort of a well-known and classical way to resolve these. So I resolve. So I resolve via the Aguchi-Hansen space. So Aguchi-Hansen is a resolution of C2 mod Z2. Blown up. There are various descriptions of it. It's an ALE space, which looks like S3 mod Z2 at infinity. And there's an exceptional curve. There's a copy of P1 sitting there somewhere inside. So, you know, what I'm doing is I'm gluing on. Know what I'm doing is I'm gluing on four of these things, and there are various parameters when I do that, but I have a space that, roughly speaking, looks like that. And let me finally draw you a picture of how you should think about the whole space. So I'm going to flatten out the cone so I can uniformize C mod Z2. So I'm going to think of the C mod Z2 as just a copy of the complex plane. And every point outside of the origin is going to look, is going to have a torus sitting over it. But over the origin, But over the origin, I have exactly this configuration sitting over it: namely, I have a sphere resolved at four points. And so, what that's going to look like is a sphere with four other spheres glued on. So, this is the D4 I was mentioning. So, the D4 affine-Dinkin diagram is given by this diagram. So, each of these dots represents a copy of a sphere. There's edges here. The intersection number of each of these spheres, each of the outer spheres of the inner sphere is plus. Of the outer spheres with the inner sphere is plus one, and each of these spheres has self-intersection number minus two. So, somehow, what's happening is that as I look here, so this is a non-trivial torus bundle. So, again, as I go around the origin in a circle of any radius, the torus comes back to itself with a reflection. And if I look at the sort of collapsing, I mean, this gives a very nice picture of what might happen, for example, in a Gromov compactness limit. Gromov compactness limit. You know, you have this torus which is kind of collapsing to this five spheres in a particular configuration. Okay, so you know, how am I supposed to picture the whole space? Well, you know, there it is. I can think of the complex plane with these torus bundles everywhere and this thing in the middle, et cetera. Okay, so that's the ALG space that I'll take. Now, already it appeared in Picard Minerb's paper that obviously there are parameters. Paper that obviously there are parameters depending on how you glue in the Gucci-Hansen space. And you can get an informal count of how many parameters there are in their gluing construction. And I'll sort of mention in a moment that it's a 12-dimensional family, which they see. Their approach doesn't sort of obviously say that the full space of hyperkalarometrics of this topological geometric type are 12-dimensional, but one can prove that analytically. So I'll mention that. Analytically. So I'll mention that in a few moments. So let me just say a few more words about the space. So the space X is, you know, it's completely, well, as I've given it, there's no metric on it. And what Bikard Minerb do is show is at least for very small gluons, so of course the gluing regime is when these exceptional curves are very small, you know, it has a hyperkiller metric. And in fact, there's a much larger family of hyperkillar. In fact, there's a much larger family of hyperkiller metrics, which I'll mention in just a moment. And so, what can I say about it topologically? So, H2 of X, the absolute homology is Z5. It's generated by these five spheres. And kind of more relevant is H2 of X, rel boundary X, at Z4. And this is generated by the four outer spheres. I'm going through this because we'll use some of this later on. So, just to be sort of very clear, if I let the central sphere be S0 and then S1, S2, S3, and S4, the relation one has is that 2S0 plus S1 plus S2 plus S3 plus S4 is equal to a T2 fiber or homologous to a T2 fiber. Okay, so in other words, as I take these fibers near the origin, is I take these fibers near the origin, they can be connected homologously to this thing. Why do I have two times S zero? Well, that's exactly the double cover of that central sphere. So that's the reason. Okay, so because of this relationship, and then T2 can obviously be pulled out to infinity. So in this relative cohomology, that's zero, the T2. So this whole sum is equal to zero in relative cohomology. Okay. Okay. Okay, so how can we think about this in other ways? So, as I presume was mentioned, and of course is fairly well known, there was a land-breaking work by Shushong Chen and Gao Chen in about 2015, where they looked at the class of gravitational instantons. So, let me be in particular an ALG. So, an ALG gravitational instanton with faster than quadratic curvature decay. So, the curvature decays like r to the minus 2 minus epsilon. And what they proved in that case was that it can be compactified to. So I start off with this gravitational instant. Then there's a compactification x-bar, which is a rational elliptic surface. Rational elliptic surface. So x-bar is equal to a rational elliptic surface. And x itself, so the part that you're adding on. So if I take x, it's going to look like x bar minus s, where s is a singular fiber. Okay, so a rational elliptic surface is p2 blown up at a certain number of points. And if you can do multiple lopes at a point, you can have sort of Multiple vopes at a point, you can have sort of complicated singular fibers of exactly the type that I described, but you're always thinking of these as elliptic vibrations with a certain number of singular fibers over p1. And so in this case, in this d4 case that I described above, whose geometry I described above, so you have two singular fibers. So X bar has two singular fibers. Singular fibers. The one over zero is what's called the I0 star fiber, which is exactly the one I've drawn. And the fiber at infinity, the one that I'm removing here, is also I0 star. So this is kind of a very nice symmetric example. In other cases, you have sort of a duality between these. So this is the I0 star is a type of singular fiber from Kodira's classification. Singular fiber from Kodaira's classification, and it's just this sort of arrangement of five spheres, as I've talked about. So, you know, what happens is you think of, you know, here's the rational elliptic surface, and I have sort of two complicated fibers, and everything else is smooth. So it actually is a very simple geometric picture. There's some sort of duality then between these two different singular fibers. And if I have a different type of singular fiber here, there might be a different. Type of singular fiber here, there might be a different one at infinity. And as we'll talk about later, so this is infinity and this is zero. These ALG spaces come in families where, in fact, what happens is that the singular fiber at infinity stays put. It stays exactly of this type I0 star, but this one will sort of spread out and it'll dissolve into sort of a combination of actually up to six singular fibers. So this is a very classical picture, but this is kind of the extreme example that you can construct as a Example that you can construct as a resolution. Okay, so what I want to talk about then is a space which I'm going to call MALG. And this is the space of all hypercalar matrix of ALG type on this space X. So I'm implicitly allowing the complex structure to vary everything down. Structure to vary, everything to vary. And I'm also, I won't say this explicitly, but I'm going to allow orbifolds in here. So when I look at this whole family of things, and according to the usual Einstein compactness theory, there may be orbifold limits. And we'll see exactly how those might arise in terms of this picture. Okay, so work which Gao Chen described to me in the fall that was ongoing with him, Jeff. With him, Jeff Yaklovsky, and Obing, is that one can actually understand this moduli space. And so they obviously prove a much more general theorem talking about all of these different ALG types. But in particular, this one, which has, so by the way, in terms of these angles that Zhang had discussed, this is exactly the case where the angle of the cone is pi. So it's 2 pi divided by 2. That's the Z2. By two. That's the Z2. Okay. So they showed that there was actually a classification of elements in this MALG via the Turelli parameters. So let me describe the Torelli parameters. Okay, so I have the four outer spheres. So I have the four outer spheres, Si, I goes from one to four, the outer spheres. And I should say that, you know, as, well, in terms of the intersection matrix and the topology, these outer spheres are always well defined. So they're the things that sort of have intersection number plus one with the inner sphere, but zero intersection number with each other. Okay, so I have these four spheres that do not intersection. Okay, so I have these four spheres that do not intersect each other, but they all are intersecting the central sphere. And what I do is map these to the integral over SI of the first of the hypercalor triple, the Kayler form associated to the complex structure i, the Kayler structure, the period of the Kayler structure j, omega j over s i, and then the integral of omega k over si. So in other words, given a hyperkalar metric, I have Given a hyperkalar metric, I have these three forms, omega i, omega j, and omega k, which determine the hyperkalar structure. So if I know these, then I know the hyperkalar structure. And the claim is, is that by knowing the integrals of these over these four different spheres, so this goes, I goes from one to four, this completely determines the ALG metric. So one of the things if I understood, at least when One of the things that I understood, at least when Gao was telling me about this work some time ago, was that they have uniqueness. And they had a very clever argument for uniqueness. So, namely, if you have two hyperkalar metrics with the same periods in this sense, then in fact, they had to be the same. But my understanding, at least, and they may have improved this theorem, was that they didn't have existence for the full set of parameters. So, certainly locally. So, Bicard Minerb's arguments say that you realize all of these locally near zero. So, when these spheres are very So when these spheres are very tiny, I guess what happens is that S0 is sort of fairly large, but the S1, S2, S3, and S4 can have very small areas in the gluing regime, and you got the full 12 parameter family. And so what this theorem is saying is that, in fact, it's entirely a 12 parameter family, and that's it. So it's a 12 dimensional space. And there's some domain in R12, which is given by the natural constraints on this. So I should say that, you know, what are the So I should say that, you know, what are the obvious constraints? Well, if I take twice the integral over S0 of, well, let me just see, how do I want to say this? Yeah, forgive me, maybe I'm not going to say that because I'm going to get the statement right, but there are upper bounds. So these things actually live in a polytope, in fact, in a simplex in R12. Okay. And the point being that adding up these plus, well, so. Plus, well, so basically what's gonna happen is the sum. So maybe I'll just say this, the sum over SI of omega i. Sorry, I'm just forgetting. Sorry, it's my own fault. So again, let me just not say that. I'm forgetting what the right inequality is, but there's a simplex that's going to give me sort of the space of allowable Torelli parameters. Okay. Okay. So what is You know, what is what can one do from here? Well, so let me just write this down specifically. So the real dimension of MALG equals 12. And in fact, you can write down the tangent space of this MALG at any point, at any hypercalorometric G. And what this is going to be is the anti-self-dual harmonic two-forms, L2H minus, tensored with R3. Tensured with R3. Okay, and so let me just, without going through the proof in the interest of time, this can be realized via so Donaldson's methodology, so Donaldson's hypercalar triple method. So this is a very nice formalism, which explains how given a hyperkaler metric, it allows you to show that the hyperkalar deformation problem is unobstructed. Hypercalar deformation problem is unobstructed. This had been known before by various other arguments, but it's a very sort of simple and clean way to understand perturbation theory for hyperkalarometrics. I think there's a very nice write of it several places. I mean, Donaldson himself has a nice little paper about it, and it was used successfully in a paper by Michael Singer and Bern Schroers last year. So there's a good place to read about it, and other places too, which I'm forgetting. Okay, so this is one side of the story. This is a very particular ALG space. Story: This is a very particular ALG space, and I've sort of beat it to death. And so now we'd like to sort of understand what the relationship of this to this modularity conjecture of Boltz. Okay, so let me tell you the other side of the story that I want to tell. And this is the Hitchin equations. So, what I'm going to start off with is a Riemann surface. This is a Riemann surface. And I'm going to assume that it has genus gamma, because I'm using g for other things, and there's possibly a divisor, so possibly with punctures. Okay, so there's this well-known correspondence, which has already been mentioned today, the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence. I'm going to assume that I have a vector bundle over C. Over C. I'll assume that the degree of E is equal to zero for simplicity, and one can do this for other things. And I'm going to look at the following data. I'm going to look at holomorphic structures in this bundle and Higgs fields. So E is a E with a holomorphic structure. I may write it d bar sub J. So this J is not meant to be thought of necessarily as related to the other J I talked about. And so this is a holomorphic structure. Structure. And phi is a Higgs field. So phi is a holomorphic section with respect to this complex structure of C with values in K and let me just say K D squared, where D is the divisor. These are the associated to the punctures. So I have this curve, whatever its genus. I have a certain effective divisor, and I have a I have a Higgs field, and so really you should just think of this phi as a matrix or an endomorphism of the bundle. And so this is E tensor, forgive me, I forgot that. This is an endomorphism of E, but then times DZ. And phi has poles. And in fact, this notation means that phi has simple poles at the points of D. Okay, so there's a stability condition, which I won't write down explicitly in terms of the degrees of line sub-bundles which are preserved by this Higgs field. And so what I want to look at is the space of structures, which are stable. So they only admit certain types of line sub bundles. I mean, it limits the degrees of line sub bundles. Limits the degrees of line sub-bundles. Modulo, the complex gauge group. What is the complex gauge group in this action? Well, so this is uh, so I should just say the rank of E is equal to two, and I want to fix a Hermitian metric. So fix a Hermitian metric, which I won't write down explicitly on E. And so I'm looking for gauge transformations which preserve this. So G sub C is an SL2C gauge group. Okay, so I can con. Okay, so I can conjugate essentially the complex structure, and I can conjugate the Higgs field by these gauge transformations, which really essentially just maps from C into SL2C, the curve C into SL2C. Okay, so this space is called the Dolbo moduli space. So this is a space of, it's given purely in terms of holomorphic data. And so the famous Kobeshi-Hitchin correspondence relates this to Relates this to a different space, which is a space of connections and Higgs fields. Okay, so A is a connection, a unitary connection, I should say. And phi is a Higgs field, satisfying the Hitchin equations. So such that, so the Hitchin equations are that the curvature of A plus few edge V. plus phi wedge v star is equal to zero and then d bar of a if v equals zero. Okay and I have to and excuse me I need to divide out by a gauge group again and so I'm dividing out by a gauge group here. G is the SU2 gauge group. Okay, so this is a very beautiful correspondence. It says that, you know, given any Riemann surface and a bundle over it, I can look at either of these moduli spaces. So this is sort of the gauge theoretic moduli space. The other one is purely in terms of holomorphic data. So I'm going to call this M Hitchen. And these things are actually diffeomorphic. So a basic theorem is that M, and this is due to Hitchen and Sim. Due to Hitchen and Simpson, it's been worked on enormously over the past 35 years, but it says that this M Dolbo is diffeomorphic to M Hitchen. And in fact, there's a third moduli space, Durom. I'm not going to sort of spend much time in this. So this is also a diffeomorphism. This is the SL2C character variety. In other words, it corresponds to flat complex connections over the curve. Okay, so I'm going to just mention that parenthetically, but that doesn't enter our story very much, so I won't dwell on it. Okay, so the so a lot is known about this. Let me just tell you in general a few facts, which you all probably know well. Which you all probably know well. So, the real dimension of the Hitchin moduli space. Now, one thing I have not specified is what happens at the divisors, other than saying that one has simple poles. So, I describe this here. So, there are actually what amounts to boundary conditions, these poles. So, I will describe those quite explicitly. But you want to think about these Higgs fields and connections as being somehow having a certain type of singularity prescription. So, this is like in a lot of other mean field, singular mean field equations and so on. Field singular mean field equations and so on. You have a certain type of singularity prescription or boundary value at each of these device at each point of the divisor. Okay, so for the moment, let me just say these are fixed and I'll come to what those are in just a moment. Okay, so the real dimension of this is equal to 12 times the genus minus 12 plus four times the number of points in the divisor. So it's a very high-dimensional space. And as is well known, for example, when the genus is greater than or equal to When the genus is greater than or equal to two and the divisor is zero, this is exactly double the dimension of the Teichmüller space. And the Teichmüller space actually sits inside of here as a very natural submanifold associated to the group SL2R inside of SL2C. So there's a lot of beautiful structure here. Quite a lot is known about the geometry and topology of these spaces. Let me just say a few of the salient points. So this itched moduli space O is fibers over B, which is the space of B, which is the space of H0 of C k squared. This is just an affine space. This is a space of quadratic differentials with a given singularity type. Okay, so this is the map pi. This map pi, in terms of the description of elements being equivalence classes of connection, comma Higgs field, is just comma Higgs field is just taking a connection comma Higgs field to the determinant of phi because phi is essentially a two by two matrix times dz its determinant looks like a number or a holomorphic function or a meromorphic function times dz squared so that's what i have here so this is really something of the form f of z times dz squared okay and these are the space of holomorphic uh differentials of quadratic differentials of a very particular type uh namely this Type, namely the singularity prescription is going to be something specific on the Riemann surface. So this is an affine space, which is going to be exactly half this dimension. The fiber of this is going to be, you know, T6 gamma minus 6 plus 2 mod D. Okay, so this thing always has a torus vibration, and the base space actually has interesting structures. So here, let me draw a picture down here. Here's the base space. Picture down here. Here's the base space. There's a very interesting submanifold in here. In fact, it's a conic variety, lambda. This is called the discriminant locus. And what's happening is over every point away from the discriminant locus, the fiber of this Hitchin map, so this is called the Hitchin map or the Hitchin vibration, every fiber of the Hitchin vibration is going to be a regular. Fiber of the hitch and fibration is going to be a regular torus, but over these points, it's going to be a noded torus of some sort. And various, you know, you can drop, you know, you can have nodes of various types as you approach this discriminant locus. So it's some sort of singular torus vibration, and, you know, it's a rather intricate object. And so I want to immediately specify to the case that I'm interested in where the geometry becomes a lot simpler. So in our case, I'm going to look at the curve being P1, namely S2. Being p1, namely s2, and d consisting of four points, which I'm going to think of as 0, 1, p naught, and infinity. Okay, so here's my model. Here's my Riemann surface. There's four points in this Riemann surface. This might look like that central sphere I talked about earlier, and that's not an accident, as it turns out, though, in a sort of a non-obvious way. And what I'm going to get is that the history. Going to get is that the Hitchen moduli space in this case is going to be six times the genus, excuse me, 12 times the genus minus 12. So that's negative 12 plus four times the number of points in divisor. So it's minus 12 plus 16. This is actually four. So I have a four-dimensional space. Okay, so this was called the toy model by Hausel, and it's been studied by many people as kind of the very simplest example of such a thing. Simplest example of such a thing. Now, something which I haven't told you is that the Hitchen moduli space always carries a complete hyperkiller metric. G L2, it's given by some sort of Vay-Peterson description. So it's kind of a very natural thing. And again, this thing has arisen as a sort of a quotient. So remember, I just find this way up here. So remember, I defined this way up here as this quotient of what really amounts to an affine space divided by a group. And so I can think of this as an infinite-dimensional hyperkalar quotient. And as such, it inherits just by kind of a very general procedure, it inherits a metric, which always carries a hyperkalar structure locally. You don't know too much about the global structure of that metric. And one of the Hitchin's theorems in his original paper was that, in fact, this is a complete metric. Complete metric. Okay. And in fact, what happens, you have this mapping pi from m itching to this base, this affine space of a certain dimension. This is a holomorphic vibration. And in fact, this thing is hypercalar. And this is a proper mapping, I should have said before, which is kind of obvious from the picture I had before. Okay, so how does this simplify the picture I had above? Well, in this case, Had above well, in this case, the discriminant locus is a finite set of points. So, a finite set of points. I shouldn't put a finite set of points. And in fact, there can be only up to six points. So, I have a copy of the complex plane. That's the five. This is the space B here. And there's going to be a certain number of points. There can be at most six of them. And what's happening is that over. And what's happening is that over a general point, away from these six points, I'm going to have an ordinary torus fiber. Over these points, I have a noted torus fiber. And in fact, this is sort of the simplest type of singularity that a singular vibration can have, just where you have a simple double point, you know, an ordinary double point in this torus fiber. So it looks like an immersed P1 with a double point. Okay, so here's our space. And Here's our space. And this is reminiscent of what we talked about. And in certain cases, and these are going to depend on these boundary conditions at the divisor that I talked about. In certain cases, these fibers can collapse into one. And there's some extreme case or cases, in fact, where all of these singular fibers have collapsed into one. And I get exactly the picture that I described before. So this should be thought of as a generalization of this ALG picture I talked about before. Okay, well, so to. Okay, well, so to make that comparison, so there was a theorem that I proved with Aura Fredrickson, Jan Swoboda, and Hartmutt Weiss, which basically says that this M, with respect to this L2 metric, is always ALG of type D4. Okay, so I mentioned that this was called the toy model. This is the very lowest dimensional hyperkaler space you can get. And I'm taking kind of the simplest curve. I'm taking the sphere minus, in some sense, the smallest number of points where things become non-rigid. So if I took a sphere minus three points, then that sort of things would collapse. So I have the simplest kind of base geometry, the curve and the divisor, and I get the lowest dimensional hypergalar space, and it always turns out to be one of these. Space, and it always turns out to be one of these ALG spaces. Okay, so there's a lot that can be said about the metric geometry here, and I'll say just a few words now and then sort of move on. But so, there was a conjecture in the physics community. This is due to Gayoto Moronitska. They gave a very precise description for this L2 metric. Precise description for this L2 metric. And it said that this L2 metric is very well approximated by something called the semi-flat metric. So this is kind of, again, this type of picture is familiar in hypercaler geometry, but there's a metric which is flat on each of these fibers, these torus fibers, and has perhaps a more complicated geometry in the base space, but then plus some correction terms. And they conjectured that there was going to be a set of correction terms. And I'm going to sort of very roughly. terms and I'm going to sort of very roughly say C gamma e to the minus R times lambda, maybe call C gamma J, lambda gamma J times H gamma J. So these are metrics. This is a metric on the space. This is supposed to be an asymptotic description as you go to infinity. The motivation for this theorem came out of physics very directly. And so these terms Very directly. And so these terms actually all have, you know, rather interesting meaning. But the important thing is that there's exponential decay to the semi-flat metric. And in fact, these coefficients here turn out to be related to Donaldson-Thomas invariance in a certain Calabiot threefold. And in some sense, there's a recipe for cooking up all of these terms here. But in particular, there's sort of a sharp rate of decay, which is predicted, which is going to be given by, again, part of their prescription. And we know exactly what that number. Prescription, and we know exactly what that number is. And so we verified, so we, the same group of people, so we verified this in this one special case. Namely, this four-dimensional space, I mean, this conjecture is supposed to be for general higher-dimensional Hitchin moduli spaces. And there's a lot of interesting complications of what happens. Interesting complications of what happens near infinity around this discriminate locus that I talked about. But in this four-dimensional case, the discriminate locus stays contained in a compact set, which is why it makes it much more tractable. Okay, so I just wanted to mention that, but just to say that we have some fairly definitive results, at least in some special cases here. And I should tell you about sort of what I call the boundary conditions. At these four points, 0, 1, p naught, and infinity. Okay, so it turns out that these are regulated by four numbers. So there's going to be alpha one, alpha two, alpha three, and alpha four. So corresponding to these four points. So at every point, I specify a real number, and each of these numbers is between zero and one half. Okay, and there's also going to be, so I'll call this vector alpha, and there's also going to be a And there's also going to be a vector c so this is uh zero one half to the fourth c1 c2 c three and c four and these are in uh c four okay the alphas are called uh real masses and the cj are called complex masses and uh so roughly what they're meaning is is that each alpha j Roughly, what they're meaning is that each alpha j corresponds to the monodromy of the connection of so the um of the uh unitary connection. So let me call this d sub A. This is the unitary connection around the corresponding point PJ. Okay, and then CJ is going to. Okay, and then Cj is going to be something a little bit different. So remember, I took this determinant of phi j, and phi j has simple poles. So this thing is going to look like some function, excuse me, determinant of phi, forgive me. This is going to look like a function f of z times dz squared. Now, near pj, this thing could have at most a double pole because if phi has a simple pole and it's a two by two matrix of meromorphic functions with simple poles, then the determinant can have at most double pole. Than the determinant can have at most double poles. And it turns out that this f of z look like cj squared, in fact, divided by z minus pj squared plus higher order things. Okay, so in other words, this is the residue. So if I have a quadratic differential, so if I take dz squared over z squared, then the coefficient of this, c squared, is a completely invariant thing. It's independent of choice of local holomorphic coordinate. I can't scale it away. A coordinate, I can't scale it away. So that's a well-defined quantity, and it or its square root is exactly what's called a complex mass. Okay, so these are the boundary conditions. So, you know, without belaboring the point, I'm looking for connections in the Higgs field, which have exactly these types of boundary conditions. So the connection has a specified monodromy around these around these singular points, and the Higgs field has a specified residue of its determinant. Okay, so these are the boundary conditions. Okay, so these are the boundary conditions. Now, the astute viewer, if you haven't all fallen asleep, will notice there are exactly 12 of these. So, namely, what I'm going to have is for every choice of alpha and c, I get a hitch and moduli space. So, I fix boundary conditions and I get a hitch and moduli space. If I look at the family of these things, I get a whole bunch of different hitch and moduli spaces. And moduli spaces. And well, what do I mean by different hitch and moduli spaces? All of them are topologically the same, they all look like this d4 alg space. The only thing that's varying is the ALG metric. Okay, so this is a 12-dimensional family of ALG spaces of type D4. Okay, so here I've produced. Okay, so here I've produced the right number of parameters, you know, so I have this large-dimensional space of ALG metrics, these are all derived as Boltz had wanted through gauge theory. So these things are, you know, obtained in the way we want. And then the question is, is this enough of them? And so there's a map. And so let me just say, so this is a theorem. And again, joint with Fredrickson, Swoboda and Moyce. Anyways. So I take the space of these things. I can look at the corresponding ALG metric associated to each of these. This is a map between 12-dimensional spaces. And the natural conjecture is that this is a diffeomorphism. And not quite is the answer. So, but the answer is. Answer. So, but the answer is that this is a is 24 to 1, but it's on two. Okay, so it actually roughly covers. I mean, there's some sort of singularities in the covering, but you certainly realize all possible ALG metrics in this way. Okay, now this 24 to 1 is a little bit suspicious. And let me give away a little bit of the punchline since I'm getting near the end. Line since I'm getting near the end. So 24 is, of course, four factorial. And one of the obvious things you could do is just you have your four points, 0, 1, p naught, and infinity, and their labeling is pretty obvious, you know, and it's arbitrary. But I could rearrange those four points in any way I want. And there's 24 permutations of those. So that would suggest that this sort of 24 to 1 is completely stupid. It's not, in fact, it turns out that that rearrangement action actually divides the sort of chambers of this. The sort of chambers of this mapping into sort of three different partitions. So there's sort of an account, you know, this reorganization sort of ounce or you know, relabeling only accounts for sort of eight of the 24 symmetries. So there's an extra sort of three extra things which are a little bit different and somehow don't arise in such a trivial manner. Okay, but again, they can be explained. Okay, so this is the main theorem that we have the space of ALG metrics that has been understood by the work of various Understood by the work of various other people that I've referenced. And we have the space of Hitchen metrics that we've understood, sort of in nauseating detail. And the claim is that it really represents the same class of spaces. Okay. So I should say that there is or should be a generalization of these to many or most other ALG types. And again, the precise Hitchin systems have been described via sort of physics, should say strong conjectures. I mean, it's pretty clear that those are the right answers. I mean, it's pretty clear that those are the right answers, but there's definitely some sort of more complicated work to be done. So, just to say a few more words about that, for example, I could look at the sphere minus maybe three points where one of the points is a double pole and the other two are single poles. This is a slightly more complicated analytic scenario. This was analyzed by Picard and Bulch, you know, the Hitchin structure on these types of things. These are called wild Hitchin moduli spaces when you have a double or higher order pole. And these are speculated. And these are speculated to be ALG spaces of exactly the right type that fill out the other types of ALG geometries that were listed. Okay, so, you know, in a certain case, what we're doing here is the simplest of all of these things because it all fit within sort of fairly tractable tools. Okay, so I just want to give you a few words about what we actually do since I'm really right at the end here. So the simplest case is when All the CJs are equal to zero. So all the complex masses are equal to zero. Then it turns out that the story is particularly simple and it looks exactly like the picture I drew at the beginning. So I have a single singular fiber. So remember, the fibration is somehow associated to the Hitchin structure. And fixing the real parameters to be anything and the complex parameters to be zero is going to say that the Hitchin vibration is one that has only a single singular fiber. Is one that has only a single singular fiber sitting over the origin. Now, what's special about this situation is that there's an S1 action in this case. And where it comes from is just sort of the stupid observation that if I take an A and a phi, I can send this to A and e to the i theta times phi. This doesn't change the monodromy of the connection, obviously, because the connection is left alone. And if I take the determinant of the, if I take the determinant of the Higgs field, well, let's say. Of the Higgs field, well, let's think what happens. Determinant of phi is supposed to have a double pole, but its residue is zero, right? So that means that the Higgs field is nilpotent at each one of these points. Its singular part is nilpotent, and rotating it doesn't change the leading order term of the determinant. Okay, so in all other cases when the CJs are non-zero, you don't have the circle action. Now, what we're trying to do is we're trying to compute the integrals over these spheres. Over these spheres of, excuse me, over these spheres of omega i, omega j, and omega k. And in this case, you can actually see something very nice, that omega j and omega k vanish on these sj's. Okay, so what's happening is that because these things lie in a singular fiber, omega j plus i omega k is the holomorphic symplectic form. Is the holomorphic symplectic form, and these are complex Lagrangians of manifolds. So, in this particular case, where the c's are equal to zero, the integrals of omega j and omega k over the s j's are zero. So there's no work to be done. So, all we need to do is to compute the integral of omega i. Okay, so what's so special about the circle action? Well, it turns out that if I look at this configuration, let me draw it one more time, what the circle is doing is it's kind of rotating every the circle is doing is it's kind of rotating everything around here it actually leaves this central uh it leaves this central sphere alone and it rotates each of these spheres so there's two fixed points at the inner and outer point and well because there's a circle action if i take uh if i take sj uh and maybe i should say let's take omega i restricted to sj then i can think of this as a symplectic manifold sj would Is a symplectic manifold sj with this thing, and I can use action angle coordinates for the circle action. There's going to be a moment map, and it turns out that the integral of this thing is just going to be the moment map, the maximum value of the moment map minus the minimum value of the moment map. Okay, so this is kind of very elementary symplectic geometry. I can forget about this higher dimensional picture. I just have a sphere with a circle action, right? And I'm looking at the symplectic area. The symplectic area, the symplectic volume. And because of the circle action, there's a moment map, and this area is exactly the difference of the moment maps. And that's really just saying that omega i is going to look like d mu edge d theta. You know, this is the classical action angle variables on the sphere, omega i restricted to SJ. Okay, so we have to compute what these things are, and it turns out that these things are differences of these real parameters, and I'm going to write down. Real parameters. And I'm going to write down, well, maybe I won't write down in the interest of time a formula since I'm out of time, but these can be computed in terms of the alphas. And it's in fact, this is just an affine function. So this is in fact an affine function of the alphas. Okay, well, I'm over time. So let me just sort of cut to the chase and just say when the CJs are non-zero. When the CJs are non-zero, the picture gets much more complicated. And roughly, what happens is that this configuration starts tilting. So, really, what's happening is the complex structure is changing. You still have the same topological arrangement. It's going to look something like this, but these things are going to project down to up to six singular points. And the singular fibers are going to look differently. And so, this becomes much more involved. And I think that I don't have time to describe exactly what the computation is, but roughly speaking, you know, if I actually. But roughly speaking, you know, if I actually had to evaluate these integrals, so now I have to, let's say, evaluate omega j over s little j. If I actually had to do this analytically, I'd be in trouble. But fortunately, there's some, in some sense, you know, formula which says that in a certain sense, this can be given as a sum of residues of a certain Meromorphic object over Sj. Okay, so this is kind of a generalization of this picture up here. So the point is that I reduce this by sort of understanding a geometry. This by sort of understanding geometry, and these residues correspond to intersections of certain divisors in the ALG space. So, the point is that once again, these can be computed. And so, in the interest of time, I'll have to leave out the details. But the answer finally is that we get this correspondence that we can realize all possible Torelli parameters. Then I have this mysterious 24 to 1. And let me just say that the thing which I've not said much about is the stability. Not said much about is the stability condition induces a partition of the cube. So I have this cube, 0, 1 12 to the fourth. So I can think of this as some sort of cube. It partitions it up into a bunch of. So I don't know how to write this, you know, simplices. Simplices. So I drew a terrible quick picture there. So, what's happening is in the interior of each one of these simplices, I have a stable configuration. So, this notion of stability I talked about before depends on these real parabolic parameters. And each one of these simplices is mapped bijectively to the Torelli range. So, namely, every one of these simplices represents sort of the full moduli space of ALG metrics. There's 24 of these things. They come in. Four of these things. They come in three flavors, corresponding to sort of some slightly different symmetry that's not apparent. And what happens at the walls is sort of the natural question. And those are exactly the orbifold points. So let me just remark that if I have a simplex in four dimensions, it has five faces, and the five faces correspond to exactly any one of these five spheres shrinking to zero area. So that's sort of what happens at each of the faces is that S0, S1, S2, S sphere, S4 shrinks to zero area. Sphere S4 shrinks to zero area to get an orbifold point. Okay, so I'll finish there and forgive me for going over a bit. Okay, thank you, Rank. Any question? Sorry, I I wanted to ask something. Uh maybe you said that, but how does one prove that uh MALG is uh twelve dimensional? ALG is 12 dimensional? Okay, so in fact, so MALG is 12-dimensional. So what you can do is you can look at the following situations. So you can take each of these Kayler forms. And so, you know, the precise form of formalism is a little bit takes a little bit of work to set up, but it's not very difficult. And you want to know how can I? Not very difficult, and you want to know how can I perturb these things? So, I want to perturb it by some other form. So, let's call these, you know, beta one, um, you know, beta i, beta j, and beta k. Okay, and so I'd like to perturb these so that these stay hypercalar, okay, and there's going to be a gauge freedom too, so there's certain stupid deformations you could do, like I could just rotate the hyperkalar triple, and that obviously is not a new hyperkalar structure, okay? So, I can look how I could produce. Okay, so I can look how I could perturb these three hypercalar forms to a new hypercalar structure, and I can set down equations. Ultimately, I can reduce this via sort of a dd bar lemma type of thing to solving an equation where I have a Dirac operator of u. So I can write the betas as coming from a dd bar of a function u, essentially. And I'm trying to solve some sort of Dirac type equation that looks like this. Okay, it's on a non-compact manifold. It's on a non-compact manifold. We understand the kernel and the co-kernel of this. And it turns out that you can identify the null space. So if you set it up properly, the kernel is exactly 12-dimensional and the co-kernel is zero-dimensional. So it's a strike. It's an unobstructed problem. So it's a beautiful formalism that as I say is due to Donaldson. It's been written up nicely in various places. And, you know, so Donaldson, and then I said there's this paper of Schroer and singers. Paper of Schroer and Singer's. Schroer and Michael Singer. Schroer's, Michael, and Singer, where it's written up nicely. And I think there are various other papers that have a very nice account of this too.
