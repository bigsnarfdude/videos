The speakers. But again, we're seeing people from many different parts of mathematics trying to speak to each other. And what we'll learn now are some challenges in the study of algebraic models of biochemical reaction networks. And as before, please bring on as many questions as you have in the chat window. Other people might try to help answer them, but I'll pose them to the speaker. I'll post them to the speaker throughout the lecture. So, thanks Thomas, and thanks to the organizers for inviting me to give a tutorial here. I would have loved to be in Banff, but I hope we can make this work at some other point. So, I will say a few words before I change the slide. So, meanwhile, later on, I will ask you a couple of questions, like multiple choice questions. So, you can have Question, so you can have this web page open so that we don't delay the procedure later on. I've never tried that in combination with Zoom, so apologize in advance if it turns out a bit. The link is in the chat. The link is in the chat as well. Yes, thanks, Cleb. Yeah, so my original title was Challenges in the Study of Algebraic Models, and now it's some challenges because I realize that in 50 minutes. Because I realize that in 50 minutes I cannot manage to cover all the challenges, and also in 50 minutes I cannot manage to cover properly the background, the foundations, the results and the problems. So I've decided to focus a bit on giving an overview of the direction we want to go to and the type of problems maybe biologists would like to answer. And then I will give And then I will give some approaches to solve these problems that involve semi-algebraic sets, and it connects a bit with the previous talk. So let me start by giving you the big picture. So this talk is about reaction networks. And here is a very small example, a non-realistic reaction network that is used in bacteria. That is used in bacteria to transfer signal. Here, the players are two proteins, which are here: the HK and the RR. And the little P here is a phosphate group, but somehow you have to manage that the protein that receives the P is allowed to go on with their function, right? So it's it's a way to say now I'm functional, and without the P, the protein is not functional. P, the protein is not functional. And so, this protein HK is in the membrane, and when it senses some specific changes in the environment, for example, then it gets phosphorylated, this P attached to HK, and then it goes on to transfer the P to another protein, response regulator, and this one will go on and do something else. So, the body is full of net. The body is full of networks of this type that transmit the signal up and down. And to understand what's happening when one has such a system, we employ mathematical models that will tell something about how the counts of these proteins or the concentration of these proteins change in time. And here today, I will use ordinary differential equations, but soon the ordinary differential equations. Ordinary differential equations will become algebraic equations, but I will consider models that are somehow automatically built from the network in a way I will briefly describe in short. But for now, I just want you to focus that on that we have a model, we have some case here, these are parameters, and then we have the variables which are the concentrations we are interested in studying, and these parameters. And these parameters are generally unknown or hard to estimate or even unidentifiable, as probably Nikki will talk about on Wednesday. So when we have such a model, of course, we want to study to reach conclusions about our system. And here we see two approaches. One would be the quantitative one. You have a very specific system in a very specific scenario, maybe a specific organism. And maybe a specific organism, and you want to understand the output of the model. And then the typical strategy is to find approximate values for the parameters in various ways. And then you study the system. Then you have no parameters, then you can employ numerical simulations and see what happens. The other approach would be more qualitative. And here the interest is not in understanding a specific In understanding a specific behavior for a specific choice of parameters, but here you want to start a system for all parameter values or all parameter values in a box or in a region that is realistic. And here we can distinguish three type of questions. The first would be: does there exist a choice of parameters such that the system behaves in a certain way? So we choose a property we like and then we ask, can I? Like, and then we ask: can I find parameters for which the system has that property? If this answer is positive, then we can go on and say, Okay, but where in the parameter space does this happen? And finally, and that's here more where biologists or biochemists come into play, we want to understand why these parameters have that property and not others, or what is the mechanism. Or, what is the mechanism in the network behind this choice of parameters? And so, while the first and second question are clear-cut and mathematical questions, we know what to do, we know what we are after, this why question is sometimes more a philosophical question, but it's very important for biologists and biochemists, and we cannot ignore that. So, here in this qualitative part, again, there are Part again, there are two strategies. One would be okay to sample parameters, many, many parameters, and then we go back to the first approach and use numerical simulations to decide upon the property. And the other approach could be to take a theoretical study from the beginning using symbolical tools to see what's happening with my system. And here in this talk, I will talk a bit about this theoretical. About this theoretical approach. That's what I work on. So that's a bit the big picture where we want to go to, or the main question we want to address. And now I will say something about the mathematical framework. But because it's not that important how you build a model, but what is important is the fact that you have a model. I want to spend a lot of time on that. I will say a few words and then move on. So first, Move on. So, first, a reaction network is just a collection of arrows between two linear combinations of a set of species, everything finite. So, we have a finite set of species, which are the proteins of interest, the chemical compounds of interest, or even animals, it could be. And then we have some two linear combinations and an arrow between them. And an arrow between them. So here is an example that says x1 reacts to x2, 2x2 reacts to 2x1, and so on. When we have this, then under some assumptions, you can study the evolution of the concentration of these proteins or these species using an ordinary differential equation system. And the system is built systematically. Is built systematically, and of course, the validity is not systematic. I mean, you need to check that under conditions you're working on, the assumptions hold. But somehow, for us mathematicians, or for me, the starting point is that someone chose the model and I want to provide tools to understand the model, right? So, we assume that someone decided this model is realistic. Under that assumption, then Under that assumption, then let me tell you how the model is built. So you consider first the stoichiometic matrix, which is the one here, where each column corresponds to a reaction. And you can see I colored column and reactions accordingly. So the first column corresponds to this first reaction. And then the vector simply encodes the net production of each species in the reaction. So for example, for the first reaction, So for example, for the first reaction, X1 is consumed, so we have a minus one, and X2 is produced in one unit, so we have a one. For the second reaction, every time it occurs, two molecules of X2 are lost, so we have the minus two here, and two molecules of X1 are gained, so we have the two here, and so on. So this just says the stoichiometry of what's happening with the reaction. Of what's happening with the reaction. And then to decide what is the rate of change for X1, the concentration of X1, what we consider is the rate of each reaction. And here is mainly where the assumptions come into play. And under the assumption of mass action, where you think everything is nicely homogeneous, well-stored, and abundance of molecules, what you do, What you do, I mean, you think that the molecules meet by chance equally with equal probability, or then this rate is assumed to be proportional, these are the case that I wrote here, to the product of the species, of the concentration of the species in the reactant. So here we just have the rate of this reaction is k1x1. For the second reaction, we have For the second reaction, we have 2x2 becomes, we have to take the product of the species, so xx2 square, times the constant, so it's k2, x2 square, and for the third reaction it would be k3, and then the product of the two molecules here reacting x1, x2. When you make this product, the matrix product, and the vector of reaction rates, then you see your weight, you Then you see you wait, you have for each of the species a weighted sum of the rates of the reactions, and the weights are given by the net production. So this is the way you build these models. Under these models, the positive orthon and negative orthon are forward invariant, which is something you would expect because if you have positive concentrations in the beginning, you don't expect your concentrations to become negative. Become negative. So that's the model. That's the first ingredient we need today. And the second ingredient we need is to realize the nicer structure these systems often have, which, like here, you observe for this matrix, the sum of the two groms is zero. So that means if I multiply by the vector one, one, I get zero. So if I do the same on the other side of the zero, So if I do the same on the other side of this equality of this equality, I'm getting that the derivative of x1 plus the derivative of x2 is 0 for every time t. Therefore, x1 plus x2 is constant along the trajectory. And that means that all trajectories are confined to linear subspaces of the form x1 plus x2 equal to some number. And this number is just the sum of x1. The sum of x1 and x2 for any point in the trajectory, in particular for the initial condition. So, this system, which has dimensions, it has two variables, it in principle has dimension two, in reality it's a one-dimensional system because all trajectories are confined to these one-dimensional linear subspaces. And this, of course, happens in general because the way we construct the systems, we have the system. We construct the systems. We have the system is given by a matrix n times a vector. So whenever I choose a basis of the left kernel of n, so all the vectors I can write here that give zero, and I gather these vectors as rows of a matrix, then these sets are invariant by the trajectories. And these sets have a name in the chemistry literature, which is the stoichiometric compatibility classes. So the picture is. So, the picture is as follows. You imagine you have, for example, here the positive orphan in R3, and then you have these slices by linear subspaces that contain all the trajectories. So all the dynamics of the systems is containing one of these. So, this was the second main ingredient of this theory. And now the third is about steady states or Eclidean points. Equilibrium points, which are the points where the trajectories are constant. So these are the solutions to this equation. So I'd like to interrupt you. There was a question raised, whether, which you listed before, are the only constant trajectories. These are the only constant. Alexei, would you like to expand on your question? Yeah, I don't see the chat actually. I think Elizabeth will submit the question. Are these the only constant trajectories? So here, these are almost always the only invariant spaces that contain the trajectories, but they couldn't be non-linear ones. So these are the linear ones, but there could be others that are non-linear. There could be others. Yes. There could be others. Yes, non-linear. And linear, I would say essentially, these are all, only for non-well-behaved networks, you could have some others. But yeah. But these are always there, of course. Yeah, so as I was saying, then we look at the steady state, and we do that for two reasons. Well, the first is in a lab setting, for example, if your experiment or your trajectory is complete. Experiment or your trajectories converge to something that that point is a steady state. And the other, from the theoretical perspective in dynamical systems, the first step to understand a dynamical system is often to find the steady state, understand the dynamics around the steady state, and you go on from there. So if we don't understand the steady state, it's hard to imagine we can understand more about the system. So the steady states are given after the solution. States are given as the solutions to this equation, and because we have these linear invariant subspaces, we consider the steady states in each of these classes. So, this leads to the following sets we are interested in, which are the sets of all positive points that are a steady state for the given k and that live in the stoichiometric compatibility. Stoichiometric compatibility class that C defines. So for every K and for every C, these are two types of parameters, I have a set. And I treat the set as unknown. As I said in the beginning, that's the approach we consider here. In the example I started with, these two equations are the steady state equations coming from the ODE system, and this is the invariant linear equation. Equation, right? But because each linear invariant equation arises, because there is a linear combination of the other equations, remember that was this matrix multiplying n. That means there is always redundancy, and you can eliminate as many steady state equations as equations you have for the invariant spaces. So you always, these sets are described by n equations and n variables. And then you expect And then you expect, of course, you're not guaranteed that, but you expect that each of these sets contains a finite number of points if things are well behaved. But the number of elements might depend on the parameters you choose. And here is an example where I draw in red here the curve for the steady states. It's not an example here, it's just another curve. And then each of these blue lines are these invariant linear subspaces. Linear subspaces. And then the intersection of a red curve and a blue curve is a steady state in the class being considered. So here we see this class as one steady state. So the set corresponding to this class would have one element. Well, for this class, we have three elements, right? We have three intersection points. So a question was raised in the chat as to whether it's always the case that you can do the elimination down to end equations. Yes. Yes. Equations. Yes, yes, because sorry, each of the equations for the invariant space they arise from a linear relation among the other equations. So for each equation, you can remove one equation. So yes, always. And actually, I have a question for you also about this issue about the number of points you have. You say that even when it's finite, the number will depend upon the parameters. Is this because you're working with the Is this because you're working with real geometry as opposed to complex geometry? Yeah, precisely. Real positive geometry, right? So we consider the positive points, all coordinates positive. Yeah. So now I can get to the questions we would like to answer, or some of the questions we would like to answer, and about this existence, the where and the why I said in the beginning. So the first would be multistationarity, which means that can I find means that can I find parameters such that this set has at least two elements and this is related to the capacity for switching in cell signaling I mean so this is a question biologists are interested about and actually the question they are most interested about is by stability it's that not only I have two positive steady states but I can also say they are asymptotically stable. They are asymptotically stable, because otherwise I won't see them. And then the third question would be whether the system displays periodic oscillations, periodic solutions, sorry. And this is a priority, it's not a question about the set, but as you will see shortly, it will become a question about this set also. So now is where I have a question for you. Here I have two groups. Here I have two graphics or figures for two different networks. And in red, I show different steady state curves for different case. And in blue, I show this invariant linear subspaces. And the question is, if you assume nothing weir happens outside the part I show in the figure, which networks display multistationarity? So either network one or two of both? Or two of both. And now I will start the quiz in so now it's started. You should be able to see it. Yes, I see some people answering. I can see the percentage has stabilized a lot. So I think I can stop it here. So I give five more seconds: one, two, three, four, five. And I hope you can see the And I hope you can see the results now. It says most people think network two is right one, and some people think it's both networks, and the correct answer is network two. Let's see why. Let's go back to the other side here. Well, here we have to see if we can find multistationality means we can find a red curve and We can find a red curve and a blue curve that intersect in more than two points. That is a K, that's it, the red curve, and a C for which the intersection is at least two points. And here, all the intersections are transversal. So you can see every time you pick a red line and a blue line, they cannot intersect in more than one point. And here in network two, this curve, for example, here, if we intersect with this line. If we intersect with this line, then we can see there are three intersecting points. And that's the same for all the curves in between these two, essentially. That will be that case, right? So before I move on, I will use repeatedly this ingredient, which is a positive parametrization, that essentially is a parametrization of the set of a steady state. Of the set of steady states, so the blue curve, I sorry, the red curves, such that, yeah, so the image, so it's a map, an injective map, such that the image is exactly the set of positive steady states. And the example I started with today, with the HK and the RR, we have, for example, DGZ parameterization where X2 and X4 are free, and then X1 is And then x1 is expressed like this, and x3 is expressed like this. And you can see, because the k's are positive and the x's are positive, all these expressions are positive. So we are on the good side. So in general, for an algebraic variety to have a parametrization is asking a lot, but surprisingly, for networks, it happens very often that you can find a parametrization. So I want, there are many strategies. There are many strategies to find them. I can tell you if you are interested in that later. But essentially, the key idea here is that because the systems we have arise, so are polynomials that arise, so the monomials that appear arise from the reactant, right? And then the degree of the monomials is the number of species in the reactant, because we multiply them. And if you think these are projects. And if you think these are proteins, having three proteins interact at the same time, I mean, proteins are macromolecules, so it's quite unrealistic to think three proteins meet at the same time and form a big complex. So usually it's two come first and then comes the next. So what happens with our systems is that they are often quadratic and they have a lot of linearity. So that allows things to work out, but we it's not that I understand exactly. It's not that I understand exactly what are the conditions that will make it to work that nicely. Do you actually just a question about that? Are there some general results about the complexity of the algebraic varieties which can arise from some reasonable class of reactions? Yeah, not that I know of. Is it possible to encode every Encodes every algebraic variety. That's maybe up to birational morphism or something as arising from one of your systems. No, that I mean, you have some very mild conditions that essentially says every time, let's say, all the negative coefficients like in the if equation should be a multiple of xi. So if that's true, then you automatically can write that as a reaction. Automatically, you can write that as a reaction network. And you could say, okay, any system I multiply each equation by the xi corresponding, and then it displays the form. But then it's not a realistic reaction network. Then this nice structure that comes from real networks that it's hard to encode is lost. So let me say something about multistationarity. Recall that at Recall that that meant that we could find case and c such that there were two positive solutions. And here is where quantifier elimination should give an answer or cylindrical algebraic composition should give an answer, but they are impractical completely. They only work for really small number of parameters and variables. But there are many methods to decide whether multistationarity exists, like the yes or no. And that's they build mainly That's they build mainly on the fact that the case, our parameters, appear in the coefficient linearly, and the c's are also linear. And we are just asking, can I change the case and the c's such that I have two solutions? And most methods that exist, they end up rephrasing the problem to a problem of solving some linear inequalities. And then you can do that. So I have a So, I have at the very end a slide where I say something, I give a list of methods, but because somehow I don't know of any network that cannot be understood by the methods that exist, I will consider the problem solved, although it's not completely solved. But I will move on to the question: okay, where in the parameter space you have multistationarity? So now we want to understand. Stationarity. So now we want to understand the region where that happens. And again, the techniques that exist should give the answer, quantifier elimination should give the answer, but they hardly work. And then what we try is to find other approaches that exploit the structure of the reaction networks, what I was saying before. And here there are some approaches that have been used recently. That have been used recently, one would be the most classical, would be to reduce the problem to one polynomial and then study the solutions of the positive solutions of the polynomial using classical results. And then recently I've seen some other people using like combining sampling with these methods for like cylindrical algebraic decomposition or even numerical algebraic geometry also. Also, but again, this works with few parameters. With few parameters. We recently have used some characterized formula. It's a probabilistic formula that gives you the average number of steady states in a box. So you can find approximations of the regions with multistationality. But yeah, all of these approaches have some problems, right? And even if you succeed, so that's the key point here, even if you succeed, like for this. Here, even if you succeed, like for this network, which is an extension of the one I started with, a bit more complex, this network can have three positive steady states, and that happens if and only if, so full answer, these four inequalities hold, and these a's in the inequalities are these polynomials in my parameters. So, here I should be very happy because I completely solve the question I had. I had. But my collaborators, which are biologists or computer scientists, didn't know what to do with these equations because it's not saying anything about the network. It's not saying anything about the biology that causes multi-stationarity. We don't even know if this region is connected. We don't know anything at all. We have the equations, but we don't know what to do with that. And that's where the why I started with comes into play. I mean, this was not a satisfactory answer, even though I. Not a satisfactory answer, even though I was very satisfied as a mathematician that I got the answer. So, somehow, most satisfactory answers arise from partial answers, somehow that those that would be less satisfactory for mathematician, that would mean separate your parameters into sets and ask what are the conditions on this set that will allow me for sure to find. Me for sure to find parameters in the other set for which there is multistation. And here, so it's a projection of the region of multistation. And I will talk about a bit the question of can I find the conditions on K that will allow me to find a C for which there is two steady states. And going back to the figure you looked at before, I want to identify what K. I want to identify what case will give me curves like these ones here for which I will be able to find this class. That doesn't mean that for all classes I will have multistationality because this red curve that gives multistationality here doesn't give multi-stationarity here, right? So we only want the existence of some C. And for that, And for that, we had a theorem long ago where, under some conditions, essentially, that there is a parametrization, that you can find it, there is a polynomial, which is simply the Jacobian of the system evaluated at the parametrization, that has this property. If the polynomial is positive for all positive x, then there is exactly one positive steady state in each class. Class. If the polynomial attains some negative value for some positive x, then there are at least two positive steady states. And the class would be the class of this point. So this result is based on Brouwer-degree theory. It's using the properties of counting solutions related to the Jacobian. So the technical conditions guarantee that we can do that. So how is this useful for? So, how is this useful for us? I go back to this example. I said we had the region we were not satisfied with. And here, the polynomial is quite simple, is this polynomial. The x's are my variables, and the k's are the parameters. You see they appear as coefficients, and you see that all coefficients are positive, except for this one, whose sign depends on this term. On this term. If k1 is larger or equal than k3, then this polynomial is a sum of positive terms. It cannot be negative at all. So we are in the first case of the theorem that is one steady state in each class. If this coefficient is negative, then you can observe that the monomial associated to this coefficient has degree 3, while the rest of the monomials have lower. Rest of the monomials have lower degree. So if I let x4 and x5 be equal to some other variable t, this becomes a degree 3 polynomial with negative leading term. Then you pick t large enough, the polynomial becomes negative. So we can find an x exact polynomial that is negative. Therefore, that is multistation. And we conclude that k enables multistationarity if an If and only if k1 is smaller than k3. And this is a nice answer because k1 is the phosphorylation rate of the first site when the second is not occupied, and k3 is the phosphorylation of the first site when the second one is occupied. So this tells a story about what is the biology or the biochemistry behind why multistationality occurs. I mean there is a mechanism taking place there. So here then my collaborators were happy here. My collaborators were happy here. But deriving this condition from the original set of inequalities, the full set, it's not trivial at all to see that that was inside the full system. So with this, we rephrase the original problem of finding multistationarity, which was counting solutions of a parametric system or semi-algebraic system, I would say. System, I would say, to the problem of deciding whether a polynomial is non-negative over the positive order. So now here one might think that some techniques from optimization, like minimizing the polynomial, could be useful. Other techniques from some of the negative circuits, some have been proven useful to study what happens with this polynomial. Polynomial, but still the polynomial is parametric, so it's limited what you can do with optimization because your case are not fixed, right? I mean, you won't find the case. So, this was an example of a way to obtain partial answers. And there are two other works I know of, there might be others, but where they they follow the same idea, but choosing other types of partial answers. Of partial answers. So behind Liekenstein and Geroli, they use some triangulations of a polydrup associated to the system to find regions, partial answers involving the C's and some of the K's. And then Conradi, Yosef and Kali, they find conditions only on the C's for systems that have a monomial parametrization. So, and again, in both cases, the answers they get give nice interpretation of what is the biology behind what's happening. So, in the last part, I will say a bit about biostability and oscillations. And for those that are not familiar with that, I will briefly recall some definitions that arise from an arbitrary. From an arbitrary system of ordinary differential equations. Imagine you have a steady state, and then you consider the Jacobian matrix at the steady state. Then the steady state is said to be exponentially stable if all eigenvalues of this matrix have negative real part. And that automatically implies that the steady state is asymptotically stable, meaning that for initial conditions close enough to the steady state, trajectories will converge to the steady state. Virtual steady state. If at least one eigenvalue has positive real part, then the steady state is unstable, meaning that you can always find initial conditions close to the steady state where the trajectory diverges. And now here it's a bit a lot of more technical definition. It's about hop bifurcations where you consider now a parametric system, so now your system that is on parameter that you vary. System that is some parameter that you vary. We have K and C, for example. So imagine there is only one. And you start with a non-singular steady state for a given parameter value. Then by the implicit function theorem, you can find a curve of steady states around that parameter. And then what you do is you find the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the of F evaluated. Of f evaluated at the curve, right? And then you say you have a hope bifurcation if at mu zero, that is a pair of imaginary, purely imaginary eigenvalues, and at mu zero, let's say this pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues, they cross the imaginary axis. So the steady state goes from having all eigenvalues with negative real power to have a pair of eigenvalues with positive real par. pair of eigenvalues with positive real part and it goes in the middle through one where the real part is zero through a pair where the real part is zero when that happens then it's known that a periodic solution arises at on the site where the system is unstable so that's a way to identify periodic solutions is to find steady states with this property of purely imaginary eigenvalues so that's why i said in the beginning oscillations also relate to Beginning oscillations also relate to the set of aesthetic states. So, for us, what would be then our goal would be to understand the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of our system evaluated at the parametrization of the steady state. So, in this way, we can understand the whole family of behaviors. And how do we do that? I mean, you know, eigenvalues arise from the characteristic polynomials. So, given a polynomial with real coefficients, how do you decide how many roots have positive real parts, how many roots have negative real parts, and how many on whether there is a pair of imaginary roots. And here a method that a satisfactory method to decide that is based on the Hurwitz matrix, which is a matrix built from the coefficients of the polynomial. Of the polynomial is essentially, for those that know what this is, is the resultant of the even part of the polynomial and the negative and the odd part of the polynomial. So you construct this matrix and then you consider all the leading principal minors. So all the determinants coming from these upper left corners. And note that the Hn, this is not Hn minus. H n, this is not H n minus 1, Hn. So the last one, the whole determinant, is alpha n, Hn minus 1, because here there is either a column or a row that is all zero here. So when we have this matrix, the first criterion that becomes useful is the Roth-Hurbis criterion, that is about the negative real part that says if all h i are positive, then all roots of the polynomial have negative real parts. Of the polynomial have negative Rio R. If not, if that's not true, but none of them is zero, then there is at least one root with positive real var, and you can actually count how many of each you have. There is some formula on the alternating signs of these minors. And the second criterion says that the polynomial will have a simple pair of imaginary roots and the rest. Of imaginary roots, and the rest of the roots will have negative real part if and only if the first n minus 2 Hurwitz determinants are positive, the next one is zero, and the independent term of the polynomial is positive. So these are two criteria that based on the coefficients on the polynomial, polynomial decides about the sign of the real part of the rule. Real part of the root. So, what will we do in our application? We will apply this criteria to the characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian evaluated at the parameterization of the steady states. And we just need to remove n minus the rank of n zero eigenvalues that we have just because the trajectories are confined in these invariant spaces. In variance spaces. When we do that, we get the polynomial of degree s whose coefficients depend on the case we started with. So therefore, all the questions about stability and hoff bifurcations, they reduce to decide whether some semi-algebraic sets are non-empty or decide when they are non-empty. So we want to understand whether letting the case positive and either these conditions. And either these conditions, if we worried about the stability or these conditions, if we're worried about hop bifurcations, hope. So just to give you an example, this is a network of calcium transport in the endoplasmic reticulum. This network admits a parametrization. I don't want to go into detail. It's a very small network. It's a parametrization in one variable. And if I compute the whole I compute the Hurwitz determinants here s equals 3. I have these three polynomials: h1, h2, and that's an independent term. Here are the criteria. And then I will give you an extra question, which is the following. So this network has exactly one positive steady state in each class that I tell you. And then I give you three statements, and only one is true. Three statements, and only one is true. The first one is for all k, the steady state in each class is asymptotically stable. The other one is for all k, the network admits hop-bifurcations, and the other says a bit of everything. For some k, the steady state in all classes is asymptotically stable, and for some other k, there is a hop-bifurcation in some class. So, again, I will share the quiz. A quiz with you, and you can answer the question.  So, I hope you are seeing the results screen. That says most people think is the third option, and often the majority is right. And this is also the case here. The right answer is the The right answer is the third option. And to see that, note that h1 is a sum of positive terms or product and sum. So it's positive. The same holds for a3. And h2 has a single factor or term that can be negative. If this expression is positive, then h2 cannot be. Then H2 cannot be negative by choosing X4 in any way. So this will be again a sum of positive terms. So we are in the first case where everything is positive. So the steady state is asymptotically stable. If this is negative, then we are in the situation we were before. Now I have a negative coefficient of a polynomial of degree two. 2 and that's a leading term. So I can choose x4 such that the polynomial is both negative and positive and also 0. So you can make this 0 without affecting the two other ones. So you can have a hop bifurcation. So for this case, again, we have a nice answer that the system has a hop bifurcation. Has a hop bifurcation or that meets a pair of imaginary eigenvalues if and only if this is negative, which can be rewritten in a form that also says something about how two mechanisms compete with each other. I mean this quantity is well known for biologists. This is just a catalytic constant with a Michelis-Minton constant. So this has a lot of meaning for them. And extra condition that actually, when you move the parameter, you cross the imaginary axis. You cross the imaginary axis is satisfied, for example, if you choose this total amount as bifurcation parameter. So, these were somehow the questions, but I haven't said much about the challenges, and that's what I will say a bit briefly, because I'm it's easy to say what the challenges are. Well, the first is the high computational complexity. These Hurbit determinants, they have millions of terms. Minutes, they have millions of terms, so they are huge, and they are often not computable in a normal computer. So, you just run out of memory. Even if you can compute them, if you have a huge polynomial that have both positive and negative terms, you need to decide if the polynomial can be negative or not. There is a trick of some type of coordinates called convex coordinates that help a bit to reduce. To reduce the computational cost. So, now I will say very briefly two strategies that are being employed to tackle the first and the second challenge here. The first is model reduction. If you have a complex problem, you simplify. And here we employ these very nice results that relate two networks in the following sense. Imagine you have a theorem saying if I have two. If I have two networks related in a certain way, if f has property x for some choice of parameters, then so does g. And this property x could be having two asymptotically stable states or having a periodic solution. And many of such operations are known based on the structure of the network. And I want to mention two that are easy to state. One is making a reaction reverse. One is making a reaction reversible. If you have a big network where all reactions are only in one direction, and that network has periodic solution, for example, or multistationarity, then it's known that if you make reaction reversibles, that's preserved. And each reaction is a k parameter, right? So, by that, I mean, if your simpler network already has the property of interest, you are reducing the complexity a lot. And the other property. And the other property is that if you have a reaction, a direct reaction like this, you can add the species in the middle in this way, which are called intermediates. And again, the number of steady states and their stability is preserved. If you have a property for F, so F would be larger, right? I mean, but it would include something like that. The same property holds for G. And for example, the network I started with, or I used before for the parameter region. Before for the parameter region, this is very unrealistic. I mean, there are these direct conversions that would be more accurately modeled like this, putting this intermediate in the middle. But because we know that this network has three positive steady states, we also know this one has. And now the last thing I want to mention, I might, if I'm it's okay to steal two more minutes, it's about deciding whether a polynomial has negative. Whether a polynomial has a negative coefficient, if it can be negative for some positive x. And the answer is not always. This is a very simple polynomial where we have a negative coefficient, but it's a square. So it's not a polynomial that can attain negative values over the positive or even over the fields. And here, the trick that works often is to consider the new Often is to consider the Newton polytope of the polynomial, which is essentially you consider all the exponents of the monomials, you treat them as points in Zn, you consider the convex hull, then you have the polytope. And if your coefficient, so your monomial with negative term is a vertex, then you know the polynomial attains negative sign as well. So if you're lucky that you end up in a vertex, So if you're lucky that you end up in a vertex, then you can guarantee that the presence of a negative coefficient, no matter what the value is, is enough to guarantee the polynomial is negative. And for non-vertices, then the coefficient plays a role. Just knowing the sign of the coefficient is not enough, you need to know its value. And the example I gave you before, when we argued that this polynomial could be negative when this was negative, that was because. Was negative that was because this we did it basically very easily because this monomial corresponds to a vertex. And here, the good news is that the computation of the vertice of the Newton polytop can be easily done. If you can compute the Hurbitz determinant or the polynomial, you can compute the vertices of the Newton polytop. So the conclusion is that recurrent problem in the study of biochemical models is to determine parameters. Models is to determine parameter regions where a semi-algebraic set has a certain number of points, and the specific structure of the systems can be exploited. But of course, I would be very happy to hear if some people in the audience at this workshop have other tools that could be useful. So, when you get the slides, you will see some references you can check if you want to read more about this. And I want to thank you all for your attention. For your attention. Okay, so thank you. Let's give some applause to this wonderful talk. And there have been a number of questions that were raised that I put off to the end. So maybe I'll ask that these be raised. So Nita Abatake has a question. So why don't you raise it now? Hi, I am going to be talking. I just have a I just have a quick question about determining hop specifications. So, is it choice of positive parametrization dependent? Like, if I pick a bad parameterization and I can't decide the kinds of the coefficients, you get unlucky. Yeah. Yeah, I would say, I mean, if the yeah, if you. Yeah, if you yeah, I mean definitely yeah you can end up I mean you so the answer is I guess yes, but I'm not sure I have encountered that in when working with examples. But I see no reason not to expect that this can happen. That you might choose a parameterization where the negative Where the negative part, the fun part, it's not, for example, in the vertex of the Newton polytope, then it's hard to say anything. Of course, it matters for the computational cost, right? Right, exactly. Thank you. And Bill Johnson had a question earlier about thermodynamic constraints. Did you want to raise that? Dynamic constraints. Did you want to raise that well? No, it's not entered in the chat. Okay. So I'll leave that then. Are there other questions people would like to raise? Just feel free to unmute yourself and ask the question. I have a short question. So the parameterization you showed, if I'm not mistaken, they were all monomial in excess. Right? It can be that the ones I showed were. Ah, so it's not the common thing. I mean, there are big classes of systems with this property. I mean, actually, they receive the name system with toric steady states in this. Well, that's actually, I wanted to ask you. Ah, that's actually I wanted to ask you. So is there a tricky round? So okay. So the it's true that the ones you showed, but it's it's not yeah, for this one, for example, I didn't show the parametrization and it's not binomial. It's not monomial. Okay, okay. Because I didn't show. And Jason White has a has a question that you would like to raise it out loud. I was just wondering, long ago I looked at some work on reactions on surfaces or in channels where you're not looking at reactions in a 3D volume. And I wondered how much of what you've described transfers in a natural or unnatural way to those other settings. Yeah, I actually don't know exactly the modelling setting. I mean, it all depends on the type of equations. The type of equations you have, right? I mean, nothing of this is specific of reaction average, it's specific of all the systems. So, yeah. Okay. All right, so maybe we'll wrap up the wrap up the question time. And Gleb, did you want to explain? Because I don't actually remember how this is supposed to be done. Remember how this is supposed to be done. Explain how it is that the discussion is going to take place. Yeah, sure. So now we have time.
