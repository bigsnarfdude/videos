Obviously, and I guess that has also already been discussed here, is we need single-cell analyses. There are different methods available, and the one I opted to use is Mass Etometry. In fact, I was one of the first people to work with this first instrument and to develop many of the methods that are now used for the technique. And in mass itometry, And in mass istometry, we take cells in suspension, we mark molecules here interested in with metal isotopes, then we shoot the single cells into an instrument, a mass spectrometer, that is the so-called Cytof. And here every single cell is basically atomized and the atoms are ionized. And this then allows us to read out which metal isotopes were bound to every single cell. And since we know Cell. And since we know which isotope we used to mark which molecule, we in the end can determine the single cell molecular expression. And ultimately, this gives us a lot of information about the cellular phenotypes and state of a given tissue. And what is positive about this technique is that we can in the moment measure about 40 proteins, phosphorylation. 40 proteins, phosphorylation sites, and there are also protocols available to do this with transcripts at a speed of about a thousand cells per second. So it's fairly easy to accumulate a high number of cells for downstream computational analysis. And we also developed tools that enable us to measure hundreds of samples a day, but we realized that the biggest issue is to actually have the samples ready and not to analyze them. To analyze them with such a throughput. So then we used this technique to study the tumor ecosystem of human breast cancer. Here we analyzed in depth 144 tumors, and most of them were from the so-called luminal subgroup that I described to you previously. And in addition, we also analyzed 50 control samples. We dissociated those tumors into single cells. We then used two different antibody panels. Used two different antibody panels, one focusing on tumor, the other one on immune cells, for a total of 37 antibodies. And we analyzed 26 million cells in total across all of this tumor and control samples. And the first question that we wanted to address is how heterogeneous are actually breast tumor cells, since nobody before had really addressed this question. Before, had really addressed this question using a comprehensive single-cell analysis technique. And the result is shown here in the form of a heat map. On the x-axis, you see the different tumor cell markers that we have measured. On the y-axis, you can see 45 distinct epithelial breast cancer cell phenotypes. And the Mark expression is shown in a normalized scale from blue lowest to red, highest. Blue lowest to red highest level. And we, in addition, have basically determined groups of epicenyl cell phenotypes that we call L1 to L6, which are luminal groups, and B1 and B2, which are basal groups. But to come back to answer the questions, how heterogeneous are these phenotypes? I guess the answer is very simple. It's very heterogeneous. We were actually fairly surprised to encourage. Fairly surprised to encounter such a wide heterogeneity. But then we also looked closer at what we can see for these phenotypes. And when we looked at this basal phenotypes, we realized that they express markers such as sorvin that are known to be associated with high treatment resistance. And then, and this was in some ways also surprising. In some ways, also surprising, we found luminal tumor cell phenotypes that also have been associated to a high level of resistance. For example, this L6 group. We found a high level of hormone receptor expression, high level of FO2 expression, and especially also high levels of BCL2 expression, which is known to be make cells resistant to aoptosis. And also other markers, again, like surviving and endogen receptors. Sorivine and androgen receptors. And also in the Luminal 7 group, we found the absence of FO2 and still high levels of survivin and androgen receptor and only low levels of hormone receptor. And also this has been associated in literature to be a phenotype to be fairly treatment resistant. So here we could see that there are basal cells that are known clinically to be treatment resistant, but that there are also luminal cell phenotypes. But that there are also luminal cell phenotypes that also have a high level likely of resistance. So then I have to admit, I quickly go back to this heat map, I have to admit that we really struggled to deal with this heterogeneity of these tumor cell phenotypes. We tried clustering of patients, etc. Some of you might have read the paper. We really didn't really manage to identify solid patterns. Identify solid patterns. And for this, we were then searching for a score that nevertheless would allow us in some way to classify those patients. And in collaboration with a group here at IVM at Zurich, the idea then was to describe how abnormal are those tumor cell phenotypes compared to normal. And to describe this phenotypic abnormality, we use this. Abnormality, we used a deep autoencoder. And this deep autoencoder was trained using the normal epithelial breast phenotypes. And then we ran all of the individual tumor cells through this deep autoencoder. And if you run first the normal cells through this, the mean squared error will be very small. But if we then ran the tumor cell phenotypes through this autoencoder, the more a tumor cell is different from normal, the higher the mean squared error. From normal, the higher the mean squared error will be, and this difference we call the phenotypic abnormality. And we can compute this phenotypic abnormality per cell, but then also for a tumor. And when we then assess this phenotypic abnormality in relation to a clinical parameter that does reflect the pathological assessment in the clinics, we saw that there's actually a fairly good correlation since the grade 1 tumors have a low female. The grade I tumors have a low phenotypic abnormality, but the grade three tumors, they also have the worst prognosis, they have the highest mean phenotypic abnormality. So here we could see that this marker abnormality, ultimately, that's what we determine here, reflects the pathological abnormality in the clinics. And this core will then also be fairly interesting and surprising when we look at the immune compartment. Immune compartment. But then we also looked at the composition of the tumors. And for this, I show this bubble plot. Where on the x-axis, here to the left, we have an adjacent normal sample. Here in blue, these are all the tumors. Then on the y-axis, you can see the different phenotypes. And the presence of different phenotypes per patient is shown with these bubbles, where the size and the color indicates how dominant a cell phenotype. Dominant a cell phenotype is within a patient sample. So, here from dark green, the frequency is close to zero, to a gold, which is the frequency close to one. And we furthermore sorted or ordered those tumors according to their phenotypic abnormality. Now, the first thing that you can see is that each tumor is unique. No tumor looks like another tumor. The second thing that we found The second thing that we found is that humors with a high phenotypic abnormality, they seem to be dominated by only one or few phenotypes. And then we then further looked which phenotype clusters these dominant cells belong to, where we then also have this high phenotypic abnormality. We can see that in those cases, we again find this basal phenotypes and also. Basal phenotypes and also those phenotypes that are associated with treatment resistance. And so this showed us that these abnormal tumors are dominated by these resistant phenotypes. And that was also, I give in the literature, somewhat a surprise because we assumed that those humors that contain those resistant phenotypes. And also here, if you look at the bottom, again, we see this high grade, which is also associated with a poor outcome. Associated with a poor outcome. In literature, based on literature, one would have assumed that these are the most heterogeneous tumors, but in fact, we found that those tumors are the least heterogeneous of all of them. Then in the next step, and also since we struggled to identify strong patterns in the tumor cell compartment, we were wondering can we identify immune environments? Immune environment patterns or groups among the patients. And here we focused on markers that indicate whether the immune system is actively fighting the tumor. And to learn about this, we mainly look at two cell types that are dominantly present in breast tumors. One is the so-called T cells, the CD8. The CD8 T cells, these are cytotoxic ones, they actually actively fight the tumor cells. And if these cells express a marker called PB1, that indicates that they are active, that they're in an active state. There's also another cell type that is fairly common in breast tumors. These are the so-called macrophages. And also, they can be very supportive in fighting your tumor by activating, for example, the T cells and also by T cells and also by fighting the tumor cells. And if these macrophages are also anti-tumor, they express, for example, the marker CD169. What you've likely heard about already is that the immune response can be dampened or shut off by the tumor by so-called exhausting the T cells and by cell cell communication via PD1 and PDL1, and there are also other mechanisms. And there are also other mechanisms at play. These T cells can be turned off, and also these T cells, once they become exhausted, they start to express so-called co-inhibitory receptors such as CTL4 and TIM3 that tell us when we analyze those cells that these cells are exhausted and inactive. The other way around for the macrophages, markers can be expressed such as CD206, CD204, or also CD38. For also CB3, that indicate us that those macrophages have taken a state that has put them into a tumor supporting role. And so the first question that we really asked is, what is the state of the immune environment in these tumors? And first I want to focus on the T cells. So here we initially only looked at the expression of PD1, which indicates activated and or exhausted. Activated and/or exhausted T cells. And we found that in tumors, so here each dot is the frequency of these T cells in a given patient sample. And you can immediately see that tumors have higher levels of this PD1 positive T cells. And we also saw, again, a relationship to the crate and the levels of PD1 positive T cells. Then we wanted to know in more detail whether these cells are active or whether they actually are active. Are active or whether they actually are exhausted. So here you see a heat map of the T cell phenotypes. They are shown on the y-axis. On the x-axis, you see the different markers that we measured. And as always in our heat maps, we show the normalized intensity for each marker where blue is the lowest and red is the highest level. And now I only want to focus on the PD1 positive T cells. And when we did a close analysis, we found that there's one phenotype. Found that there's one phenotype that we call then T11 that has a highly exhausted phenotype, high levels of PD1, and high level of this additional markers that are canonical for calling a T cell exhausted. Then we also found cells of phenotypes like this T7, where we also see activation markers and some exhaustion markers, or T14, where we still see levels of PB1. So for these. Levels of PD1. So, for these two, we rather think they're activated rather than exhausted. And we found another phenotype that is called the so-called regulatory T cell. And these are present in tumors to actually turn off the immune response. So they have that also associated to an exhausted immune environment. And this actually showed us that within our cohort, we have In our cohort, we have activated as well as exhausted phenotypes present. And this will become really important when we look at the immune groups that we identify across all of the patients. Then, once we saw that we have T cells in our data set that are exhausted, we were wondering whether these macrophages contribute to this exhaustion. Since a main mechanism to Since the main mechanism to exhaust the turn of these T cells is via the expression of PDL1, which interacts with PD1 on the T cells and then signals the cell to actually shut up and be calm and not to do anything anymore. And so here we were wondering what the contribution of the macrophages to this process is. And then also here we plotted the frequency of this PDL1 macrophages. Uh, macrophages for the chisel normal compared to those in tumors. We also here saw that on average it's much more frequent in tumors than in normal. And also here we saw a relationship to the grade of the patients. And also here, again, like before, now all the macrophage phenotypes are shown on the y-axis, x-axis the markers that we looked at. But I just want to focus again. But I just want to focus again on those macrophages that have expression of PD-L1. And we could identify one phenotype that we call M17 that had very high levels of PDL-1. And here we would expect it to be present in immune environments where likely the T cells should be exhausted. And we could also identify two other phenotypes, this N1 and M2, where we found expression of PDL1 indicating that. PDL1 indicating that likely it's present in some sort of exhausted environment. And also in this case of M1 markers that are known to be expressed on macrophages that support tumors. And then the M2 phenotype less so. And also some expression of a marker that is also known to be tumor inhibiting, which is the CD69. So here we were not sure where you would actually find these two macrophages. Two macrophages. So once we had done this analysis, we then moved on and asked: can we now group all of the patients based on their immune environment? And to do this analysis, we took all of the immune phenotypes and we clustered all of the patient samples according to the frequency of these different immune cells. Of these different immune cell phenotypes. And we could readily see that there are three, well, actually, four large clusters. One cluster, which was fairly different in the immune composition, were the normal cells or the adjacent normal cells. And then we had three other clusters: the so-called tumor immune group one, which is shown here in black, tumor immune group two, which is highlighted here in blue, and the tumor. In blue, and the tumor immune group 3, which is highlighted in red. And when we then gave a closer look, we saw that in this tumor immune group 1, we mainly found those T cells that seemed to be slightly activated or rather inactive. So here we concluded that for those patients, the immune system was inactive. We saw that in this tumor immune group 2, we find macrophage. We find macrophage and T-cell phenotypes that indicate some immune activity, but no strong signs of exhaustion. And we found that in this tubo immune group 3, we had extremely high levels of frequency of this T11 T cell phenotype, so this highly exhausted one. And we also had very high levels of the T regulatory cells in this geomimine group 3. And here it was clear to us that in this sub- Clear to us that in this subset of patients, we have an exhausted immune environment. And that was striking since when we look closer in the clinical subgroups, we saw, and you see here, this is like this light green, we saw that those patients are mainly from the luminal B group. And classically, it was assumed that luminal tumors, and I also told you this in the introduction. And I also told you this in the introduction: that luminal tumors are fairly immune inactive. And we found in our study that in the tumor immune group two, there's some immune activity present. That was one surprise. But more importantly, that we have a subset of patients in the tumor immune group three that seem to have a highly exhausted immune environment. And we actually now started to work with a clinical group in Germany. A clinical group in Germany to see how we can translate the results that we found here in a clinical setting and a clinical trial. Because one of the big pushes currently in breast cancer therapy is to assess whether and how we can bring immunotherapy, so targeting those cells and reactivating them to the patients. Now, finally, what I also want to mention here is before I was talking. Mention here is before I was talking about the autoencoder-based phenotypic abnormalities call. And what you can see here, when you plotted this phenotypic abnormality for each of the samples across the tumor immune groups, you see that the phenotypic abnormality, which was only based on the epithelial tumor cell phenotypes, also shows a relationship with the tumor immune groups. Immune groups. And that was surprising to us, but it simply means biologically that these fairly abnormal tumor cells seem to be those that evoke the strongest immune response. So a quick summary of the first part of my presentation. Here we analyzed the composition of 144 tumor and 50 normal breast ecosystems. We could shape We could shape normal concepts, including the one of tumor abnormality and also the tumor individuality. We also saw that the immune environment, but not the tumor cell environment, stratifies the breast tumors. And we also found that patients of this tumor immune group 3 might be amenable to immune checkpoint therapy. So this I hope could show you that with mass cytometry we can now determine the composition of tumor ecosystems. Now the question is how can we evaluate the structure within the tumor ecosystem? And to do this we must not dissociate a tumor but we need spatial cell analysis in situ. And in order to enable this my group developed Is my group developed what now is called imaging mass cytometry, and here we again use this Seitoff machine. But in order to enable spatially resolved measurements, we do not dissociate a tissue into single cells, but we slice a tissue or tumor into so-called tissue sections. We then stein those sections again or mark molecules that we are interested in on those sections with metal. In on those sections with metal isotopes. And then we use a laser that systematically removes part or spot by spot of the tissue. So we ablate the tissue and every time the tissue is ablated by the laser, we generate a small particle cloud of the tissue that we then analyze again in the site of mass cytometer. And this allows us then for every location on this tissue in which the laser shot. Location on this tissue in which the laser shot to determine again which isotopes are present and via inference which molecules are expressed. And since we do this systematically across the whole tissue, in the end we can assemble in silico a high-dimensional image of, in this case, what you see here is a cell line or any other of the tissues. And ultimately now, the imaging mass autometry images, they're now fairly simple. That are fairly similar to fluorescence microscopy. Here you can see images of a cell line called A431 cells. And the two markers I would like to point out is phosphorylation on histone H3. It's a marker that indicates cells that are mitotic. And the antibody that labels this phosphorylation binds to the chromosomes. And you can nicely see here in those images the chromosomes. In those images, the chromosomes that are lined up and how they're separated into the two cells at mitosis. And that really looks akin to what you see in fluorescence microscopy. Or here to the bottom right, you can see phosphorylation of PLC gamma2. That upon EGF treatment increases. And you can also nicely see how imaging mass hytometry saw this upregulation of the Saw this upregulation of this molecule in the cells. Here's another example. Here we measured a breast cancer cell line called MDIMB231, where you see in red CD44 and green rementin and in dark blue DNA. And if you now zoom into this cell line that we imaged, you can nicely see the rementin filaments, or you can see cells again in late mitosis. And overall, Hartland Jackson, who's actually also Hartland Jackson, who's actually also present here today, did the direct comparison of immunofluorescence imaging versus imaging mass cytometry. And he could nicely show that the data is now very similar to microscopy, routine microscopy, but that we have a slightly lower resolution. But as long as you're not interested in small subcellular structures, that really does not matter. Does not matter. And the big advantages of imaging mass hydrometry is that we can image 40 markers simultaneously. The main caveat in a moment is that it's a slow technique. It takes us about one hour to image a square millimeter. The limit of detection though is similar to fluorescence microscopy. We also have implemented methods that you can use it for organoids or tumorspheres in high throughput. We will, I guess, this week. We will, I guess, this week put the manuscript on bio archive and also that this technique by now is commercially available. We furthermore developed different tools to be used with imaging mass otometry. One is that you can simultaneously image transcripts and proteins, and this allows you to detect cytokine and growth factor producing cells. Since these factors are released, it's hard to detect them using an antibody. Detect them using an antibody, but since we can measure now the transcripts, we know which cells are actually producing them. And here is an example of a melanoma tissue section. The dotted line is the tumor-stromal boundary. And you see in red cytotoxic T cells, in green the expression of interfrone gamma, which triggers the release of CXCL10, which we then find in the same regions where also interfrone gamma is present. And this for me was a key development. And this for me was a key development since now we can measure cell phenotypes, cell state, but we can also draw conclusions about which cells communicate and how they communicate with each other. Other advantages of this technique is that we overcome lots and lots of issues of optical methods such as fluorescence microscopy. And since there are many methods out there for multiplex tissue imaging that rely Multiplex tissue imaging that rely on fluorescence microscopy, there are many issues that still these methods have to struggle with. And to give you one example, this is a bone metastasis section of a breast cancer patient. We imaged the region shown here in this square. And we zoomed in using fluorescence microscopy. You can see cytocarotene in yellow, CD68 in red, and DNI in blue. And then we imaged a very Blue, and then we image the very same region using imaging mass hytometry. And please note how there is lots of yellow in fluorescence microscopy, but really no signal in imaging mass hytometry. And this is actually all auto-fluorescence in this fluorescence methods that we do not suffer in imaging mass hytometry. Same is true for within the tissue. And in addition, we have a much larger dynamic range. It's about 10 to the power of... It's about 10 to the power of 3 larger. And you can, I guess, just images tell it all to you how big the difference is. And also, we can image tissues that are not penetrable to light. And here, this is a bone. And sometimes you just cannot image the bone, since, in light of fluorescence microscopy, you would only see black. And we can still analyze this thoroughly. Then we also developed. Then we also developed a toolbox called HistoCat that enables analysis of cell types and what we call social network of cells. So here we can visualize the images, we can determine the different cell phenotypes, how these phenotypes interact, or to be more accurate, we statistically test whether pairs of cells can be found next to each other more often or less often than you would expect by chance. By chance, and we can also mask the tumor regions or the stromal regions and determine the distance of cells to those boundaries. And we are now actually also very close to release the next version of HistoCAT. It's called HistoCAT web. The original version relies on MATLAB and the new version will simply be a cloud-based solution where you can log in and do your analysis. So, now coming back to the aim to evaluate the structure of tumor ecosystems. The biggest strengths of imaging mass autometry, or one of the main strengths, is that it allows for retrospective studies, meaning that we can now go to biobanks where there are millions of patient samples available with long-term clinical data associated with them. Because that for the first With them because that for the first part of the talk, for the first project, we had to analyze viable tumor cells, or we needed viable tumors. So we did not have any long-term clinical information. With imaging mass hytometry, we now can go back to biobanks and generate cohorts of samples that allow us to address specific questions based on the clinical features associated with the sample. On the clinical features associated to each sample. And in the following study, that was led by Hartford Jackson. I mentioned to you already that he is present in the call today. So then afterwards, you can also ask him lots and lots of questions. One of the questions that we wanted to address is, can we use imaging mass cytometry and what we then call the single cell pathology to better stratify breast cancer patients? Stratify breast cancer patients. So, here to the left, you saw these four clinical subgroups, and the question was: well, can you perhaps split up those groups or come up with completely new subgroups of these breast cancer patients? And so, Hartland set out to develop an antibody panel that included all of the clinically used markers, such as estrogen receptor or HER2, but he also added many additional markers that Many additional markers that describe the phenotype of these breast cells, but also of the immune cells that are present in the tumor, but also the state of these cells, such as whether they are proliferative, whether growth signaling is activated, epigenetic state, viability, and so on and so forth. And here I will not go into details again on which. On which cell phenotypes he identified. This was similar to the first study. And what I will directly show you is how those different tumor, immune, and stroma cell phenotype were distributed across the cohort of this 281 patients. There's a comment. Shall I address this now or shall I address this? Address this now, or shall I address this question at the end of the talk? We can wait for the questions after. I think GC is just trying to have a spot. Okay, good. Yeah, we wait for after I'll answer it in the end. Okay. So now what you can see here is every patient is represented by a column. And the single cell density that we found in this image analyzed by for each patient, we then plotted the single cell density of these different phenotypes that in green. Phenotypes that in green is immune, bluish stroma cells, and all the other colors are the epithelial breast tumor cells. And then we performed hierarchical clustering, and you can immediately see just visually that there are groups of patients based on their phenotypes. And you can also see that there are more than just the groups that you have then defined in the clinics. And now, this special feature of this cohort. Feature of this cohort is that we had long-term survival data for each patient, and that we knew whether or not the patient died of breast cancer. And now here I show you the survival curves based on the markers used in the clinics. So first black is the average of the whole cohort. Then in yellow, you can see the luminal A patients. In pink, you said the luminal B. The triple negative one. The triple negative ones are those in green, and the HER2 positive ones are those in violet. That's what you would get in the clinics. Now, what we found in the study is that among those patients that are enriched in the hormone receptor cell, so these would be mainly luminal A patients, we could identify one subgroup where the patients actually did not succumb to the disease. Succumbed to the disease, and others that had a poorer prognosis than those than you would expect for this group of patients. Then, there was also another subgroup that was also enriched in hormone receptor cells, positive cells. We had another subgroup where there were only few hormone receptor positive cells. But it was striking that also here we identified a subset of patients with a very good prognosis, others with a fairly poor one. And ultimately, And ultimately, these are the patients that are mostly from the triple negative subgroup. Even here, we could identify a subgroup of patients that had the good long-term survival versus those that, as expected, had a poor long-term survival. And what this showed us is that we can actually stratify patients or identify many of those patients with a good prognosis compared to what we actually find. Compared to what we actually find using the clinical stratification. Now, one big advantage of imaging mass cytometry and all other multiplexed imaging methods is that we now have a lot of biological knowledge about each of these patients and patient groups. And we started to ask: how do those patients actually differ? And to give you one example, if you looked at this patient group one and three, then we could. Three, and we could find that both contained this. Now, let's call it a dark brown breast cancer cell phenotype. So, both contained this phenotype, but this patient group 3 had a much poorer prognosis. It had more of this pink phenotype. And you can also see that morphologically, the structure was very different after group 3 versus group 1. And this then initiated to ask, how do To ask how do those cells and groups of cells and morphologically, how do this differ? And ultimately, then Jana Fischer, who is the shared first author on this study, she's a computational scientist, had the idea to look into stromal communities, so into spatial communities of cells. And to determine those, she assigned each cell a node. Cell-cell interactions are the edges. And then she used Luvain to identify. And then she used Louvain to identify cellular communities in those images. And when we gave a closer look into how these epithelial communities, so the breast cancer cell communities are structured, we found that if you just look at the color, they're very homogeneous. So there's typically only one tumor cell phenotype present, but they do differ in how large these communities are, which is shown on the x-axis, the average cells per The x-axis, the average cells per community. And here's an example: community 16 has few cells, 22 has more cells, and 14 these large sheets of the very same tumor cell phenotype. And so here we learned that epithelial or breast cancer cells, they're driven by homogeneous phenotypes, but the size of the community, the number of cells. In the case of the stromal communities, it was different. Here we have the cell phone. It was different. Here we had a mix of all the different cell phenotypes, and these communities were much more driven by the structure and composition of these communities. And now quickly coming back to this pathology groups one and three that had this distinct survival curves, when we now looked here at which communities were present, then we found that in this group number one with the long-term survival, they were dominated by They were dominated by this community number 23. So, this has this large sheet of cells, while this patient group number 3 with the poor survival was mainly dominated by this tumor cell community number 17, which is only small clusters of these tumor cells. Jana then also built an overall model and computed the hazard ratios, where to the right you have the good procedure. Where to the right you have the good prognosis features and to the left the poor prognosis. And you can see here the different communities, either the tumor or the stromal communities, as well as the grade that are used clinically to assign these patient groups. And you can now see that this tumor group 23, this community 23, that before was associated to this group of patients that. To this group of patients that had a very good survival. Also, here it's associated to good prognosis, and this community 17 is associated with poor prognosis. And we find other even more extreme examples, where you can see here this violet tumor cells, but depending on how the communities are structured, we can have a very poor or very good prognosis. And the same was also true for the stromal communities. And here it was. And here it was interesting that in some of these triple negative patients that had a good prognosis, surprisingly, we then had these micro dystromal communities that were also associated with this good prognosis. And so this really showed us that it's not just a marker or a cell phenotype, but that it's communities of cells that can be informative about the prognosis of a given patient. Patient. So, here, that's just a quick summary: that these communities are a novel descriptor that can be used in tissues to predict patient risk. We also could see that the single cell pathology can be used to improve patient solidification. And by now, also this imaging mass cytometry and histocat, we now broadly use it in basically all projects in my. Basically, all projects in my or most projects in my group, and you're already using it in observational clinical studies. And I hope that eventually there will be actual clinical studies to assess the value of this technique for the patients. So, now this will only take one or two more minutes because I think my time is pretty much up. But I just want to. Yeah, I think we need to leave time for questions, please. So, yes, this will be very quick. This will be very quick because so far all that I've shown you is 2D. But in 2D, we miss most of what's reality in the tumor, in the ecosystem. If you want to explain a cell state and we have a section and an image, we most likely will miss important features on top or below the cell. So what you really need is 3D analysis of tumors. And actually, this we just submitted or We just submitted or put this manuscript on bioarchive. So we developed one workflow that enables 3D analysis of tumors and we generated now the first data sets again of breast cancer where we used imaging mass autometry to analyze tumors in 3D. I will not go into details here. I will directly jump to this video. May you see the different colors, the different tumor cell phenotypes, anion blue and violet. And in blue and violet, you see stroma cells, and over here you see pockets of the tumor cells. And people always ask me, why do you need 3D? Isn't 2D everything we need? And my answer is typically no. And this is a nice example why that is. So here you are assuming through the set axis of this pressed tumor model. And then many individual tumor cells. And what I believe what we see here is micrometastasis and invasive tumor cells into the stroma. And to see this within a single 2D section is really, you would have a lot of luck to have. Have a lot of luck to have this on the same section. So, here we can use this to analyze spatio-temporal processes within a tumor. All right, with this, I quickly want to acknowledge my group, who is doing an amazing work. Many of the people here on this image contributed to the development of imaging mass otometry. And especially, I want to acknowledge Johanna Wagner, who was the main driver of the first. Driver of the first study where we used mass cytometry to study 144 tumors. And here, the collaboration with IBM and the PATH Foundation in Germany. I greatly want to acknowledge those two institutions. And for the imaging mass automatic project, I greatly want to acknowledge Jana Fischer and Hartland Jackson. He's also present today. Those two were a dream team in driving the second project. And then I also want to thank the University Hospitals of Zurich and Basel for providing us samples. Basel for providing us samples, and also the European Research Council, the NIH, the Swiss National Science Foundation, and other institutions for funding the research of my group. And with this, I'm done. I'm happy to answer the questions. And I already see that there are several. Yeah, I think the first question came from GC1, and he wanted to know if he could comment on the difference between image. If you could comment on the difference between Image MasterSpec and similar technologies such as SciSIF, Codax, and MIBI, yes. So I guess I first start with MIBI, which is the multiplexed IMB imaging, where you, so we use a laser to apply tissue and to analyze it in a mass spectrometer. And in multiplexed IMB imaging, you use a slightly different approach in that you have what you Slightly different approach in that you have what is called the primary ion beam to release the metal isotopes that are then as secondary ions are analyzed in also a mass spectrometer. And there are several differences. One is that in multiplexed I beam imaging, you can, in a way, tune the resolution. That has some advantages. In theory, you can also go to very high resolution. The overall specs. The overall specs of the latest approach is that they're very similar to imaging mass cytometry. I assume this technology is not yet as accessible as imaging mass hytometry. And one very big difference, however, is that in imaging mass hytometry, we applied the whole tissue section. That means that our technique is very quantitative. While in multiplexed IM beam imaging, In multiplexed IM beam imaging, you only remove a tiny, tiny amount of the top layer of the tissue, and it's not easy to control how much you actually remove. So in comparison, it likely is less quantitative and more qualitative compared to imaging mass cytometry. So I guess I actually have a whole lecture that compares these different techniques. Perhaps I should dig those out. So if you know Dig those out. So, if you now look at SISIF, that's a fluorescence-based tissue imaging method where you stain with one of your antibodies on the tissue, you do the imaging, then you have to quench the signal. This can be done by removing the antibody or by quenching the fluorophore. And this, in theory, allows you to do a lot of cycles, but practically, in this technique, In this technique, over time you destroy the tissue, you alter the epitopes. And another issue is that you suffer from autofluorescence. And there are many things. So it's in a way finicky. The advantage, though, is that you can use it in routine microscopes and you can fairly easily image large areas of a tissue. And in my group, we are now more and more start to do. More and more start to do some fluorescent imaging on a whole tissue section and use this to guide where to use imaging mass cytometry, since the measurement speed is slow. And codecs, one difference here is that you bind all antibodies at the same time on a tissue, and then you have a DNA tag on the antibody, and you read out this DNA tag. Deanitech. And Codex, like all of the cyclic methods, has also issues associated with the fluorescence, the autofluorescence, how the tissue behaves over time. So these are all things that you have to deal with. And I think in the moment, also practically, how you can use the codex instrument and the areas that you can image, as I understand from people that use it, might also still be. People that use it might also still be somewhat limiting. So, in the end, I think it's always a question of what you want to achieve, what is your question, and with which advantages and disadvantages can you live with. I think a major key point is that if you want to analyze formaline-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, and this is pretty much all of the tissues that you have in biobanks, they show They show often strong out of fluorescence in fluorescent-based methods. So, here I would strongly suggest that you should use imaging mass cytometry or MIBI to analyze those samples. Since with the fluorescent samples, you struggle a lot. So, I told you we are doing this pre-imaging of tissues with fluorescent methods by now, also multiple markers. And people in my lab are always quite excited. And people in my lab are always quite explicit that, yeah, it's kind of okay, it gives you some good impression, but there are lots of artifacts because once you use a metal-based method, like I've shown you before, many of the signals that seem to be there, they just disappear or look somewhat different as what you would expect. I hope this answered this question. What other questions are there? So, one of the questions. So, one of the questions came about communities, and I think that for computational folks where we're trying to integrate across different platforms, how can we define communities and then transfer that information to maybe other platforms? So combining the SISIF, the higher resolution, or the lower resolution data together, SISIF or one of the SITOF methods together. What do you think? Methods together, what do you think? I mean, for the community building, ultimately it was Louvain implementation that was used to identify the communities. And so I guess one question is how you construct the graph beforehand. That then, of course, will have an influence on what you will do with the nearest neighbor graph that you will do. But I think it was fairly routine how it was implemented. I don't know whether. I don't know whether Hartland wants to give an additional comment here, since he was deeply involved in the optimization of the whole process. So it's like Baron said, we're basically building the graph out of the neighbor analysis that we've produced. So any cell that's within four microns of another cell we deem neighbors. This then produces a network. Produces a network, and then within that, we're using Lovain to basically optimize the modularity. And then this defines modules of highly interconnected cells that we're then defining as communities. So it's 100% spatially defined of groups of cells that are close to each other in a clump. And then that's how we're defining communities here. And I guess one key aspect, as I mentioned, is how do you define a neighbor? What's the distance to the neighbors? The distance to the neighbors, etc., and ultimately, like for many things, that like what's the perfect clustering method? There is none. So, you always have again to assess versus biological reality and knowledge. We probably have time for one more question before 8:30, but we can run over into the break for a second if we wish. So, there was a question here about defining the phenotypic habit from this from Chair. Phenotypic happening, from this from Chen Meng, defining the phenotypic abnormality and basically complementing that on top of clinical factors that already exist, such as grade, TMN, stage, survival time. So why not use the clinical factors that already exist? So that's a great question. The aim when we developed this was, so ultimately we set out to determine a measure. Determine a measure for tumor heterogeneity. Because initially, when we started this project, we assumed that, as you find in literature, tumors are fairly heterogeneous. And so we looked into different ways how can we describe this heterogeneity that we might find in those tumors. And we had some good ideas on how to do that. But then what we found was this dominant few phenotypes in those tumors that was really a surprise. And then we And then we then all the ideas we had in the first place that just didn't play out. And also, when we tried, for example, to group those patients, and you can also group them is also in, I mean, we use some PCI in the paper and to actually look how these phenotypes relate to clinical features. It's very difficult since these phenotypes are so different to find relationships. And so we had to go a step back and think. To go a step back and think, what can we in a way quantify? And what we then realized is how different are those cells from normal. And so then we also looked into different possibilities how to describe that. And then we found that with the autoencoder, it's a good and reliable way to do it. And then we also found, and that was in the interesting part, that this phenotypic abnormality is reflected. Abnormality is reflective of clinical features. So, like the grade. So, and that gave us one score that, in a way, is reflective of many of the features of the patients. But in a way, I have to admit, it wasn't our first aim to come up with this call. It was rather, oh my God, there's not really the heterogeneity we had expected. So now we have to find something else to quantify the The features of the tumor cells across all of these patients. And I mean, if there are other ideas in this workshop, please let me know because that's something we think about a lot and also still have not a good idea on how to describe these ecosystems in a good way. I think that's actually a very, very important question. There's actually a lot of questions. We're going to copy those into the Slack and hopefully yourself. Hopefully, yourself or Heartland would like to answer those. I can also email them probably to you, but ideally, you can join the Slack channel and we can continue those discussions. But for now, we'd like to take a break and we can return at 9 p.m.
