Thank you everybody for being here. Hiking outside and enjoying some place. I appreciate it. Thanks to the organizers for the invitation. So this is a great place. And yes, and I'm going to talk about the game function that you heard a lot about already up to now. So actually I'm going to give Up to now. So actually I'm going to give you maybe a few more details just for uh for those of you. Sorry, I'm having a maybe printing it on a piece of paper could have been a wise thing to do, but yes it's fortunate. Okay, I was saying I will give you some introduction anyway, so for those of you who don't work every day with the UTCross varieties and That would decurse for varieties and stuff like that. Maybe I will tell you what the J function is, right? What are the properties of the J function that define the J function and then how we use them? The other thing we want to do is, well, I will tell you again about what this exponential algebraic closeness project of zip benefit. And I think this will be repeated again in another talk later. So by the end of this workshop, you will know. This workshop, you will know what it is, like even if you don't want to know, you don't have a choice. All right, so first of all, let's start with the background, the origin of this problem, that is the way we're approaching the problem, which is Z burst exponential algebraic closeness conjecture. So say you take a bunch of polynomials with complex coefficients in two n variables. In two n variables. And then you write this system of equations. P1 Z1ZN e to z1 e to zn equals 0, dot dot dot pk z1 zn e to z1 z e to zn equals 0. And you want to know whether it has a complex solution or not. Now the Zimbabwe's conjecture is that So there is a solution in C to the N. So the solution is going to be tuple of n complex numbers, unless that's a very good reason. Okay, this is the part that is always a bit annoying to explain, so I'll give it to Bit annoying to explain, so I'll give it to try now. Again, maybe if you repeat this several times, then we find a way that everybody can agree on. Okay, so what's a good reason? Well, the reason should be geometric, meaning what? Well, the idea would be that if I have too many questions and I try to do this, well, but the potential function is a transcendental function. If I ask for too many questions, Continental function. If I ask for too many things, I don't expect to find solutions anymore. So let me make this more precise. Meet of notation. Find V algebraic variety of the points where polynomials value, right? Just as polynomials. Remove the exponential function. Thus, polynomials. Function. Those polynomially two n variables. This is an algebraic variable. And then let gamma be the graph of the exponential function. Well, in this sense. Okay, still points in C to be n and apply x to all the coordinates. I take it as a positive. You can read it. It will be still legible for now. Okay, so you have these two objects. This is now an analytic set of dimension n. Now, this n is kind of the main thing. If you want to find If you want to find, I'll take now let me say the final thing of solutions sorry solution x corresponds to a point x e to x in this intersection. So I'm really so this is really the thing we want to say. We want to see what this is. Is this a non-empty set or not in the complex numbers? And now I can use this dimension information. This is an analytic set of dimension n. The ambient space is of dimension 2n. So I should at least require that the dimension of v, the algebraic right itself, is n. Otherwise, we are into unlike. Otherwise, we are into unlikely intersections. We don't expect fine intersections. Okay, so one likely intersections, which means I'm going to require that the dimension of V is at least f. Otherwise I say, well, otherwise I mean I have no expectation of finding permitted graph, but Perimeter R, but that's not what we're going for here. We're going to find some geometric conditions on P that guarantee that there are always solutions. So this is a sensible one. And it's not the only one. This is easy to explain. What else you can do, but also, for example, you could project to To x1, y1. Alright, when I do this, say that this PR now is this projection to these two coordinates. I'm looking at the projection of, I mean, the projection of the point in this intersection is going to be here. Nothing controversial. But now the problem is. But now the problem is what? Well, the projection of gamma, the graph of exp, well, that's going to be just the graph of exp, just one coordinate. So this is going to be of dimension one. And now when we expect to find intersections here when expect well this light intersection when the dimension of The dimension of this projection of the is at least one. Okay, so the same. So, if you agree, if this was a reasonable requirement, I also need to ask that the variety has the property that when I do this projection, the projection itself is also of touch dimension. I mean, touch enough, in this case, at least one. Okay, is that enough? No, I need to ask more. I mean, of course, I need to take projections to the other coordinates, but also I can take four coordinates like this instead of just two. And then it gets even worse. Maybe I can also map to more complicated things. So say I can map to x1 plus 2x2.1.2 squared. Another map that I can use, and because the exponential function is a group of homomorphism, when I look at the image of gamma, the graph of x, through this map, I still get a set of dimension one. And so I need to require that if I apply this map to V, I get an algebraic variety of dimensional at least one. was the same requirements. So um oh I should give it a name and I then prepare this this is the map so this was a projection, this is just a homomorphism, say this is a phi, then want dimension of phi b to be at least one because Because dimension of phi gamma is one. Okay, so you want to go through all of this and now the statement or the conjecture, so the summary is, well I'm not going to tell you the full thing. I suppose I could tell you exercise. Figure out how to complete this picture based on the things that I just told. Based on the things that I just told you. And the summary is when E is V in Rotan, V interceptor gamma is not happy. That's a conjecture, okay? So this is it's not a statement, it's a conjecture. It's a conjecture. That's the conjecture of bodies. Free rotand. Well, free is actually a slightly different thing, but I won't go there. I'll just say rotand captures this idea that this intersection between B and gamma is likely, however, you look at it. Meaning, however, I use these projections, like coordinate projections of these maps, where the group structure plus here and times here are arranged in a way that the graph of x remains the graph of x, essentially. I always see something like that. So, this is something now. I like the terminology of Tom and Sebastian here. They use the word. They use the word persistent way, rightly. Just in case it's this, well, it's more descriptive than rotate, you would say. Okay, the point is, you want it to be light intersection in the sense of these dimensions, and you want this to be true, even if you apply some of these maps. Now, the thing I'm not telling you, although what it is. Not telling you, although in this case, because you don't know the exponential function, otherwise it wouldn't be here, it wouldn't be right to do the bowshot. So, for the exponential function, you can see what this is about. This is about the fact that this comes from u of x plus y equals u of x equal y and Well, the remaining thing to say is why do I think that these are all the conditions, all the maps you need to use? So why does it... So making this conjecture, actually, assuming that potential that's potentially controversial, I'm only looking at projections and maps that use linear combinations here with. Linear combinations here with integer coefficients. Short version. So, how do I know that this is really everything I need to say? But the reason is to ensure that all these maps, these conditions, these maps are all of them. How do I say this? Total completeness. I want to say, how do I know I'm capturing everything? Why Why should that be enough? Those marks. And I haven't told you what they are, but again, think about them again. So why are they enough? Why should those mark be enough? But now this comes from Axe Schander, which is a transition. Which is a transcendent statement about the exponential function. So now the idea is that to make an extreme case, if instead of the exponential function here, I have an algebraic function, then the gaming becomes completely different. If I have algebraic functions here, basically asking, I'm taking two algebraic varieties and I want to know if they intersect. Well, but then I just compare the polynomials and check. But then I just compare the polynomials and check whether the ideal of these, you know, the two ideals generate a proper ideal or not. Like different kinds of gamma. Whereas here, because the exponential function is transcendental, I'm saying, well, we should be seeing, really just required that the dimension would be z and these other things. So I need to be careful about which identities, algebraic identities. Algebraic identities are satisfied by the exponential function. And of course, this is one of those algebraic identities. And from this, I can generate other ones. I mean, from this example. And Scharmer tells us, in a sense, that these are, that the things you generate this way are the only relations, the only identity is satisfied by x. So let me state actually geometric just to. Geometric just to resolve actually. Okay, so at Sharn, I'm going to write it in this way. Let's now take another algebra to write it, again C to the N. And suppose that the dimension of the intersection between W and gamma. Which is w gamma is still greater than zero. Okay, so there is some analytic curve, for example, inside the graph of x, which lies on such weak right. Then extra tells me that either the dimension of w is at least n plus one some intersecting algebraic variety of dimension n plus one with an analytic set of dimension n, but you find something of dimension one. Well, you find something of dimension what? I. There's nothing strange about that. Or well, there's a or maybe the d if the dimension basically if the dimension of Delta is less than or equal to n, so this becomes some kind of a likely intersection, well this must come precisely from some finite union of cosets. And then being vague here. I could put potential marks. So let me give you an example rather than this. An example is basically the same thing with that, but expressed in another way. For example, if you take the variety w defined by x1 equals 2x2 and y1 equals y2 squared. Y2 squared, this is inside c to the 4, I'm taking in n equals 4 here. Now, what happens when you take intersection of w with the graph of x? This is something of dimension 2. This is something of dimension 2 again in the space of dimension 4, but if you look at this, because whenever x2 is twice. Whenever x2 is twice x1, x2 is the square of x1. So when I do this intersection, the intersection is going to have dimension one, greater than what I would expect. This is supposed to be, this is an original intersection in that sense, but it's fine because we know what the exponential function does. We know it's supposed to do this. But Axander tells us. But Shaq's chandelier tells us, right, this is the only thing that can happen. So once you know that, okay, and then now you can make simpler conjecture, you say, okay, these are the only, these kind of varieties, these cosets that I haven't defined, these are the only things I need to care about. And so I use this to define Rotant, to capture this idea of persistence directly, and then I state it in general. Is it likely an NSA contraction? Okay, which is a 2n equals 4, n equals 5, 2n equals 4. Thank you. Yes. Okay, so that's the story for X. Does that make sense so far? Heard that many of you have heard about this several times. This Dox for people especially uh must be here with this a lot. Uh must be here, miss a lot. Okay, so this is about the x. But the talking is about the j function. Right, so who is now, well, I won't even state the problem, let's just say what the j function is. The j function is not an exponential function, it's slightly different. So, first of all, it's a holomorphic function from the upper half plane. So, this H is just the complex numbers with imaginary parts that's greater than zero, which, well, this picture wants to be a picture of the upper half plane, cut off at Cut off at zero imaginary part. Okay? But find the plenty of these functions. Now the key properties, so this is the unique function such that, now let me make a list of things. First of all, it's modular, which means that J of Az plus B over C Z plus A z plus b over c z plus d is equal to Jerry's z for whatever EBCD, but for any EBCD, coefficients of the matrix in a set of z. So matrix with integer coefficients such that A D minus B C is equal to 1. The terminant is equal to 1. Why this matrix is? Well, because actually, this is a group action. I will tell you in a second. But let's just talk about J. So J is invariant under this transformation here. J is a constant. That would be too easy, of course. But we've got more, more precisely. We require that for when the imaginary part of z goes to infinity when moving vertically in the upper half plane, value of z has to be approximately x of minus π iz. Bust and correct me if I put plus or minus in both ways, because I do this. So this is saying it's not constant, because of course that would work, but also more specifically it has a certain growth rate when you go up towards uh towards infinity. Uh goes infinity and final quest: W is 17.8. Don't ask me about it. That's it. It's a normalization, right? You can rescale this function, but this is the traditional choice. Okay, now let me make two comments. First, you can Comments. First, in case you've never seen this before, this transformation here is actually a group action of S to Z over H. So notes S to Z acts on H. Exercise, verify that AZ plus B over CZ plus D is still in H, so the imaginary part remains positive. Also exercise, verify that Also, exercise where you find that if you act with the product of two matrices of Z, you can apply first one and the other, and you get the same result. So, this is a group option. You can do this. Just cross it. Okay, this one. Another thing is observe that the action of Of this matrix 1101 of Z is just translation by 1, which means that J is one period. And there's also another notable sort of transformation which is, if you take this matrix, it's just minus one over Z. Two things. I dropped here on the picture. I had here on the picture. So, what happens is when you look at this group action, then you can look at fundamental domains for the action in H. And this is the classical feature to be used. This is the standard fundamental domain. It's going to be a strip here of the number. Strip here of the numbers with real parts between minus 1 over 2 and 1 over 2, but not all of them, because you also have this map here. You actually also take away this disk, rate 1. And then, if you want to be precise, you have to drop this part of the boundary because this point goes the action plus one goes to this point. So we only want to take one of them, etc. Want to take one of them, etc. But this is the traditional picture. And this is also a nice fundamental domain because this is going to be definable in a nominal structure. So it's a good choice. Okay. The other fundamental domains, I mean, some of these are translations of the standard one, but then when you use minus one and z, you get a picture like this. And these copies of the fundamental domains, they're all going to have this tip on a rational. Tip on a rational number. So, this is what we want to call this a cusp of a fundamental domain, the point where it touches the real line. And it's always rational. So, these Funuelto domains, the cusp is I infinity. It depends on who's writing. It depends on who's writing. It's just something else. So the caspet with the rational numbers of this point at infinity moment. Okay, so let me write down now a couple of consequences before I try to state some version of the conjecture. The conjunction for the j function, so what would be the equivalent here, just say a couple of things. I'm going to need them later. So one is that if I look at the derivative j and I look at j gamma z, okay, now gamma is a matrix in a z to z, what's going to be the relation. So j is invariant. J is invariant under the application of gamma. But now exercise, use the chain rule. J prime is not invariant under the action of the group, but almost. Like you could write the correction term here. And you have the same thing for the secondary group. So it's going to be more complicated. The exact shape is not super relevant, uh but I'm not going to use it. Okay. Second derivative that's this. I'm not writing the third derivative because as you might have heard the last two days, j satisfies a third order differential equation. So what happens is that j three put prime, third derivative of j is just a rational function. j is just a rational function of j j prime j double prime. So for the purposes of now asking whether certain equations in j j prime j double prime can zero or not, every time you have j triple prime you can replace it the ration function of previous ones. So that's why the title says jg prime is equal function. We don't need to go inside of it. And you might have heard that this differential equation has nice properties, right? The solution set in the CF0 is a strong minimal set. That's not what I'm going to talk about. Not to qualify it, as we say. So I leave that to the experts. Alright. So now the question is. Now, the question is: Now, this is going to be a transcendental function, differential algebraic buttons in the enter. So, you can ask the same kind of thing. If I write now a system of equations, polynomials, where I have J prime, J double prime placing these exponentials here, when do I find solutions? Now the approach is similar. We look at these persistently like intersections and Likely intersections, and to figure out what does it mean to be persistently likely, but we just have to know that there is an extra understatement for the time, which is much more recent 2016. I mean, I actually checked this, but it was yesterday. Right, this says something like that. Let's see if I can write this down without making mistakes. We take noun w. Again, we have n variables. Here we had C to 2n because we wanted to fit the graph of x. I lose just one function. Now we have three functions. So this is. So, this is going to be c to the 4n to fit all the things needs. And now, gamma, let me say gamma j, is going to be the graph of a three of them together with n variables, so we repeat them n times. So, this is also living in the same space. And now the dimension Now if the dimension of W intersection with this wj is oh yeah, no sorry, if this intersection has positive dimension, then if the w is big, it's of dimension at least 3n plus 1. This thing is of dimension 3n. Uh no? Dimension n? Here. Ah, no, no. Thank you. Yes. Thing is of dimension n, the space is dimension 4n. To find something of positive dimension, this thing has to be this big. Well, I mean, it should be this big, unless there's something special. And there's something special There is some condition which is like this intersection is contained in the finite unit of cosets. Here, the condition is, I don't want to actually write it down, but W is contained in either a bunch of coordinates here are actually constant, or there are two coordinates that That sorry, that should say the intersection between W and K. Or two coordinates are actually related via an element of a set to z function is bringing one to the other, which is the version for j of this kind of relation. So to here, right? Thank you. Yes, you want to so that there is How do I say? I painted myself in a corner. I mean, if it's a two-set, it's also true. I mean, of course, you can plug in a rational numbers, of course. This is not invariant on the things in GL2Q, if you allow rational coefficients, but there's going to be algebraic relations between them. Close enough? For purposes of this talk. So there's a bunch of relations like that. So there's a bunch of relations like that. And well, once you know now that these are essentially the only relations satisfied by J J prime, J double prime, now you can state the conjunction. Also, we state it without stating, we can cheat again, and we cannot actually tell you what the definition is. Now the conjecture is if you take a variety of If you take a variety, algebraic variety, in C to the 4n, if this is free and broad, then intersection with this gamma J is on empty. Yes, what to a ton? Broad. That's the meaning of this broad is. The meaning of this broad is, I mean, it's just that you need to generate, based on this idea you want to have things to be persistent rightly, you just write down all the relations, all the things you need to check, based on what you know from basically what comes from this relation here popularity. All right. So this is the thing that we would like to prove. I don't know if Vahagan connected remotely. It's too late. Yeah, it's too late. Anyway, there's a V here. Oh! Inside VS I don't want it to be. Okay, so we care about this and and well um well you should care about it too. You know, I'm not judging. If you don't care, that's fine. You're lost. Okay, so we want to know whether this happens in the same spirit as. Fine. So let me give you now basic example. Basic example is is in n equals 1. For exp, it will look like you have a single polynomial and you want to know whether it is zeros and for jet and it's going to be the same thing. Right. And well what happens? Now I didn't say anything about what we actually know about these problems. So let me say something now. Jonathan made a list. I'm going to make a shorter list. But in the case of X, well, what we know we know. No. It's true for n equals 1. For what reason? Well, for n equals 1, looking at this function here, p z e to z, and there is a very, very simple way, by a very elementary complex analysis, say that this thing must have solutions. Like, if it's never zero, that's going to be the exponential function of something else. This could be the exponential function of something else. And you look at the growth at infinity, for example, that's polycolas, you find that you're actually imposing a larger decoration on the function x itself. You say, okay, but x is a transactive function. That's not happening. So we know how to do this very, very easily. And for x, as it happens, we also know how to do n equals 2. This was very easy. This was very easy, right? This is not easy. It comes from an in-general. Now I don't know how many of you remember this from Jonathan's talk. Of course, if you know this paper in general, in general, you have to look at the projection of B of B first, but let's say the. be first, but let's say the x1, xn coordinates. And then in this setting, if the projection is, if this projection has dimension n or 1, we've done, we're fine. Refine. Maybe not distinguishable from a deep case. Okay, so the general result we have in this setting is also another one, but mention it tomorrow. It's a self-interest in mentioning this during this talk, but I forget that. Now, what we know is that you take a Verdi-maker ID V, you project down to the X coordinate. You project down to the x-coordinate. If what you get is almost all of the space, you get something of dimension n, then yes, we know that there's going to be solutions to the system of equation I community erased that we could write in this. And we also notice when the projection has dimension one, it's just a curve. Because in those two cases, the nice thing that happens in those two cases is that this being free rotant over This being free rotant or persistently likely, whatever that means, is extremely easy to verify. It's almost automatic. I mean, in dimension n is literally always true. The projection is one, it's well, the only case in which it fails, it's very simple to check. Once you exclude those two cases, then you can actually solve the equations. For n equals two, this covers everything because uh this projection is either dimension one or dimension two. Dimension one or dimension two. And that's it. For n equals three, we don't know, and actually, we don't really have a technique in mind for how to do this. I mean, Sebastian has ideas. So far, we don't have that yet. Okay, and then there's also the special case of recent powers. is when when V is of a very special shape is actually a product of a linear space in the coordinates x1 xn with an algebraic variety in the other coordinates in the y's and but now here you still actually here you it's non-trivial to check that this Trivial to check that this, you know, to whether this is free-rotant is a non-trivial condition. But somehow, this problem is also sort of all right. And it's related to what Francesco is going to talk about tomorrow. I hope I'm not putting too much on you. It's fine so far. Okay. Right. So, this is what we know for X. For J. For J, well for J is kind of the end of button now, so J for J if equation without J9 and J05, like so this is if you just take equations in Z and J Z, so In z and j z, so strings like pz j z epsilon persistence of this kind of a thing and this projection to exponent n has dimension n and yes all right and this is these are two surpass things to do this. 21 probably is the absolute list officially. We know this and Abutas do we know is now the thing I'm going to talk about today and the case A1. So literally just z az, the prime z, the double time z. And actually we're stuck here already. I mean I think we know how to continue, but this integration just started doing this properly. And unlike the exponential case, soving this is already not easy. And it's already not easy, right? There's there's there's work to do. So I'm going to show you some of the ideas going to this. Some of the ideas that we use can be generalized by the certain things. Some are probably not. But they were fun anyway, but not always fun. It took us some time to actually make it work properly, and you can see why. And then you can see why. Right, any questions so far? Problem is really, I want to solve these equations, one variable, compensative function. I want to know whether these are zeros or not. Right. So what's the theorem? The theorem is joined by Hagan. What we're going to do is join Bahager online, Sebastian and myself. I'm not putting it here. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Archive 2023. That's December 2023. So the theorem is this one: take F polynomial. F polynomial. So let me set up some notation because it is much easier to discuss certain things later on. So I take a polynomial in four variables and f z j z j form z j file z zero as solutions Going to leave the gap here unless I only require that we have solutions. That's actually still easy. But other things, right? You can do it with half a page, one page. What was it? Half a page, one page? Proving that these are zeros is fine. If I only require that these are zeros, then basically this is true automatically unless the polynomial is constant. Right. But we're going to do something a bit better, right? Only finding zeros is not that interesting. So what you actually do for this equation, for example, these are. For this equation, for example, dz dz, is actually you check very easily that this has infinite many solutions. So we want something similar here. We want at least infinity many. We want even more. So where is the R? Okay? So we want Okay, I made I made a bad bad bad call when raising this part before I even finished doing this. Before I even finished doing this, so the conjecture was that when you take an algebraic variety, we just wanted that this is not empty. What actually happens, if you believe the conjecture in general, then automatically we also have consequences. The consequence is that this intersection is a risky dice. So not only you find zeros, you find points in the intersection, you actually find the very sparse around the variety B. They don't leave on a sub-variety. And you can believe that this should be the case, also because if they all lie on Because if they all lie on a proper set of IT, then those are not likely intersections anymore. So the dimension goes down. That's suspicious operating. And then, formally speaking, literally, if you believe the conjecture for every at the priority, then you can prove as a consequence that these points are also the risk events automatically. So, with this in mind, what we actually want here is that This equation is risky-dense solutions, meaning that you have to translate now, this is a single equation, and you have to think, oh, this f defines some variety of C for the four, it's going to be a hypersurface, and you want the points, like this four-tuple. Of tuples like this to be the risky density of this. So this happens, and the theorem is this happens unless F is what, this specific form, is going to be, well if we write it like this, the same way we write it in the paper, it's product of polynomial just in X. Polynomial X is going to have finite many solutions. The very special case times times power of the variable y0 or y0 minus 1728 again to some power or y1 to some power okay and this is essentially sharp in the sense that if your polynomial is of this shape then no the solutions are not going to be the resistance because because those Because because those these are really these correspond to certain special values of j Right Okay, well and this is in some sense this statement is even stronger than the conjecture in the sense that somehow we're covering things that are not free, whatever that means okay so I'm just saying it's the setting is slightly stronger but in some sense Stronger, but in some sense, we also have to prove it in this way, in this form, just because of the way the proof works. At some point, we really need to prove that anything that is not on this form has the risk-bensido solutions. It's really part of what we need to do. Right. You are really out of time, but we could allow you a couple more minutes. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, so let's see. Okay, so how do we go through this? So there are two ingredients Ruby segments. Okay, the first one, so I number them, ABC. And one is, is it a This is a polynomial. You can think of this as a polynomial in z with coefficients that are one-periodic functions. One way of looking at it. Okay, so you look at polynomials in one variable with periodic coefficients. Coefficients, but one periodic coefficients. Let me show some conditions under which conditions they have zeros. And this is a general strategy that This is a general strategy that, because we're talking about periodic functions, I don't need to be talking about j. So, what we group here works for, of course, j j prime, etc., but also works for, for example, for the function x i z. That's also a long periodic function. It fits into this thing. This end of this thing. This end of this entity. Right. Um that's one ingredient. You won't apply it to something like this, but it has to satisfy conditions. Conditions, these conditions, for example, require that the polynomial contains the variable set in non-triggered way. I mean as a polynomial it has to be of the creative one. Okay, so does not apply to this hey, it does. So this A does not apply EG to an equation like this, J of prime plus J equals 0. It's technically a polynomial with periodic coefficients. It's polynomial degree zero in this sense. So this trick doesn't go for this particular equation. But we still need to, you know, we have to do this at some point. So how do we do this? So, how do we deal with this? Well, the second ingredient is, well, okay, let me shrink now this discussion in a moment. So, let me motivate V before just stating one line what V is about. Let's look at this equation here. This equation here, j d over prime plus j equals zero. I want to solve this, but the two, the only two we have so far is something that wants a genuine polynomial containing the variable z as a variable, but not as an input of this periodic function. So what can I do? Well I have a half design on the board, so I did my job this time. But what if I apply some element to my group? Of my group. Okay, if I solve this equation, if I solve this, I also solve the original one. Just apply the inverse of gamma to find a solution to the equation. What happens here, this is going to be equal to industrial computation plus 2c blah blah blah prime 3 prime. j doesn't change and this and now this is a this contains the valuable j going to be the leading term is going to be so it's going to be degree four the leading term is just c to the four degrees of the prime there's some stuff and then the constant term is going to be answer uh to c the q i Okay, now this is the right shape. I want to apply A. Well, then that's when things get tricky. And for a long time we kept chasing, you know, finding gaps in our arguments because essentially because now at this point we need to make sure that the we we actually satisfy whatever is required here. Whatever is required here. What is required there, for example, would be like, like, for example, we'd like the ratio between the constant term and the leading term, all that C from all 0 to prime, you have I'm almost done. I'm almost done. I'm not sure we're going to let you stay in C. Now, I mean, this is the example that shows directly. This proof sort of fits here at some point. To find poles of this function, you need to find a zero of this function, this J double prime. But by now, finding zeros of J double prime looks a lot like Finding zeros of g double prime looks a lot like the problem you actually had, the original problem here. We want a zero of this one, that is not a zero of this one. So we want a risky best set of solutions for this guy here. But now the leading coefficient has a special shape. And so the green B is about this stuff that we call the G homogeneous, which is it's all about handling the making sure that the readings are So making sure that the ligament has been and then there is an ingredient C because sometimes the lid inter is of this form. So the thing still doesn't work. But then there are some estimates, some zero estimates that we can use to solve that problem as well. Thank you. The question is why do you think this kind of projecture is true for J? I mean, what is special? I mean, why not? I mean, if you ask me if I believe it, I mean, yes, somehow, but but uh but not too strongly. But not too strongly, right? Because we don't, I mean, we certainly don't have a lot of evidence yet. But I would say this works on aesthetics. And the second problem is, so this is something to be careful, I didn't say this, but while for exponential functions, this thing applies for the minimality of the certain structure, don't have the same feature here. Because this H sub. H is on the half-plane, is not a countable subset of C and is not co-countable, it just doesn't fit into that picture. So there's no model theoretic consequence of what we're doing. We're just doing this because it's the same thing, and there is an X shadow for J, so we know what the persistent light intersections are supposed to be, so we're just going with that. That's why it's nice, so maybe I can't say it. Okay, and I use oh, so I mean now a version of X shamel for combination of J function with exponential? Right. Yes. Did you want to try this problem there too? Next year. No, it's absolutely we get that because eventually mixing varieties for all these things. Like Vincenzo again. And we'll take a five-minute break.
