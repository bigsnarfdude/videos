So um Brandon, I'm going to try and say way too much. So I've got three projects all about getting rid of fitness. And you know, this just tells you that if I don't get to number three, you can talk to me if you want to know anything about our loan cluster selection. All right, so let's start with the beginning, which is, you know, usually when I want to get rid of something, which is very frequently, I ask, well, what would I be missing if I got rid of it? So, you know, what is it that the work that fitness is doing for me that if I scrub That fitness is doing for me that if I scrub the word from my vocabulary, you know, what am I currently using it for that I might miss? So that's this idea: what work is it doing? And what we do when we use fitness, and I'm not talking so much about inferences, the sort of the what-if kind of questions that many of us ask, you know, is we're generally assigning some kind of short term fitness to some model in order to derive the answer to some question about what evolves. To some question about what are volumes. So that's usually the work that fitness is doing. What fitness we assign will be different in different models. So absolute versus relative fitness is one example. So we use the same S confusingly, whether we're talking about the absolute expected number of surviving offspring or the relative contribution to the gene pool. And I'd say that, you know, really, what we're actually assigning is neither of those things. Behind each assignation, Things. Behind each assignation of fitness, we are in fact assigning vital rates of birth, death, and growth. So, for example, a Wright-Fisher model has differences in types in their birth rates and a constant death rate and only one life-risky stage, and so growth doesn't apply. And those are assumptions about birth, death, and growth, and that every time we assign fitness, we are potentially implicitly always making assumptions about birth death. Always making assumptions about birth, death, and growth. And then, having made those assumptions, we then derive things. And so, classically, you know, if we're absolute fitness, we might put into a branching process and derive the probability that a beneficial mutation becomes established. Whereas relative fitness, we might be deriving the sojourn time during which how long fixation takes. So, we're doing something with it to get some. We're doing something with it to get some outcome that tells us something about what will evolve, and these are sort of intermediate steps in doing that. So, important point, often not understood, that absolute fitness is B over D, Narthusian parameter is B minus D. They do not contain the same information. There are two parameters here. And what you get out of them is also different. What you're getting out of them. Also different, what you're getting out of them might be a probability for the dimensionless one. What you're getting out of them is a rate for the one that still has rates in it. And this very much is the same as what Iwana was talking about yesterday in terms of amplification versus acceleration factors, whether you're talking about fixation versus whether you're talking about rapt. So, Iwana's example there was about the spatial structure of the population. I'll give you another example, which is about the Which is about the temporal variation rather than spatial variation. So let's just say we have a fluctuating environment revolving a probability of a seed germinating. And this shows you in one particular example, you know, what's the invasion probability as a function of the invader, what's the invasion fitness, and you can see they're maximized at different points. So this, what is the fittest type depends on, you know, what is the most likely to On what is the most likely to evolve, is different depending on how you phrase which output you look at as your output measure of what is likely to evolve. And I just want to highlight adaptive dynamics as a field always uses information fitness R and who knows what the results might be different if they, for example, used establishment probability instead. So, okay, so what we're doing in general, as I said, is we're In general, as I said, is we're assigning vital rights, and assigning these vital rights are basically growth, birth, and death. This actually looks functional. Oh, yeah, that's. So, and then what we're deriving is maybe little w or little r or their average across environments in some way. And this is, I have this here as a murky shadow that is short-term fitness of the underlying thing. Of the underlying thing that is the vital rights. Okay? And then next, we allow feedbacks. So there's going to be feedback, all birth stats and growth all affects the environment. And in addition, through density and frequency-dependent effects. And the phenotype also affects the environment via migration where the environment is chosen or niche construction where it's. Chosen or niche construction where it's altered. So it's sort of the causal stuff that's going on. In addition, we have some genotype-to-phenotype process going on in our models. Again, in some models, these are ridiculously simple, like, you know, fitness, you know, birth rate is the product of these 1 plus s terms, but still, that is also an assumption about the process by which a genotype goes to a phenotype through to the viral rates. And in more complex Rates. And in more complex models, we may explicitly consider the developmental environment, for example, and the informational environment. And in between those two, there's something we're calling strategy, which is given the information environment, what are you going to try to do? What's your organism trying to do? And then the phenotype is given the constraints of development, what does it actually succeed in doing? And then the selective environment acts on that. acts on that. And then we want to know what, we want to know, when we want to know what evolves, we're usually asking questions about strategies. Like those are the things that are biologically complex and interesting. And so to sort of close the loop on those, what we want to do is we want to somehow figure out genetic lineages. So genetic lineages are like let's introduce a new mutation, what happens to it? And that's all of the fate of that. And that's all of the fate of that. And our idea of long-term fitness is this hazy shadow of the entire complexity of the system, but more specifically, primarily it's a hazy shadow of the fate of the genetic lineages, which in a very complex way end up affecting the strategies and hence their evolution point. So, more about lineages. So, lineages are in the terms of the Lineages are in the terms of Jeremy's paper are the things that bear fitness, the long-term fitness, that is. Short-term fitness doesn't exist, that's just vital rates. So a lineage, to be clear, it is an object, a physical object in space-time. It is defined through the physical act of inheritance from the point at which it appears or begins typically by mutation to the point in which it fixes or goes extinct. That is the Extinct, that is the lineage. If you have recombination, each gene's lineages will be nested differently. We've talked about ancestral recombination graphs. It excludes, it's not the same as the fate of an allele because lineages consider, you know, the same alleles generated multiple times, those are different lineages. But it includes second-order affections where you have back mutations, where you have epi mutations. Have epimutations. It includes, you know, follow-on things enabling you to study evolvability and questions like that with this approach. So now lineages have the fitness, but how do we describe that fitness of lineages, that mythical long-term fitness? And of course that is stochastic. And one common or increasingly common method is the ratio of fixation to counter fixation probabilities. So this is Probabilities. So, this is basically the odds. If you take the limit of rare symmetric mutation, which state are you likely to be in on account of selection? And then you can multiply it by the mutation bias, and you can then piece out the relative roles of mutation and selection in causing one thing versus the other. So, great thing, I've used this, it's awesome, but it's not the only way I'm doing it. Another way that Another way that, again, back to Jeremy's paper, is inclusive fitness, normally thought of as an organismal property, but the point here really is that it's in fact a lineage property. Like, what do we do if we try and re-express lineage phase in per individual terms? And when we do that, when we sort of make force the units to be per individual, we get inclusive. Individual, we get inclusive fitness as a summary of the fate of lineages. But again, it's number two on the list. It is not the only way to summarize the fate of lineages. So we were kind of disturbed by the fact that we had no way of doing it for balanced polymorphisms, so we came up with one. And so this is just a picture of results for a simple Hawk dove game. But it sort of has three components. So you might think. Three components. So, you know, you might think, all right, you know, one that's more abundant at the mean, you know, in the mean field approximation, that's the fitter one, and how abundant you are is your fitness. But there's also the probability that you establish, and there's also the sojourn time before you stochastically go extinct. And so, really, you know, what we took is the time integral of total abundance under that curve, which is approximately the product of these three components. And you can see here. Of these three components, and you can see here as a function of the cost-benefit that, in fact, you know, the sojourn time ratio is more important than the mean abundance ratio. And in this walk-dove game, the establishment ratio is not very important. But, you know, this is a way of thinking about, you know, how do I think? You know, I can't just say what will invade. Both of them will invade the other. But yet, there are circumstances where one of them is dominant and the other isn't. So this is a way of quantifying fitness in a balance. Quantifying fitness in a balanced final model. So that's kind of number three. Okay, so but the main thing really here is just this picture. So this picture is a way of thinking and deconstructing and getting rid of fitness. Fitness, whether it's short term or long term, fitness is this shadow, oops, this shadowy thing down here. And these are the models with many simplifications, different spikes in every single model. Every single model, you know, these are the models that we're studying, and we're answering this question: what does natural selection favor, or what does natural selection plus something else favor, or whatever. So, we want to know what the fate of strategies is. So, thus ends part one, and I'll move on to part two. How do we think about strategies? So, I'm a great fan of Brimes Triangle. Grimes triangle strategies. It's shown here for corals. There was an old paper I haven't been able to find that actually applied it to scientists. Like, if anyone can remember it, you know, please point it to me again because I don't know who to credit. But these competitors overshading, their big molecular biology labs, throwing a lot of resources at the next most obvious question. I'm sort of over here as a more or less a bee specialist trying to colonize and get ahead of the curve and working the short attention span. And working with a short attention span on many things, and maybe one of them will become popular one day. And then there's niche tolerators who specialize in one thing, don't have that many competitors, do it very well, and so on. But anyway, whatever it is, there are those that specialise in births and dispersal, those that specialize in avoiding death, and those that specialize in head-to-head competition in a high-density environment. And I think this density is a really important access of the different strategies in these. The different strategies, and these strategies are why fitness is problematic. So, I find really curious that PlopGen has, you know, all the right fisher model and so on, emphasizes this competition, despite the fact that the history of evolution of life on Earth, there's clearly been, it hasn't been zero sum, there's more body mass now than there used to be kind of thing. Whereas ecology and economics tend to emphasize B and D, which, you know, there's not necessarily as much progress in those fields, perhaps all the time. Those fields of heights all the time. So I find it a little weird, but the fact is that when we make underlying assumptions that competition is C, known as W to us, or that competition is B, then we take on a lot of, you know, we make a lot of implicit assumptions about which strategies are being played and teamly and which ones are the special ones, which ones are the normal and which ones are the spice, and I think it's important that all three of them are really important points of competition. Them are really important points of competition. So, we wanted to see if we could have a unified theory that enables, you know, natural selection. All of these things are fitness. You know, they're all vital rights. So, how do we have a model with three vital rights that we can talk about fitness in? So, what we came up with is the took the lottery, well, the lottery model of ecology, for those who don't know it, is a generalization of the Wright-Fisher model, where instead of all their non- Fisher model, where instead of all their spots being filled, you know, the instead of, sorry, overlap that has overlapping generations, but not everyone dies of any abraction to them. And we extended it because they have every single end slot being filled, every single generation. It's like, well, what if sometimes nobody arrives there and it's not filled? So variable density bottom. So we've got these flies in the model. They have a birth cluster dispersal rate. They head out and look for uncolonized Look for uncolonised territory. And then you have competition. So, in a lottery, your chance of succeeding depends both on how many lottery tickets you buy and how competitive each of your lottery tickets is. And then, you know, according to those probabilities, black flies or white flies win in this picture. And then you have a round of death that, you know, frees things up. So, Jason Bertram. So, Jason Bertram heroically solved analytically this system. So, this is just death. You know, that there's a probability here of surviving death, and then there's how many you gain each time step. And how many you gain each time step is going to be proportional to how many cropicills you have and their probability of landing on the patch where they have a chance. And then you solve it by taking three. And then you solved it by taking three cases. So, this case is the easy one: the chance that our L is the total probability, and this is the chance it lands on an uncontested strategy patch. If it lands on a contested patch, then the C term is going to come in. And there are two more cases, and the math is kind of ugly, but computers don't care. It's analytically soft. All right. This was actually pretty heroic work on Jason's part. Part. So having solved it, we can now ask the question: Is what we do in POP10 okay? How does the replicator equation bear up under this? We have this simple replicator equation. Can we get it back from Jason's model? And the answer is if you have selection on either D or C or B and not the other two, you get it back. If you have pleiotropy and your genotypes vary in more than one at the same time, Types vary at more than one at the same time, you don't get it back. And the stronger the selection, the bigger the departure. But the departure is actually, it's not terrible. But if you're far from demographic equilibrium, so for example there are periodic disturbances and huge territories opened up and then you've got succession going back, terrible. Replicator equation behaves really badly. You know, if you're not at demographic equilibrium, and of course, populations are often not like, you know, Dmitri and Paul's. Dmitri and Pals, you know, Drosophilov fluctuating summer, winter. We're often not a demographic equivalent. All right. Is the S in the model, though? How can you translate what you just described to S. So in this simple case, D becomes like S, C becomes like S, B becomes like S. You know, differences in B, differences in D, differences in C. Normalized difference constant. We'll actually equal S. Will actually equal s. Cases where it's not. It doesn't matter what value of s, it doesn't fit. There is no value of s for no. Okay, so the question is, how does PopGen get away with it for so long? And I think the answer is, we just, you know, we ignore density. How have we gone this long? I mean, I know there's exceptions, but mostly. Exceptions, but mostly now, so how have we gone this long treating density as a spus, right? And the answer is: how did we even do that? You know, and the answer is that, you know, in a, what we do is we have, you know, here are our flies and they give rise to some obscenely large number and then we select usually on fertility. But if you do simulations on zygo fertility, you're faced with low selection, you'll notice something. Oh, yeah, so basically, how we get away with it is basically you do all your selection. With it, it's basically you do all your selection on the juveniles or on the fertility, and then you do density regulation afterwards, and then selection never affects it, right? Because you just patch it all up after the fact. You normalize, you get back to your population size. But the problem is that it assumes literally infinite reproductive excess. So, if you've ever done a rejection sampling with zygote viability with like really low fitnesses, you will keep selecting until you start to get really weird. Until you start to get really weird, extra-special fit recombination events, double mutation events, like truly bizarre stuff. And your simulation will also take a very long time to reach a population size event. Like we shove this under the carpet, but it is in fact built in, you know, in our choices that we are assuming there is literally infinite reproductive excess. So, you know, in contrast. You know, in contrast, in ecology, you know, usually the opposite assumption is made: that there is zero reproductive excess. Here's the NDT, and every change in birth and death, there's no compensation at all, immediately affects N. And our approach is basically by using two life history stages, we put a finite reproductive excess in and we get model three vital rates, and each of them interacts differently with density, whether it changes density. Whether it changes density, it is changed by density, or both. Sort of, we have those bases covered in those three points. All right. Am I going to get to part three? Two minutes. Okay, part three is what happens when we make reproductive excess final? And the answer is Haldane 1957 happens, is what happens. And for those of you, this is the cost of selection that triggered neutral theory. There was an extremely seminal paper until everyone started. Seminal paper until everyone started ignoring it. It was ignored shortly after it was solved, both independently by NAI and Belsenstein. Of those two papers, this one has the best title, or three papers, this one has the best title, the most accurate title, that fertility excess necessary for selection to work. That's the correct way of framing Haldane's question. So the way we look at it is selective deaths. Deaths, if they're a cost, you can think of them as being drawn from a budget of your reproductive exercise. And your selective deaths are basically the degree to which a mean individual survives and reproduces worse than it could have if it had the best genotype. And Day did this by integrating, you know, those extra deaths over the course of a sweep. And, you know, here's just a little picture of it that, you know. Just a little picture of it: that you know, if everyone has two offspring, you have an excess of one per individual, you have some extratrinsic mortality, and so you actually only have 0.33 as the effective reproductive excess. Then you do selection, it eats up all of your, in this example, in the way that Ney and Felsenstein both did it, it eats up 100% of your reproductive excess, and so 33% reproductive excess was all used, your budget was equal to the use. Used, your budget was equal to the use by selection. Haldane assumed that only 10% of debts were slow. Where'd he get this number? He pulled it out of thin air. Has anyone ever changed it? No, they all use, say, Haldane and use his number. Okay, so if you use his number like Manny Felsenstein did and you plug in K of 1.1, you get basically the same thing as with Haldane. Haldane made some mistakes, but it doesn't actually affect the result. So we actually measured this number. So we actually measured this number with data from Moyex, Posito, Alonso. And here on the x-axis is the proportion of deaths selective in some different environments. And in eight environments, one of them had something about 10% on this dashed line, but generally we saw the percent of selective deaths that was way above Haldane's 10%. So what is the solution to Haldane's dilemma? To Haldein's dilemma, really strong selection intensities in the realm of um selective deaths, you mean soft selection as opposed to hard selection? No, so so the the um so basically so we don't have self-selection and hard selection in the same way. You have or every selection is hard at its vital rate, and then at the next vital rate or at some other vital rate, you'll get compensation going. Vital rate, you'll get compensation going on that will soften it. That makes sense. So it's a different way because it's not, selection is not necessarily hard or soft at the point at which it's. Yeah, I'm just wondering what you mean when you see selective. It means that others die regardless. Yeah, sorry, I went too fast. So basically, this is what selective deaths is. It's basically the deaths that occur that causally contribute to the changes in allele frequencies. So the deaths that are happening to make selection. That are happening to make selection happen that would not have happened if you'd already got the best genotype. So it's relative to the best genotype present, and it's the ones that are affecting changes in all frequencies. So it's a causal definition. That makes sense. And this is Haldane's definition. That part we haven't changed. A lot of other stuff we did was just to generalize Name Felsenstein's results across to more complicated situations. Across to more complicated situations so that we could apply them to data. S is bigger, it goes faster, and there are less code guts. So, well, one of his results is that it doesn't depend on S. That's what I thought. Yeah. So this is, when you integrate it, the S goes away because the time goes at 1 over S. That's right. So help me understand why going from 10% to 50% is... Ah, because that's a selection coefficient. But selective deaths is a selection intensity. And intensity. And Hull Dan is all about selection intensities. So that's not the, you know. So, yes, basically, these are selection intensities. What percentage of all deaths are selective intensity? No coefficient. All right, so I got the bell, but just my slop. I get to my conclusions. Do we need fitness? Try not to. You can think about selection intensities. What percentage. Intensities, what percentage of deaths during each of your vital rats, you know, you could think about fitness that one. An advantage, since I'm in with the social people here in this session, an advantage is that vital rates really nicely, you just avoid the whole thing about individuals, which means you avoid generations. You just have vital rates, you don't have to care for what, you know, whether this is a growth at the organism level or a birth event at the cell level. Organism level or a birth event at the cellular level, you don't have to care about that. They're all just five organs, which is really nice. So, conclusion: how to think about fitness. If you must, I think this is sort of, this is really, I don't struggle with fitness anymore now that I have this diagram. It makes sense to me, which is a great model. We have an, if you're studying balancing selection or might be studying balancing selection, you have an outcome metric where you can see what strategy evolves. We solved this model of B, D, and C. Model of B, D, and C, and relative fitness does not capture its behaviour. Daniel is coming next, and he's going to talk more about exploring strategy space, in his case, with consumable resources. This model we solved was for durable fixed territories. And reproductive excess is definitely finite, but selective deaths, selection intensities in the real world could be so high that you have to worry about the speed limit. And thank you to the three extremely talented. Thank you to the three extremely talented people who were first authors and quite a bunch of training to all the groups. We've had a few questions and time is getting on, so maybe one more. And if there's not one more, we'll say thank you and we'll move on today.
