Okay, so very good. So I'm Apala Majumder. I work at the University of Strathclyde. And some of you will know that I primarily work on nematic liquid crystals, but I'm going to be brave today. So I'm going to talk about some of my recent work on nematic liquid crystals and also some ongoing work on smectic liquid crystals. And it's possible that some of you will actually have some very nice ideas and be able to help us because we're actually looking for some new ideas. So, this is largely a liquid crystal audience, so I don't really need to tell you much about liquid crystals, but just for completeness, these are materials that are somewhere in between solids and liquids. So, this somehow combine fluidity with the orientational order or the structure of a crystalline solid. So, as you might expect, there are many different kinds of liquid crystals. The commonly studied ones are the pneumatic phases, the smectics and the cholesterol. Phases, the smectics, and the cholesterol, but of course, now there are many more. But as far as this talk is concerned, and I realize it needs to be a fairly brief presentation, I'm really just going to be talking about nematics and smectics. So, most of my work is on nematic liquid crystals. They are the simplest and the most widely used liquid crystals. So, nematics, as far as I'm concerned, it's a very simple mathematician's perspective. The nematic molecules are elongated or rod-like, and these rod-like molecules. Rod-like, and these rod-like molecules they translate freely, but whilst moving around, they tend to line up along certain locally preferred directions. So, pneumatics have a certain degree of long-range orientational ordering. Now, semectics, which is what this workshop is about, and which is what I know, which is something that I'm kind of working on, but I still have, I still need to learn a lot more. So, smectics, as far as I understand, these are more like lead. These are more like lead liquid crystals. So they have a layering structure. So you have the commonly smectic, you have the you have many different kinds of smectic liquid crystals. But two common pictures here are those of smectic A and smectic C. So as far as I understand, the molecules, the smectic molecules, they're arranged in layers, and these layers are stacked on top of each other. And within each layer, you have this defined, well-defined pneumatic, you have this well-defined director, which is the special direction of the SMEC. Which is the special direction of the smectic molecules within each layer? Because within each layer, we can define a special direction analogous to the nematic phase. So you can somehow define a director within each layer, but then you also have the normal to the layer, which is this vector here, gradient to phi. And the angle theta is the angle between n, which is the director within a layer, and the layer normal grad phi. So we've also recently done some work on modeling. Done some work on modeling these smectic phases within shell-like geometries. But for me, the main idea here is that liquid crystalline phases, be they pneumatic or smectic, the key word here is anisotropy, amongst many other key words, the fact that they have these direction-dependent responses to external stimuli, be it incident light or electric or magnetic fields or temperature or mechanical stresses. And the fact that we can control, we can use these. Can control, we can use these direction-dependent responses to actually control some of the experimental observables, like the electric susceptibility or the magnetic susceptibility, the refractive indices, and even the viscosities. So, the direction-dependent properties of these liquid crystalline phases, they have a direct manifestation in the experimental observables, which you can actually measure in an experiment and you can actually use for a multitude of applications, as we all know. So, in terms of the things No. So, in terms of the things I work on, I mainly work on the mathematical modeling of this generic concept of partial order. The fact that these liquid crystals are materials which are partially ordered materials. They're somewhere between solids and liquids. So I largely work in a continuum framework, which means I don't worry too much about microscopic details and I work in a variational framework. And I largely look at equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena within these continuum frameworks. But more recently, we also look at multi-scale models. Also, look at multi-scale models, so models which actually interpolate between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions. And there are lots of interesting open questions there. Should anybody be interested in collaborating or just knowing more? So here is a quick overview of my talk. I'm going to start with a very quick review of Landau Deshen theory, skipping most of the details because this is an expert audience. Then I'm going to talk about some of our recent work for nematics, solution landscapes for nematic liquid crystals on 2D. Pneumatic liquid crystals on 2D polygons. Then I'm going to talk about some recent work on how we use solution landscapes in two-dimensional geometries to actually construct three-dimensional critical points or three-dimensional pneumatic configurations. And this, I think, is very interesting and it's also a very generic concept as to how you can use reduced studies to actually construct things which are relevant in higher dimensions. And there's probably an algorithmic way of doing this. Algorithmic way of doing this. And lastly, I'm going to talk about some of our ongoing work on smectic shells, which is actually in collaboration with Professor Jan Lagerwald's group at the University of Luxembourg and two of his students, and also somebody in my group, a postdoc in my group, Dr. Yu Chen Han. So hopefully there's something here which is of interest to everybody in the audience. These are just some of our recent papers, some more papers. So I'm going to start off with the Landau-Di-Gen theory. So I guess this is now. I guess this is now well known to everybody in this audience that the Landau-Di-Gen theory was actually one of the reasons for awarding the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1991 to Dijen. It is one of the most powerful continuum theories for nematic liquid crystals. So it's a continuum theory, which basically describes the state of a nematic liquid crystal by a macroscopic order parameter, which we call the Landau-Dijen Q-tensor order parameter. Deshen Q tensor order parameter. So, if you're an experimentalist, you can measure this order parameter in terms of experimental quantities like the magnetic susceptibility or the dielectric anisotropy. But if you're a mathematician like myself, the Landau-Desian Q-tensor order parameter is just a symmetric traceless 3x3 matrix, which contains information about both the preferred nematic directions within the eigenvectors and also the degree of orientational ordering about these directions within its eigenvectors. These directions within its eigenvalues. So it's a matrix. So it has three eigenvectors and three eigenvalues. It's a traceless matrix. The sum of the eigenvalues is just zero. The eigenvectors, they model the special material dependent directions, because remember, pneumatics are directional materials with long-range orientational ordering. And the eigenvalues, they measure the degree of orientational order about these special material directions. So I'm working in a variational framework. So, I'm working in a variational framework. So, we have the concept of a Landaudesian free energy, and the modeling hypothesis, which is quite generic in material science, is that the experimentally observable configurations, they will correspond to either global or local energy minimizers. Now, as you might expect, there are many different forms of the Landau-Dishian free energy. But again, let's just work with the simplest possible one. So, if you look at my formula here, you will see that the energy density. You will see that the energy density just has two contributions. So, Fb is just a bulk potential. If you look at this formula here, it's a degree four quartic polynomial in the eigenvalues of the Q-tensor. You can skip all the details if you're not interested, but basically it's just a non-convex, non-negative potential with multiple critical points. You can actually explicitly compute these critical points. The capital A is a rescaled temperature, and the B and the C, they're positive material-dependent constants. Their positive material-dependent constants, and the purpose of this bulk potential is that it basically dictates the preferred phase of the liquid crystal as a function of the temperature. So, for high temperatures, the minimum of this bulk potential is just isotropic when Q is equal to zero, when the system has lost all its orientational order. And for low temperatures, the minimizer, the bulk energy minimizer is uniaxial. Basically, you have pneumatic ordering for low temperatures, because I haven't actually told you what uniaxial means. Actually, told you what uniaxial means. So basically, you just have pneumatic ordering for low temperatures. Then you have this capital L, this is a material-dependent elastic constant. And then you have this elastic energy density W, which depends on both the Q tensor and its gradient. So again, multiple choices are possible for W, but these are two common choices. They're both quadratic convex functions of gradient of Q. The L here is just an elastic constant, and the L one and L two are also just elastic constants. Two are also just elastic constants. This many of you will recognize to be just the Dirichlet elastic energy density. This is what we call the one constant approximation. So based on the assumption that all deformations are equally energetically expensive, clearly not true because most pneumatic materials tend to be anisotropic. So this is the anisotropic version of the elastic energy density, which is better. It does have two different terms, and you lose a lot of the nice mathematical properties. But again, Properties. But again, since a lot of the work that I've been, because my aim is to move from a two-dimensional study to a three-dimensional study, so I'm going to start with a reduced study. A reduced study is in the sense that I'm going to work with thin geometries when I have a two-dimensional cross-section omega with a height H, and I'm going to work in the limit H tends to zero. So that's the thin film limit. And again, this is not my result. This is work. This is gamma convergence, which has been done very beautifully by. Has been done very beautifully by Golovati, Montero, and Sternberg. But if you follow the proofs in their paper, it is a rigorous paper, then you can actually make a transition, a proper reduction from this five-dimensional quantity, because the Landau-Desian Q-tensor order parameter has five degrees of freedom. It's a symmetric traceless three by three matrix. You can make this transition to a reduced Landau-Desian order parameter P, which only has two degrees of freedom. Which only has two degrees of freedom on a two-dimensional domain. So you can effectively go from a 3D domain, which is in the thin film limit. So you can assume, you can go, you can just effectively model the profile on omega in the thin film limit, because the effective modeling assumption is that the structural characteristics are invariant in the third dimension. But of course, you can make it more rigorous, but that's the effective idea that things are invariant in the third dimension. So effectively, you're only modeling things on the two. We are only modeling things on the two-dimensional cross-section, and you can make this transition from the Landau Desch and Q-tensor order parameter, which has five degrees of freedom, to this reduced order parameter P, which only has two degrees of freedom. And there's a very simple physical interpretation of these two degrees of freedom. You can see an S here and an N here. The N is just the nematic director in the plane of the 2D domain. So it's the planar director in the plane of the 2D domain. So it's the preferred. 2D domain. So it's the preferred direction in the plane. And the s is a scalar order parameter in the plane. And if s is equal to zero, then you have a defect. So I should warn you that defects do not have a simple interpretation in three dimensions. In three dimensions, it's far more complicated, but in this reduced description, it is quite straightforward. You're just tracking the zero set of S. So you can do all of that. You can get a reduced Lambda Design free energy. The Lambda here, so we've obviously rescaled. Here, so we've obviously rescaled this. The lambda here is effectively a geometrical parameter. So, in this case, you have a hexagon, so the lambda would be the edge length of your hexagon. The L is your elastic constant. B and C are your bulk parameters, the positive material dependent constants. You can work out the Euler-Lagrange equations, which many of you will recognize to be just be the Ginzburg-Landau equations in superconductivity. So, it's a substantial simplification from the 3D case. If you're a numerical analyst, V D case. If you're a numerical analyst, so I think there might be some numerical analysts in the audience. Then we have a paper on a priori and a posteriori estimates for these equations. So this is work with Neela Notaraj from IIT Bombay and Ruma Maiti, who was our joint student. But let's skip all the details and move to some results. That's effectively our 2D framework, which is relatively tractable, right? And effectively, the goal is to study some asymptotic limits rigorously. Limits rigorously. And the two obvious candidates for the asymptotic limits are the lambda tends to zero limit, which is relevant for very small 2D domains, and the lambda tends to infinity limit, which is relevant for larger domains, typically the ones that you would actually observe or use in experiments, right? And the benefit is that in these two asymptotic regimes, you can actually compute, mathematically compute the limiting profiles and then check that these limiting profiles are actually a good Profiles are actually a good approximation to numerical solutions for physically relevant parameter regimes. So, asymptotics are useful because they're good approximations in certain regimes, and also they give you excellent initial conditions for continuation methods, right? When you want to compute bifurcation diagrams or you want to track solution landscapes. And this is effectively what we've done. So, I'm again going to skip all the details for lambda. When the lambda tends to zero gamma, you have a very simple. Zero limit, you have a very simple limiting problem. You just solve the Laplace's equation for this reduced order parameter on your 2D polygon, subject to the imposed boundary conditions, which in this case are tangent, but this would work equally well with any other boundary condition, and you can explicitly track the defect set. And the interesting result is that for all regular polygons, except for the triangle and the square, you have one isolated point defect. Isolated point defect at the center of the limiting profile for all regular polygons except the triangle and the square, which are special. And if you want to understand more, you can read the paper. If you want to look at the other extreme, which is very large domains, you can make some simplifying assumptions for the behavior on the boundary. It is an assumption. So we do exclude a lot of local energy minimizers when we do that, but we argue that our assumptions are physically reasonable. That our assumptions are physically reasonable because what we are assuming is that the director has the minimal possible rotation around the boundary of our 2D polygon, because we are just focusing on 2D polygons, but the methods are generic. They would really work for any 2D domain. And if you make these physically reasonable assumptions, that you really have the minimal possible rotation of the director on the boundary. So if you do topology, then that is equivalent to saying that it has topological degree zero on the boundary. Degree zero on the boundary, which is an assumption, then you can use fairly simple combinatorial estimates to show that you will have at least k choose two stable states on a regular polygon with k edges. So what does that mean for a hexagon? For example, k is equal to six and six choose two is 15. So the contrast is that for lambda tends to zero, you have a unique limiting profile and the limiting profile as one isolated. Limiting profile as one isolated defect at the center, except for the triangle and the square. But in the other extreme limit, which is lambda tends to infinity, we have multistability in that we have an underestimate of at least k choose two stable states on a k polygon, subject to this physically reasonable assumption. And again, here you have some bifurcation diagrams. So this is on a hexagon. You have this unique state for small lambda. Remember, lambda is effectively. Lambda is effectively the edge length. I mean, it's a dimensionless parameter, so we obviously the ratio of two length scales. But what it really means is that you're in the small, you're in a regime where the edge length of your hexagon is comparable to the pneumatic correlation length, right? That's what it sort of precisely means. It's a small domain. So you have this unique profile, which we call the ring solution, with the isolated defect at the center. And then as you're making lambda bigger, you get these 15 different solutions. 15 different solutions, and you will see that there are no more interior defects. There is a color bar here. I'll just briefly tell you: blue means low order. So, blue effectively means it's either a defect or close to being a defect. And red means that it's almost perfectly ordered. Again, this is on a pentagon. Pentagon only has five sides, and five choose two is 10. So, again, you have something similar. For small lambda, you have this unique profile. And for large lambda, you get 10 different stable states. Different stable states, at least. And that's an underestimate. So, again, how do we go from 2D to 3D? So, how can we use all this two-dimensional information to sort of in higher dimensions? And this again, so we are using something called the high-index optimization shrinking dimer methods, which is which has been developed by Lei Zhang's group at Peking University. And the idea here is that we're not just interested in energy minimizers, we're also interested in the non-energy minimizing critical points. Energy minimizing critical points of the reduced LDG energy, or indeed any free energy that arises in our studies. So we basically track saddle points of the energy as well. So these are, so a saddle point, I mean, I guess you know the definition, but effectively the Hessian of the free energy will have a certain, so an index k saddle point, the Hessian of the free energy will have k negative eigenvalues. So it's basically going to be unstable in k. Basically, going to be unstable in K-distinguished directions and stable otherwise. And the benefit of this method, from my perspective, is that you can basically track the K-saddle points, but you can also track how they're connected to the lower index saddle points. So K-saddle will have K unstable directions, but you can track how they are connected to lower index saddle points and eventually how they connect to energy minimizers, which are index zero. Which are index zero because they have no unstable directions. So you can also look at the connectivity between the different energy minimizers. So you can look at pathways on the solution landscape. This is a paper which has been submitted, but is under review. So these are the two-dimensional solutions on a square domain, right? So this is when we applied the methodology that I described. And these were some of the saddle points, which saddle points. Saddle points, which saddle points, including a minimizer, found on a 2D square domain. And the question is: can we use any of this to construct critical points of the 3D Lambda Desian energy in a 3D setup where the height H is actually significant. So you no longer work in the thin film limit. You have a real cuboid with finite height. And you're actually looking for fully three-dimensional. Fully three-dimensional critical points of the Landau-Desian free energy. And the question is: can we use the information about the pathways that we have on the 2D solution landscape to construct 3D critical points? And the answer is yes. You can obviously just stack these on top of each other. So these would be Z-invariant 3D critical points. That's not terribly exciting. But what is exciting is when you start getting mixed critical points, as in when you start to get two different. In when you start to get two different two-dimensional critical points on the top and the bottom of your cuboid, and in the middle, you get something different, and you can actually translate something like this. For example, this is diagonal, W-O-R-S, and diagonal. You can actually translate this to a pathway that you observe on the 2D solution landscape. So that's the gist of this slide, that we have some evidence that you can actually use pathways on the two-dimensional solution landscape. On the two-dimensional solution landscape to construct these three-dimensional mixed critical points, which are actually composed of different layers of 2D critical points. So it's some sort of tessellation technique, but we clearly need to be more precise, right? We need to understand this better. But we have made some progress. So in the limit of small height, H, you can do some asymptotic analysis. Again, you have a unique limiting profile. So in this case, you have two different D profiles on the top and the bottom, and they're fixed. On the top and the bottom, and they're fixed. And when h is small, that's the height is small, you can show that the profile in the middle has to be the WORS. So, this is a pen and paper proof. You can actually show this by symmetry arguments, and this is obvious, and this is clearly verified by numerics as well. But as the height increases, you can prove or we can prove that this actually loses stability. It exists as a critical point for all heights H, but it loses stability as the height increases. Height increases, and it seems this is numerical. It seems that this profile, which we call something different, is preferred. And you can actually track this in terms of the smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian of these two corresponding 3D states. So I thought that was interesting to just briefly present how you can go from a two-dimensional study and actually use it to construct three-dimensional critical points of the Landaudesian free energy, which are obviously, you know, you might expect. Obviously, you might expect them to be more relevant for experiments because most geometries tend to be three-dimensional. So, finally, before I finish, I want to briefly touch on some recent work on semectic shells. This is very much work in progress. So, it's a three-dimensional shell. So, that's, I mean, you've got this big shell and a small shell inside it. So, these shells are actually manufactured by Jan Lagerwald's group in Luxembourg using micro. In Luxembourg using microfluidic techniques. It's an asymmetric shell, so it's slightly displaced. So they're not concentric shells, it's asymmetric. They can play around with the boundary conditions, but we've resumed planar boundary conditions on the inner and the outer surfaces. And this is, I should say, this is joint work with Weiwei, Wang, Yu Chen Han, and myself. So we work on the modeling side of things. And then there's Jan Lagerwald, Anjali Sharma, and Mitch Magrini, who've been working on the experiment. Mark Greeni, who've been working on the experiments. So, we've been working with this particular free energy. So, it is partly inspired or maybe entirely inspired by Patrick's work with Jingmin and also papers by Kim Slukin. So, I have to check, but I think those were the two main points that we were building on. But I understand that lots of people, you know, they have very sophisticated forms of the smectic free energy. Free energy, and we are still trying to finish this project because we've encountered some numerical difficulties. But as far as I understand, so some of this is very familiar. So, for example, this is just your usual pneumatic bulk energy. So, your T is your reduced temperature. The Xi R is effectively the size, it's the rescaled size of your shell. This is just to account for the boundary conditions that you have on the inner and outer surfaces. And this is effectively just telling us that it likes to be planar on. Just telling us that it likes to be planar on the inner and outer surfaces. And these two terms here seem somewhat empirical to me, but the idea is that they somehow want to enforce that the nematic director, that the angle between the nematic director and the layer normal is this angle theta here. So when theta is zero, it's a smectic A phase, and when theta is non-zero, it's a smectic C phase. So this is effectively some sort of co-alignment condition between the Condition between the nematic director and the layer normal. So that's what. So, this is again just a bit more information about the free energy. So, this is how we've done the rescaling. The T is a reduced temperature. This is just the size of your shell. This is scaling. This is the familiar equilibrium nematic order parameter. It's just a number if you work at a fixed temperature. So, we've been working at this fixed temperature below the isotropic nematic phase transition. We've fixed the anchoring on the inner and the outer. The anchoring on the inner and the outer surfaces, just the standard Rapini papuller. And Lambda 1 and Lambda 2, these two empirical terms, we've taken them to be 10 to the power minus 4. And I'm not sure if that's a very good choice or what a good choice would be, but that's what we've done. And we've effectively been playing around with parameter Q, which is the layer number. And this again will be familiar to people who work on smectic liquid crystals. And we had some success. So when Q is equal to 50, when you have a So, when q is equal to 50, when you have a larger number of layers, we have been able to find two different stable configurations, I think, two different local minimizers of this free energy. They do capture some of the experimental details. So, at least this is smectic A. So, this is when theta is equal to zero. So, you can see the layer buckling quite clearly. So, these are the two different side views. And this is from the thin side, and this is from the thick side. And again, you have this coloring. And again, you have this coloring. The color bar is when, the red is when cost theta is equal to one, and the blue is when cost theta is minus one. So it's basically a color bar capturing cost theta, which is the co-alignment between the pneumatic director and the layer normal. So we do find two different configurations where Q is equal to 50, and one has lower energy than the other. Than the other. But the problem was that we are not really finding four defects, we are just finding two defects. Whereas experimentally, they find four defects, and we only find four defects for Q is equal to 10. So very small number of flares. And that's where the discrepancy is with experiments, but that's where we stand. And then we've also been able to generalize it somewhat to smectic C, but here I think the results are what you'd expect. The layer normal is not co-aligned. Is not co-aligned with the pneumatic director anymore, but that's really what you'd expect. So the better results are definitely for smectic A, but even in that case, even for smectic A, we do have this issue with not being able to capture at least the right number of defects, or it's possible that we are capturing a local energy minimizer and what they see in experiments is slightly different, or we haven't really been able to capture the experimental conditions properly, which is why. Conditions properly, which is why we're getting a slight discrepancy. Anyway, I'd like this brings me to the end of my talk. So I'd like to thank everybody who's funded my research, and of course, the organizers and the audience, whoever's. Yeah, thank you. Great. Any questions for Paula? Yeah. Do your smectic shells have a finite thickness, or is it a two? Finite thickness, or is it a 2D simulation on a curved space? They have a finite thickness, it's fully 3D. Yeah. Do you have any cross-sections? Do you have any cross-sectional views? What's it look like? I do, but not with me. But I can, so I don't know who's asking the question. Who is it? But I can certainly. I can certainly send them to you, but. Certainly, send them to you, but the only plots that I have are the ones that I've shown, and those are not cross-sectional plots. But I can we do have cross-sectional plots. Yeah, but these are fully 3D simulations, and it's finite thickness, and it's an asymmetric shell. Why are they so ripply on the sphere, those pictures? No. But you might need to speak up and talk to the. Okay, there you go. Why are they so ripply? Why are they so ripply? Why are there so many under conditions? Oh, that's the layer buckling. So, I mean, so I mean, the experimentalists didn't complain. I mean, I don't know, maybe they shouldn't be so wriggly. I mean, I don't know what the right amount of wriggliness would be. But the experimentalists didn't complain about that. That was lair buckling, and they thought that was good. The main complaint is the number of defects. Well, it's not a complaint, it's an observation. It's the number of defects. Number of defects. So the layer buckling is coming from the incompatibility of the length of the spacing of the smectic and the sphere, or is it coming from? Yes, I mean, yes, it's coming from that, and it's coming from different competitions in the energetic terms. But yes, I mean, I couldn't hear your comment fully, but yes. Yeah, I was saying, so I mean, it could be coming from the fact that the inside and the outside are different sizes, right? Yes, it is coming from that, yeah. Yes, it is coming from that, yeah. Abala, in your energy, what is R? Capital R? It's the sorry, little R. R, where do you see it? In the arguments, that's a function of QR and by position. That's trace. That's trace, yeah. That's phrase, yeah. In your arguments in the top left, that's a typo. Ignore it. Oh, okay. And do you enforce any constraints on phi? It's representing your varied levels. Is it beautiful? At some point, we tried enforcing grad of phi is equal to, I have to double-check, but I think there is at some point we tried enforcing grad phi is equal to some sort of fixed length, but that didn't. Some sort of fixed length, but that didn't really work. But I'd have to double-check that. I'm not, I mean, or at some point we tried even enforcing grad phi is equal to q, the norm of grad phi is equal to q cost theta or something like that. But I should double check. Because I haven't thought about it enough. Well, you have a null space here because if phi only shows up when you ratify it, can you give me a solution? Can I modify phi to give you back another solution? You back another solution. Can I modify phi to give you another solution? So phi only shows up in the energy with grad phi, right? What are you saying? Phi is there a boundary? Because only average grad phi. So do you have any boundary conditions on phi? Because if you don't have any VCs, then they won't be well promised. I'll have to double-check, but I think it's on a screen. It's on a screen. I have to check. I'll double check and get back to you, Patrick. I mean, I don't, I can't, but that wasn't flagged up. I mean, when the numerical, the numerics were done, that wasn't, I mean, it seemed reasonable. But I should double check what we for Q, it's tangential, but for phi, it's probably a constraint. It's, um, I mean, it's n dot graph. It's, I mean, it's n dot grat phi is equal to q cos theta, but how that constraint has been enforced, I should double-check. Okay, and how do you discretize this numerically? Yes, so he's using spherical harmonics as a basis. And then that effectively gives you a discrete problem, right? And then you're solving a large system of equations for those finite degrees of freedom with the basis expansion. And you use the same basis for the. Right, yeah, and you use the same basis for the components of Q and for file that I will need to check, but for Q, it's clear. I think that I understood. But I need to check about how the two discretizations are related. But on the boundary, I think there was a constraint n dot gratify is equal to q cos theta. Can you go back to the pictures again? There. No, you had ones where you could see the top. I can't hear you. You had one where you could see the top. You can see the top. Oh, next slide. Good. Next slide. I don't know. Is that true? Yeah. You can see the North Pole there. Yeah. You can see there's an implicit boundary condition because the deep back set of cross-section. Yeah. Top of it. That is a cross-section. But you can see you can see that the defects, right? It's a whole ring of red. So phi equals zero or two pi or four pi, whatever one you like, is sitting at that defect, right? It's pinned on it. So if you set phi equals zero at some point, then that's going to tell you where the defect's going to want to slit from. And it's going to be plus one definitely. Two plus halves. It could be a half. No, no, it could be it could be a half deep left by the consumer, also. That would be her. Oh, okay. There's no problem with that. But do you think that might be why she's not getting the defects she wants? I'm not. I guess the experimental shells are much, much larger than the simulation. Could that be an issue with the number of defects? Yeah, definitely. The shells are much larger. And that is an issue with the simulations. And yeah. Yeah. But we have tried larger shells and it hasn't converged. I think also in the experiments they start from the pneumatic, right, and then pool it down to the semectic. And in the pneumatic phase, they see four defects. And so that may be an initial condition that makes it favorable to then. That's a very good suggestion, and we've tried that too. Okay. So you basically mean a smart initial condition, right? Yeah, yeah. Condition, right? Yes, yes. We've tried that too, unfortunately. Well, there could be a to follow up on that, there could be an opposed initial condition, but couldn't you also use your method and just simulate the pneumatic parts of it first and then turn it on spectrum order? That we haven't tried. Yeah, that would maybe mimic the phase transition, right? So we've certainly tried smart initial conditions. Smart initial conditions and with larger shells, we haven't converted, or the simulations haven't converged. I couldn't hear the last suggestion fully, but we haven't, I don't, we haven't tried that. I mean, whoever said it, maybe they write to me because there's some echo in the room. It's not hearing things fully, but. Yeah, sorry, the microphones for the audience don't work very well. But that might be a very good suggestion. The last one is something that I. And the last one is something that I think we, I mean, I didn't fully hear it, but I'm pretty sure we haven't tried it. All right. I have another question. Can you? It's about the energy landscapes. Yeah. I'm just curious, did you ever get into this minimum energy path between states? Yeah, absolutely. So, a minimum energy path is for us typically is an. Is typically an index one saddle point, right? So, yes, that's usually your minimum energy pathway, right? The maximum is an index one saddle point. Those are the ones you would often observe in switching processes, for example. But the constructions that I have here, so this is this is index one. So, this is something that you might observe in a minimum energy pathway, but obviously they're not unique, right? I mean, you can have multiple minimum energy pathways in certain scenarios, certainly multiple. Certain scenarios, certainly multiple pathways. But if we also look at higher index saddle points and we can use them to construct 3D critical points, although they're not always stable. But yes, we do get, I mean, these methods, I mean, the minimal energy pathways would be a subset of what's being discussed here. So yes, that's right, we do. Yeah, but I was wondering if we actually had a plot of the energy as you go from one state to the next. Statement to the next just to kind of see the yeah in the in the paper in the paper there are bifurcation diagrams and energy plots not on not on the slides no okay okay all right i think uh let's leave it there so thanks very much but oh yeah now allison are you okay And now, Allison, are you?
