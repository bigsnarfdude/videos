This meeting is being recorded from both the University of Maryland and NASA Guadalajara Space Flight Center. And she will talk about on the geometry and dynamics of decision keeping around liberation points orbits. So thank you, Ariana. Thank you, Marcel. And thank you to the organizers for the kind invitation. I hope kind invitation. I hope that what I'm going to explain today is interesting for the public around here. So the talk is mainly based on the dynamics and geometry of station keeping and it's a joint work with people from Barcelona, Gerard Gomith and Masdemon and a student Cheng Gao and also my colleagues at NASA, Dey Fult and Cassandra Webster. And the idea behind the study was that we were trying to understand better We're trying to understand, better understand two different ways of doing station keeping and kind of compare them and see what is going on when we do station keeping around a libration point orbit. So just to set a little bit the problem, the main idea here is in vision applications. I think on Monday or Tuesday, remember tomorrow I was talking about the rest of the body problem. And one of the main places where we put spacecraft is essentially usually around Put a spacecraft is essentially usually around L1 and L2. Yes, click in the banner to hide the. Oh, yeah, sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, thank you for that. Okay, so going back. Yeah, so essentially, most of the space missions are around L1, the libration point L1 and L2. The main reason is because they're easy to access from the Earth and they already provide good, they're good for doing science. They're good for doing science. One is mainly used by missions like ACE, Soho, Discover to observe the sun. And then other things. I hear some background noise. I don't know. Then an L2 is mainly for missions like Gaia, James Webb, Hershan Planck, and others to observe the universe, right? The others are. The others are further away and they're usually harder to access, so we don't use them for mission applications. The only drawback that L1 and L2 would have is that they're naturally unstable, so we do have to make some station keeping maneuvers, so essentially have to do maneuver from time to time to avoid deviating from their vicinity. So the idea of this talk is to describe what is the dynamics around the libration point orbit, how it's a Point orbit, how it's affected when we do maneuvers, and try and compare two different station keeping maneuvers that we have. The first one is the floquette mode approach, and it comes from the group of Barcelona, and it was developed by Tuomez, Maximon, and Simone and Sorba, I think, or many people back at the group of Barcelona back in the 80s, where we used the foquette mode to drive the station keeping maneuvers. And the other one is the one that is more based on. That is more based on the work that they do here at NASA and it has been used in many different mission applications. That is the velocity plane crossing. I'll explain later how it worked, but essentially it's a more straightforward way of doing station keeping. And the main idea of here was to compare both strategies. And as we will see, they share a lot of similarities. So at the end, we can use the two of them. We can always describe them in the same way. And as we'll see. And I was saying, like, when it comes to station keeping, there's a lot of things that one has to take into account. Like, are you targeting to be back to a reference orbit? Are you just trying not to escape from your point? There's also things like what happens when there is more realistic perturbations on the system. We will don't focus that much on that at the moment. We're just trying to get the general idea of how things work. So, just to set the problem, we're based, all the computations here are done in the All the computations here are done in the restricted body problem. So we have Earth and Sun, our two primary masses, that revolve around their center of mass in a circular way. And we have our small spacecraft that is essentially attracted by the two main masses and does not affect the other two. And as we know, we have five equilibrium points. And instead, I'll be focusing around L1 and L2. And as we already know, there's a lot of families of periodic and quasi-periodic orbits around L1 and L2. And those are the ones that we're using. And those are the ones that we're usually using for mission applications. Because, in the general sense, staying around L1 would not work because if we have to do communications with our spacecraft, being at L1, we're blinded by the sun because the sun is in our way. So essentially, we usually have to orbit around halo orbits or lesage orbits that do not kind of go have the sun in the middle, and we're just on the side of the sun so that we can speak with our satellite in a way. And we also know that the restricted body problem is already a good model for what will happen in the full EFEM model. So, most of the results that we use here can also be applied when we enter and add other planets and other perturbations on the system. Okay, so a reminder: probably all of you already know this that we have a lot of bounded motion around L1 and L2. This is just L1, just so we usually have. Just so we usually have vertical Yapanov orbits. We have planar Lyapunov orbits at the boundary. This is just a point current section. We have Lissidu orbits, halo and quasi-halo orbits. In terms of mission application on today, I'll just be focusing on halo orbits, but most of the results can also be applied for any other type of orbit around here, as long as they share the same linear approximation of the dynamics. Okay. Okay, when it comes to studying the dynamics around the libration point orbit, in this case of Halo orbit, what it refers to is we just linearize the system around the periodic orbit. So we take the monodroming metric, so the time t return map around the orbit, and we take and study the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. And we know that in the sticklistic value problem, all halo orbits, or at least halo orbits or at least the ones that are useful for us are the text center saddles so the eigenvalues we have one that is larger than one one that is less than one this gives raise to the saddle and then we have two complex eigenvalues and then we have two neutral eigenvalues in in here right and we know that this is how it behaves and in a way we can think of it like we have four different planes we're in a 60 phase space but we can separate We're in a 60-phase phase, but we can separate the dynamics in four different phase planes. One has a saddle motion, so essentially things escape along the unstable direction and contract along the stable direction. We have a rotation around the equilibrium, so we also have like this gift thrice to the quasi-hale orbiter, and we have a rotation around my periodic orbit. And then I have a neutral one that essentially is related to the fact that first we have a periodic orbit, so the velocity vector. Orbits, so the velocity vector goes back to itself, and also the fact that we have a family of orbits that gives this other neutral part. So, in general, what is making us escape from the orbit is this unstable periodic orbit, the subtle motion around here. And we know that there exists this floquette reference frame, which is a periodic reference frame that allows us to describe the dynamics around using this reference frame. Reference frame. Okay, so Gomez and Edal, they already described that in their work in the 80s, where they developed this flow kit mode reference frame. So from the eigenvalues that we have from our system, we can derive this periodic reference frame that is splitting things in these four planes that I was talking about. The first two is the saddle motion. Two is the subtle motion, then there's the center motion, and then we have the neutral motion here. So, what we'll do from now on is instead of looking at our trajectory in the position and velocity phase space, I'll be looking at things when I'm close to the orbit using this reference frame. I can compute the reference frame and I can store it as a Fourier series. So essentially, I'm just doing changes of variables between position and velocities to this particular reference frame, and I check how the orbits. Reference frame, and I check how the orbits behave, right? So, this is my reference frame. And if I do nothing, what I would see is that on the left-hand side, I just have an orbit. I start on my orbit close enough, and what happens in general is I just escape along the unstable direction. It's what we're seeing in here. I'll just escape along the unstable direction. I'll start rotating around the center. At some point, I do something weird, and in here, I'm just neutral. It's the one that has eigenvalue one. This part. One. This part wiggling away is just because at some point, if I'm too far away, this is a linear approximation, so it is useless at some point. If I'm too far away, it doesn't give a true description of what is happening, right? So as long as I stay close, I have things, but because I'm escaping at some point, I have an unexpected behavior that would explain this kind of wiggle in here. When I do maneuvers, what am I doing? I'm just, I can think of a maneuver as just a change in the velocity. Is just a change in the velocity, right? So I'm just adding something to the velocity. So essentially, it's like jumping on the phase space. Each time I do a station-keeping maneuver or any maneuver of any time, I'm just jumping in the phase space. I'm changing the velocity and keeping the same. And if I look at it in this reference frame, I'll just see some jumps. And that's what essentially is happening here. When I'm doing a station-keeping maneuver, when I'm jumping around, what I do is like I was escaping along the unstable. I do a certain delta D maneuver. In here, I was. Certain delta D maneuver in here. I was trying to get back to the stable manifold. So I just maneuver in this direction, I come back here, and I then escape again. I do another maneuver and then I come back. So essentially, when I'm trying to stay around the orbit, what I'm doing is I'm just coming back to the orbit, jumping towards the stable manifold, right? If I look at the projection on the center plane, I see how I'm rotating. Every time I do a maneuver, I displace myself from the center and I keep on rotating every time I leave the dynamics on its own and I do a Dynamics on its own, and I do a jump every time I do a delta V maneuver, and I'm doing this. So, in a general sense, when I want to do a station-keeping maneuver, my goal at the end is to stay close to this orbit. So, essentially, I want to find maneuvers that when I'm doing, I try, essentially, ideally, I would jump, I'm escaping along the unstable, so I just jump back to the stable manifold, or I just jump back to, oops, or I can just try and jump to the center here, which is the bread orbit. Center here, which is the periodic orbit, and what I wish is that the center part also stays rotated. One thing that could happen is that although I'm controlling the saddle, I could start diverging on the center. In general, most station keeping maneuvers just take care of this, and this is a given, but it might be useful to try and understand this. We will not focus on this in this talk, but it's just something to have in mind. And on the neutral just wiggles around here. So essentially, I'm staying close to my previous. So, essentially, I'm staying close to my periodic orbit. Okay, so using the floquette mode reference frame, I wanted to use compared two different station keeping maneuvers. The first one uses advantage of the floquette mode. So, it is understood that what I'll be seeing here is directly related to jumping on the stable and unstable manifold. And then the second station keeping maneuver, the idea behind is essentially we know that all vibration point orbits. We know that all libration point orbits, at least the halo orbit, and most of the vibration point orbits, what they satisfy is on the xz plane crossing, right, the y equal to zero plane crossing, vx is equal to zero, right? Like halo orbits satisfy that. So it is kind of a constraint. So what we do is instead of targeting a specific location in time to go back, right? When we do a maneuver, we are targeting. So we do what is the maneuver that I need such that if I press I need such that if I propagate to the next plane crossing, dx is equal to zero. That would guarantee that I'm close to a periodic orbit. And if I haven't deviated that much from my periodic orbit, then I'll go back to the same periodic orbit. And instead of doing it at the first plane crossing, ideally what we do is at the fourth plane crossing so that in a way we're guaranteeing that that maneuver will keep me in orbit for at least two orbiter periods. So this is the idea behind the station keeping. The geometry is simple, but we The geometry is simple, but what we didn't know is what was happening internally dynamically. What maneuvers is this second one finding? So I just try to put here the kind of algorithmic part of the two station keeping strategies. The one where I target the x equal to zero at the specific plane crossing. In a way, I understand this one as I'm guaranteeing that I'm keeping on orbit. I'm doing a maneuver that guarantees. Keeping on orbit. I'm doing a maneuver that guarantees me that I'll be orbiting at before two orbital periods. I sometimes change three to four, just sorry about that. So essentially, it's just a differential character, right? So essentially, each time my H is this delta V, and I just always, I define the Poincaré section to be propagate at a specific time to four plane crossings. And then I just compute, I solve which is the change in velocity I need to do from where I am. Change in velocity, I need to do from where I am to guarantee that after plane crossings, Vx is equal to zero. So essentially, it's just solving an iterative process. And I can, this is kind of very easy to code. And the advantage of this approach is that even if you have a higher, a more complex force model, you can easily code this and find a solution. The other one is a little bit more complex. And the general idea is that I know what I do is I write I know what I do is I write my position and my states, position and velocity in this floquet mode reference frame, right? So I would have the position and velocities plus my perturbation, that is my delta V. I write it down in this floquette reference frame. And if I work around the math, what I essentially want to do is I want a maneuver that cancels my instability. I want a maneuver that brings me back to the stable manifold. So I want a maneuver that once I, so I want a delta V that once I add those two things. Delta V, that once I add those two things, C1, that is the one on the unstable, is zero. So that reduces everything to an algebraic calculation, and it just reduces to, if you do the math, and the details are on a lot of papers, so I didn't want to go over that. You just solve this and find which the delta D maneuver is. And these are sort of projection factors. So essentially, I just have an equation that if I manage to find my reference frame, and I know where I am relative to the reference frame, my delta V is given. Relative to the reference frame, my delta v is given by this trajectory over here, right? Okay, so if we do that and we plot the solutions on using both methods, what we see is that we're essentially doing the same. The squiggling or the rotations, the maneuvers that are found are slightly different, but the general dynamics that is happening is the same one. On this one, I am still seeing that I am canceling the unstable direction. Unstable direction. And if you think about it, it might not be a surprise. If I'm trying, in a way, if I'm trying to get back through the orbit, the best way usually is to get on the stable manifold, right? So even though I'm not directly imposing to be on the stable manifold, my targeter is finding that as to be the best solution. The location on the stable manifold that I'm choosing in one on the other might be slightly different based on trying to be there on the fourth or third plane crossing, but essentially the idea behind it is the same. Essentially, the idea behind this is the same. So, that was something that was nice. So, the main idea of this is that this allows us to properly compare both. Even though I'm using this, I can use the ideas on the dynamics of this one to understand the results. Okay, so that's essentially. In order to do it a little bit more proper mathematically, to try and prove that not just based on a picture that everything looks similar, what we did is we tried to analyze the two controllers. To analyze the two controllers using a Poincare map. So essentially, right now we define a Poincare map. Sorry. It's okay, it's okay. Okay. So essentially, we use a Poincaré map, right? That we essentially start on the top part of my orbit and I orbit and I apply a maneuver every quarter of the orbit, right? So I propagate to the first quarter of the orbit, I apply a maneuver here, I propagate to the next quarter, I apply a maneuver here, I propagate to the next crossing here, quarter, I apply another maneuver and I propagate here. So my Poincaré map, I have a map that just goes one orbital period, three maneuvers, and I compute numerically the two Compute numerically the two Poincaré maps using different station keeping strategies. On the first case, what I call PVX0, I'm computing the station keeping maneuvers using the PX to plane crossing strategy. And on the second one, I'm using the flockette mode strategy. And instead of looking at the numerics of that, what we do is we use the check transport procedure to derive the first and second order variational equations. First and second order variational equations of this. And we use the first and second order variational equation, variational expressions of our map to compare the two. And if they are similar, we can say that at least at first or second order, the two approaches are the same. So I don't know how familiar you are with jet transport, but it's a tool that allows us, in an easy way, overload our propagators in order to find high order approaches. In order to find high-order approximations of the first and second-order variational equations or any up to any order in a fast and efficient way. So, if we do that and we take the two different maps and we compute the first order variation, we computed the first and the second, and what we saw is that at first order, they're almost the same. There are some differences, like if you look at this one in here, this number in here is slightly different than this. This number in here is slightly different than this one, but at least to 10 to the minus 5 or 10 to the minus 6, both maps are the same. So this kind of gave us more or less proof that both approaches are doing the same. If we compare up to second order, this was not the case. The second order is slightly, it's completely different. And one thing that we did do, but I do not mention it, I did not add it here, is if instead of doing the floquette mode, Doing the floquette mode at the point of the maneuver, but instead you propagate to the next point crossing and over there. It's kind of weird to explain, but if instead of imposing to cancel the unstable manifold at the point of the maneuver, we impose to cancel the unstable manifold after 10 days or after two orbital periods. If we put that, what we saw is that the two maps matched up to first and second order. Up to first and second order. So, in a way, it's not canceling at the time of the maneuver, but it's canceling after a while. Arianna? Yes. I have a question. So, have you changed the slide? Because I only see the same slide to station keeping strategies for LPOs. Yeah, I was having the same doubt. I'm not sure if they are stuck. Oh, that kind of sorry. Maybe you should stop sharing and then. Maybe you should stop sharing and then sharing again. Yeah, yeah, I'll do that. Yeah, maybe. I was just talking and no slide for a band. Okay. No, no, I mean, we had like the 12 algorithms, but that's fine. Okay, so are you seeing some pictures now? Not yet. It's black so far. Okay. Maybe stop again and try to share again. Yeah, let me also. Yeah, let me also meeting is being recorded. Okay, so I'll share again. Okay, now we see. Okay, so where did you get stuck? Did you see this part of the Pompere maps? No. No. Oh, so here? Yeah, we were stuck. Yeah, we were stuck here. Okay. Well, I'll go faster. Sorry, yeah. No, that's fine. So I was explaining this part, and what came after this one was this fancy plot that essentially was trying to show that when we apply the two station keeping maneuvers using the two different methods, what we essentially are seeing is the same. There are some differences because the pods are not exactly the same. The pods are not exactly the same, but we do see that the general behavior that we are using this, we are also canceling the unstable direction, right? So essentially, if we focus on this part, it's essentially doing the same. And we see that the saddles are slightly different. So that ensures that we are not finding the exact same maneuver, but there's more than one maneuver that cancels the unstable. So essentially, they're finding different maneuvers, but the overall dynamics is the same. What I was trying to show. What I was trying to show here is that in order to study the controllability of the system, we use this Poincare map that essentially is like for one orbital period, we do maneuvers at every quarter and we generate this as a Poincare map. And we can compute this numerically very easily, right? Because it's just propagate, apply maneuver, propagate apply maneuver, and we do the two different approaches. And what we see here is instead of What we see here is instead of, we cannot direct this analytically, but we can find using the jet transport high-order approximations of the Taylor X of the first order and second order variational equations. And we use the JET transport for that, for the two different methods. And you're seeing the slides right now, advancing there's different things. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay, just making sure. So essentially, here, what we see is that up to first order, the two Up to first order, the two tailored expansions were the same. There's small differences, but essentially it's the same map, which is reassuring. So it means that the two station-keeping maneuvers are essentially doing the same, although I'm asking the computation of the delta V's to be different. If we compare them to second order, there's some differences. And if we slightly change the floquet mode approach on not canceling at the time of the maneuver, but after a certain time, we found that the two we found that the two strategies converged, sorry, had also the second order rational equations the same. Another thing that we can do is as we have the Poincare map of this, like do one orbit at a period and apply four maneuvers, we can also study if we've managed to actually control the stability, right? We see that when we don't apply any maneuver, when we do one orbital period, we see one one orbital period we see that our uh stable um our system is unstable because we have two uh eigenvalues that or at least we have one eigenvalue that is positive and it's larger than one so that means that everything escapes if we take the uh the poincare map of doing maneuvers and we compute the stable and unstable uh we compute the eigenvalues what we see is that we actually have cancelled the unstability the the unstable eigenvalue lambda one Eigenvalue lambda one is now zero. That means this is machine accuracy, and the other one stays the same. So essentially, we've cancelled the instability, which is what we were looking for, and we do not have an asymptotic stability. Everything does not go towards the orbit, but we stay orbiting near the orbit. So that is good enough because that's the end goal of a station keeping. I just want to be close enough to the orbit to guarantee that I'm not. Close enough to the orbit to guarantee that I'm not going to escape. So, this kind of shows two things: first, that our procedure of applying maneuvers cancels the instability, and two, that both methods are essentially doing the same. Okay, so now that we've understood a little bit that the two methods are the same, why is this useful or what is this useful for, right? And one of the ideas behind that is to try and explain when we're doing mission applications and we're When we're doing mission applications and we're trying to make decisions on for this specific mission, what is the best option? This can provide a useful insight information in order to derive the proper strategy. So in the first case, and I'll just focus on three examples, and some are in more detail, others are more just a general idea. The first one would be just finding the optimal thrust direction. Can we use the information in this map? Map to find which is the best delta D direction. And the second one is: okay, sometimes we have restrictions on the thrust direction. We are not allowed to thrust everywhere. How does that affect my station keeping? Or if I have other perturbations like solar radiation pressure or other things that are affecting me, if I can project that on this stable, unstable map, can I use that information to make better decisions or to understand what. Or to understand what's happening. So, when we have to find the optimal thrust direction, it's always hard. Like, what do you minimize, right? The overall delta V? Do you have to minimize the delta V after one year or the instantaneous delta V maneuvers? At this moment, what we're going to do is how to find the minimum delta V for each of the station keeping individual maneuvers, hoping that this will end up minimizing the overall, right? So, one thing easy. So, one thing is easy just to see that numbers change when you change the thrust direction. When we are on the targeter that we imposed or on the using the floorhead mode, one or the other. Right now, I'm just going to say doing a station keeping maneuver because we've seen that both end up having the same approach, the same results. If I change the direction, one is if I thrust along the stable, the sun-earth line, what happens? And then the other one is. What happens, and then the other one is if I thrust along the position component of the stable eigenvector, right? Which is a weird choice, but it's this is shown to be the best choice right now. So if we thrust along this to what we see in this here is that we're essentially finding always finding, sorry, canceling the instability, but the direction in which we are canceling is different. And that ends up leading to different delta V costs. So here is just a project. Delta V costs. So here is just the projector on the saddle plane. On the top corner, what I'm seeing is the delta V that I'm using. And I see that thrusting along the position component of the stable eigenvalue is smaller than if I thrust along the sun line, like 1, 0, 0, right? So it has a different impact. So there is a difference in here. And in a way, we can see that this is somehow related on how much I have to jump. On how much I have to jump in here, which kind of makes sense, right? My delta V is in a way the jump that I have to do is how much I change my velocity. And if I have to go to the stable manifold, if I go along this direction, this path is shorter than if I have to go along this direction, right? So the longer path I have to go to get into the stable manifold, the larger the cost will have, right? So in a way, measuring the jumps I have to do in I have to do in the saddle plane gives me an information on how much things are going to cost. So the first exploration that we did is just: okay, place yourself around here. And we used a set of different thrust directions. So we thrust it along different directions in the plane, right? I just parametrized this by one angle and I just compute delta V maneuvers along these directions. How much does it cost? So in here on this left. So, in here on this left, if I'm on one side of the saddle, I can only thrust along, I can only use this set of manufacturers to get back, right? If I thrust on the other direction, I'm just never gonna get back. And what I see is that the line that I'm doing here is kind of related to the delta V that is parameterized in here. So, along theta in this direction, here is the one giving me the minimum thrust direction. And if I'm on the other side of the saddle, I can use the other. The saddle, I can use the other half of the point. So I essentially get an idea on what these are. And what kind of magically happened, which is kind of counterintuitive sometimes, is that if I take the position components of the stable eigenvalue, these ones are very well aligned with the minimum thrust direction. So taking this vector is something that surprised us at the beginning. Surprised us at the beginning is the one that cancels the best the instability and is well aligned with E1 sorry E2 equal to zero or E1 equal to zero. So when we try and if we want to try and understand or analyze this more analytically we can take and see okay how much does delta C1 vary when I do a delta V maneuver and if I take the equations I have this expression that the change in C1 so the change in the unstable So, the change in the unstable direction is given by this expression here. So, if I want a minimum first direction, what I essentially want is to minimize, sorry, what I want is to maximize delta C1, right? So if with a minimum, if I can maximize this with a minimum in here, I can find my minimum delta V. And if I solve this, I get this expression over here, and there's this dot. Over here, and is this dotted vector in this part here? And also, this gives me information on where I can not have any control. And it would be if I have a delta V where delta C1 is zero, that I do not change the, I cannot jump in the unstable direction, this is essentially a no-go because I cannot go back, right? So it's this dark lines in here. The dark arrows would be the directions where I cannot trust because I would not be able to do station keeping maneuvers. So if I plot this, uh So, if I plot these lines around here, they kind of very nicely coincide with the asymptotes that I had here, where the closer I get to here, the larger the delta V cost. And the minimum delta C1 coincides with this stable direction and is aligned with this one. So, you know, we had a nice expression to finding which are the ideal thrust directions. So, if we can choose where to thrust, we always want to thrust along this dotted line in here because that's the one that's kind of guaranteeing me that it's an. The one that's going to guarantee me that instantaneously I have the minimum thrust direction. And this is always easier than trying to have a target and ask it to minimize some cost function and so on. This is very straightforward because we know that if we force it along this direction, we only have to find the magnitude. Then the second one is seeing already what we've seen, some spacecrafts have some limitations on the thrust directions, right? Like James Webb that was launched in Was launched in December 2020, so this Christmas. Nucleid that will be launched soon. Both of them have some limitations that happen in other spacecraft. Like James Webb has a, I don't know if you're seeing the picture, but has a sunshield. And the sunshield is used to cover everything on the instruments of my telescope. And that means that I can only do maneuvers away from the sun. I cannot point my telescope to the sun. I cannot point my telescope to the sun and dual maneuver. So essentially, I am limited on the direction of my thrust direction. So the question is: how does that affect my delta V cost? And one, can I always, am I going to be able to control if I'm limited on just thrusting in one direction? Or is this going to cost a lot? So one thing we can do is we take all the possible thrust directions that are represented here on the left-hand side, and we project those thrust directions on the saddle. We project those thrust directions on the saddle plane. And what we see in a way is we see that as long as we can thrust, we see two things. First, how it is projected here, that we're missing half of the others, and they're slightly tilted relative to stable and unstable directions. We can identify two types of maneuvers. There's some maneuvers that will bring my satellite towards the sun, right, which are the ones on this left-hand side here. And then there's Hand side here. And then there's maneuvers that will bring my satellite away from the sun. So when we're doing maneuvers, depending on where I am of the saddle, or depending on if my trajectory is escaping towards the sun or away from the sun, I need to do a maneuver to bring my spacecraft back. So in the case of this particular telescope, we separated the maneuvers in two cases, towards the sun and away from the sun. And as we can imagine, And as we can imagine here, when we do maneuvers, if we're allowed to do maneuvers away from the sun, we can, from all the set of maneuvers away from the sun that are available, we have a lot of them that are well aligned with the minimum thrust direction that is along this E2 equal to zero line. While if we have to do maneuvers towards the sun, the best one that we have is this one that is roughly 30 degrees off this line in here. So it is less effective to do maneuvers towards the sun than it is. Maneuvers towards the sun than it is to do maneuvers away from the sun because we can find an ideal maneuver for our case. Right, this is kind of tried to do here. If I'm in this location here, I have to do a maneuver towards the sun and I and the best one that gets in here is the one with a pitch of 90 degrees. While in the other case, I can actually take the 60 degrees pitch of this direction here that will bring me as fast as possible. So, this kind of gives an idea that we can. Of gives an idea that we can also use this to try and study, and we could use those graphs in here to try and say, okay, what is the penalty you have if you have those limitations, right? It also helps us like, okay, if we know that this is one of the things that happens, that we want to always use maneuvers that are pushing me away from the sun, right? One of the things that we might want to do is, okay, instead of always doing the maneuver pitch perfect that brings me on this table and then I have some uncertainty. Beyond the stable, and then I have some uncertainties that will bring me in one side or the other of the orbit. Try and actively bias them down, and maybe we can use the information here to find which are the biases that we need in each case. And the general idea, I hope these pictures are clear, is that ideally if there's no bias, right, and I have to do an anti-sunwards maneuver, so essentially I'm escaping in this direction that is towards the sun, and I do a maneuver away from the sun that gets me back. Away from the sun that gets me back, depending on some uncertainties that can happen because of my thrusters that don't perform perfectly, I have a small error on my position, there is an uncertainty around here that kind of can have that my next trajectory will escape away from the sun or towards the sun. And ideally, I always want the trajectory to escape towards the sun because this way that that guarantees that all my maneuvers are always anti-sunward. Are always anti-sunward, right? So if I bias down my maneuver, I actively impose it to be not the computed value, but 5% down, I can move this set of uncertainties lower and guarantee that despite of any uncertainties that I have, I can always bias down. So one of the things we could use is these tools here to try and get better estimates on how much should I bias down things. And then the other is like if by some case I did If by some case I did miscalculate, or there's some other effects that made me go to the other side and I have something that is escaping away from the sun, so I have to do it towards the sun maneuver. If I don't bias properly, I could always be following always in the same path, getting back away from the sun and having to do the same type of maneuver. So essentially, if I actively bias up, I kind of manage to call on the other side and escape. So understanding things on the side. So, understanding things on the satellite plane helps us define these type of strategies that we have here. Then, the other and final example, I'm still good on time, right, Marcel? Sorry, you have five minutes. Okay, I'll be very fast on this one. I'll just give the general idea. So, the general idea here is, and I'll be very fast, is that we sometimes will have some SRP uncertainties, and that's something that happens. Uncertainties, and that's something that happened for James Webb. James Webb has a very large solar panel, sorry, sun shield that is very effective. So each time I change the attitude, I'm changing how SRP is affecting. And SRP is the solar radiation pressure. It's the sunlight that is pushing my spacecraft. It is very small, but it does have an effect at a time. And what we know that happens is that if we add this extra effect, what essentially it's doing is because we understand that one and Is because we understand L1 and L2 as the equilibrium point where all the forces in my system are compensated. If I add the SRP, I'm moving my locations towards the sun. And if I change the attitude, what happens is I just displace those points up or down or sideways or in different places. It's hard to put down the equation on how much things are displaced, but we can have a general idea of how those things are displaced. Okay, so if we and the same. Okay, so if we, and the same happens with, sorry, I'll try and explain that block. And the same happens with the periodic and quasi-periodic orbits around there, that they are slightly displaced, so the same, so these, the saddle, each time I'm changing the attitude, what I'm doing is I'm kind of moving the saddle. So I'll try to explain this. And if you don't understand, it's fine because I try to put in a plot the general idea of that. Essentially, when I change the equilibrium point on the left-hand side, I kind of have how these points are displaced. This point are displaced, and the same happens with the orbits. How the orbits are displaced around here, right? They are displaced in this kind of circle. So I'll essentially be orbiting around this SL2 point that is full SRP effect. And if I tilt, I change the attitude of my spacecraft because I want to see a star or another, the natural L1 or L2 will be displaced along this sunline, along this dotted line around here, right? So essentially, each time I change the attitude, what is happening, it's my size. What is happening is my saddle is slightly moving, right? So, if we could kind of get those points and project them on the saddle plane, that is what displays here. If what I want to have is I want to avoid having, or I want to understand what type of maneuvers I'm going to have, what I'll have here is that I'm essentially always going to be, let's say, escaping if I do nothing, right? If I do nothing, right, the saddle in the middle is the one that's dominating everything, so I'm just escaping away in this sense. And every time I change the maneuver, I change the attitude, sorry, this saddle moves. And what is happening is I could have things that go towards the sun or away from the sun. And we were trying to use this, and it's kind of complicated because usually they have a lot of different changes between maneuvers. But if we could kind of pinpoint which If we could kind of pinpoint which are the orbits that are going to be effective every time, we could maybe understand better why we have more or less sunward or anti-sunward maneuvers. So this is just work in process, in progress, but one of the ideas of using that is that it could help us understand the effect of SRP on orbits like this and how this impacts the cost of the station keeping maneuvers. And that's all I have. Essentially, Essentially, at many, there's a lot of still work to do, but we have done a comparison of these two station-keeping maneuvers, which seem that they are essentially the same. And this has been very useful to try and understand and make better decisions when it comes to mission applications. And if you have any questions or anything, thank you for your attention. Thank you, Rianna. So is there any question or remark? Is there any question or remark? Well, if not, let's thank Ariana again and we continue. Thank you. Thank you.
