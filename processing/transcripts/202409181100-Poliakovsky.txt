So, first of all, I would like to remind what is the definition of functions of bounded variations. So, u is belong to B V if U is one function, and distributional, every distributional partial derivative of U is a finite signed Radon measure. The B V semi-norm. The B V semi-norm is this quantity. W11 is a proper subspace of BV and for U in B V in W11, the B V semi-norm is just the L1 semi-norm of the gradient, L1 norm of the gradient, sorry. For U in B V, in general, there exists a jump set J of U of dimension. jumps at J of U of dimension n minus one with the normal new U as such that at H n minus one every point in X in omega minus the jump set the U is approximately continuous and on the jump set itself approximate one side limits exist on both sides of the Exist on both sides of the jump state. Next, I would like to remind what the fractional ensemble of spaces WRQ is r less than one. So given r less, greater than zero, less than one, we say that u in w r q if u in l q and the following quantity which call it Galliardo semi-norm in the power q is finite. Is finite. So the WRQ semi-norm is just square q square root of this quantity and the wrq norm is just wrq semi-norm plus norm in lq next i would like to define what is approximate limit of function of function in l1 function of function in n1 log given u in n1 log we say that u has approximate limit if exist vector at limit at point x if exist vector z in the are d such that this limit is zero the set s The set assume where this property does not hold, call it the approximate discontinuity set for any x in omega. The vector z uniquely determined by one if it exists, call it the approximate limit of u at x and denoted by u with the head x u tilde x. Next, we just would like to chum. Next, we just would like to go do some more general definitions of approximate limit oscillation point. So, we say that given u in L1 log, we say that x is an approximate limit oscillation point of u if this limit is zero and the set S U prime where this property does not hold is This property does not hold the score, reduce it approximated discontinuity set. So, in contrast to the previous definition, we require less than here. Here we require this, exist of this, and here we require less. Less just the infimum of the C limit equals to zero, and then obviously if we require less, the set where this property does not hold is a subset of the SU. The discontinuity reduced at approximate discontinuity set is a smaller, in general smaller subset. General smaller subset when the usual discontinuity set. And I would like to remark that if u in L1 log, then for every x in omega, we have this limit is zero if and only if this limit is zero, where u is a mean value, integral mean value of u over ball. U over ball be rho. So this and these are equivalent. Next, we would like to remind the classical result of Adams Hellberg, Zimier Reymans Garpy. I don't know who exactly established this result, but this was took in these books. So Books. So let omega in Rn be an open set P less or equal than N and U in W1P. Then there exists set U in Rn such that capacity of E equals to zero and this property is zero outside of set E. We have a couple If we have capacity of discontinuity sets is zero. So here we have a limit. This is not mean value. This is the limit of the mean value when epsilon goes to zero. Capacity is the peak capacity of the set. The set. They call that for P less than n greater or equal than one, there exists a constant such that capacity less or equal than HN minus pi Hausdorff measure of E. However, if P greater than one, then if we have finite Hausdorff measure of E, then it plus its capacity is zero. We establish it. Somehow, more general results, in some sense, general, and some sense less. Let omega in Rn be an open set and U and W on P. Then there exists a set E in Rn such that H minus P E equals to zero. So this is a better condition. However, we have only not with a limit here, but the mean value. And here we have h n minus p su prime greater equals to zero, not su without prime, bus su with prime, the smallest at su prime equals to zero. And we show the example that ub rho, the mean value of cannot be replaced by u b epsilon limits of this in the general case. So in general case, we cannot. So in general case we cannot get this result with SU. We just can get it with SU, SU prime. We also established similar results for fractional Soboleph space, let omega n R n be open set R less than one and Q greater or equal to one, such that R Q less equal than N. That RQ is less or equal than N, and let U in W R Q. Then there exists a set E in Rn such that H n minus RQ E equals to zero. And this limit is zero. Again, here is a mean value, not the limit of the mean value. Here we have h nine minus r q s u prime equals to. U S U prime equals to zero. We also have a similar example, like in the case of usual W and O I1Q, so therefore WRQ, that the mean value in this formula cannot be replaced by the limit of mean values in the general case. Next, we would like to. Next, we would like to remind the classical result I found in the books of Zimir and Evans-Garpe, that losing approximation of Sobolev function and BV function by Lipschitz functions. So let omega n Rn be an open set and let U in W1P in the case P greater than zero or U in B V log in the case P equals to P greater than one and in the P greater than one and in the in BB log in the case p equals to one and let case be a compact set just compact set just for because of log we just it doesn't matter if we have no log we don't need this compact set then for every epsilon goes greater than zero then there exists a compact set k0 subset of k such that lm k minus k0 less than epsilon and the u in is a limit In the Lipschitz function on k0. And we established the similar results for fractional soboleft spaces. However, instead of Lipschitz function, we instead for older functions. For elder functions, let omega in Rn be an open set, Q greater or equal than one, and R less than one. Then for every U in W R Q log, Q log and therefore every compact there exists epsilon greater than zero and the component K0 subset of K such that Lebesgue measure of K minus K0 less than epsilon and U is the older continuous on K0. Next, I would like to remind the definition of BS of space. Not all the BS of space, but the Not all the base of space, but the particular case BSQ infinity. Given q greater than or equal to 1 and s greater than 0 and less than 1, we say that u in l q belongs to B S of space B S q infinity if we have the following quantity is finite. Moreover, we say that u in a q log belongs to That u and lq log belongs to local version of Bessel space. If for every compact there exists a function uk dependent on compact such that inside of this compact uk equals to u and u k belongs to global base of space then clearly u k u in LQ belongs to base of space if and only if we Base of space if and only if we have this quantity is finite and for the local version we just need this quantity on compact is finite next I would like to define one more definite not one more some new definitions generalized approximate limit generalized approximate limit approximation limit oscillation points. Given u in a one log, we say that x is a generalized approximate limit oscillation point if this quantity is zero. Here we have in the previous definition it was limp sup limbs here we just require limins so we just require less the same The set SU prime prime of points where this property does not hold is called the generalized approximate discontinuity set. Obviously, SU prime prime is a subspace of CU prime and SU prime is a subspace of SU. Next, I would like to remind the classical definition of jump points. Let omega in Rn and U in L1 log. Rn and U in L1 log, we say that X is an approximate jump point of U if there exists two different vectors A and B and the unit vector in Sn minus one such that I already said A is different from B and these limits are zero on half of the ball where this B row plus This B rho plus X nu is the half of the ball in the direction of new and B R minus in the opposite direction. The triple of AB new uniquely defined permutation of AB and the sine of new is denoted by U plus U minus new U. The set of represented jump points is denoted by J of U. Obviously, we have J of U. Obviously, we have J of U is a subset of S U prime prime. It's a subset of S U prime is a subset of S U. Next, we would like to present some results of Giacomo Del Nin. Let omega N Rn be an open set and you in one log. Surprisingly, you just belong to one log. Then the jump set is containable n minus one rectifiable. And the classical theorem of Federer-Wolpert: that if u omega in Rn be an open set U in B V log, then the jump set G U is contable n is one extra failure center orientated with the jump vector nu u and moreover we have h n minus y of su minus j of u equals to zero. What happens with the besoff space? happens with the base of space, with the base of space and somehow base of space are similar to B V in some sense. And let omega in R2 be an open sentence and this is a combination of results of two papers of De Leilis Otto. First paper is of De Leilius Otto and second paper of Geraldine Lamy. Let me omega in R2 be an open set and unit B S of one divided by three three infinity of omega with values in R2 satisfy. Values in R2, satisfying that u is a unit vector and the dividence of u equals to zero in the sense of distributions. Then the jump set G U is a containable one rectifiable set oriented with the jump vector mu u. And moreover, we have similarly to federal Wolpert Su prime minus Ju equals to zero. However, here we have only SU prime, not SU. Prime, not SU, as in the federal alpert. I don't know if they can establish SU, but in the previous paper, this was an open question. We establish it the same for the general not the same, somehow less. However, for the general base of space BSQ infinity without any restriction on distributional derivatives. Distributional derivatives or modulus of U. Let omega n Rn be an open set, S in 0, 1, and Q greater equal than 1, such that SQ less than 1 and U in B S of space, then there exists N minus SQ sigma finite finite space set at E in Rn such that such that this limit equals to zero outside of E. Here we have that S U prime prime is h n minus S Q sigma finite so we we don't get that S U prime prime minus jump of U is equals H L minus line H L minus SQ norm equals to zero, but we get just that these two sets That these two sets different with H and minus HQ sigma finite set. And the example, again example U bi row in this expression cannot be replaced by the limit. So we cannot obtain SU here, but I don't know, can we obtain SU prime? It's a still open question if whether we can obtain. whether we can obtain SU prime here, but we cannot obtain SU. This is the example we cannot obtain SU here. Thank you for the attention.
