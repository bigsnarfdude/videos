Today, I will be talking about some of our work in the Penn Medicine BiBank and my lab mostly focus on the women's health traits. So, we talk about how we use electronic health records and genomics data to understand some of the women's health. We've talked a lot about healthcare data and how healthcare data is useful. So, this is a great representation from Lancet. This is a great representation from one study that was published a few years ago that showed 300 most popular diseases that individuals are diagnosed with over the course of their lifetime. And because there's so much longitudinal data in the electronic health records that is already available, we think for genomic research, this is a really good resource and we've been talking about that a lot today. So we won't be going much into detail for that. Much into detail for that. VHR data is great because it's longitudinal and also because it's disease agnostic, so we can pick whatever diseases we're interested in and try to mine the data. We've talked about all the different methods for mining the data as well. In my group, we work on using electronic health records and genomics data for both discoveries and also for translational medicine. Translational medicine, and I would mostly focus on not just the GWAS part or the discovery part, but more so on how we use these genomic discoveries for building risk models and understanding the risk for comorbidities or understanding the diseases itself more. For this, we use a lot of publicly available resources such as All of Us, eMERGE dataset, UK Biobank. All of those have been talked about today. But one of the resources I've been But one of the resources that we have at Pan is the Pan Medicine Bioban, which I'll describe about. The question that we're interested in answering from the Octavi Health Records data is what disease a patient will have, or how would a patient react to a given drug at a given time. There are multiple factors that play a role into that, such as age, race, medical history, family history, genetic predisposition, any other drugs that a patient takes. Drugs that a patient takes, and also their smoking and lifestyle. All this information is also readily available in the electronic health records, and we work towards incorporating all those into these risk models to understand what disease a patient would have. Not only at a given time, but again, since this is longitudinal data, we want to see what diseases a patient would have at a given time point in their life. A lot of the work kind of falls into these four categories. Into these four categories in context of different phenotypes. And this is, you know, this is just a very small list of everything that's been going on, but it's more of the work that my lab has been focusing upon. We use electronic health record data to do really deep phenotyping from the VHR, either using some of the large language models that we have been describing, or doing more of collaborative work with clinical. Of collaborative work with clinicians and understanding the diseases and disease and phenotyping, and then taking them into the much language models. And then we do discovery, which is either using genome-wide association studies or exome-wide association studies, and risk prediction for many of these diseases. To utilize this, we do PAD Medicine Biomac, which is a single institutional research program and it is at the University of University of University And it is in the University of Pennsylvania Health System Program, and every patient who is UPHS patient is eligible to be enrolled into the bioburg. We have both in-person and remote recruitment for patients at a variety of patient sites. It's in the Philadelphia and the Greater Philadelphia and Washington, both of them on the suburbs on the New Jersey side, and also on the Main Park side. This map here. This map here kind of shows all the different hospitals where the patients are included into the bioplane. When patients come in for their regular outpatient visits, they get asked if you want to be enrolled into the bioplan. Many times you even get that asked when you're doing your pre-check-in steps before coming into the hospital. Then, when you, if you have to, if you said yes, then Have to collect, and if you said yes, then we do collect blood via centralized processing, and the storage of DNA, plasma, etc. was also done along with any other tissue that had been collected. Say if there was surgery that was done and this was going to just be discarded tissue, we do stop that as well. We also have all the researchers who are in the Penn Medicine Biobank access to the clinical data. We have electronic health records, and another great thing about our biobank is that we have. About our backbone is that we have permission to recontact and do callback studies. We have a lot of work that we've been doing to actually contact patients back to understand their risk prediction models or just recruit them if there are specific grants to be able to do that. This just shows quick demographics and the study population of the Plant Medicine Bioventric. This is actually a little bit of an outdated slide. We have about 275,000 participants. 375,000 participants that have been recruited into the biobank, and we are working towards collecting their samples. We've collected about 90,000 samples. This does say about 75,000. And out of those, half of them have been both exome-sequenced and genotyped, array genotyped. The plot here shows how we have a kind of equal 50-50 distribution of males and females. And also, one other great thing is about the diagnostic. One other big thing is about the diversity of the bibe. I think we know about 30% of individuals that are of non-European ancestry, and we do put a lot of effort into including more individuals from non-European ancestry, specifically given the population of Philadelphia and that region has high diversity. So this plot here is showing us a combined genome-wide association study. Combined a genome-wider association study of multiple phenotypes. It's from all the different larger GOASs that have been done on body mass index, coronary artery disease, many blood pressure measurements, and type to type disease. The point here to say that in the last few decades, GWAS has really helped to enhance our understanding of how these variants are associated with diseases. And there are multiple questions. There are multiple basic utilities for using these genome-wide association studies. One is basically obviously understanding the disease mechanism, which I won't be talking much about today, but more so we'll be talking about how we use these findings for disease risk, comorbidities risk, and also for understanding more about diseases, which is disease subtyping. I'll skip through quickly the polygenic risk score is one of the main ways we use these GWAS findings to pull some. GWAS findings to build some risk models. It's not only the GWAS results that go into a polygenic risk score, we also always include other factors like age, sex, principal components, or any other race ancestry information on individuals and other clinical biomarkers. These all together contribute towards a risk score for an individual for a given disease. Now, when we talk about women's health, though, this is again Women's health, though. This is again a similar combined plot of as many women's health disease traits that are available in GWAS catalog. And what we see is that there is underwhelming representation of many women's health boards and what GWAS have given us in terms of understanding just about the women's health boards. We've gained a lot. We have many signals for breast cancer, other cancer types. Cancer types, we have uterine fibroids that are resulted from here, but not as much as what we see from BMI or other diseases. But we have seen that many of these cardiometabolic conditions that I showed you before are highly linked with many of these women's health diseases as well. So we asked this question that if these diseases, these two different GWASs are highly correlated. GWASs are highly correlated. Can we understand anything about what the genomic burden of these cardiometabolic diseases do to influence the risk for conditions in females that are only unique to females? To do that, the first thing we do is we extract our phenotypes for building phenotypes in our longitudinal electronic boundaries data. We have women that come into the EHR system during the pregnancy and also outside their pregnancy ranges. And many of these conditions are actively influenced when we combine the factors during the pregnancy and outside the pregnancy. So we separate them together, we build cohorts that are just during the pregnancy and also outside of pregnancy. Both the laboratory measurements and also the disease. And also, the disease and ICD codes and all the other phenotypes we are extracting are not including the pregnancy measurements. So, we do several case control definitions. This is just an example here showing how we define cases and controls for a pregnancy cohort phenotype, such as stiltor. But we do these iteratively for many different phenotypes. And this can then also extract other factors such as gestational aid, smoking history, alcohol, lab measures during pregnancy, and vitals during pregnancy to put it into a larger database. So far, we've done this for this handful of phenotypes in the Penn Medicine Biobank and the eMERGE Consortium. The ones that are listed here is about 27. That we have disease diagnoses that are using both the Are using both the ICD codes, the surgical CPT codes and ICD codes for identifying disease diagnoses for both cases and controls. And then we do for laboratory measurements, both the median overall measurements that do not include pregnancy measurements, but also only the measurements that are during the pregnancy. To come back to the first genetic correlation plot of how these diseases are associated with cardiometabolic conditions. Are associated with cardiac metabolic conditions. What we did here in this study that was published last year, what we did is we built polygenic risk scores for the cardiac metabolic conditions from the large GWASs that are published. And we then checked for their association with all these phenotypes from the women's health database that we have calculated in our two paradigms. We follow this analysis with. Follow this analysis with doing Mendelian anonymization and also understanding about any longitudinal patterns that we may be able to identify from the electronic health that we received. In here, we were able to identify that four different cardiometabolic conditions are associated with seven different women's health genotypes. Many of these are what you would expect, such as the association of type 2 diabetes and BMI with gestational. And BMI with gestational diabetes. PCOS is associated with type 2 diabetes and also BMI. An interesting novel association that we did identify in this is an inverse correlation between breast cancer associations and coronary harder disease polygenic risk bore. When followed these associations with mandelar rhythmization, many of these did show significant associations with menel randomization. Associations and by the normalization. I am now showing those results. But I want to just highlight the coronary artery disease and breast cancer associations that we've been looking at further now. In this published work, we saw that when we look at the variants that are associated with both breast cancer and coronary artery disease, we do see that they exhibit different direction of effects when compared together. When compared together. And also, that was also shown by the inverse correlation and the genetic correlation study. And then, when we, in the Penn Medicine Biobank, when we look at the overlap of individuals that have both coronary artery disease and breast cancer, we see only 8.1% individuals to overlap. There are several hypotheses that could be built from here. One is that it's possible that the women that have coronary artery disease do not live long. Archaeology disease do not live long enough to develop breast cancer or vast versa. And also, possible that many of the medications that are given for treating coronary outer disease may actually be protective against breast cancer. There are some papers that have done some immune randomization studies to show that, and we're also looking more deeper into it to do some callback studies to identify if that's really the case. Lastly, also in this study, we looked at some longitudinal patterns by just looking at high polygenic risk-forward versus low polygenic risk-for groups. This is only showing results for obesity, polygenic risk-for or BNI, polygenic risk-for. And we were able to see that individuals who are younger and have high polygenic risk-for BNI did present with many diseases earlier in their life. With many diseases earlier in their life than later in their lives. So, a conclusion from this study is that we were able to show that women that have high genetic burden of many of the cardiometabolic diseases are predisposed to certain diseases such as gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, post-particle depression, and many other cancers. And also, through the chronological map analyses, we were able to show how. We were able to show the chronological map of female health that included both disease prevalence based on high and low polygenic risk score, and that would have some more clinical hygiene. Now it's great that we can use polygenic risk scores in some contexts, but I also want to show since we're looking at many of the women's health conditions in some of the phenotypes where it really does not work well. Work well because there are many factors that contribute to polygenic response. Some of these that we include in our models, but are also other factors that are nuances to how these genome-wide association studies are actually conducted, which could include overdiagnoses or underdiagnoses of diseases, population substructure, and also heterogeneity of diseases as well. One of the diseases that my lab really focused on is endometriosis. And endometriosis is really important because about 200,000 women are diagnosed with endometriosis every year in the United States. And although it is mostly characterized by severe pelvic pain, it is not just a disease of pelvis. It is a more systemic disease. This slide here shows that how many other conditions are actually coexisting with endometriosis. And it ranges from many given. And it ranges from many gynecological conditions to mental health and cancers that are highly associated with endometriosis. A large genome-wide association study of endometriosis has already been conducted. This was published last year, and this included about 800,000 women with SKAs in control. I think about 40,000 had endometriosis and controls. So one would think that. Our controls, so one would think that we could really build a polygenic risk score that for such a large set. When we build this polygenic risk for, we see that the accuracy in our data set is, this is a very optimistic one. This is the best one I've got by running every methods that are possible and every slicing of data, every covariate we could include. The maximum we can go is 60% accuracy, and AFR accuracies are actually. AFR accuracies are actually not that right here because the data set didn't include any African individuals. I think all we're pulling out here is from the principal performance. So this is best we can do with homogenic risk for. That's why we take a step back and see that this could be a problem of clinical heterogeneity. So, how we can leverage electronic health records. Oops. I'm going to present it. Oh, it's that. Oh, it's that. I'm going over time. Is that for all four? A couple more minutes for sure. Okay. Okay. So this slide is not for everyone to be able to read, but essentially just to say why we think this. Just to say why we think this is a problem of clinical heterogeneity, because everything you see on the white section of this plot is everything that a clinician has to do to see if patient has symptoms that are consistent with endometriosis. Everything that's on the gray section of the plot is everything a clinician has to do to say that the symptoms are discordant with endometriosis. And then they do a laparoscopic surgery to finally do an endometriosis diagnosis. So our hypothesis is that. So, our hypothesis is that the symptomatology of endometriosis may contribute to different comorbidities and also indicate some possible subtypes. Now, subtyping for endometriosis is possible if you're looking at just the surgical notes data. There are information about how severe endometriosis was, where the lesions were found. But that's not only the subtypes we care about because most patients who go through surgery are the ones that have very. Surgery are the ones that have really severe phenotype or symptoms at any point. They have pain that is uncontrollable for many years, and that's why they go for surgery. In fact, but if we look at other symptomatologies for morbid fees, 70 to 80 percent of women who come for infertility treatments are actually diagnosed with animatriosis later on. So they didn't have those pain and other symptoms that we talked about that would be in the surgery, but they have other characteristics up and up. Other characteristics of endometriosis. We want to see how we can use different electronic health record phenotypes to identify features that are relative to these symptoms, all those that work in the white and the gray categories, and do some clustering methodologies to indicate any subtypes from these EHR data. So, when we do hierarchical clustering on just the clinical features, that would be relevant. Features that would be relevant and comorbidities that would be relevant to endometriosis. We identify five different subtypes of, and these, I'm not listing the sample sizes here, but they are very similar. And each cohort is very much similar in the samples. Like we all have about 500 samples in each cluster. We're able to see that there's one cluster that has the highest prevalence of pain comorbidities, and we do. Comorbidities, and we do validate this with doing some chart reviews. So, for every cluster, we've picked a random set of individuals to see if this was just what we've extracted or this is actually written in the notes that they do have high prevalence of pain or uterine disorders or pregnancy complications. So, we're able to identify these five different subtypes for endometriosis. So, we go back to the GWAS findings of those 46 loci. Those 46 loci to then see if these GWAS findings would be different had we done the GWASs separated by these subtypes. When we conduct that, we do see that obviously we have smaller sample size, so we don't have enough power, 800,000 samples, for each subtype to do these analyses. But we do see several relevant associations in uterine disorders, pregnancy disorders that would be more relative to what. Be more relative to how these phenotypes present in those women. And also for the cardiometabolic conditions, we do see only one signal, RNLS, which is already associated with other cardiometabolic phenotypes. But all the other endometriosis-related genes, such as WINT4, REM, they are not present in that one subtype of individuals. Yes, this is my last. Sorry, yes, this is my last slide. So, what we're trying to do next is we're trying to use conduct these polygenic risk scores based on these different subtypes, going back to those larger data sets, doing the subtyping analyses and genome-wide association studies. We're also using different metrics of endometriosis scoring from extracting this from the EHR, and then include information like race, ethnicity, or age. Race, ethnicity, or age into building these models that would help us first predict who's at the risk for endometriosis symptoms and then predict the risk for different subtypes that we do see in this data cell. Because that will be all. I don't get to all this stuff. Oh, thank you.
