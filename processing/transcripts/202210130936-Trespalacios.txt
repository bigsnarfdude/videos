Organizer for the opportunity to present in this event. I am very happy to be here. Today, I want to talk about some results about the serial model. For this, I am going to identify the serial model with a particular case of the Einstein equation in vacuum. So, in this order, I want to start with a brief introduction about the general relativity theory. Relativity theory, and next we can pass to show some results about the local and global existence and long-term behavior for the serial model. Okay, well, the general relativity is a geometric theory whose main object of the study is the Lorentz manifold. In this case, we have a Lorentz metric with this signature that satisfying the Einstein equation given in the The Einstein equation given in that way. In this equation, we have in the left side all the curvature expressions related with the rigid tensor. And in the right side, we have energy-momentum tensor. In particular, I will be focused on the Einstein equation in vacuum. That's me, the Lorentz metric. Me, the Lorentz metric vanishing of the Fritz tensor. Okay, this equation is the answer equation in vacuum. And for this equation, we have so many important examples of the solution like Mikovsky spacetime. We have the Source spacetime and Kerr space-time too. And the last two space-time is very related with the description about the black hole. Um the black hole considered consider rotation too. Okay, okay. Um, from the mathematical point of view, we have so many important previous results about the Einstein equation concerning, for example, the well-posnet for the Cauchy problem discovery by Sokerbruhab. We also have to the application. To the application to the inverse scattering transform for the Einstein equation by Belinsky and Sakharov, and some results related with the stability, like the global nonlinear stability of the Mikovsky space-time by Christolo and Kleinermann. Currently, we have so many remarkable results related with, for example, the core. With, for example, the correct definition about the conserved quantities, or maybe there are many results related with the impulsive gravitational wave integration given for Luke and Mortel. And more recently, the group of the study of Michales da Fermo find some results about the decay of the solution to the scalar way equation. To this colourway equation using a care black hole background. Okay, with this short introduction, the question is how to identify the Chiral model with the Einstein, the Einstein equation in the vacuum. And the answer is using the following answers given for Belinsky and Sakharov. Or maybe you can call it Belinsky. Maybe you can call it Velinsky-Nzakarov spacetime. The idea is to have the following assumption about the metric tensor. In this case, G tilde depends on two variables only. And that means, or that is equivalent to say that the space-time admits two commuting killing vector fields. With this consideration, Together with coordinates transformation allow us to go from a metric in this way, in this form, sorry, to a block diagonal form. The idea is take this term here and this term here in the principal diagonal of the matrix and take a function f, the same function here and here with the this. here with the different different seeds and using the coordinate the see the coordinates transformation we can eliminate these terms this component of the matrix and this component of the metric and with this assumption about the commuting healing vector we we can eliminate this and other components and we have a matrix with a block diagonal form This form gives me the opportunity to write the space-time interval in a simplified form like equation two. In this equation, we use Cartesian coordinates, but maybe you can use axial symmetry. You can write the space-time interval like an equation tree. Like an equation tree. In this case, my assumption is that the function f is the function g, the function g, remember that is the block center of the metric, just depends in the variable t and variable s. Okay, and this assumption may seem very restrictive, maybe, but however, there are many. However, there are many, many different examples in the physics of the space-time that can be write like equation two or equation three. For example, we have the Kastner metric, the Kerr metric, the Einstein Rosen metric, and some Bianchi's model. To be specific, the Kastner metric you can write in this form. In this case, we had the dependence on T here. For the Einstein-Rossen metric, we had the definition in this form. And for the source shield metric, we can use the Krukal-Seeker coordinates for describe the metric. Okay? The answers of Elijah and Sakharov gave me the opportunity to simplify the Einstein equation. The Einstein equation. This equation is actually a system of the 10 equations, and each equation is highly non-linearity. Then, with the answer, we can decouple this system, and we obtain a matrix equation for the metric G. Remember, G is a blood center of the metric. In this case, alpha squared is equal to Is equal to the determinant of the matrix G. And this equation is called the reduced Einstein equation. And additionally, the alphan function is a solution of the one-dimensional way equation. Another motivation to use this approach for study Einstein equation is the existing. Is the existence of the gravisolitons for this equation? The term of gravisoliton is related with the explicit solution generated by the Belliskin-Sakados transform. And this transform is the inverse scattering transform applied to the Einstein equation. The Gravisoliton doesn't have the classical definition about the classical solid. The classical soliton, because, for example, the solution don't preserve the amplitude or the shape, but there is a very important relation between gravitatonial waves, gravisolitons, and black holes. All the black hole is a gravisoliton using this definition. And in 2016, we have the field determination. We have the field detection of the gravitational waves. And these gravitational waves were produced by the merger of two black holes. That means that this type of solution is very important to the theory and the application too. Okay, in additional to unsafe obelisk and Sakharov, we will use a new coordinates. A new coordinates for describe of the components of the metric. In this case, I will describe the metric G using the spectral theory in this way. And we obtain this description for the term for the components of the matrix. This new function, capital Lambda and phi, Will be a new function that describes the components of the matrix. Will be my focus now and on. With these coordinates, the Reduce-Ainstein equation, this equation here in green, can be write like a system of the equation. This is a system of semi-linear equation. And we have again, sorry. Sorry? Okay. We have again the one-dimensional equation for the function alpha, and here an equation for the function f. The function f, remember that, is like in the first element in the last element in the diagonal of the matrix. And this equation is the coupled to the rest of the system. If you have the solution for... you have the solution for capital lambda for phi you can easily to to describe who is the function f and the most simple case of this system here the system seven is when alpha is equal to a constant or in particular alpha is equal to one and when alpha is equal to one we have the reduced Einstein equation can be identified Can be identified with the principal child field equation. And this is the model that I want to work with. Okay. If we use the definition in terms of the capital Lambda function and the function phi, this equation can be written in this form in the system 11. Again, this is a system of semi-linear way equation. And this system has the following conserved energy given for this functionality. Okay, and now we are ready to present some results about this model, digital model. The initial resource is related with the classical local system of the solution for digital model. we take the function capital lambda in this form as a a constant su plus sorry plus another function we call it capital lambda tilde and here lambda is different to zero and and actually lambda is a constant is a positive constant this consideration is important because when Is important because when you write the principal Shira field equation in this form, we need a uniform tissue zero for this function here. Because I need to, in order to have the necessary regularity to get the local result, I need to this term is different to zero. And using a vector notation, the Cauchy problem for this system can be written this way. Here, M is a component of the Mikovsky metric. And the space calligraphical edge is given in this form. And we are also going to impose the following condition on the initial data. I need to the initial data is controlled by the constant lambda. By the constant lambda and another appropriate constant d. Okay, will all this hypothesis we have if the initial data satisfy the equation 14 appropriate constant, we have existing unique for the local intern solution and we had continuous defenses of the initial data. Continued the basis of the initial data. The idea of the proof is to use energy classical estimate for the weight equation and use an argument using post-track methods. The following result is related with the global system. It's like a natural result about if you have a local solution, maybe you can extend this solution to a small, smooth. Solution to a small, smooth global solution. And for the way equation, for the non-linear way equation, there are important results about this topic. All these results for Kleiner Mar, for Christo-Dolovi, for Alinak have some things in common. They use an old condition, they use a small initial data, and they have a high-dimensional dimension here. High dimensional dimension here is three space dimensions and two space dimensions for Alinac. In one dimensional, we have maybe some problem because waves in one dimension don't decay. But in 2018, Luli Iro can prove that this semi-linear wave equation and one dimensional with null condition have Have a global smooth solution. And with this word, we have another important word about the geometric analysis and quasi-linear way equation, for example. Recall or remember that the null form or null condition is defined in the next way. We can describe the null form of the classical null form. NURFOR OF THE CLASICAL NURFOR, like a bilinear for giving 4-14 in this way, and for our system doesn't have a particular denial condition, but this factor here, this factor here, and this equal equation can be write in terms of the equation 15. Then, if Then, if you impose the condition about the initial data, a sufficiently small condition about the initial data, I cannot find the global small solution for the principal cheerleader field equation. And the idea, the proof here is you see, use the coordinates system, standard Cartesian coordinates and new coordinates. And new coordinates and give a volume of the integral region for define the wetting norm of energy. The idea is define the new vector fields in this form and use the relation between the bilinear force, the null form here and this vector field defined here. And on another hand, On another hand, we have the null structure is preserved after differentization. We can see, take the diversity here, the equation 18 give me the preserve of the structure. And with this inequality, this is an important inequality, and using the Bus Strat method, we can prove with this wearing energy norm that. Energy north that the local solution can be extended to a global small solution. The following result is about the long-term behavior. And for this, we used the definition about the momentum density and energy density. The idea is use a birial estimate for give a long time behavior. For give a long-term behavior of the solution. And for this, we need the following continuity equation. We have this relation between energy and momentum in this inequality that control the energy over the momentum density. And we have energy conservation, like I said before. And then we can use the same approach that. We can use the same approach that Munoz and Alejo used by the Boringfell equation and define the following functional. This functional use this equation, this is a weight equation, this is a weight equation, weight function, sorry, this omega function and not time the birial identity given in this form. Giving in this form. And with this medial identity, can be obtained the following result about the average estimate give me the behavior of the energy when T going to the infinite. More precisely, I can show that if you had a solution that have conserved infinity energy, this Infinity energy, this energy in the light cone go to the infinite go to zero when T go to the infinite. And finally, I want to talk about the application to soliton solution for this equation, for this model. We have that Belinski and Sakaro in this work, and this work proposes that the Einstein equation has The Einstein equation has any soliton solutions. And Hadad, in his PhD thesis, proved or showed explicit example of the solution for the principal shield equation using this diagonal background. Okay, in this case, capital lambda super zero satisfies the one-dimensional wave equation and And he gives the explicit solution for the serial model, giving it this way. For this solution, when you compare with the function lambda in function phi, we obtain this this structure for this function. But for this solution, the energy is not finite, don't have finite energy. don't have physical energy um okay our propose sorry our propose is present another option for defining the one soliton solution for digital model and the idea is that this solution have finity energy for this i consider the following function and function and is a compact software function. In this case, mu is a dispersal of see this is a parameter of dispersion and lambda like before is like a gap for definition of the function. And for this background the energy is finite. We had this one and we have the one soliton is now describing this form. Now describing this form. And for this solution, I can prove that situable perturbations of any solitones as 28 with the condition 1 to 3 are globally well defined. That means we have a splitting solution that fulfills everything hypothesis of the global existing theory. Maybe, if you want to see like the behavior of the initial data in this problem, is a localized function given in this way. This is the sum reference used in the develop of this work. Thank you so much. Thank you, Jessica. So, is there any question? So, just some curiosity, Jessica. So, you start from the use-Einstein equation, right? And then you put alpha number equal to zero or to one. To one. To one. And then you get this model. And your solutions in this model. Can you come back to the This model can you come back to the instead equation and then find solutions close to the solution of the chiral model? No, you can you can um I can pass to the Einstein equation to the Siral model, but I can take the opposite direction because there are some some definition particular with the energy that fail. But the idea is work about the more general case. The more general case, what happened when alpha is a more general function? And if you try to prove that we have a global system in this case or maybe the long-term behavior for this case, but it's not easy to return to the general model to Einstein equation. That is not the direction. So, more questions? No more questions so we thank you, Lisika. I'm just wondering if it would be possible maybe to take the online photo of the online participant. Of course, everyone in the room, you can go enjoy the coffee break that I made. I believe there's Brownie involved. Okay. So we will come back in 10 minutes. I think they're okay.
