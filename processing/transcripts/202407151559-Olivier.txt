Marie Laurel, seven years of experience in the COE programme. Yes, my name is Marie La Rouligier and I'm the administrative leader for the Center of Excellence Programme. I'm afraid that my presentation will be quite different from all of yours because I'm not working with research, I'm working only with administration. So I'm going to present to you seven years experience of the our center of experience. Of the Armored Center of Excellence, PORLAB. So, what is PORLAL? PORLAL is the acronym for PORS Media Laboratory and this is a COE, so a Center of Excellence. The Center of Excellence is a funding scheme administered by the Research Council of Norway. And this is actually the most prestigious program from the Research Council of Norway. We are in the generation. We are in the generation number four. And in 2020, there was an evaluation order by the Research Council of Norway, which concluded that the SFF program, SFF means Center of Excellence in Norwegian, has been a great success for Norway. So, to continue, its duration is 10 years. We started in August 17, so we have funds until August 27. 27. Per lab has two notes: Enternu in Frombei and the University of Oslo. It is led by seven scientists from physics, chemistry and reservoir engineering. The fundings, half of the funding is coming from the Research Council of Norway, and the two institutions which are involved in Parlab, so Antel Nu and Julio, have to come with some own contributions. Contributions. So the own contribution can be a part of the salary of the professors, it can be some internally funded PhD students or postdoc. So total we have 274 million crowns. You have to divide by 10 to get US dollar. So about 30 million US dollars for 10 years. So as I mentioned, Pura Basu notes. As I mentioned, we have two notes, one at Antenu and one at the University of Oslo. At Antenu we have two faculties, the Faculty of Natural Sciences and the Faculty of Engineering, and in Oslo the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. There are two departments involved, at the Faculty of Natural Sciences, the Department of Physics and Department of Chemistry, and the Department of Geoscience and Petroleum at the Faculty of Engineering. And at the University of Oslo, you have just the Department of Physics. So, taking people from these four departments, then we have PORLAB. The mission of PORLAB is to unify and advance understanding of porous media, both at the fundamental level and in application. So, we start with the basis in physics, and we aim for a better description of Description of flows that range from geological, such as a reservoir, for example, to biological and technological. The objectives of the program is to link together observations of how fluids behave at the bulk scale with the proper description of fluid bulbs media at much larger scales. The aim is to construct a large-scale theory for flow in porous media based on the detailed physics at the Paul River. So to achieve this, we combine hydrodynamics, non-necular thermodynamics, statistical physics under the three pillars of science, which are theoretical, computational, and experimental methods. So, how are we organized? We have a four-lab steering board on For lab steering board on the top. I will come back on its role a bit later. We have a scientific advisory committee, and I will come back on the role as well. The centre director is Alex Samson, who is here. Then I stand up here, administrative leader, and then we are organizing eight work packages. So I'm not going to go into details, but just that you understand that it's That you understand that it's a really multidisciplinary center because we have physicists such as Alex, Peter Gene, experimental physics, Marcel who is here, experimental physics, the same with Eric Dor who is sitting here as well. Evin Widelsson is a professor at the Department of Chemistry. His specialty is on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. And we have And we have Carl Frederick Berg, who is a professor at the Geoscience and Petroleum Department. The Pollab steering board includes members from all participating institutions. So we have two people from the Faculty of Natural Sciences at Mtenu. Then we have one person from the other faculty, the Faculty of Engineering, and then we have two people. Engineering, and then we have two people from the university also: head of the department of physics and the director of the center, a neuron center where it's located for lab. What is the role of the board? It's actually to oversee that the activity takes place according to the project description, and especially is to we hope that it promotes a wider collaboration among. Promote a wider collaboration among the participating departments as a leadership leader. Yeah, sorry. And then we meet twice a year, usually. The scientific advisory board, we have five members, three professors and two people more from the industry. There has been some changes. We had three members before. Two of them went retired. So there is a rotation here. There is a rotation here. I'm not going to go into details, but the main role of the SAB is actually to evaluate and make recommendations only on the scientific status and progress of ORLAB. And we organize usually a meeting once a year, it's a big meeting, one to two days, and then they have to answer back to a set of five questions that Alex set up. So, how many people are we? We are already seven here and one online, actually, but all together we are 42.89 years in 2023, so it's quite big. The pie chart here on the right shows the categorization of our star by position. So, you see that the biggest bot is the number of patients. And we have at least one here. Yes. Just one here? Yes? So, a main goal, I mean something very important at Polab is what we call the Polab Graduate School. This is for PhD students and postdocs, especially the juniors. So, we organize Polab lecture series, usually done by external speakers, a prolab journal club where postdoc or PhD or even master. Postdoc or PhD or even master students need to present a present application. Then we have two mandatory Pollard courses for the PhD students, one in experimental techniques and the other one in theory and simulation. We have quite large fundings to fund research stay abroad and participation in conferences, lectures, such as this one, for example. The Pola Genieu Forum, this is all the Genie. Pola Junior Forum, this is all the juniors from both Node and LU and UEO. They meet usually twice a year just to get to know each other, present their activities and so on. And quite often we include master students here. Oops, sorry. A center of excellence is very important to attract guests. So we started with quite a high number of guests in 27. Number of guests in 2019, sorry, you see that it represented 5.8 man years, with quite a lot of people. Some guests say one day, other guests say one year. So it vary a lot. We had a dramatic drop, of course, in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID. And then the numbers pounced back in 2022. And in 2023, we had 58 guests. That represents about 3.4 million years. Years. PORLAM and Interpor, you know probably that Interpo is the International Society for Forest Media, and we have a very tight contact with them. Actually, the leader, Majida Soni Sadeh, was actually a member of our scientific advisory board, but he retired. We have a strong participation of Bora to the annual meetings, such that this picture, for example, is taken at Edinburgh. We were 26. At Edinburgh, we were 26 people from Poland attending the cereannual meeting in Scotland last year. It was in May 23. We organize as well national Interpol workshops in Norway. We have members of POVLAB members as well as the Interpol Student Affairs Committee and the Interpol Young Academy. And this is Marcel. He's here. And in addition, we have what we call And in addition, we have what we call the Interpol Colab Award for Young Researcher, which is given to a young researcher in recognition of outstanding contribution to fundamental research in the field of various media. And this person received a stipan and everything is covered for this person to come to Borlau up to three months. And we are present in the social media. This is our website. And we have a Twitter. And we have a Twitter as well, I mean, X, sorry, or X Twitter. And this is a joke for Mediterranean. And I just would like to introduce that we publish an annual report, annual, of course, every year. So this one is from 2023. I brought seven. It was heavy enough for my luggage. So you can pick up one. If there is not any more, you just give me your name, your address, and I'll just. Maybe you address, and I'll just sign over to you. Okay, challenges. This is probably the most important slide in my presentation because this is actually I try to gather or to list all the challenges that we have been facing since the beginning of COLAB in Omega 27. So, here we go. When it comes to research, as you have understood, it's a very multidisciplinary center. We have people Disciplinary center. We have people from physics, people from chemistry, people from reservoir engineering. So we need to understand each other when people talk to each other and this takes time because each discipline has its own language. And the scientific advisor needs to cover all disciplines, otherwise there is a risk of misunderstanding, and this happened actually. But when it comes to research, I prefer that you prefer to leave the words to my I prefer to leave the worst to my colleagues because I don't work with research. So I am more going to talk about organization because this is my theory actually. So when we started to move together, Porlab, people from the different departments, then we had some departments complaining that we were splitting their working environments. And I wrote in Italians here what exactly I heard. And I didn't hear it just. And I didn't hear it just once. So we were stealing their people. But it didn't happen like this at all. I mean, people want to join us, they want to collaborate with us, and some of them want to sit with us. But then sometimes their own departments are not very willing to do that. We have to fight this. Yes, and you have seen as well that both institutions, Enteli and the University of Oslo, needs to. And the University of Oslo needs to come with some own contribution. And the own contribution usually is some PhD students or some postdocs who are internally financed. And so what I heard at the beginning, sorry, and each department has a kind of fixed budget with own financing, PhD offers. PhD or postdocs, which means that since Antenue has to give a certain number of positions to Pollab, it means that there is less positions for the departments. And so I heard this a few times, that we are stealing or that we are taking our internally financed PhD. So something to fight against. Yeah, so the risk actually is that each department behind the PhD. Actually, is that each department defends its own interest instead of all that's interesting staffing plan? Some HR rules may differ between the faculties. So yeah, some professors at Borlab can do some stuff and other professors cannot do it, depending on which faculty they are. So we are small per department, which means that. We are small per department, which means that we have less leverage compared to a large section. So when it comes to, for example, recruitment of academic persons, such as the professor or associate professor, usually a large section will have more power, more leverage to get this position from the faculty. But since we are small per department, then we have less leverage. When it comes to economy, it's a very complex calculation. It's a very complex calculation for the own contribution cost for each department, and I'm really happy that this is not me who did that, because it's really complicated. And we have to be careful that the financial interest must be equal between each department, because there are very concerns about this. And I am still struggling with the rental cost for our offices after seven years because how it's organized that we have people from three different We have people from three different departments at Porlab, and each department is supposed to pay for the rental cost of the office for each of these employees. And some departments try to reduce the cost. So, for example, they do not allow the people to sit with us. Or they start to complain about the list that I'm writing on. Well, still struggling after seven years. And you have to. And you have to understand too that the budget allocated to a department at the end of the year depends partly on the amount of money that this department manages to develop through externally funded projects. So more a department has money coming from outside, more budget this department will have from the university for the next year, which means that Which means that a department is not really interested to have an internally financed PhD. He will prefer to have this position financed by the Research Council of Norway. So here again we have to fight and we have to make sure that this is equal between the three departments. Here I'm speaking especially about NTAM because also it doesn't have the same follow-up. Reporting, and this is Reporting, and this is my job actually. So, it's very complex because I have to retrieve data from a bit everywhere. So, if you understand that most of the challenges that I described, they're actually linked to the fact that we are interdisciplinary center. We have another center at the Department of Physics that we call Q-Spin. Everything of Q-SPIN is organized under the Department of Physics. Is organized under the Department of Physics, and when I talked with the administrator, I really envy her life because this is so much simpler for her. Yes, but MTN is not built for interdisciplinary. I mean, the leaders, they speak very warmly about interdisciplinarity, but in reality, back it's not easy at all. If you remember, we are remember we are two faculties, three departments. So we are small in each department but we are large together. So this is what Alex used to call the curse of interdisciplinarity. Because as seen from each department, you see just the face here, but all from them is copy. So how to break the curves? This is what we have been doing with Alex for Been doing with Alex for seven years. One of them, one point, very important is that we have to sit together. This is one of the most important. And this is actually a requirement from the Research Council of Norway. I'm sorry, I just found this slide from the Research Council of Norway in Norwegian, but I can proceed for you. They write here for the host institution, that is Fantené, physical. A physical location, not a loose national network. It's very clear. Several routes need to be co-located. The research consider Norway understood this very well. So how do we do? If you take Oslo, this overlap node in Oslo, Orlab is located under the Njorde centre, which is already by itself a cross disciplinary geoscience physics centre. Geoscience Physics Center. So they managed to do it really well. They have no problem with that. But at Antieny, it's not that easy. You have three departments, and physics, chemistry, and geoscience and petrolio. And we sit here in this building at the second floor. This is a schema of our offices. So you have two meeting rooms. This is all the offices. They are quite small. All the offices, they are quite small, but big enough. We have a library, we have a ping-pong table, very important. But the most important, this is this room. This is what we call the common room. And the common room, you have a very big table, you have some kitchen facilities. We organize all the lectures in this room. We have the coffee breaks, lunch. Lunch, students having pizza, playing games or whatever. And what is important, we always have a few thousand piece puzzle on this table. So as soon as one is finished, then we start another one. And you have a nice picture of Erika. We see her very happy that she finished the puzzle. Okay, when it comes to ERP. You have two types of hierarchy. You have hierarchy between disciplines and between parallel legals. In Norway, we hate hierarchy. Absolutely. So, how do we do to break it? We have a random placement of people, which means that whatever... So whatever it's physics, chemistry, breathal warning. Chemistry, reservoir engineering, PhD student, a master, whatever, it's placed completely randomly. And we have an open door policy, especially for the PI, the minutes, okay, well, I'll have to go back, especially for the professors, such that they're available for the students when they need it. This is actually This is actually the way how it's coming from a book from Rasmussen. This is a Danish writer and he wrote a book, Potunschegenza, where he stands that you can have two types of organization. The first one that he calls the rocket, you have the main leader, the boss, usually an officer with a very high competence within certain Competence within certain disciplines, important co-workers which will be typically associate professors or senior researchers, and then a group of PhD students and postdocs. This is a scheme which is very efficient, lean, and focused. The second one that he calls the Star Club, where you have a group of seniors. Group of seniors, this organization is, we have a group of senior people that share the management tasks. And there is a joint responsibility on a common infrastructure. And this model, you have each senior who gather for some research projects, and then they can change according to the research project, or they can belong to a few groups, actually. So this model is very flexible. Very flexible. And this is actually how Parliament is organized. Scientific leadership. This is the third point. There must be a vision. And the leader's main task, the role of Alex here, is to ensure that the research approaches the vision. So how we do that? By consensus view. And all important decisions are made by the PI, PI, this is principal investigator, a group, and we meet every second. Group, and we meet every second week. So, summary, what you need if you want to develop a center of excellence. This is our advices, what you need for a smooth running interdisciplinary center. The first one, a clear vision followed by all. See together to secure collaboration across departments and attractiveness to international visiting scientists. The full support of the leadership at department and faculty levels. Department and faculty levels, and this is here that we struggle the most. I would say some departments are very happy, some others less. And the staffing plan, that the new position and replacements for position must be secured by the institutions. And the ownership is critical for the administration to run properly. And this is more on my side because things OLAB is organized administratively. OLAB is organized administratively under the Department of Physics. I can feel that the administration at physics really have this sense of ownership of OLAR. And this is very important, because then we get all the backup, all the services that we need. And organization of center is a very important criterion. So I have two examples. This is the Research Council of Sweden. Of Sweden, and they have the same type of program, Center of Excellence, but in Sweden, and it's organized like in Norway with two rounds. And the first round, the assessment, is on management and organization, merits of the applicant, and feasibility. So you see that they don't really go in details in research yet. They check first that the management and organization is in place. And the same with the research. And the same with the Research Council of Norway. The first step, members of the assessment committee must have a broad research experience, so we are not speaking about a detailed research, and with experience from management. So here again, they focus entirely on management and organization. The goal of Polab for the next three years is to have a POLAT two point zero. Is to have a product two point zero. Yes, of course, we want to continue ten additional years. So we are working now to develop a new center of excellence proposal for the next call, which is coming in the fall 2025. If plan A doesn't work, then we want to develop a center which is similar to the Newt Center at the University of Oslo. We need to maintain the integrated interdisciplinary aspect of the center, so it's absolutely crucial that we continue. So, it's absolutely crucial that we continue sitting together. Secure an international share in theoretical physics to be hired already in 2025. This is to replace ALEX. Develop additional external funded projects and expand the core research themes in the more applied directions while keeping the main fundamental research profile. Sorry. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's time for questions. So, you've co-located for offices, but you didn't mention about lab space and experimental space. Are they still spread out in the department? Yeah, the building that I showed, this is only the offices, but we have laboratories as well. The laboratory for the True Reservoir is located in Northern. Is located in Northern Pity and the laboratory for the Edit is also located in North Park.
