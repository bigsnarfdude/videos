This is a joint work with my student, which actually sits there, Tanadun Kung Kum. And so, how to move actually? Oh, this one. Okay, so this is what I'm going to tell you today. I'm going to start from the basic things like this action principle and then how to construct the propagator into standard. In the standard way, and talking about intecurability in the context of multi-dimensional consistency, which actually I believe that you know more or less from the at the beginning of the day, right, about this notion of multi-dimensional consistency here. And I'm going to talk about well, black energy in one form and its causal relation. And then the main topic is I'm going to. Topic is: I'm going to give you a multi-term propagator for the continuous case, right? And then I'm going to give you from that new object, we're going to give you a criteria for the integrity, and then I give you a summary. All right. Okay. Sorry. All right. So, this from the standard mechanics, you know that actually you. You know that actually you have a system, you have what we call configuration space, right? And so your system will go from the first point to the second point on that space, which actually we're going to follow a part that we call classical part, right? That which actually that part is give us, actually we can find that part with the critical condition of the actual. Critical condition of the action, right? And then we get what we know actually the Euler-Logong equation. Okay, that is a very basic thing in this context, which is actually classical. We have only one true path connected to a different point on this configuration space. But when we move to the quantum level, I think, well, we have here the new. Well, we have here the new object, which actually we call the propagator here, which actually you can construct the propagator from the Tamiversion operator, right? And so in the quadratic Hamiltonian, I would say, so we can derive actually your propagator can be explained in that this form. Okay, we should, this is a fancy L. We should. This is a fancy lead. We should nothing that you have to take in all possible paths that actually start from this point to that point. That's it. Okay. Right. That we have to keep in mind that actually we can expand the propagator in this way as well. In the case of the product of the Hamiltonian. That is the thing. And so, well, next, I'm going to talk about this. So, I'm going to talk about the standard notion of the integability, and you know, we call it the UU Nano theorem, right? So, in this context, if we have a Hamiltonian system, and you can find a set of invariants, right, which is actually in evolution and independent to each other, right? And there must exist a set of action angle variables, right? And then with this existence of Is existent of set of action accumul variable, you can say that your system can be solved by poor data, which means that your system is integrable, right? Yeah. And so the main feature in this context, we call it the Hamiltonian computing flows, right? Okay, so normally we're going to treat this setup invariance as a set of Hamiltonian. Invariants have a set of Hamiltons here, right? And we knew that this we call Hamiltonian halokey equipped with this property that actually coming from this one in Bausion here. And so if we understand that structure, we know that actually the Hamiltonian is like a term generator. If you have this function that I call dot, actually. This function that I call dot actually defines on this cotangent bundle, right? And then if you compute the Poisson bracket between this object and the Peter Hamiltonian, you will get the time derivative between object right here. Then in the context of multi-term, then here we're going to have more or less the same, but we have, well, if this f is a function actually defined on this cotangent bundle here, and then we can find that actually. And then we can find actually, we have these two equations, and then we can find the second derivative, right? And then we find the difference of these two quantities, right? And then we turn out that actually at the end, after we apply the Jacobi identity, we get this quantity that actually involution of the Hamiltonians. Then we get the actually the order of the time evolution doesn't matter in this. Of the time evolution doesn't matter in this case, right? Yeah, and so in the well, in the context, if you would like to express this whole thing in terms of the Hamiltonian vector field, right, you're going to, you can express thing in this way. So it means that, so this whole quantity here, the whole equation here is nothing but this relation. I mean, the bracket of the I mean, the bracket of the different Hamiltonian vector fields acting on this function equal to zero, which means that so if you look at on this cotangent bundle, if you start from this point, right, it doesn't matter, you go this way and up, it's going to be the same that you go this way and go to this one. This means that you complete your parallel games in descent. So Okay, so now we move to the context of the Lagang genes. So, well, previously I gave you that actually we have a set of Hamiltonians, right? And it means that it must be a set of Lagangian associated with that set of Hamiltonian. We should actually this one. Technically, we can solve. Technically, we can solve this lag angle by applying not the standard junction formation, but a bit tricky one. And so now the action functional can be written in this form, which actually this fancy L is nothing but the one form, and this gamma is a part defied on spatial time variable. Okay. And so, well, So, well, so we're going to look at the critical condition on this action, which actually we have to layer. So, if we impose this condition on the space of time variable, we're going to get this quantity to form object here, which is nothing but the quaut form of quauti relation here. But in another layer, you're going to get what. Get what we call generalized Euler-LauBrown equation, but I haven't put here. Okay. So it means that with having this culture relation, it means that on the sphere of time variable here, you can take any part actually from the beginning to the end. It doesn't matter your action is invariant. Is invariance that you're talking, okay? And so I give you this very important example of the integrable system called collojio-mosa system, which is the one that I did study for my PhD and construct the Lagang multi-form, a one-form structure from this particular system. But the point is that if you look at this hierarchy. You look at this hierarchy of the Hamiltonian cathode, you're going to see that the first one is just total momentum, and the second one is a standard one, right? The quadratic of the P. And beyond the second one, then you are not in the realm of the quadratic anymore. So you get P cubed here, and then you keep going further, and you get higher power of the P. Then the question is that how to, well, if you want to. How to well, if you want to construct the propagator, that might be a bit tricky. Okay, anyway, with this Hamiltonian, we have also a set of Lacanjin, which is actually when I did derive this set of Lacankian, I did derive it from the KDB system, I believe. And then we perform the content limit. The we perform the content limit, and then we get this set of lag anchor. And later, we realize that actually we can construct what we call a Lejeune transformation for the formation. And then we get a set of this block engine here. All right. And then again, so well, the first one, we don't have the lag engines for the first one because the first Hamiltonian we can. First Hamiltonian, uh, we cannot apply the Le Jong Kan formation, right? It's not applicable. Um, then we start with the second one here. This is actually the standard one, and this is the third one. It looks very messy here. Anyway, we have this. So, as you probably see in the morning, Frank mentioned that actually he proposed this kind of new object that. Kind of new object with the populator here 10 years ago, I believe, at Newton Institute. Actually, with this new structure of the Lagankian one form, the propagator that we should have, it should take or possibly not only possible for the space. For the spatial part, but also for the temporal part, as well. And I believe that it means that so dependent and independent variables are treated on the same equal footing. We should correct me if I'm wrong. This idea more or less related to the one that actually the overlay, even in this year. In this year, because he tried to generalize the idea to actually try to treat Q and T on the same equal footing, then he introduced a new variable, a new parameterized variable right here. And then he got a new set of variables called Xn, which is actually nothing but the Q and T. And by doing this, his action will become. Action will become this one, and then the Lagang Jian standard one going to be this one. And later, he, well, at the end, he ends up with this kind of thing, going to have to taking care of the possible other queue or and all possible other time as well, and in this way. And so, and later, um, the work by um Stephen and Frank again for the Frank again for the for the this KDV and they impose a periodic reduction, which it actually you heard a little bit about this from Jacob's talk in the morning, I believe. And then they end up with this kind of two disk time harmonic oscillator, and then they can show that actually with the disk propagator that. This kit propagator that they got here, they possess the PAR independent feature. They should actually, they call this feature like I took a top-up thing on the standard Washington principle. They call this is a quantum version of the Washington principle. Okay. And from this work, what we did try to do is to try to extend the idea to the continuous case. idea to the continuous case. So first I give you a definition of the multi-town propagator for the continuous case here. So here is Laguna chain one form and we have also introduced actually the S we should actually parameterize time parameters variable right and then we can find out And then we can find out that actually for this, the multi-sam propagator can be written in this way. And so actually this whole thing a bit is not look like what Flank proposed because we don't have that kind of separate between Of the separate between Q and T, but I think they are share more or less the same because we have to take care all possible parts of the Q and T as well in this fan CD here. Okay. So let me give you the definition of the fan CD, which it actually looks a little bit mess, not really a bit, but very mess. Really mess, but I think I'm going to show you for the simple case how to derive this fancy D here. So we start with the 2D space here, is T1, T2, right? Yeah. And so we say that actually, if we consider the part, actually the horizontal part here, we can write a propagator in this. Can write your propagator in this way. We can do the same for the vertical part here. And so, first, we're going to consider the part in this configuration, which I call gamma, which belongs to this fancy one, right here. And you can see that actually the propagator in this situation is nothing but the propagator from this point to this point, and then you have to integrate this. And then you have to integrate this corner point, and you go up there. Then you have this is a corner point here, right? And then this is all the propagator that we have here. And so, but we can simply rewritten our whole thing into this way. Actually, this whole bunch of thing here can be put simply in this, like this gamma actually belongs to B1. Actually, it belongs to B1. And this B1, actually, there is only one configuration in this case. And so next, we're going to consider, we should actually, this kind of part in 2D space, we should actually, again, I call gamma here, but I say that this gamma belong to a new kind of a new family they call B2 here. Why is that? Because actually, Why is that? Because actually, you can move the vertical line here from this side and to this side, right? This means that if you move this vertical line from to the right up to this battery, you're going to get K1 previously, right? But for an at arbitrary point here, N1, 0 here, you're going to have extra terms. You're going to have extra term that's coming out here, right? And so, again, we find out that actually we can simplify this whole thing together. We should actually put this into just a single equation and say that actually now gamma is belong to the family of B1 and B2. Now, all right. And d2 now, all right, because the because the first term, um, as I mentioned, oops, okay, oops, sorry, as I mentioned, the first term is nothing but the k1, right? And yeah, that is the reason why we can compact it, compactify it, and then make it shorter. And so we keep going with a bit more complicated structure here. Structure here. All right. And again, I can call gamma here is actually a new type of part that actually belongs to this set of a new family B3. Yeah. And so we can write out the propagator in this situation, which it actually has three terms. I believe the first one, the second one, and the third one. Okay. And so again, by doing By doing the same trick, we can simplify this whole complicated thing into this very shorter one, I believe. And then we say that the part that actually we consider now is belong to the V1, V2, and V3. By keep doing this, we're going to have much more complicated Complicated equations, I believe. And then, but we're going to find a way actually there's some kind of structure that we can simplify it. And then at the end, so you go like, oh, K5 and this one. And then at the end, you're going to have I call K all possible part actually, like this gamma. That this gamma it belongs to all possible families of the B in this 2D space here. And we put this n back to make sure that our propagator is normalized, right? In the case of we have to satisfy the probability condition. Okay, it's not finished yet because what we did is just a halfway because what we did is we start to procreate. start to to to progress the term in in the t1 first right and then you go up in the t2 actually we can do the same or the same trick with if we start with the t2 right here and then go go go to the right to this point this means that we're going to get more or less the same with it you can interchange just t1 and g2 and then you will get a complete of the d in this situation Of the D in this situation, this means that you have to add another term that coming from the D21. All right. So this is what we had in 2D case space. Okay. For a definition of this fancy d so what we did here is that actually we trying to put infinity into infinity because Infinity into infinity because the standard notion of the fancy contain infinity already, right? But the way that we did the way that we did to construct this all possible part on the time space that we try to put all possible part, all possible infinity, again, into this context. I'm not sure that you. I'm not sure that you clicked this one. Okay, but that is the way that we did actually. And so, okay. Then, so with actually, you know that actually with this normally with this structure of the propagator, we cannot do anything because we need to apply the semi-classical approximation, right, to get in order to get the. Right, to get in order to get the exact form of the propagator. So then, is that what we did next here? So we consider, well, we put our propagator back into the single term with the variable s here. And then we perform the And then we perform the semi-classical approximation right here. And this Q is nothing but the fluctuation around the classical part here. And if you look at this carefully, this Q is in the quadratic form, then you can integrate out exactly. And so if you look at this carefully again, this fake is also. Again, this trick is also mentioned in the Andrew talk when he did try to construct his partition function, right? Actually involved with this Lagungian business here. Anyway, then we're going to look at this particular Look at this particular part actually, and then what is the Q look like? So, if you look at this carefully, the Q can be expressed in this way, which is actually more or less with the standard form that we had. But, well, it's contained multi-term here. All right. Okay, so now we're going to look at the condition for integability. So, we have a theorem here. So, we have a theorem here. So, again, so we say that with this set of Lag engine, one form actually will satisfy the Cauchy relation. All right, so the propagator for this kind of loop part going to has to be identity, right? It means that for the loop part, it does not contribute to the propagator. To the propagator for the evolution of your system. Okay. Right. So now we're going to give you a proof. So we're going to start to prove by recalling this relation that I call K gamma here, which is gamma is the part that connects between two points on the space of time, right here. Right here, and we know that actually this Q gamma can be written in this way, and we have another part which is actually sharing the same endpoints, all right. And so we have this one, and then we have Q demo pan here. And we know that with the closure relation, the difference between these two, then we get, we can retain the difference between. Tend the difference between this two actions in this way, which is nothing but the closed cellulation, then well, we get there is no difference of the action. Then this means that since there is no difference of the action, this means that this Q gamma and Q gamma paper must be the same. This means that your propagator is the same for the gamma and gamma pa. That is the thing. So this means that for the loop. That this means that for the loop one, so you're going to get the identity, right? So, next, um, this is for the loop part, actually. We're going to we consider this the whole object here, which is this is called the loop one. And so, actually, look a bit, this is nothing but the queue, actually, two queue together, and this is for the loop integration. And this is for the loop integration. And so, because we have a part-independent feature, right? If you look at this, you can try to rewrite this whole thing in this way. And it turned out that actually can be put in this simple form. And once you put this whole thing back into this exponential here, you're going to get the delta deductible. The delta DAC delta equation, yeah, the D-Dact delta function, and it turned out that actually it declared of the D-Dak Delta function gives you nothing but identity. Then that is a finished proof, actually. Okay, this look a bit abstract. Let me give you a concrete example that we can do. This I recall again the result from I recall again the result from Stephen and Frank papers, actually, these two term harmonic oscillators. And so the quantity that we're going to compute is the exponential is this whole term actually in the Q function right here. function right here, which it actually involves the fluctuation from the classical part here, the y here, which it can be rewritten in this form for this particular systems. And this means that for the q gamma in this in this system can be put in this way. All right. And so what we're going to do next is we do the We do indicating by parts, and then we get this one. And then so we're going to start by looking at this part we call gamma A. This part, then we can say that actually this fluctuation can be put in this form because this can be, because this satisfy the boundary condition, right? If you put the boundary condition, it satisfies, and then you say. And then you say you can find that actually they also possess an orthogonal orthogonal property here as well. And then you have this one and you put this Y into the Q gamma, you can compute the Q gamma in can be the Q gamma can be reduced to be very simple form in this way. And next we go into And next, we go into consider a part gamma B. We should actually go out first and then go to the right. Okay. And for this part again, fortunately, they share still this we stand, we can still use the same y that we used previously because they do share the same boundary condition. And then again, when you put this y into the qamma function. This wild into the q gamma function, you get exactly the same with it with the with the gamma b, gamma a. That is the thing. All right. And then, so next we're going to consider a much more complicated, a bit more complicated part, they call gamma C here, which is actually the fluctuation can be explained in this way that actually. And then, anyway, when you put this. Anyway, when you put this y into the q function, it turns out that actually you get exactly the same with the gamma a and gamma b right here. So it means that so now with this different tile part on the spread of time, you have the same q function or the fluctuation here and also the same action. It means that your propagator is part independent somehow on this one. On this one, because I have a part independent feature. Okay. And that's it. And so let me give you a summarize. So what we have here is a kind of a new feature that actually Flank calls a quantum variation, a kind of on top feature from the standard variation, right? Because we have a set. That they call the sphere of Lagang, that will have there must be a kind of special set of Lagangi that pay a role for the cutical propagator that then make your propagator a process a part independent feature somehow. Okay, and so and then we find out that actually we have the same for the same in the in the disk it came. The same in the in the disk case here, they find that actually the loop part does not contribute to the part. We also find the same exactly the same for the continuous scale that actually the loop part does contribute, does not contribute here. And so, what about beyond the quadratic case? This is my speculation from this paper. From this paper, there might be, it seems there might be a way to do the integration beyond the quadratic one. And then I would say that this means that there might be a way that we can construct the propagator, which is actually from beyond the quadratic one, but this fancy might be different from the standard one. That is the thing that. That's all of my talk. Thank you very much.
