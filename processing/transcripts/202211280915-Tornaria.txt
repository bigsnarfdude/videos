Okay, thank you very much. Grand Place Tara Ga. It's a pleasure to be here. This is my first travel after the pandemics. And I was thinking, it turns out my last travel before the pandemics was coming here in 2019. So it's a beautiful place. You know, the idea. You know, the idea of coming here helped me overcome the inertia of not traveling anymore. So I'm very happy. Okay, so I want to talk about, I give a catchy title. I hope it's a catchy title. It's not the actual title of our paper, but it is the hidden title of our paper. Hidden title of our paper: The Basis Problem for Paramodular Forms. So, when we say the basis problem, we think of Eichler in the 50s and then later on, he was concerned of how to find bases of classical modular forms, which were special in some sense. In some sense, and allow and were useful to compute classical modular forms. And he accomplished this by using Brand matrices and quaternionic modular forms. And this, in a way, his work led to the Jacques-Anglands correspondence, which I like to call the Eichler-Jacquel Anglans correspondence, because really, really, really, Because really, really, really, this started with Eichler or Brandt himself. And in the classical setting, this works very beautiful because eigenvalues are the same as Fourier coefficients, whereas that's not quite true in general. So that's what I think in the abstract I use the word partial. word partial that's part of the partial in the in the in the abstract we we really deal so it's kind of a fake basis of paramodular forms because what we are going to show is how to construct a basis of some space with the same eigenvalues as paramodular forms. But the main point is that we are able to identify all paramodular forms subject to Subject to a restriction on the weight. So that's the reason of this catchy title. So I'll try to be not very technical on this, but please feel free to talk to me and look at the paper. The paper is in the archive. I was accepted last Friday on MatCon. Last Friday on MatComp. So it has a, it's very technical about proving isomorphisms between orthogonal modular forms and paramodular forms, but then it also has a very computational flavor. So it's both sides of the thing. So let's start here. So the main goal of the talk today is to explain how to use this orthography. How to use these orthogonal modular forms to partially, as I say, solve the basis problem for paramodular form. And later, the second part is an interesting application is to prove congruences of eigenvalues of siegel modular forms of different types. Some types had already been proved, but then there are some types of congruences that are more. Of congruences that are more elusive in a sense. And it turns out that a particular feature of orthogonal modular forms, which at the beginning seems like a nuisance, turns out to be the key. So something that, you know, when you encounter the first time, you say, oh, this is just bothering me. But then it helps us. So that's the story. That's the story. So, as I say, I will start giving a review of orthogonal modular forms, in particular in the case of SO5, five-dimensional. But I've been working for a long time on even dimension three modular forms, orthogonal modular forms, because those give an insight and a way to get into Shimura correspondence and modular forms of half-integer weight. Forms of half integer weights. So they are interesting in that sense. And then, well, I'll focus on dimension five for this talk. And this, the way everything gets connected, it's due to recent work. So I see if I can. This is so funny. I could do this all day. Anyway. Anyway, so Rama, Gustavo Rama, is a student of mine. He graduated a couple of years ago, and we started doing this computationally, just computationally and getting conjectures. And we have a paper in ANDS 2020, New Zealand, virtual New Zealand. And then we were like, well, we are not going to be able to prove this. We are not going to be able to prove this. It's very hard. And then Rosner and Weis Hauber published this beautiful, wonderful paper, which is the sort of analog of Jacqueline Langlands for GSP4, connecting modular forms for the standard GSP4 and the compact twist of GSP4. And then we say, well, then the thing that you need to connect to orthogonal models. To connect to orthogonal modular forms is to go back from you know GUB to orthogonal modular forms, and we sort of know how to do that from the case of dimension three and iClear ideas. So we started doing this with Neil Dominum and Ariel Paceti. So, in fact, we started doing this, and Neil was doing the same, Ariel. So, we all So we all worked together and got a much better paper out of all this. So our theorem is the following. This is very much more precise, but this is a high level way of stating it. Paramodular eigenforms of weights starting at three, even J, so this is a vector modular forms, and certain levels. And a certain level, the level needs to have a prime to first power, just like in the classical Eichler correspondence. These paramodular forms, they all correspond to orthogonal modular forms, meaning we can compute all these paramodular forms via this, and we can be sure we have computed a complete table of paramodular forms. And this is the key feature. This is the key feature that I say it felt like a nuisance, but it's actually a gold sand. Orthogonal modular forms also include forms of Yoshida type. And you know, representations of Yoshida type do not contain paramodular vectors. So they will not show up as paramodular forms. So they are like, oh, this is just bothering me. We're finding these guys that we don't. finding these these guys that we don't we are not interested in them but then they help us connect and get the congruences so that's uh you will see if you if you've heard of the paramodular conjecture you know abelian surfaces should correspond to paramodular forms of weight two unfortunately then this is kind of disappointing but you know Pointing, but you know, unlike the classical case where elliptic curves correspond to weight two, weight two is comological. Well, in GSP4, only weight three and up are homological, and we cannot hope to get weight two using these methods. Okay, and the second part I already said is that the key ingredient for congruences is the unexpected appearance of Yoshida lifts. Of Yoshida lifts. Okay, let me talk about orthogonal modular forms. So, suppose you have a lattice and some quadratic space, a definite quadratic space, that's the point. Let's agree everything is over Q. Most of our methods are local. This is purely a local computation. So, there's really no abstraction other than actually sitting down and write the. And write the stuff to do this over arbitrary fields, at least totally real, let's say. So an orthogonal modular form of level L is in a simplified way, the trivial weight. It's just a function on the finite set of equivalent classes of lattices in the genus of L. So you take your favorite lattice, you know how. Lattice, you don't have to impose anything on this lattice. You have your lattice, you look at the genus of this lattice, and you just construct it, you think of the formal linear combinations of them. So this is, well, I'm thinking here as functions. And well, there's an action of Hecke operators in this space, which is given by Nesser neighboring operators. So here I'm just saying, well, you have a lattice lambda or a class. Have a lattice lambda or a class of a lattice lambda, and you want to. I want to explain how TP works. So, you just look at the neighbors, which are so the neighbor of lambda are all the lattices pi such that the intersection is order p in in the two. So, that's that's the neighboring. And this is this is TP1, which for dimension three is enough. For dimension five, you need another hecupretor, but whatever you. Later, but whatever, you just do the same. The intersection has to have index p square, but then you have to ask for the quotient to be cyclic or something, whatever. And of course, this will just give us way three, but you can replace C here. Sorry. Here. I'm not sure I like this. I'm not sure I like this. You can replace C there by a representation, and then your functions are just invariant under this, like this. So instead of being invariant in classes, you just transform this way and everything works. And then you just look at the classical representation theory of SOV and you figure out all the representations and it turns out Figure out all the representations, and it turns out you can get all the weights I claim by doing this. So I'll stick to the C just to avoid technicalities, but this is not the hard part. Okay, that's the main idea. Let me recall the case of SO3. In the case of dimension three, this is very, very well studied. This is very, very well started. This is what I say started with Brandt and Eichler correspondence. And in fact, if you're given a quadratic space of dimension three, you look at the Clifford algebra. This is standard construction, gives you an algebra. Dimension eight, it's not a central algebra, but if you just take the even part, you get a The even part, you get an algebra of dimension four, and that's a quaternion algebra called B here, the even Clifford algebra. And right, the orthogonal group is just the projective units of the quaternion algebra. Okay, so this is just, you know, if B is just an indefinite. Is just indefinite or over R, whatever. This is just an instance of this exotic isomorphism, you know, this isomorphism between SO3 and GL2 or something, or PGL2, or whatever. Okay, and if you use this iso. This is no, it doesn't get like well, sorry. If you just use these isomorphisms, you know, going from B, you have to think of this as a map from B cross to S O of B. Using this map, you can relate orthogonal modular forms, modular forms for this group with modular forms for this group with central, trivial central. Group with central, trivial central character. And then blah, blah, blah, Icluk correspondence. There's a beautiful paper of Birch in 1988 in, I think it was published in a conference in Lumini, I'm not sure, where he does this for computation. He says, you know, this is a moment where we're trying to compute, people are trying to compute modular forms. Trying to compute modular forms, making tables, huge tables, and there's this, I guess, this, well, sort of parallel to the modular symbol revolution. And this is a way to compute. And it's funny, Bert says, well, this program spits out numbers so quickly that you cannot even process these numbers. And I actually got the secret. I actually got the C code from this program. John Cremona gave it to me. I actually still compiles. You compile and you run. And it uses 32-bit integers. So it will compute everything that it can possibly be computed with this size of integers in like two seconds or something. So it's very interesting. There's a limitation that, in principle, That in principle, you can only use this to compute modular forms with sine plus one in the functional equation. That's sort of a limitation of how these things work. It has to do with the way of this mapping from B cross to SOB goes, but we know how to fix that. So the idea is, I've been working on this. Since my thesis, I gave some ideas and we developed this during the years. You can actually take characters on this group, this is the discrete group, and compute the whole space. So this is a very, very, very satisfactory answer to this. To this, and yeah. Um, anyway, it is a very, very quick way to compute model classical modular forms of every level except perfect square levels. Anyway, so back to five. Um, so in the case of dimension five, there's still a particular isomorphism. There's still a particular isomorphism that we like. And in this case, so space of dimension five, the Clifford algebra has dimension two to the five is 32. If you take the even part, which is central, it's dimension 16. It turns out to be M2 of B. I mean, we know how to classify algebras, right? So it has to be. Algebra's right, so it has to be something like that, and the actually the um this so v is really it's again a quotient like like before, just using gu2 instead of well you can think b cross is just gu1. So and so anyway, this is the compact. This is the compact twist of GSP4 I was talking about. And I guess that's where, you know, here is where, again, there's a special isomorphism between groups. This doesn't work for n equals to seven. So this is sort of the end of the story, or maybe not, because there are some others interesting groups of rank seven, whatever. Whatever. So, and a very, very precise analog of Eichler, Jackie Langlands, as I say, I like to call it that way. But that's just what everybody calls Jackie Langlands. This was conjectured by Ibuki Yama. Yama has a series of very, very, very nice papers where he works from the theoretical. you know from theoretical to the the actual very explicit this is it's it's uh it's it's very very very beautiful and uh he has a very precise conjecture for prime levels and then later he he wrote another paper with ibukiyama uh with uh kitayama sorry for extending this for square free levels and uh this this really relates he conjectures a very He conjectures a very specific relation between paramodular forms and modular forms for G2 of P. And he actually computes, he actually proves that dimension formula on both sides and the formulas match. So that's a big evidence in my book. Well, you only have to do the same for other heck operators than the identity, and then you win, but whatever. Anyway. Whatever. Anyway, as I mentioned in the introduction, the conjecture was recently proven by Rosen and Waifauer. And so, and they prove it for square-free levels. Let me say, just because Ibuki-Jama conjecture is stated for square-free levels. I say we extend it to more general levels, but it's still really their theorem. I mean, we should. Really, their theorem. I mean, we just took what they did and we just brought it down. I mean, it's not, that's not the merit on our work. Our work is on the other part, right? But still, we wrote it in the paper. It's written precisely what's the correspondence, what's the generalization of Ibukijama conjecture and proved using Rosner-Bay-Sauer methods. Okay. I mean, so everything is local. The point is, everything is local. And, you know, as in the Jackie Langlands case, you know, there are two cases, you know, the case where you jump from a quaternion algebra split to one which is ramified, and the case where you just don't change the quaternion algebra. And in the case, you know, locally, if you don't change the quaternion algebra, nothing changes. quaternion algebra nothing changes locally of course and so everything happens in the in the primes where you where you change your quaternion algebra and the the condition we impose at least for now is that the level has to be p at the primes where we change the quaternion algebra so you can imagine it i mean it's really just picking up whatever they do locally at these primes uh and and And putting all together. Okay. So that's kind of a limitation. On our side, there's also an issue. It's not completely obvious how to extend this to levels other than P, but we think the same as in the classical situation of Eichler, you know, going from level P to level PQ or P5, you know, odd powers of P should. Know odd powers of p should be okay, but whatever. So, and as I say, our main contribution is really the connection between modular forms for this and modular forms for this. That's our part. So there's two steps. One step is Rosner-based hour and the other step is our. Okay, so how does this work? So how does this work? So as I say, fix a level n and pick up a random prime. Well, not random, a prime that appears with power one. Okay, I'll do everything like this. And then for computational purposes, maybe n is a product of, maybe n is square free and has a lot of primes. So you can pick a different quaternion algebra if you want, and everything works. It's just for the sake of the. Works. It's just for the sake of the argument. This is enough. A and B are parameters for the representation. So you can ignore, you can think A and B are zero if you want, but it's just to get a more general statement. So you look at the quaternion altrui at P and infinity, and of course, that's the reason we need a prime p for fields of, you know, for totally real. Fields of you know for totally real fields of even degree, then there's no problem. You can just take the quaternion algebra of discriminant one. And so this is Rosney-Bay-Sauer theorem. There is actually, there's actually this K of N. I'm not going to explain what it is, but there's a particular discrete subgroup such that the paramodular forms. That the paramodular forms of wave 3 plus v, a minus v, this is the scalar part, and this is just the vector part. So if a equals b, then these are just regular scalar valued modular forms, and otherwise you get vector valued. And if A and B are zero, then you get weight three. And these paramodar forms correspond to modular forms of G. To modular forms of GU2 of B of level K of N and this weight A, B. Okay, so K of N, you know, the notation is at the primes where B is split, then GU2 of B is just GSP4, and K of N is just the paramodular group. So the thing is, well, at the primes ramified where B ramifies. Ramified where P ramifies, K of n is a different thing. And here's the connection. Okay, this works beautifully as a bisection for P new forms of general type. Forms of Cytokurokawa type appear on both sides. We know, you know, this Gritsenko lift gives paramodular forms of Cytokurokawa type, and they also show up on the side. up on the on the on the side of gu2b and then on the side of gu2b you also catch yoshida uh types okay um well again the the the details are on the paper or you can ask me but kfn is given explicitly as a stabilizer of certain lattice um this is given by bookiyama right By Boogiyama, right? And okay, we will then identify M2 of B with the even Clifford algebra of quadratic space. You know, the fact that the primes where B ramifies or doesn't correspond to the primes where the Hase-bit invariant of V is minus one or plus one, except there. Or plus one, except there are like a zillion different definitions of the Hasevit invariant, and only one matches that, and it's the one that Lam calls the Clifford invariant, because just to make sure, you know, he changed. But anyway, that's what we meant. You know, the Clifford invariant is just take your space, construct the Clifford algebra, and look at the Brouwer. The Brower invariant. Anyway. So there's this correspondence. So you, you know, if you started with B, you can construct, if you started with the quaternion algebra, you can construct the space and get this isomorphism. And there is a special lattice in V which maps to this guy, but it's not quite K of M. Quite K of n. It's not quite K of N. This L, it's a bit larger. And that's the reason why, you know, same thing happens in three, and that's the reason why Birch picks only forms with plus sign in the functional equation, because the latter is a little bit too large, but it doesn't really matter because the normalizer and this. And this question is kind of ambilian, and you can actually get characters that will cut out the pieces you want, and then you recover other signs. So that works. And so here's I'm presenting the theorem, and I'll move to the applications. So we have to assume A and B are the same party. This is all This is all because of the fact that when we go down, there's this Q cross here that forces the central character to be trivial and that will force us to have particular weights. Just as in classical case, you only get even weights because it's yeah, you know, trivial central character, all weight. Central character, all weight, there's nothing so same prism, and then there's an isomorphism between these are the modular forms in that the Bronson-Bay-Sauer prove a correspondence to paramodular forms, and these are the ones we are interested in. And I should say, I mean, this is still a sort of compact group. So the same as in the classical situation, you could compute. Classical situation: you could compute quaternionic modular forms, and it's possible, and it's still a good method. But it's much, much better to work, you know, in the classical case, is working with stuff of dimension four or stuff of dimension three. It's faster to work with stuff of dimension three. Now, here is working with stuff of dimension 16 or 5. So, this is really, really, really fast from a computer. really really really fast from from a computational point of view is is it's really nice uh this fact that that the the about the normalizer again it's it's kind of a nuisance but in the end is it's it's helpful because it it really means that when you compute modular forms at this level say you you don't you don't use character then you only get a piece of this space but piece of this space but then you only get a piece of the space so and always the the hard part after you get the the matrices for the for the heckebretters is to factor them you know compute the characteristic polynomial factor the characteristic polynomial compute kernels what and you know if your method already gives you a quarter of the space then that that step is easier so in that sense So, in that sense, it's useful. Anyway, so this is precisely what I stated before: the corollary from this bisection, putting together Rosen-Bay Sauer and our result. Okay? What I say, the methods are local, so this extends in a very natural way to arbitrary totally real number fields. And for even degree, Even degree, you don't care about this p because you know this p you only need. I mean, the whole point of this computation is compute in discrete spaces. So you need your quaternion altruist to be ramified at all infinity places. So if you have an even number of infinite places, then you are good. But in Q we only have one infinite place, so you need another place. And that's the reason of the restriction on the Of the restriction on the level. Okay, and as I claim, we didn't write this, but in principle, I mean, we know what are the lattices, we have to write down the details and maybe something else. And here we have to redo Rosne-Wesauer a little bit to get this case, you know, a level of P to an odd power where P ramifies in the quaternion algebra. In the quaternion algebra, that, but it should be doable. That's what we think. And for perfect square levels, it's just the same as in the classical case. You might. I mean, it still works. I mean, the beauty of this method, in some sense, from the computational point of view, is that just take a random lattice and you just do, and you will get something. And of course, And of course, you don't know what you get. I mean, you don't know if you get everything. That's the main issue. So, and that's the importance of our work, that we know we get everything. So, okay, let me give you an example and then I explain how we get congruences from this. So, this is this is, I try to be very down to earth. I don't know. I like to be. I don't know. I like to be. I hope I'm not healing the technical parts too much, but whatever. This is a particular quadratic form: five variables. Of this Kremian 61, just random prime, 61. You compute two neighbors. There are 15 neighbors. You know, if you want to compute two neighbors, you can. Two neighbors, you can look at vectors that are zeros of this quadric mod two, and there are 15 of them, because this is non-degenerate, and each one corresponds to a neighbor. And then you reduce them, and then of the 15, there are seven equivalent to Q1, four. seven equivalent to q1 for they are equivalent to q2 and four are equivalent to q3 this q1 q2 and q3 are three the here is the forms themselves this is not the the whole genus so we we keep doing this because now you compute the neighbors of q2 and then you get more quadratic more classes and uh and so on but there's a finite number of classes In number of classes in the genome. So eventually you get around and you compute everything. And in this case, it turns out there's eight classes. So, well, this comment, this spans the whole genus of Q1 because there's only one spinogenus. Spinogenus sometimes when you pick one particular HEC operator and you move around. Particular HEC operator, and you move around, then maybe you don't get the whole genus, you have to jump to a different HEC operator. But anyway, in this case, everything works beautiful. So this procedure is very easy. Computationally, this is very, very easy. Gives explicit representatives for the eight classes in the genus of Q1 and gives you the matrix. I didn't write the matrix, but here's the characteristic. matrix but here's the characteristic polynomial factor of the characteristic polynomial of t2 and will give you x but minus eigenvalue 15 eigenvalue minus seven and something irreducible the first factor is the Einstein eigenform which will always be there because you know you compute Tp there there's going to be P cube plus P squared plus P plus one P plus one neighbors, and that number is an eigenvalue of TP always, and that's just some sort of isistain factor. The third factor, the irreducible, you go and look in the LMFDB, this is the LMFDB tables labels, and you have something called 61.4.a.a, which is just a classical modular form of weight 4. Modular form of weight four happens to have coefficients in a field of degree six. And so, in fact, this, well, you could compute T3, T5, T7, and you will still get degree six factors that correspond all to the classical modular forms. So, this is really the lift, the Saitokurukawa lift. I mean, we know, we expect this. We expect this, we know this Gritsenko lift should show up here, so we know this is it. Because that's the point of proving what we expect to find. And well, but there's an extra factor x plus seven here, and there are no modular forms of weight for level 61 with rational eigenvalues. So this is something really new. It's not Agrisenko's. Something really new. It's not a Grizzenko lift. And that's what we call F61, which is the paramodular null lift of weight three and level 61. That's the first one of prime level and weight three. Anyway, so that's one way to get hands on a paramodular form of level 61. Um, suppose you want to compute what I already say, this gives us eigenvalues, it doesn't give you Fourier coefficients and is actually open. I don't know how to compute the Fourier coefficients of this form. I mean, I know there's a formula in Pur and Yuen's paper. There's actually a formula, but the formula is like, you know, take this power series in three variables, multiply all these together, then. Variables, multiply all these together, then divide by this. And then, if you're very, very smart, then you can do computation in power series in three variables, then you'll get your answer. But if you want to say compute a million Fourier coefficients, then that's kind of out of the scope. I know the first time I met David, I asked him if he could compute me a million coefficients for the form of level 277 weight. 277 weight two. You know, that's the first one in weight two. And, you know, we were having dinner. I asked him, and he just laughed at me for like 30 seconds or something like that. And so, well, I took that as a no. They had computed like 3,000 coefficients. And I say, well, can you compute a million for me? No. Anyway. For me, no, anyway, so but what we can do from the eigenvalues is compute the L function. So you want to compute the L function, you need to compute the eigenvalues of Tp1, TP1 for P up to X and T P2 for P up to square root of X. The number of The number of neighbors needed for TP1 is on the order of PQ, and this is the order of P to the fourth. So computing TP2 is just irrelevant because I only need to go TP2 up to square root of x. So it's, I can't, I can't ignore computationally. Asymptotically, I can ignore TP2. Anyway, so And this TP2 was already computed up to for P up to 100, say, by Chef Hain. It doesn't take that much. Now, computing TP1, just for the example I gave, for up to 3000, it takes six CPU months. I can compute this in five days, of course, because I have a big machine, but it's still six months. But it's still six months, it's equivalent to 30 seconds of laughter, six months equivalent to 36 seconds of laughter. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I think competing 2000 for David was equivalent to this. And yeah, 30 seconds of laughter means, I don't know, waiting for the universe to cool down or something. I don't really know. I haven't even tried to do this computation. They do, so I wouldn't have a hint. And they figured out some, this was a long time ago, and they figured out something. So still, if you want to compute something about paramodular forms, go ask them because they really know what they do. So I mean, it's not a coincidence. You look, there's lots of computation. You look, there's lots of computational papers about paramodular forms, and they are all most of them contain David and Chris because they really, really, really know how to optimize these programs. Anyway, so that's example. That's the two CPU days to compute this silly number. Anyway, anyway, I'm not having an application. I actually had an. Have an application. I actually had an application for this because we wanted to figure out some denominator in some special value in some convolution of this with something. And well, it turns out 3000 took a lot of time, but it's still, we would need like million, so it's out of scope. But anyway, that's another. That's another, as I say, open problem is to compute the Fourier coefficients, and I don't, I don't know how to do that, anyway. So, last 10 minutes, let me explain how to get congruences. What congruences we get? There are basically three types of congruences. The first type is kind of normal, easy. So, the first congruence is, I'm So, the first congruence, I'm giving the congruence for this particular example. It's this congruence, lambda p happens to be a p plus p plus p square modulus on prime, norm 43 with a weight for classical modular form. This is the one, it's the same one we saw before, the one of degree six. The one of degree six. This is a bit more different type of congruence. The first, this one is more classical, you know, the fact that you have p and p squared. You know, when you get your powers of p next to each other, then this is sort of more classical and easier. Easier. But here, this is something weird because in terms of the colour representation, it means like your colour representation splits in a kind of funny way that can only happen because four is big enough. Anyway, and Golichev was predicted, you know, just by thinking of Galois representations. By thinking of Galois representations, you say, Yeah, there has to be some congruence of this form. And then he went and then computed with Basser, and they found this example. And then he had this, and he didn't know how to prove it. And I was computing this, and he said, Can you prove this or what? Well, anyway, it still took us like two or three years to find out what, how to do this. So the first congruence, as I say, is kind of classical. As I say, it's kind of classical. It's easy in the sense that it's a congruence between a modular form, you know, F61 and a modular form of weight 4. But this modular form of weight 4 happens to have a Grisenkolift. And the Grisenkolift lives in the same space. So you have two modular forms in the same space. I'm not trivializing, but at least you have two things in the same space that. Have two things in the same space that you can try to prove they are congruence. And Apur and Juan did this. I mean, you have, you know, the whole space. So you can, you know, you only have to check a finite number of Fourier coefficients to know they are congruent, right? So whatever. And it's not many. We can also prove this using orthogonal modular forms. This was already. Modular forms. This was already proven, but well, we can do it. We already say the characteristic polynomial factors like this, and pick V0, call V0 the eigenvector here. Okay? And take V1 an eigenvector. Well, I wrote it this funny way, but it's an eigenvector for f of x. Um and 43 it happens that minus seven is a root of this by also a root of this mod 43. So, but if you look at the kernel of this plus seven mod 43, it only has dimension one. So you uh you have an eigen space. Space that it really means that the two eigenvectors, mod 43, have to be the same. Because if you look at the whole space eight-dimensional, you only have one eigenvector, mod 43, or eigenvector minus seven. But if you look at this piece, you have one. And if you look at this piece, you have one. So they have to be the same congruent mode 43. So that's the easy. And mode 43. So that's the easy part. Okay. And I rephrase this because I'll use it in the next slide. Two eigenvectors living in a space of dimension one have to have the same eigenvalue. So, and in this case, it's mod 43. So let's move to the second congruence. The second congruence works like this. Here, we don't have, in principle, we don't have in the paramodula. principle we don't have in the paramodular forms in the space of paramodular forms we don't have two things that that are that that can be made congruent but remember our orthogonal modular forms have some of these extra emissions forms coming from the oschidalists and they will help us so look at this form 37488 this is a classical modular form of weight four in principle For in principle, you look at this, this has nothing to do with the problem in hand. However, when you look at this form, this is congruent to the Eisenstein form mod 19, mod some prime 19. And so the congruence we wanted to prove was, remember, lambda p congruent to p v p plus. congruent to p v p plus one plus p cube but we've replaced one plus p cube to to this guy which is no longer an isosist you know it doesn't look like the eigenvector of an isosten series anymore it looks like the eigenvector of a eigenvalue of a weight form modular of caspital form but of course there's no paramodular form with these eigenvalues but there is an orthogonal modular form with this An orthogonal modular form with these eigenvalues, which is kind of, well, it's what you would call the Yoshida lift of this and this. And that's it. So yeah, once you realize this, this is funny because I was working with my students. It's like, oh, we have these forms. I don't know how to get rid of these because they just pop up and whatever, you know, we just figure out how to, you know, the, the, the, the, You know, the eigenvalues grow faster than they should. So you can actually see them out quickly if they bother you. But then it was like, oh yeah, this is what we want. Okay, so instead of working at level 61, we work at level 37 times 61. Blah blah, some has a bit invariant. We work as before. Work as before. Actually, M37, the sub-index here means we had to put a particular character. So, yeah, the notation is not very happy, but the 37 there refers to a character. And if you compute this space, the characteristic polynomial factors as some stupid thing, x plus 7, the agree 12, degree 211. Okay, it's very big. 11. Okay, it's very big. Okay, the first factor is at 61. We know because of the way we pick the signs, because the sign, the Hase-Bit invariant at 37 is plus one, it means, you know, we are still working in the quaternion algebra ramified at 61, but split at 37, and we still pick all things at 37. We don't pick all things at 61. Don't pick all things at 61, but we pick all things at 37. So we know F61 has to be there. So this is F61. And the second factor, degree 12, you look at it, and it's really this factor, which we already, which we also proved that the Yoshida leaves have to be there. So we know it's there. And then the other one is degrees too big. Too big. So, this guy here has the eigenvalue that we want to prove is congruent to this eigenvalue. So, all we have to do is take a vector, an eigenvector here, an eigenvector here, and prove they are congruent, the eigenvectors. So, yeah, at this point, you can actually just compute the eigenvectors and do it. As I say, our theory implies that these two have to appear. Have to appear in this space. So it's not just, I'm not just saying, oh, it looks like it's what I want to be. Our theorem says these two guys have to show up. So I can claim it's these two because they cannot be the degree 211. And right, take the two guys in this space of dimension 224, and then you go and say, okay. And then you go and say, okay, I have to prove these vectors are congruent, but they aren't. So this is where I'm like, oh, man. Because when I learn about this, I say, okay, yes, we compute the two eigenvectors. They are going to be congruent. And we are happy. We finished. We proved the congruence. But no, they aren't. Actually, compute the coefficients. I mean, they are coefficients. I mean, they are coefficients in a number field, but whatever. No. But it turns out the other guy is useful for this because this guy corresponds to some non-lift of some huge level, whatever. And it turns out that minus 7 is a double root mode 43, mod 19 of this big. Of this big polynomial. And if you look at the kernel of the whole space, the T2 plus 7, this kernel has dimension 2, not 4. We have 4. We have one vector corresponding to the F61, one vector corresponding to the Yoshida Lift, and two vectors corresponding to this 211 guy. And or no, how can we prove this? How can we prove this thing is a, you know, it's the same. I mean, this is a particular computation for T2. I mean, maybe I compute for T3 and this guy has dimension four. And I mean, well, you compute nine addically. And then it turns out there are four nine addict because happily Q19. Because happily, Q19 has characteristic zero. So there are four eigenvalues, different eigenvalues. You see, here are the four different eigenvalues. And you compute the eigenvectors, and they are different. So this really is a dimension for space, but they all live in the same two-dimensional space model 19. Model 19. And this is the same as before. If you have four eigenvectors in a space of dimension two, I don't know, they can, I'm not saying they are collinear, but four eigenvectors with different eigenvalues in a space of dimension two, they have to have the same eigenvalue. So the whole thing has to be the same. Anyway, so um Anyway, so very quickly, last example is congruence of type of hardware congruence. This is more, well, this came later and it's more interesting in the sense that it has more literature. And this involves vector-valued modular. Vector-valued modular forms. And so, just as an example, you look at this 514AB. That's a classical modular form of wave 14, some eigenvalues. And the theorem, this was the conjecture. The harder conjecture is more for level one, I think. And Fredwell gave a lot of examples for higher levels and so, but. And then, and so, but it was always, we find the examples, and it's always conjectured. So, this is this is the proof. There is a paramodular form of weight seven, two, so this means it's vector valued, level five, blah, blah, blah, blah, such that this guy here. So again, you see the powers of p, they are separated. And here's the proof, and this is the end of the talk. We look at the space of orthogonal modular forms. space of orthogonal modular forms of weight six comma four and six comma four remember this means uh whatever this this matches seven two the the the the the vector part the j is the difference of these two so level 55 compute this space um the weight is kind of high so it's it's not trivial but can be done done and then we find an orthogonal modular forms corresponding to a paramodular form Corresponding to a paramodular form. So we find the thing. We know there is a paramodular form. I mean, we cannot write down the Fourier coefficients of this paramodular form, as I say, but we know there is a paramodular form with these eigenvalues. And we also find our Flobonal modular form of Yoshida type corresponding to this product. And we proceed as before, you know, the trick of finding spaces which just collapse, you know, too many eigenvectors. You know, too many eigenvectors in a too small dimension space. And also, this 114A is this auxiliary, it's just congruent to an isostain. And if you look, this guy gives you the PQP8 modulo 61. And of course, this guy gives you the AP. And that's how we prove, and we prove several of these congruences. Several of these congruences in our paper. Anyway, that's all. Thank you. Are there questions for Gonzalo or online? You can leave them in chat. Descriptive remark about SO7. You made the scriptive remark about things falling apart for SO7. What? And is it because you should be working with G-Spin? Well, the thing for seven, so if N is three, you get SO3 and you get GL2. And if n is five, you get SO5 and you get GSP4, which is what you think you want to get. But those are both accidentally GSP4. And yeah, exactly. That's accidentally. So if you do SO7, you don't get GSP6, which maybe it is what you think you have to study, but maybe it's not. Because say if you're interested in Say, if you're interested in, I don't know, modularity conjecture, if you look at if you if you're going to look at the abelian threefolds, yes, there are GSP6 on the Galois side, but they are SO, they are O7 on the Langland side, so on the automorphic side. So, yeah, maybe, you know, maybe we don't care, but I haven't looked at seven, but it's just. But it's just, you know, when we started looking at five, it was like we started doing it because we said, oh, this is accidental. You know, everybody's talking about signal modular forms of genus too. So we want to compute gene signal modular forms of genus 2, and this is a way. So what I really mean is doing orthogonal modular forms for seven will is not a path to compute single modular forms of genus three. Siegel modular forms of genus 3. That's what I say. It doesn't mean it's not interesting. In fact, I'm sure this is very interesting, very, very, very many ways that I probably know little about. But yes, in principle, all of this is doable. As I say, you don't even need to worry about. To worry about what's the level or if it's square free or non-square free. You just take your random lattice, whatever lattice. You know, to prove this, we define a particular type of lattice we call special lattices, which is just a lattice of odd dimensions such that if you take the dual, the quotient between the dual and the lattice is cyclic. That's our special lattice, and it turns out to be just the nice thing. The nice thing. This can be generalized, but that also, I mean, this is this works very nicely because we can compute everything for this, and we can classify. We have a local classification, we have a global classification. But that's because we want to prove a theorem. If you just want to compute, you can take arbitrary lattice and do whatever, whatever dimension. Of course, as the dimension grows, the computing. Dimension grows, the computations get harder and harder. Here, I should say the hard part of the computation, in a sense, is you compute the neighbors that take some time because there's a lot of neighbors, p to the cube neighbors here, or for seven it would be p to the fourth, so on. But and then once you compute in the neighbor, so you start in a lattice and then you move a little bit, but you have a list of classes. You have a list of classes, and then you have to make this isomorphic to one of your classes, so you have to test isomorphism. And then, you know, there's this beautiful isometry testing of Pleska and Souvigner. That's what we use. But also, you have to be very careful because if you're gonna check isometry between your every neighbor and every class, then the thing gets. Every class, then the thing gets a quadratic factor that kills you. So you actually have to be a little bit better. You have to somehow get something that is almost good enough as a canonical form so that you can use hashing or something to avoid this quadratic. It's a kind of worms, but the point is, you can really, really compute anything. I mean, as an experimental thing to see. Theme to see what happens, to see what you find, and then you know, to guide us to see what we can prove, where can we go? I mean, I don't know. It's like not always, but sometimes, you know, when you know what you want to prove, then it's a lot of work, but it's work that you just do. I mean, well, not just, but yeah, that's the point. That's the point. But yes, seven would be very interesting. Also, even dimensions are also interesting in some regards, but somehow the odd dimension got more interesting. I mean, I started doing n equals three because I want modular forms of half-integer weight, and those are perfect for that and give a lot of information. Anyway, so yes, so about seven, that's that's the comment. Thank you. And if there are no more questions, then we can thank the speaker again. Thank you. We will continue at 10:30.
