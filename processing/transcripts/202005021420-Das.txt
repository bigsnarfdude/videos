Just before I start, can everyone see me properly? Okay. It's because I never thought that I would have a lighting situation in my room while I was renting this house. And I'll put a lamp light so that people can see me. Okay, just when I start. So I'm going to talk about my master's research work carried under the supervision of. Carried under the supervision of Dr. Shadiri and Dr. Ng on the topic: an explicit version of Chevodarov's density theorem. Now, going back to my abstract, a Chevodarov density theorem, it states that the prime ideals are equidistributed over the conjugacy classes of Galois group of the Galois group of normal extension of number fields. This looks like a very complicated statement. A more simpler version is. A more simpler version is let L be a L over K be a normal extension of number fields with Galva group G, O L and O K with the corresponding ring of integers, T be a prime ideal in OK, sigma P with the atom symbol at P. Then Chevrolet density theorem says for C which is a conflux conjugacy class and pi C which is the number of unramified tribes P in OK with norm of times p in okay with norm of prime less than equal to x and the atom symbol at p equals to c pi c would be asymptotic to mod c over mod g li x which is asymptotic to mod c over mod g x over log x as x goes to infinity. A more probabilistic interpretation would be for a given fixed prime ideal p, the probability that sigma p equals to c is mod c over mod g. Note if L and K are both field If L and K are both field of rationals, then Shavotarov's density theorem reduces to prime number theorem. Similarly, if K is a field of rationals and L is the cyclotomic extension, then Shabotarov's density theorem reduces to Diricheletz prime in a fixed arithmetic progression. Next objective. First, I will introduce the sum Xi C. Xi C, which is a sum over log log F from log log f from log n p and the sum runs over m p m less than equal to x norm of p is unramified and sigma p m equals to c where sigma p is the attending symbol at p. We see that by partial summation and integration by parts we can prove bounds for pi c from the bounds for xi c Lagerioza Nulisko did a similar thing and proved in 1977 that 77 that if log x is greater than or equal to 4 and l log dl square, then there exists a positive constant C13 such that psi Cx minus mod C over mod gx divided by mod C over mod Gx. This in this in this talk we'll consider this as our error term. This is this is this has the size exponential minus some that constants time nl to the power minus half log n L to the power minus half log H to the power half where this beta 0 term exists if zeta L has an exceptional 0, beta 0. I give an explicit version to their result and I prove if log x is greater than 29.57 NL log 50 dl 1 over N L square then the error term has this size 0.22 log x to the power 3 by 2 N L 1 over 8 exponential minus 0.046 N L minus half log x to the power half. N L minus of log x to the power half, where again the beta 0 term is present only if zeta l has an exceptional 0, beta 0. To carry out that, I introduce some new smooth sums. First, I choose my appropriate smooth weight H, which is an approximation of the indicator function 0 to x. As a result, I obtain a smooth version of the xi cx, the prime counting function xi cx, as the following. Cx as the following. Here the sum runs over all P unramified and sigma p m equals to C H is the chosen smooth wet. We notice that the error term from Xi C X is less than equal to the error term from Xi C tilde for our appropriate choice of H. Next, I introduce a new sum Ix which runs over all prime ideals P and is given in this form where theta is theta. Where theta is a characterization that P is unramified and sigma p equals to C. Oh, suppose to sigma p m equals to c. Now this h is our smooth function. With this notation, we see that xi c tilde is ix minus i ram of x, where i ram of x is the restriction of ix to the ramified primes only. The ramified primes only. This term is a very small size term and that contributes to our error term in the final computation. Next. To obtain from the last formula, to obtain a bound or the error term for xi c tilde and in that we have error term for xi cx, we need to bound this Icx first. To do that, we look at an explicit, we try to find an explicit formula for Icx. An exclusive formula for ICX. We see that by Mayline inverse formulation, Ix can be written as mod C over mod G, summation over phi by G, phi belongs to G of this integral, where phi is a character of the Galois group L over K, G is this Galois group L over K. H is our, is the Maline transform of our chosen smooth weight H. Than smooth white H and L is the R T n L function corresponding to this irreducible character C. And the R conjecture for R Tin L function says that R T n L functions are holomorphic over the complex plane, entire complex plane. But unfortunately, I couldn't prove that. So I had to reduce it to the Heckel function case. Heckel function case using during reduction. What are Heckel functions? These are Atin L functions where the corresponding representation is of dimension a degree 1. Using During reduction, we get that Ix is now of this form where this Atinal Heckel function is defined over this L over E field. E is a subfield of L. is a subfield of L and chi it comes from the group which has the fixed field as E so L is a Heckey function corresponding to the derucible character chi going forward to bound Ix I need to find an estimate for this integral before doing that since we introduced Artinel function and Heckel function we'll talk about a little bit about the Derek and Zeta function Derek and zeta function. One thing to note that if c is a trivial representation in case of here in case of Atinal function, if C is a trivial representation, then L pr L S C L over K is basically zeta k, the Derek and Zeta function k for week. Now, some results concerning the Derek and Zeta function. Derek and zeta function. We see that Derek and Zeta function zeta Ls is equal to product of all Atinal function L s chi L over E where chi again belongs to the group which has the fixed field E. And some properties of Zeta L. Zeta L has an analytic continuation to C minus 1 with a simple pole at S equals to 1. Zeta L vanishes at all negative even integers. Zeta vanishes at all negative odd integers unless L. Negative odd integers unless L equals to Q or a real quadratic field. Zetyle has non-trivial zeros in the critical strip and Zetyl has possible exceptional real zero which we denoted beta zero. Now Anne and Kwan in 2014 proved some zero-free regions for this Zeta function. They proved if NL is greater than equal to 2 and if rho denoted as beta plus i gamma is a non-trivial zero of zeta with rho not equal to 1. of zeta l with rho not equal to beta naught then one minus beta satisfies this property also if one minus beta is oh also one minus beta is greater than one over two log dl when mod gamma is less than one over two log dl okay next we go back to finding the integration in the last slide we need we need to estimate this integral We need to estimate this integral to do that. We use Cauchy's residue theorem. So, on the right-hand side, here this is what we need to estimate. So, to do that, we increase our region of integration from this line over this entire rectangle and use Cauchy's residue theorem. We observe that this, the contribution from this three side goes to zero as u, t goes to infinity. goes to infinity hence using Cauchy residue theorem which is like the if you integrate a meromorphic function over a closed rectangle then what you get is the sum of the residues using that we obtain Ix minus mod C over mod g X H 1 can be written as mod C over mod G J L 1 plus J L 2 where J L 1 is the contribution from poles at S equals to 1 pole at S equals to 1 and zeros Pole at s equal to 1 and 0s at negative integers of zeta ls. Again, this term we compute to be small and hence will form the error term. And for J L 2, it is the sum over the non-trivial zeros of zeta ls. Notice that J L 2 is given as this. So going forward, we need to bound this mod of x to the power row and mod of h rho such that they are as small as possible. That they are as small as possible. Now, this is: I first divide my GL2 into separate regions and follow what Lagerius and Olisco did in their paper with some changes. So, Lagerius and Olisco had their division into three separate ones: S1, S2, S3. I have JL3, JL4, JL5, and JL6. Gel 3, Gel 4, GL5, and Gel 6 instead of those three. The reason for dividing this Gel, the S2 into J L4 and GL5 is when we compute J L4, using the 0, 4 region from N and Q1, we found that the J L4 has a better bound than the bound for S2 and thus gave us better explicit result in this case. Now, that's the first observation here. Now, that's the first observation here. Again, the second observation is when Lagaris and Olisco did their work, the zero-free region that was available to them, one of the zero-free region was having this one over four log dl as a value. For us, I have the un and const result, which gives me one over two log dl. Hence, I get explicit better explicit result for those parts too. Now, the notations here: JL3, JL. The notations here, JL3, JL4, JL5, and JL6 have been directly taken from my thesis. So that if someone ever reads my thesis, they can relate it. But if someone does ever read my thesis, I should warn you, it's pretty long by now. Okay. Next, our objective now is to bound this JL2 turf because this was the measure. Because this was the major this this was the major contribution for the error term so before I do that I have I I am gonna discuss a result for the low lying zeros of Heckel function which I used to prove bounds for j L 3 and X J L 4 let A be greater than 0 and T be any real number. Let N k denote the number of zeros rho is equal to beta plus i gamma of Heckel function L F of Heckel function L s chi L over E with t minus gamma less than equal to a then I proved n chi at has this is bounded by this where c1 is a constant depending on a given by 4 plus a square by 2 and c 2 is a constant given by this now here a chi is a constant depending on chi and if we take the sum over If we take the sum over all chi, log a chi, that will give us log dl. Delta chi is 1 if chi is a principal character and 0 otherwise. Just a sketch of the proof or the key ideas that we used to prove this. First, we notice that l chi t can be written as sum over 1 where or sum over the zeros of Heckel function where t minus gamma is less than or equal to l 1. equal to a 1 and we also saw that 1 is less than equal to 4 plus a square real part of 1 by 2 plus it minus rho if t minus gamma is less than equal to a. The next key idea was we use explicit formula from L prime over L given by this big expression where again a chi is as described earlier delta chi is m and gamma chi is the gamma factor associated to the l function and then And then we generalize the technique from Fierali and Martin for derigilate L-function to obtain our result. Next, I'll try to compute my bounds for J L2, J L3, J L4, and J L5 as well as compare them simultaneously with Lagarios and Ulisco's paper. So the first thing. First thing we look at the sum over the zeros with mod rho less than or equal to half. S1 and mod rho less than or equal to half S1 and J L3, S1 for Lagarius and Olisko and J L3 for my term. Lagarius and Ollisco prove that S1 has the size x to the power half log dl square. I use the bound on n chi half zero as as defined in my last proposition, the low-lying zeros of a KL function, to prove that J L three also has the similar also has the same size and this delta here comes from the choice of our smooth function. comes from the choice of our smooth function. Gel3 is small and hence contributes to the error term. Next, S2 and XJL4 and XJL plus XGL5. This is the sum of the zeros outside that small circle and below height t. Lagariz and Olisko prove that there exists a constant C14 such that S2 is of this size. I use the last proposition for m chi half two log dl this is for j l 4 and 0 free region of zeta ls for x j l 5 to obtain this estimate again here the delta is from the choice of our smooth wet we see that the size of the exponential term is similar the main thing to observe here is they had the term log t log dl t to the power n l and i have log dl log t square And I have log dl, log t square, which are of the same size. This is because of Hermite-Minkowski inequality, which says that NL is less than equal to log dl over log root 3. So, if I put that in here, I will get NL outside, which is log dl and log t, which gives us log dl log t. So, the again we observe that both they have the same size. Now, for the last one. Last one S3 and XJL6, which is the region above T. Lagarius and Olisko had this result that it was less than or equal to log x log dl plus n k log x plus n k x log x square over t. I use the zero-free region of zeta ls to prove that xjl6 is of this size where e2zm A2ZM Wm is called incompletely modified Bessel function of the second kind and is given by this expression where Zm is given by this and Wm is given with this expression. Notice that M delta M by M delta M again is a constant depending on our smooth function and delta and M yes. Yes. So to bound K2, Zm, Wm, we use Roscher and Schoenfield and Bennett et al. to find the upper bound for this as this big quantity here, which depends on Wm and Zm. So finally, we have a bound for S1, S2, and S3. One note the Note the assumption to prove a bound for S3 that we used here is log d2 dl1 over NLT is of the same size as log x to the power half. So now that we have bound for all the terms of i which we were looking for, so i changed to j1, j2, j1 was small, so we needed to bound j2. Now j2 changed into j3, j4, j5, j6 and J5, J6, and we short bound for each of them. To compute the final main term, we need to optimize some parameters. We need to choose some parameters and then optimize them. Lagerius and Rolisko chose their t to be exponential root log x over nl divided by dl me. I choose delta m depending on the smooth function h. Depending on the smooth function h, such that this quantity delta by 2, j4, j5, and j6 is as small as possible. My choice of delta looks like this big huge term where this m delta m part again depends on the choice of smooth function. And I choose my t to be exponential root log x over 29.57 nl 2 dl1 over nl now. Now, note that my choice of T gives a better log x region than what Lagaris and Olisco had in their paper. Next, we optimize the variables using GP pairing and compute to obtain our theorem that I defined in the first slide. As a result, we see that Lagerius and Oliscope. Lagerius and Olisko had this result. If log x is greater than 4 in a log dl, then the error term was of size this. Now, Winkler in 2018 proved that if log x is greater than or equal to 1545 NL log dl square, then the error term is 1.5110 to the power 12 exponential minus 0.014 nl of the same size nl minus half log h to the power half. Winkler, what he did? Winkler, what he did, he made all the results of Lagarios and Oliscos explicit, and as a result, he obtained his part. I proved that this is a more simplification of the theorem that I mentioned in my first slide. If log x is greater than 1951 over NL log dl square, then the error term is 0.22 log x to the power 3 by 2 N L one over 8 exponential minus 0.046. Exponential minus 0.046 nl minus half log x to the power half. Notice that the region that Lagarius, Olisko, or Winkler had, I have a better reason for log x than that. Also, my error term is better than Winkler's error term for all fields NL, for all fields NL greater than one. Okay. Okay. Finally, currently I am working on establishing the bound for the error term in two other forms: epsilon x using the method of Kadiri and Lumley and epsilon x over log x to the power r where 1 over 4 or 1 by 4 is less than r less than m plus 1 using the method of Bennett et al. So thank you Bennett. Thank you. Thank you. Any questions? Let's thank the speaker.
