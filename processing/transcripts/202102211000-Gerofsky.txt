    I just sent a tiny chat, and you've got a lot of thank yous here. Lot of thank yous here. A lot of thumbs up. I think we're a small group. It's possible we'll have one or two other people join in a few minutes. There was a little bit of technical difficulty starting. I'm Nancy Johnson. I'm a colleague of Zora Shivazi and Parker from UTSC in Toronto. And it's my pleasure to do a very brief introduction to Susan, Dr. Susan Jarofsky. And I'm going to leave her to say. And I'm going to leave her to say the title because I've already mangled that a little bit. But I did want to say this is a very exciting session. And if you don't have some of your tools, perhaps you want to reach out and grab them from your desk because we've asked if you have it, a protractor, carpenter square are optional, but might be helpful. Having paper and pencil around. And if you have an accordion, that's also going to help. Yes. So, Susan. Yes, so Susan, um, I'm reading from a bio, um, brings experience from a number of fields, as I think as she's just demonstrated, including music, to bear on an innovative interdisciplinary approach to mathematics education and environmental education and curriculum theory. She holds degrees in languages and linguistics, as well as mathematics education, has worked 12 years in film production, eight years in adult education, and nine years as a high school teacher. As a high school teacher with the Vancouver School Board. Dr. Drowski has been involved in interdisciplinary research and teaching involving embodied arts-based mathematics education, garden-based environmental education, and applied linguistics and film. Very exciting to meet you. Thank you. Thanks for the nice introduction, Nancy. And welcome, everybody. And really, the only tools that you need are some paper or cardboard. If you have a ruler or a straight edge, If you have a ruler, a straight edge that has a square end on it, then it's reliably square. That will do the trick. Some kind of a pen, a sharpie, a pencil, and some scissors will be handy too. And if you don't have all that, well, don't worry about it. Like just paper and pencil and a ruler will get you quite far here. So let me share my screen and I'll show you the slides. And so before I put the slides up, I'll just say that we will. Put the slides up, I'll just say that we will be making a Wurzelschneck today. A WÃ¼rzlschneck is just so much fun to say. It's a German word for this figure that goes back to historic times in ancient Greece, for sure, and maybe other places. And so we'll learn to make one, we'll explore a little bit of the possibilities, and I'll share with you my obsession with the Wurzelschneck over the last couple years and the many things that I've been making with it. I've been making with it. So let's share screen here. And I do hope more people will be showing up as the venue got changed because of a technical issue. So, all right. Just be one second as I get. Okay. So the Writzelschneck is about understanding number and creating geometric design. So the Writzelschneck is all about constructing numbers. Constructing numbers. And here's the roots of the word. Writzel means a root. And there's some kind of vegetable called a Mungel Writzel. I think it's some kind of either a beet or a turnip. But Writzel just means a root, like an actual root of a plant. And schneck means a snail. And in German and related languages, schnecker means not only a snail, but a spiral. And root, just as in English, can mean a spiral. And root, just as in English, can mean, for example, the root of a function or other kinds of extended meanings of root, the square root, the cube root, and so on. So, this figure, which you see in the background in blue cardboard there, is also known as the spiral of Theodorus or the Pythagorean spiral. And I was first introduced to it through Bridges, Math, and Art 2016. So, Bernard Rietzel created this kind of lovely snail shell figure, the one that you're seeing. Snail shell figure. The one that you're seeing on screen right now is one that my teacher candidates in my teacher education classes created as part of a math art project they do every year. And I can do, there's a link here to Bernard Rietzel's page. So you can see a sort of a slightly more professionally version. He calls it Nautilus Theodori. And he talks about the Wirtselschnecker, the root snail. And so I got interested in this. So, I got interested in this because of the connection with this piece of art and the way that you could make a spiral quite easily, quite a beautiful spiral using this construction, this easy construction. And then I started looking into the history of it. So, it's called the Spiral of Theodorus, and Theodorus of Cyrene, Cyrene is a place that's now in Libya. He lived at the He lived at the same time as Plato, and he actually moved to Athens and became the tutor of the famous Plato and of Plato's contemporary Thetetus. And Theodorus was a member of the Society of Pythagoras, so he knew about Pythagorean things for sure. Plato wrote a book called The Thetetus, and in that he has this little intriguing statement. He said, Theodorus was proving to us a certain thing about square roots. I mean the side, i.e., root, of a square. i.e., root of a square of three square units and five square units. So it's talking about something about the square root of three and the square root of five. That these roots are not commensurable in length with the unit length. So this idea of incommensurability, that the irrational numbers are not measurable with the rational numbers. So it's really interesting. It's known certainly to the ancient Greeks. And then it says that Theodorus went on in this way, taking all the separate cases up to the root of Taking all the separate cases up to the root of 17 square units, at which point for some reason he stopped. Why would he stop at 17? And Plato didn't seem to understand why Theodorus stopped at 17. Whoops, let's see. But the right-hand side here, I don't know if you can see, can you see the whole thing? Is it all visible? So there's this green, sort of medium-green, light green, and very pale green spiral. And the medium-green one is the one we're going to consider. Medium green one is the one we're going to construct, and that one has 17 right triangles that make it up. It can continue to be extended, so it would sort of overlap on itself if you kept going, but you can extend it indefinitely. And very interesting to see that the lines that construct it are not overlapping with the previous line. So this is an interesting thing about numbers that comes out through the spiral of Theodorus, that these lines never overlap with one another. That these lines never overlap with one another, and that the physical one that you can make without overlapping just goes to 17 and that it starts to kind of go around the next time. Okay, so now we're ready to make a Wurzel Schnecker. And I've made some here already, so I'll show you the ones I've made. And I'm going to have to. I was trying to get a document camera going, but that didn't work. So I'm just going to bend my computer down a little bit so you can see. Down a little bit. So you can see some that I've made here. I've stuck to the top of this box. And you can see, here's one of the ones. Yeah. Can you see it on my personal screen there? Okay. I can stop sharing for a moment if that helps. Maybe that'll make it bigger. People need to be in side-by-side speaker mode. Thank you. Oops. Just. Thank you very much. All right, so this way, if you have me pinned or you're looking at the speaker, you'll see it fairly large. Here's one of the baked versions that I made on Friday night, and there's another one underneath it. Oops, if I look at that pan, there's another one under there. Oh, with icing sugar on it. Oh no, they're falling off. Oh dear, I dropped a triangle. Okay, it's okay. I'm the only one who's going to eat these anyway, so just put these back where they belong. All right. Anyway, you get a little look at these and these cardboard ones I can hold up, but I can take them off the box. Anyway, there's the preview. Okay, so I'm going to go back to sharing this. Back to sharing the slides because it shows how to construct the Ritzel Schneetke. Okay, I think I'm on the wrong screen here. Okay, so this is how to make it. And again, I was going to do it under a document camera, but it's a very easy construction. So I hope you'll be able to follow these instructions. So, first of all, you draw an isosceles right angle, a right triangle rather, with the base. Rather. With the base, we're going to call it the base, the leg, and the hypotenuse. So the base is one unit, whatever size you want it to be. It might be one inch or one centimeter, but it could be easily three centimeters or whatever you want it to be. But call that one unit. So an isosceles right triangle. And if you have a ruler that has a reliably square base, you can just use that to make your right angles. But it is important to make the right angles as accurate as you can. Angles as accurate as he can manage. So if you can if people could give me a thumbs up either physically or with the icon, I can see whether you're when you've gotten to the point where you've been able to make that isosceles right triangle, base one and um and uh leg one. And uh, leg one. All right, got one person here. So, this is the one that you're making is sort of this initial one here. All right. Anybody else? It looks like one or two people have done that now. All right. Nancy's done it. Amanda's done it. Dawn's done. Sir Jill's done it. Laura, great, thanks, Nancy. All right, I'm going to go to the next step. And if you're still making your isosceles right triangle, then follow along. You can always ask questions if you're getting stuck on anything. So the next thing is to build another right triangle on that one. So here's the first one. The second one is built on the hypotenuse of the first one. The base is still one unit. All the way around, the base is going to be one unit. So don't make the base bigger. So, don't make the base bigger, but the leg is now the hypotenuse of the original one, and then you just join the ends of those two lines. Okay, and again, just going to give me a thumbs up if you're there, or a question if you have a question. All right, Mandela. Yay, thanks. Okay, and then continue to iterate the same thing. So after you've done the second one, you use the hypotenuse. Hey, thanks, Nancy. Use the hypotenuse of the second one as the leg of the third one. The bass remains one unit. Don't make the bass get bigger. Keep the bass as one unit. And just join the ends. So you'll find you'll get into a rhythm of it pretty soon. And you just keep doing that, keep iterating. And you just keep doing that, keep iterating up to as many as 17 times. This one has got 16, not 17. And you can see that there's a question about how close to the edge of the piece of paper or cardboard should you make it so that you'll be able to fit this long tail in. So you can see I had to, I didn't judge correctly to be able to make 16 of them. I think I made 12 and ran out of room. So then I just taped on an extra bit of cardboard and carried on. So don't feel bad if you have to do that because I've made a lot of these and I. To do that, because I've made a lot of these, and I still am not. This is one of the open questions: how do you know where to place the first triangle? And by the way, the triangle can go in either orientation, whether the hypotenuse is sort of coming slantwise to your left or slantwise to your right, doesn't matter. Just either way will work. So keep going. And maybe when you get to about six, you know, give me a thumbs up just so I see where people are at with the making. So I see where people are at with the making of it. But it is if you're ever asked to draw a spiral, it's a very nice, easy way to make a spiral or to teach people how to make a spiral. Because once you've got the first two or so. Once you've got the first two or so, you just iterate and iterate and iterate, and it can be kind of meditative. Maybe I'll play a bit of accordion music while you're doing that, just for, you know. Because who doesn't like accordion music? Okay, here we go. Okay, here we go. A little bit of English Morris dance music.  All right, how's it going with your Writzel Schnecker? All right, and for new people just arriving, we're at the point where we're making the Wirtzel Schnecker or the Spiral of Theodorus, and the instructions should be up on the screen for you. And the instructions should be up on the screen for you. It's very iterative. You start with drawing an isosceles right triangle with base and leg one unit long, then build another right triangle on the hypotenuse with a base of one, and then build another one on the hypotenuse of that one, and so on. And you can keep going until you make something that looks a bit like this. A bit like this. Let's see, Meda. Oh, gorgeous, fantastic. That is so beautiful. Yay! All right, as other people get theirs close to completion, if you want to hold them up, that would be great. Turn on your camera for a moment and show what you're making. And it would be great to get some kind of indication from people what the, you know, where you're at with it so that I'll know when to move on to the next screen. So do give me either a thumbs up symbol or show what you've done or turn on your camera and do a physical thumbs up. Thanks, Andrew. Thanks, Andrew. If you want to kind of show what you've been making. Hey, thank you, Sergei. Thanks, Dawn. And feel free to show off your work with pride. Alright, I think I'm going to go on to the next slides just to kind of keep things moving along, but if you need, once you've Need it once you've got the basic procedure, I think you won't have any problem carrying on. And if you do want to come back to this slide, just let me know. So there's a question here, number four on the screen. It says, what numbers are you constructing geometrically? So for those who are well along in making it think about that, maybe you could just share with people. What are the numbers that you're constructing? We had a one-by-one One right triangle. Of course, we know that the hypotenuse of that one is the square root of two. How about the next few? So what's the hypotenuse of the second triangle that you made? Whoops. Oh, there's lots of stuff in the chat that I'm not looking at here. Let me just take a look. Alright. Alright, looks good. Yes. Yeah, it's really relaxing to make this, I find. I mean, except, you know, when I kind of find I'm going off the page and I need to tape on an extra piece, but you know, even that is okay. All right. Cool. Cool. Alright, and so Frank is saying it's the roots of successive integers, right? So the next one that's up after root 2 is the hypotenuse is square root of 3. It's this base of 1, leg square root of 2, and the hypotenuse square root of 3. Next one after that, just do a couple more. We've got the base is always 1, the leg is square root of 3, and the hypotenuse is 2, which is the Noose is 2, which is the square root of 4. And we start to get, so you can start to see the first one is 1. I mean, the leg is 1. The next one, the leg is 2, root 2, rather. Next one, root 3. The next one, root 4. And it keeps going like that. So we're actually constructing the square roots of the counting numbers all the way up to 17 here. And when Theodorus was talking to Plato and Thetetus about the About the square roots of numbers, and he stopped at 17. Plato doesn't mention that he brought forward a figure like this, but there's little doubt that, why would 17 be the stopping point? It makes a lot of sense if he actually constructed this. So, we may want to, so I'd ask you to label your triangle. So, I don't know if you can see it on here, but I've labeled them one, two, three, and this one goes up to 16, but you could do a 17th one. But you could do a 17th one. So just maybe put the number on it because we might want to play around with them later and might actually want to cut them out. These ones I actually did cut a little ways into each leg because I used this as a template for making the pastry that you saw earlier on and you'll see in some of the pictures here. So I needed to kind of cut in to show where the marks would be. Okay. So here's when I was baking the virtual schnack, as you can see here. The Virtzelscheck, as you can see, here's this figure that I rolled out dough, I put it between two layers of parchment paper, I laid this thing on top with these little nips into the edges and with a kind of a hole drilled through the middle with a tip of a pair of scissors. And I just took a pairing knife and cut around the edges of the dough and cut a little ways into it where the edges should be. And then I used a ruler afterwards to connect. Afterwards, to connect those with the center so it was ready to bake. And I was trying to think how to number the triangles because once I bake it and they were each, you know, the triangles were each separate, what happens if they get mixed up or I'm playing around with them? So can you figure out how I label the triangles? It had to be something bakeable. Can anybody figure it out? I'm sorry, I'm just still trying. Can anybody figure it out? I'm sorry, I'm still trying to get find my cursor so that I can look at the. Alright, somebody's put something in the chat, and if I can get the cursor to show up, I can open it. Dang. Let's see. All right, Nancy, I might need your help. Can you just read what's in the chat there? Because I just can't seem to get it to open from the screen. Laura Frank Ferris said binary. Um, Frank Ferris said binary. Oh, binary would be really smart. I didn't really do binary. I guess I did a sort of well, sort of a modulo four because I had 16 triangles. And I thought, okay, well, I can sort of work in fours. There's this picture, you can see those little post-it notes and those little triangular numbers constructed out of baking goods. Goods. Sorry, Nancy, if you can be the one who could read what's new, and if there's anything new in the chat. Well, I'll just tell you how I did it. So I thought on the smaller triangles, I can put one little extra item on top. And then the medium-sized ones, I can put two, and then three, and then four. So it'll cover all 16. So, and then I picked almond, blueberry, chocolate, date. Can you figure out why I picked those four things? Those four things kind of boring alphabetical order, right? So, A, B, C, and D. I had to find something with A, B, C, and D that I had in the kitchen. And we caught that. And that would taste good, right? So, whoops, sorry. All right, so here's the finished product. So, you can see that the early ones have like almond, blueberry, chocolate. Almond, blueberry, chocolate, date, then two almonds, two blueberries, two chocolates, two dates. Three almonds, three blueberries, three chocolates, three dates, and then four of each. So that was a way of doing it. And I made two Vertzelschnecka and I put powdered sugar on one so that I could tell them apart. So in case I wanted to know which one was which. So it's kind of like a plume. Oh, yep, sorry. Then it unfolds. So this was an early experiment. So this was an early experiment. So this is why I got interested in the Writzelschneck. And this is because the Bridges Math and Art Conference started to have a mathematical fashion show. A mathematical fashion show, and I thought, wouldn't it be neat to have a hat that had a spiral that would unfold? You could pull a little string and fold it up and unfold it. And you can see that we had some technical difficulties with it, so I'm going to ask your help with that too. And so the easiest spiral I could think of making that would unfold was the Wurzelschneck. And you can see I made one out of basswood, which is a very light. Basswood, which is a very light wood that hobbyists use for building things like train sets and stuff. We're right near a train hobbyist shop in Vancouver, so it was easy to get. And I got a little tiny drill so I could drill holes through it. And so I made a Wirtslishneke, but we were, and my friend Marcia Martinez is a milliner, and she had this fedora, this kind of plastic fedora. So we made the fedoras of Theodorus that could be supposedly could be unfurled and refurled. Supposedly, it could be unfurled and refurled, but we were having materials problems with what to put at the base of it so that it would not torque too much. Anyway, that was the start of this procedure. And then I decided to make some out of foam, sort of like furniture making foam. So I've worked with two different foam shops in town. And I came across this optimization issue. I had one rectangle of foam, and the question was: how to optimize the layout when Was how to optimize the layout when cutting blocks of foam so that my guy at the foam shop working with his electric jigsaw could cut it out. And one thing that I figured out is it's as easy to make two as one if you're cutting it out of something rectangular. Any idea why that might be? And again, whoops, if I can, see if I can. Nancy, if you can read me the comments, that would be really helpful because I just can't seem to. You don't have a comment yet about your question. About your question, people are thinking. So I think about that. Why is it as easy to make two verses as one in a rectangular fit to be a rectangle? That's exactly it, yeah. So if you look at the layout there, the one on the left is probably more visible. You can see that I've got them numbered 1 to 16. Numbered 1 to 16. I did 16 of them in this particular foam version. And you put them together, put two right triangles, identical right triangles together, you get a rectangle. So it was easier for the guy at the foam shop to cut out sort of these long strips and rows and then cut them into rectangles and then just cut the rectangles in half along the diagonal. So then I got two for the work of one. And then I started to play around with these. So you can see the Wurzel Schnecker. You can see the Wurtzlschneck laid out flat. You can see what we called foam hinge after a while. The Wurzelschneck is standing up on end, which you can't do with your paper or cardboard versions probably, but if it has a bit of thickness, you can do it. And then you could also make this sort of sunburst from it. And these are just a few of the affordances you can have when you make it in 3D. And I brought it to some different places. So this was the Canadian Math Education. The Canadian Math Education Study Group at CMESG conference in Squamish at Quest University. We did a quick ad hoc workshop with it, and people were drawing the Versal Schneck on Windows. It was really fun. Playing around with lining them up on a desktop. And can you figure out in the upper right-hand corner what they've done there? There's some that are lying down. Which ones are lying down? Again, Nancy, I'll rely on you to read the. I'm just waiting for Frank. I'm just waiting for Frank. I don't know why I can't. Oh, here. My cursor is just disappearing, that's all. Oh, sorry. It's doing funny things here. Okay. Don't have a guess. No guess? Well, if you take a look, they're sort of lined up from 1 to 16. And the ones that are sort of down are 1, 4. Down are 1, 4, 9, 16. So the square numbers are, that was a choice to put the square numbers down. So they're the ones that come out to be whole numbers when you are making them. And then people were playing around with different kinds of... Oh, this is actually from a workshop I did with grade eight and nine math students at Burnaby Central Secondary. And so this kind of fish scale thing, this kind of like slightly skewed fish scale, is an interesting. Like slightly skewed fish scales, an interesting configuration. And then the bottom right-hand corner of the screen, there's this beautiful, I find really beautiful shape that happens when you lay them on kind of backwards. So instead of putting them, you know, like the next one on the hypotenuse of the previous one, when you cut them out, you can put them the other way. So you can put the hypotenuse of the root 2 one on the leg of the one. So you're sort of putting them on the back. Of the ones. You're sort of putting them on the backs of the other ones rather than on the hypotenuse, if that makes sense. And you get this lovely spiraling figure, too, that has a sort of roundish hole in it. And I haven't figured out yet why it does that or what the shape of the hole is. So that's a bit of an open question for you. And here's some other playing around with the different configurations that you can do with it. So, this is one of my graduate classes in math education at UBC in the hallway outside our classroom. And this is this large WÃ¼rzl Schnecker. So, it's really nice to see Brackett has just arrived because she and I are both really interested in working with large-scale manipulatives or large-scale kind of things you can work. Kind of things you can work with with your senses in mathematics. And so I wanted to make a furniture-size furniture scale of RÃ¼zzelschneck. And in fact, two of them, because it's just as easy to make two as one. So I did that. I had a little bit of money left at the end of a grant about embodied mathematics. And I went to this other foam shop and I got this furniture foam. And I went to great fabric store, Rocco Sari shop on Main Street here and bought all this gorgeous material. material and they got them to sew the at the foam shop they sewed the upholstery for it so there at UBC right now I can't really get into my building very easily but there are two giant Versel Schneckers like this that are sort of furniture size and we're playing around with the idea of mathematical furniture so I'm thinking about like say in a classroom or in a daycare or somewhere else like that or in your home to have In your home, to have these two sets of Verselschneck. Of course, you can put the two that are the same size together to make rectangles. So you could just make rectangular, say, covering for a bench or something like that. That's one unit wide, however wide your unit is. But you can also take them apart and do all kinds of play with them. And on the right-hand side, you can see some of the things my class was doing with playing with them in a sort of balancing way. And it started me thinking about, say, Me thinking about, say, playground equipment or sculpt public sculptures where you might be able to play with this interesting shape and make big things that people could engage with publicly. So then the questions of materials are always important. How would you make them, if they were taller than a person, say if they were eight feet tall for the largest one or something, how would you make it so nobody would get beamed on the head and get a concussion or anything like that? Or anything like that, but where you could play with them and reconfigure them in different ways. Susan, you had a question about are the colors of the pieces random or are they mathematical? Oh, well, the colors are, I did plan the colors out and I plan the textures too. So there's some of them, like you can see in that picture, there's red one and this green one, some of them have a kind of a flocked texture, sort of not quite like velvet or. Sort of not quite like velvet or but something like that that had a different texture. I've been working a lot with learners who have visual impairment or are blind, and I was thinking about how I could work with people with low vision or blindness with these and have them be meaningful and interesting. And so I wanted to have all the ones that were square numbers. So I was thinking about that 1, 4, 9, 16 be made of a different textured material. The rest are more like a canvas kind of material. But I Material. But I anyway, there was some problem with the sewing, and it ended up being just like multiples of three. So 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 got made of this flock material, which is less helpful. But it's a way of you can identify them by touch anyway. And then part of the colors was just to find colors, like sort of patterns that kind of clashed but kind of went together. And I didn't have a particularly I didn't have a particularly, it was partly dependent on the how much yardage or meterage of each type of fabric I could get to, what they had on stock at the store, in stock at the store. So that's not so mathematical. You had a question also about can you combine the two furniture sets? Yes, you can definitely. So, and I that's but the problem was that in my classroom, there's a tall cupboard and I can actually fit one. Tall cupboard, and I can actually fit one set in that cupboard, but only one set, and then it's full. And even like the idea of how you pile them up in the cupboard because these are sort of like four tall, narrow cupboards. So that in itself is a close packing problem that's quite interesting in itself. And then the other set is down in a research room in the basement. And, you know, people are always threatening me that they're going to make me take it away. But since nobody's at the university right now, I have a report. The university right now is have a reprieve. But I'd really like to have them together and be able to play with them together because there's a lot more you can do with two than with just one. All right, I'm just going to, whoops, let's go back. And then I started playing around with the idea of having Writzel Schnecker jewelry. But I'm not a jeweler and I don't have jewelry skills or tools. But I did have, I was able to get some tin snips and I had some, there's an interesting A colorful biscuit tin that I had that I was willing to cut up. So I made a couple of sets out of this biscuit tin. And in this case, again, I made the square numbers with the shiny side of the biscuit tin showing, and then the non-square numbers with the colorful painted side. And I think it's quite pretty. I mean, I really like it. It's too big. Again, it's about Too big again, it's about yay big, so it's kind of pretty big to wear as jewelry. And it's also very sharp. So, there's another materials question here. I've been talking to jewelers that are friends of mine, and they're a bit worried about the spikiness of it, that it might kind of cut into somebody's skin if they're wearing it as a necklace or that sort of thing. So, but I do think, again, if it were something that you could take apart and reconfigure and then wear it in different configurations without losing any of the little bits, it would make a really cool. Little bits, it would make a really cool kind of jewelry. And certainly, it could be made from cloth, kind of like this up in the upper left, there's kind of a pennant, and you could make kind of prayer flags or pennants like that. It might work for quilting. So, here's a question that came up for me. Whoops. When I started lining them all up in order with the right angles all lined up, I looked at the I looked at the shape that the vertices made, and I thought, is this a line? It doesn't really look like a line. What is the shape that these make? So I put that to you, and I tell you that at a certain point, I kind of went like face-clown, like, oh, yeah, right, of course. So I'll let you think about this sort of a discretized version of something that you might find familiar. And Nancy, let me know, I see that things are showing up in. Let me know. I see that things are showing up in the chat and I just can't quite access it. So let me know what there are things I should be knowing about. Frank said a Riemann sum for square root N. I hope I said that right, Frank. Yes, so Riemann sum. So yeah, it is. So it's, I mean, I was thinking even more simply, but I was just thinking about the square root function. So y equals the square root of x, but just for the root of x but just for the for the counting numbers so we don't have all the all the real numbers there we just have one two three four five up to seventeen so so if you follow that that curve and then of course y equals the square root of x is the inverse of y equals x squared so it's just if y equals x squared is a kind of as a parabola this is like the parabola on its side let me just do it with my thumb and finger something like that there's a few facts Finger, something like that. There's if that's the parabola, this is the parabola turned on its side and just the top half of it. So that I found that a really, I hadn't even realized that when we made the Wurzelschneck, which is so fun and easy to make, we're also making a model of half a parabola or y equals root x, just the positive values. And there's some interesting other ways of sort of pairing them up on the left-hand side here. The left-hand side here. And then here's people visit a math teachers conference in Greater Vancouver. Again, people playing around with the Vritzneka. And I think there are a lot of interesting architectural possibilities too, like some kind of spiral staircase or something like that. Again, you know, pending use of materials. So here's some open questions. Let's just check our time here. So we're at 9. Time here. So we're at 9:39, so we've got about 10-11 minutes left. So here's some questions for you to think about. A practical question, how to know where to start the first triangle so that they'll all fit on the piece of paper or cardboard. No doubt there's a proportion that I should be paying attention to, but I haven't really taken a minute to figure it out, and it would be a good thing. Another question, this one I really. I really would love to have an answer to. Why does the reverse spiral have a hole in the middle, and what is the shape of that hole? So that's when you pile up the triangles sort of backwards. Is there a pattern to the angles of successive triangles? So some of my teacher candidate students who were playing around with this were playing with inverse tangent. No, sorry, inverse. No, sorry, inverse, yeah, inverse tangent function just to try and figure out what would the angles be as you go along, because we know the lengths of the sides. And then how to optimize the layout on a flat piece of foam, fabric, or metal, or something else that's rectangular. So I worked out a kind of, you know, by trial and error, I made these rectangles and then I had to cut some of them out and fit them at the top and so on to try to see them. And so on to try to see them, see how you'd optimize them. But I wonder if there's a more algorithmic way of working with that or other kinds of logic you could use. And then just some design questions. How could this be used as a learning architecture or kind of something you could have big to play around with in a public space like a park, a playground, you know, a schoolyard, maybe something you could travel around with? And how could you make a kinetic? And how could you make a kinetic kind of jewelry? Because I like jewelry. How could you make jewelry that could be changed in shape by playing with the shape of the WÃ¼rzlschneck? And then materials question, what makes a good base for an unfurling Wurzelschneck on a hat or costume? And just so happens on Friday, I received this watch spring that I had ordered on eBay like months ago, so it was just perfect timing because I kept thinking maybe watch spring material it wants to coil up. It wants to coil up and it doesn't torque very much. It doesn't want to bend to the side like the plastic placements that we used for the original one. So I'm wondering if we could make our hat or fedoras of Theodorus with a watch spring as the base, but I haven't really worked with metal or with this material before. So one of the things if you're a mathematical artist is that sometimes you're called on to be sort of a master of all materials, even though you don't really know anything about them. Even though you don't really know anything about them, so it's good to get help from people who do. So at this point, if you've arrived later and you haven't actually made the WÃ¼rzl Schnecker yet, I can go back to the screen with the instructions. If you have made your WÃ¼rzl Schnecker, I suggest you might want to try cutting out the triangles. So I've got my scissors maybe. out the triangles so I've got my scissors maybe I'll cut out the triangles on this one because then you can try putting them backwards and sort of experiment with you know with the actual shapes if you like to do it in a tactile way or you can just do it by drawing or or thinking about them but I would love to I would love to hear any answers that you have to these questions that are of great interest to me and also to just kind of get your your take on what the um Your take on what the, you know, on the whole enterprise of playing with the Versel Schnecker. Did you want to unmute yourself, Frank? Susan, this is wonderful. When you make the reverse spiral, you're turning the triangles over, and then what's the rule for putting them together? So you're putting. I'm sorry, I haven't got this cut out right now, but in the original one, the In the original one, the next triangle is built on the hypotenuse of the earlier one. In the reverse one, you put the hypotenuse of the second one on the leg of the first one and continue that way. So I can start cutting these out and maybe that'll help illustrate it. I've got my cookie ones too that I could play around with, but they're kind of messy. Yep. Going back to the instructions? Oh, yeah. Let me just be interested in that because I definitely don't. And do I need like a piece of cardboard? What do I need for materials? A piece of paper or cardboard, a ruler with a square end on it that is reliably square, and some kind of drawing implement like a pen or pencil. Okay. All right. I'll go back to that screen there. I hope my ruler is reliably square. It's from first grade. First grade. That's probably a good one. Okay, here we go. There's the okay, now I should be able to see the chat, too. All right. So, Frank, anybody else who's working on this? So, here are the first two triangles. There's the one and the two. And normally the two would sit like that, but this time the two is going to go on the back of the one as I think of it. And then the three. And then the three goes on the back of the two, and so on. I'll just cut out a few more. So, does that make sense, Frank? Is that explanatory? Like put the hypotenuse of the larger on the leg of the smaller. Exactly it. Yeah, well said. And it was such a surprise to me. Actually, a friend of mine, we were playing around with this, and And she just did it that way. And I had never really considered that you could. So it was really, it was very cool. Okay, I've got one, two, and three here. I don't know if you can see, but that anyway continues on like that. Hypotenuse of the larger one on the leg of the smaller one. Oh, and bracket makes jewelry cool. When you do that, do the vertices really lie in a circle, like a circle of radius root 17? Maybe. Sometimes it doesn't. I mean, so what's the reasoning behind that? That's the largest length you started with. Largest length you started with, and then you're sort of flushing the next ones to be like at that same largeness somehow. But I'm not sure. Yeah, I mean, it sounds sensible. It is somewhat kind of circular-like, but whether it's an actual, it sort of looks a bit skewed, though. It doesn't look like it's absolutely circular. So, that's another question I have: is like, is it actually a Is it actually a circle, or is it some kind of spiraling shape? So, when I start, my ones are just whatever length, because I have my ruler now. Oh, yeah. I just use whatever one unit that I want. Yeah, the choice of what you call it-like one inch or one. It could be one inch, or it could be two inches for that matter, if you feel like it. Pinches for that matter, if you feel like it. One ruler. Yeah, one ruler, but just call that. This is now assigned the value one. Yeah. And then you just stay with that all the way through. And then I found a piece of cardboard, but it says this on the back. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. It looks pretty. I mean, I just went for the recycle. Yep. I dug around and talk about something usable. Yep. I have a lot of Amazon and other delivery boxes nowadays, so it's. That's what I went with, but yeah, it's kind of fun when you do it on something like the biscuit tin or a box that has a print on it because then you it reconfigures that you can still sort of see what it was, but it reconfigures it in colorful, interesting ways. Nice. And then, oh, and then you always do one unit on the outside. Exactly. So just make sure that's the only thing you have to really measure. And everything else is, you know. You know, once you've done your original one, it's just built on the previous hypotenuse. Cool. So it's interesting in the first workshop yesterday we were doing something about oh I just lost the name of the the presenter but he was doing something with from Seattle and doing work with making squares and Making squares, and he asked how many different kinds of squares could we construct? I mean, squares off whole numbers. And I sort of said, all of them, because, you know, and the proof is the spiral of Theodorus. And so here it is. We've actually constructed square roots of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, up to 16 or 17. And you could keep going. So it's a kind of a proof by construction that you can construct all the square roots of all the whole numbers. The square roots of all the whole numbers. Oh, JDF, thank you. Thanks, Frank. Yeah, it was a great workshop. And so it working with graph paper constrains you to the little squares on the graph paper. And the constraint was that things had to land on the intersection points. But if you didn't have to do that, then you could just, you know, you could just make this on graph paper or not on graph paper and just And just so you've then you've constructed everything. And then it would be interesting to compare these, maybe to put these on an appropriate size graph paper and see which of the square roots lands on an intersection point and which ones don't, because those would be the ones that are less constructible on the graph paper. I think it also raises questions. I think it also raises questions about the nature of proof and physicality. So, when you're making something physical, is that a proof? If you're making something with GeoGebra or Geometry Sketchpad or something like that, is that a proof? Does the proof have to be algebraic? We certainly have a preference for algebraic proofs and the generality that that gives you. But there's for, again, for the ancient Greeks, everything was about geometric. Everything was about geometric proofs and construction. It was a big part of what they were doing. Susan, Vassal, here. Hey, Vassal. Hi, this was very nice. But what you just said reminded me about an example that John Borwin was using. So he uses something similar to show that square root n, if n is prime, is not Is not a rational number. And he used it in the following way. He used actually the same construction. But his argument was: so if you say that it is a rational number, then you can find the smallest denominator. But if you do this construction, you always can find the smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller. And that was. And that was his argument actually to demonstrate to to make uh a a student or a viewer see that the square root n is an irrational number. That's not rational. Oh. So what would the denominator correspond to on the actual construction? So here, your red line, if you think about this one and one and one, your red line is square root three, isn't it? Square root three, isn't it? The red line. I'm not sure what you mean by the red line. The hypotenuse of the oh, yeah, yeah, it's square root three. You know, and so so if you if you do something, if you if you represent square root three as uh p over q, and if you do, I can, actually, I don't mind, I wouldn't mind. I actually. I actually worked on this relatively recently. I wouldn't mind to share with you the construction. It is basically what you are showing here. Okay. So, and I mean, in Pythagoras, like before Theodorus, Pythagoras was, I guess, Theodorus' teacher or mentor. And there was the question of the incommensurability of the square. Of the incommensurability of the square root of 2 with rational numbers. So basically, the diagonal of a unit square could not be measured in the same units as the sides of that unit square. And that's a fascinating, I mean, and it's interesting again to construct that, very easy to construct that, and then to try, take any ruler, and you can see that if you call the sides unit, then the diagonal will never fall on any of the Never fall on any of the markings on any ruler. I mean, it's not a proof, it's just a kind of a demonstration. Or if you call the diagonal a unit, then the sides can't be measured in the same units. And this is a really basic to mathematics. It's something as simple as a square, and it goes back at least 2,500 years. At least 2,500 years, and it's really surprising. So, you know, what we think of is a number, but these are constructed numbers. And I'm looking at Amanda and Frank's comments right now. So, yeah, so this, there is some kind of fractal feeling to this, even though it's not exactly self-similar, but it's very, I mean, they're all right-angle triangles, and they Right-angle triangles, and they create. I mean, this, particularly the backward spiral, does create something that looks quite like a fern. Let's see. Hey, very nice bracket. Beautiful. And so, yeah. And then Frank mentions John Edmark, who does beautiful, beautiful work with actual kinetic sculptures that coil and uncoil. That, yeah, that coil and uncoil. I just love his work. So, check out John Edmark. He was a plenary speaker at Bridges Math and Art about two years ago, three years ago. 2017, because I was there. Oh, yes, fantastic. At University of Waterloo, I think, right? Yeah, yeah. The only one I've made it to, so I know. Oh, yeah. So amazing, yes. And I would love to. I would love to, you know, learn from him, like, how he does these incredible things. Oh, it's so amazing. But it's interesting that this, but this one is not Fibonacci, interestingly enough, although many are. And a lot of sort of non-mathy people will say to me, and they'll see this, and they'll say, oh, Fibonacci, right? Because it's just a sort of word that they know. And I'll say, actually, no, it says square roots and right-angled triangles. Ah, well, thank you, Frank. Frank and I will be in conversation about this, and anybody else who's interested in doing this, we can do it through Facebook or we could do it by email or through the Slack group. But I would really, really be interested what's happening with that center of that backwards, yeah, the backwards spiral. And just to respect the time, I know it's 9:56 now, according to my computer, so I know. According to my computer, so I know that there's something else happening at 10. I've lost track of what it is, but I'll look it up. So I'll ask Nancy to be our timekeeper and let us know when it's if we should be. You'll have about four minutes, I think. All right. Susan, I want to talk about jewelry making and the spiral sometime. I don't know. So love to do that. So love to do that. Though I don't know, like my current techniques are mostly putting pre- Like my current techniques are mostly putting pre-existing beads on things, but I've been experimenting with cutting things out of felt. So, oh, fantastic! All right, well, thanks, everybody, and thanks, Sir Jan. I'm the one who gets to eat it, so I'm me and my family. Sorry, I can't, if we were actually together in person, you would be eating some Britzelschneck pieces, but yeah, all right. Well, thank you, Susan, for your session. I don't want to cut off. For your session, I don't want to cut off. I hope you've got other ways to connect with people. I think everything is posted in the site. Yes, and the slides are posted. I've lost, I should have put where they are, but yeah, the slides are posted somewhere in the site, and I can. The session's recorded as well. Yes, that's great. So thank you again. All right. Well, thanks, everybody. And I guess we'll stop the session now and I'll talk to you soon. Like to the conference, someone. Like to the conference, someone has just asked, I believe. Yeah. Oh, okay. Oh, okay, great. Thank you. All right. Thanks, everybody. I'll see you soon. Thanks for participating.
